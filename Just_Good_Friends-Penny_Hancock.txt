chapter one in camden town i know where we can go on holiday said stephany she was lying on the sitting room floor of her london flat there were newspapers and holiday magazines all over the floor all the hotels stephany liked were too expensive and she didnt want to spend her holiday in a cheap hotel with a lot of other english people max came out of the kitchen with a plate of sushi and a bottle of cold chardonnay wine he knew this was the kind of food and drink stephany enjoyed stephany looked up at the tall handsome man his good looks made her heart jump the first time she saw max she thought he was a cold unfriendly person she could not believe that a person could be so goodlooking and nice as well but now stephany knew that max was just shy not unfriendly he also thought about other people and tried help them when it was possible stephany thought he was perfect man he sat down beside stephany and touched her black hair show me he said nodding his head at the pictures of white beaches in the magazines no said stephany this place isnt in the magazines i dont know why i didnt think of it before where is it tell me said max he was pouring the wine into two tall glasses carlos flat said stephany with a big smile she took her wine and bit into the sushi sushi my favourite i love japanese food she said when did you get this i went into the supermarket on camden road on the way here said max i knew you would be pleased now tell me more whos carlo and where is his flat carlos a good friend i taught him english five years ago when he was in london he has a flat in a beautiful village on the ligurian sea in italy near genoa he said i can stay in it ive been there a couple of times its perfect youll love it slow down said max if it was five years ago do you think he still wants you to stay in his flat oh yes im sure carlos a very kind person he doesnt live in the flat now its empty most of the year he only uses it for weekends sometimes well max didnt know much about italians or italian men he didnt know if they really were good at being good friends with women it would be difficult for any man to be just friends with stephany she was very pretty he watched her now as she walked into the kitchen she was just as pretty as when he first met her one night at the jazz cafe in camden with some friends they had been going out for two months now max had had a lot of girlfriends but now he wanted to have a serious relationship it was easier said than done some women were too interested in their jobs other women just wanted to have a good time some were too serious others were not serious enough stephany however seemed just right she was intelligent and serious and she liked her job she was a language teacher and she worked hard but she also liked to enjoy herself she liked going to clubs and parties and doing sport she did a lot of swimming and was very strong max didnt really like sport in fact he didnt like taking exercise he was an architect and he enjoyed looking at buildings and paintings but max liked the fact that they were different and he liked her more because of it im so pleased i thought of carlo stephany said sitting down next to max again well have a great time i love you max it was the first time she had spoken so warmly although they had been going out for a couple of months now she had never said she loved him before max pulled her close to him i love you too he said they kissed then stephany began to describe the village where carlos flat was to max its beside the sea its on italys northwest coast near genoa the houses are built on the hills and are all different colours and the country is beautiful full of places where they grow fruit and vegetables its so pretty max and there are good restaurants with fresh fish or you can get fresh pasta or pizza its beginning to sound very nice said max we can walk and swim and waterski hey slow down said max i cant waterski well anyway we can eat good food max put his arm round stephany he thought she was lovely when she was like this ok telephone carlo he said but not until later and he began to kiss her again chapter two in genoa some things never go away you think they have gone you continue with your life you think ill never see that person again so there is no more need to worry you have children you go to work and come home you shop for food and cook good meals for your family you look after your husband well you buy him trousers and shirts and ties you make love with him whenever he wants it and say nothing when he doesnt you dont agree sometimes you think he might spend more time with the children you know he works hard and also know that the children can be hard work when he gets home you put the children to bed yourself although you have been working too you are tired too because you have also done the shopping and cooking this was what it was like for ruth ruth had met carlo in italy when she was working in a restaurant they had married and she had left her own country and moved to live with him in italy she had two children and they had lived in the fiat in the village by the sea for a while then ruth had wanted to move to a bigger house in the town the reason she wanted to move was to get away from carlos family carlos mother and father lived in the flat next door and his uncle and aunt and cousins lived opposite there was also a grandmother who lived above his parents everyone in the little village seemed to be part of carlos family ruth couldnt get away from them they seemed to watch her all the time they told her how to cook which fruit to buy where to dry the washing but she just wanted to be alone with carlo and she began to hate carlos family she had to get away carlo finally agreed he bought a house in genoa because he loved ruth so much and he wanted her to be happy they kept the flat by the sea for weekend visits and summer holidays one friday evening the telephone rang the children were in bed and carlo was working late pronto ruth answered in the italian way hello hello at first ruth thought that one of her friends from england was ringing her it didnt happen often she felt surprised and happy hi ruth its stephany stephany stephany for a few seconds ruth could not remember who stephany was stephany said ruth hi said stephany how are you were fine said ruth how many children have you got now asked stephany two more than enough yes i think youre wonderful wonderful why asked ruth oh bringing up children its hard work i know lots of my friends are doing it you havent got any children yourself if stephany had children ruth would feel safer with her she remembered the last time stephany came to visit carlo it wasnt a happy time me no sorry not yet said stephany there was a silence ruth didnt know what to say finally stephany said i actually wanted to know if the flat might be free in two weeks time oh no ruth thought what should she say if she said it wasnt free it would be a lie if carlo ever found out he would be angry she could say she needed to check with carlo but ruth didnt want stephany to think carlo made all of the decisions so she said in a friendly and helpful voice why yes i believe it is are you coming to italy would you like to stay in the flat well yes if that would be ok asked stephany of course it would be ok said ruth although it wasnt true it would be great you know carlo said you can stay in it whenever you want so it was decided ruth put the phone down with a heavy heart stephany was back in their lives chapter three a good friend in london stephany put the phone down well she seems to think its ok she called out across the flat max came out of the bathroom drying his black hair whos she carlos wife ruth oh said max he was pleased to hear that carlo was married great he said he sat down on the sofa ill get the plane tickets he held stephany in his arms i feel better for a shower now i can relax its been a long week but stephany couldnt relax she stood up something about ruths voice had made her feel strange im a little worried i dont know ruth very well maybe its not a good time for them said stephany oh lets not worry now said max its late and im tired lets go to bed ok said stephany but that night she didnt sleep very well the next evening while max was cooking supper for stephany in the kitchen the telephone rang hello stephany said hi stephany its carlo hello carlo max watched stephany she looked very happy how lovely to hear your voice she said ruth says you want to stay in the flat said carlo yes if possible of course you can are you coming alone no ive met someone hes called max hes very nice stephany looked up at max and smiled well then well see you in a couple of weeks how are you carlo stephany asked soso up and down we worry about money like everyone and my wife is angry with me because i work too much but if i dont work we dont get any money is ruth working too yes she says she never stops working she works in the day with the children and at night in a restautant but never mind you come and have a holiday it will be good to see you yes i hope we can all meet for dinner sure ill see you then bye carlo and thanks stephany turned to max i knew it would be ok if i spoke to carlo she said hes a very good friend hes really pleased that we are coming shouldnt we offer to pay for the flat max asked no said stephany carlo would be angry chapter four i dont trust stephany who were you talking to asked ruth coming into the sitting room now the children were asleep at last stephany said carlo why does stephany want our flat for her holiday why cant she find her own hotel or something ruth asked you know i promised stephany she could use the flat it was before i knew you i cant suddenly change my mind just because were married i just think giving someone my home is unnecessary but the flat isnt your home said carlo you didnt want to live in the flat remember you didnt like living in the village you wanted a bigger house this house is your home not the flat the flat is empty and it is much better if someone uses it you never asked me how i felt about it said ruth she knew she sounded a bit like a child but she couldnt help it i didnt know you when i made the promise carlo said i cant suddenly tell her she cant have it if i make a promise i like to keep it ruth knew this it was one of the things she loved about carlo he was very honest and if he said he would do something he always did it ruth was always surprised that carlo had married her she didnt think she was very pretty not like the italian girls he knew and she hated her red hair carlo promised her he didnt like women just because they looked good and dressed nicely one of the things i like about people from britain he said is they dont worry about fashion not like italian women carlo loved everything to do with britain the sense of humour the green fields the people even the food and the weather the only reason he stayed in italy was because he had a good job as a surveyor but stephany was from britain and she looked good as well ruth felt jealous of her she didnt say anything more to carlo about it she went to bed she heard carlo go out he had probably gone for a drink at the bar later on towards midnight she heard him come in again the bedroom door opened carlo came in and sat on the bed next to her listen he said taking ruths hand you mustnt worry about stephany shes just a good friend you are the only person i love ruth looked up she was crying and anyway stephany is coming with a new boyfriend ruth put her arms round carlo perhaps things would be all right if stephany had her own boyfriend now she smiled at carlo he was such a lovely man and she wanted to trust him she did trust him the trouble was she just could not trust stephany chapter five in a village by the sea stephany and max had ordered a taxi to take them across london and up the motorway to stansted airport i love this building said max he was talking about the airport building stephany didnt say anything it was something she didnt understand to her a building was a building however she enjoyed being inside the airport with its shops that sold holiday things everything from perfume to underwear and expensive clothes she liked to watch the people too lots of businesswomen on their way to milan to fashion shows and wealthy men on their way to expensive holiday places she hoped that one day she would fly about the world earning lots of money soon they were sitting on the plane stephanys stomach gave a jump as the plane took off and she had her usual moment of feeling afraid as it rose into the sky soon up above the clouds she began to relax the sun came into the plane max bought a bottle of champagne and they drank to our first holiday together then they were coming down and the colours below them had changed from the grey and green of england to the gold and brown of italy the light was soft stephany had forgotten this about italy she came out of the airport feeling happy from the champagne but also because she was back in her favourite country from genoa they took a train down the coast how do i ask for a sandwich asked max a man selling drinks had slopped beside them just ask for a panino said stephany she spoke good italian and for some reason she thought it was strange that max couldnt speak any they drank coffee and ate sandwiches as the train went in and out of tunnels and past views of beautiful houses green trees and a bright blue sea its the next stop i think said stephany they picked up their bags and got ready to get off the train a smell stephany knew welcomed them as they climbed down from the train a smell of the sea and of pizza they had to walk back a little way to reach the village itself the colours that met them when they arrived were bright pink and orange houses red flowers and blue and green boats great max shouted and stephany knew she had made the right choice for their holiday to get the key for the flat they had to knock on carlos parents door the flat max and stephany were staying in was next door carlos mother a small woman stood looking at stephany for a moment stephany she cried in italian you havent changed at all in fact i think you are even more beautiful than you were before stephany smiled and introduced max the old woman was quiet as she looked at max welcome she said after a minute and then she disappeared into the flat and returned with a key my husband has put a bottle of wine and some tomatoes and salad from his garden in the flat she said make yourselves at home thank you so much signora stephany said i hope you will eat dinner with us one evening the old woman continued oh signora that would be lovely said stephany max watched he didnt understand what they were saying but he thought stephany was agreeing to eat with the old couple he didnt like the idea very much he wanted to have stephany to himself this holiday stephany continued to talk to carlos mother as if she were the most important person in the world to her has carlo been here lately asked stephany he was here at the weekend and told me you were coming said the signora he asked ruth to prepare the flat for you and how is ruth asked stephany quietly soso she said it was clear from her face that she did not have much time for her daughterinlaw she is always busy i never see my grandchildren anymore oh dear said stephany im sure they love seeing you the old woman smiled at stephany stephany then thanked the signora and led max to the door of their flat she likes you max said giving stephany a kiss i expect she hoped carlo would marry you instead of ruth dont be silly max said stephany she likes me because i was carlos teacher look this is our bedroom it looks very nice said max who did all this work look they have even put flowers on the table it was ruth said stephany shes very kind said max she doesnt know us and we are staying in her flat for nothing carlos flat stephany said quickly yes but as theyre married its her flat as well its very kind of both of them im sure we should offer to pay for it i wouldnt worry about that said stephany as i said carlo and i have always had this agreement max felt a little uncomfortable about being given a beautiful holiday flat for nothing stephany opened the windows and they looked out at a view across roofs to the mediterranean wonderful said max and we have a balcony said stephany opening the doors onto a little balcony where she shut her eyes and look a deep breath of sea air oh the smells here are so good stephany said i already feel better lets unpack and go and get an ice cream from the gelateria and see if anyones swimming down on the beach good idea said max looking at stephany in the italian light she looked beautiful and he thought that he really was in love this time chapter six the two couples meet the next day stephany and max ate breakfast in the bar it was only a short walk from their flat they are cakes and drank coffee then they went to swim at the beach at the bottom of the village this certainly is an ideal place for our holiday said max i told you said stephany and if we had paid for a place like this it would have cost a lot of money max said but stephany was changing into her bikini and didnt answer lets swim she called to max before he knew it she had run into the water and was swimming out to sea the blue water was clear and deep however max chose to swim close to the beach he didnt feel safe in deep water he didnt know some local boys were diving off the rocks they looked very healthy as if they spent every day sitting in the sun diving and swimming max thought of his white english skin and felt shy stephany swam like a fish before long she too had climbed the high rocks come up here she called down to max max looked up at her she had a lovely healthy body ill just stay here he called up he thought he heard one of the boys laugh he watched as stephany dived smoothly into the water she swam up to him and took his hand youre frightened to dive she laughed come on i want to see you dive no said max im hungry lets go and get some lunch i noticed one of those bars did large plates of pasta thats the trattoria the restaurant said stephany yes thats a good idea im really hungry after all this swimming soon they were dressed and sitting in the trattoria people were ordering big meals even though it was only one oclock people eat a lot at lunchtime here max said weve forgotten how to eat well in england said stephany italians love their food just think at home we would just be eating a sandwich but here its spaghetti alle vongole and wine and steak said max smiling this is a great place he continued sun clean sea good restaurants you were very clever to think of it im looking forward to meeting carlo and ruth so i can thank them properly but max was also a little worried that carlo might look like one of the boys on the beach a handsome italian with brown skin and strong muscles they returned to the flat much later after their big lunch and a good coffee there was a message from carlos mother saying carlo had telephoned he wanted all of them to go out for a pizza together hell come to your flat at seven oclock the old woman told stephany hmm said max coming up behind stephany and putting his arms round her itll be good to meet your italian friends at last yes said stephany but her face which he saw in the mirror looked worried whats the matter max asked arent you looking forward to seeing them of course i am said stephany at least im looking forward to seeing carlo hes like my brother but im not so sure about ruth i dont know her very well are you frightened of her asked max frightened no said stephany quickly i just dont know her thats all and you know women with children can be very boring boring max said surprised surely some are boring and some arent just like people without children but stephany pushed away from his arms and went into the bathroom to have a shower i need to start getting ready if we are eating with them tonight she said from the bathroom and the door shut max went out onto the balcony and sat on a chair he felt the warm sun on his face and heard the soft sounds of the village around him he closed his eyes he was woken from a deep sleep by the sound of someone knocking on the door of the flat he looked up wondering where stephany was he couldnt see her so he went and opened the door a medium height welldressed italian man with a friendly face and glasses stood at the door he wore a clean white shirt and trousers and had a pullover around his shoulders with him was a small redhaired woman with a white face and a baby in her arms holding onto her legs was a small child ciao said the man im carlo this is my wife ruth and you must be max max smiled and shook carlos hand well thought max i dont have to worry that carlo is betterlooking than me i think im more handsome than he is carlo looked nice but he was nothing like the boys on the beach he looked like a simple family man he probably ate too much pasta and didnt exercise much as the family came into the flat the bathroom door opened and stephany came out looking more attractive than max had ever seen her she wore a short black dress which made her look very slim and high black shoes her skin was brown from their morning in the sea and sun and her hair shone like glass and with the makeup she had put on her face she looked beautiful max watched her as she walked across the room and took carlos hand kissing him on each cheek max wondered how ruth felt just then the baby in ruths arms began to cry she went to the bedroom to feed it shall we go to the bar said stephany looking from one man to the other enjoying the fact they were both looking at her wait a minute said max ruth is feeding the baby remember oh she can find us there later said stephany she could be a long time feeding why dont we have a drink here while we wait said max he didnt know much about having children but he thought it must be hard to be left out of things just because you had a baby ok carlo said i hope you like it here while you are in my flat it is your home yes said max its very kind of you thank you very much carlo looked at stephany as he said i always said stephany can stay in my flat whenever she likes and of course since you are her friend you are also welcome stephany smiled at catlo soon after ruth came out of the bedroom she looked white and tired next to stephany and there were lines on her clothes a cotton skirt and a yellow tshirt from sitting on the bed would you like a drink max asked her and she smiled come on said carlo lets go we can have a drink in the bar and he led them all to the door chapter seven a difficult dinner could you please watch thomas ruth asked carlo as they sat down at a table in a bar the little boy had run off and was throwing salt on the ground relax carlo said to ruth max could see that ruth was getting angry she got up with the baby in her arms and went and took the small boys hand and pulled him back to their table he needs someone to watch him she said looking angrily at carlo but carlo was talking to stephany max watched carlo and stephany they were laughing together happily stephany turned to max last time i was here carlo taught me to waterski she said her eyes were happy max began to feel a tiny bit angry stephany knew he couldnt waterski was she trying to make him jealous or perhaps she was trying to make ruth jealous she seemed to be doing a good job carlo ruth was shouting at him the little boy had run out of the door of the restaurant and down the street carlo said you know my mother offered to take care of him i want thomas to eat with us said ruth relax and let him play then carlo said just then the baby started crying ruth got up i think ill go home if you dont mind she said i cant look alter thomas and the baby in a restaurant without any help her face was red she looked as if she was about to cry noone moved as she got up holding the baby in one arm the small boys hand in the other max began to feel very angry why didnt carlo help ruth he was also angry with stephany she should understand how ruth felt dont go max said to ruth ill take thomas for a walk until his food arrives well go and see the boats shall we thomas the little boy looked at him for a few seconds then held out his hand thank you max said ruth she smiled at max she had relaxed you have your drink max said and ill be back in a minute he walked down the narrow street with the little boys small hand in his they got to the beach where some people were putting a boat into the water the little boy stood and watched though he must have seen all this hundreds of times before he seemed very interested do you like boats max asked he didnt really know what to say to children si thomas replied then he said something else in italian how wonderful max thought that a young child can understand english but reply in italian and i cant understand a word he says apart from si the little boy said something in italian again max smiled at him the little boy looked at max trying to understand why he didnt reply to him then he smiled it seemed he understood suddenly that max only spoke english lets see the fish he said in english and max smiling said yes lets they walked beside the water some men in a small fishing boat were taking some fish off the boat the fish were silver in the evening light and a small crowd stood round the boat max and thomas were enjoying themselves so much they almost forgot the time they went back to the restaurant max felt pleased that the little boy had trusted him he hoped stephany had seen what he did if he couldnt waterski at least he could show her what a good father he would be hes a sweet kid max said to carlo when hes not being bad carlo said and gave the boy a kiss max sat down the baby was asleep ruth was drinking some beer things were going to be all right after all they talked about everyday ordinary things what do you do max asked carlo im an architect said max thats interesting i work with quite a few architects carlo said im a surveyor stephany tried to talk to ruth but ruth didnt say much to stephany thomas was playing a game with luigi the waiter the waiter was making paper hats and putting them on thomass head luigi was laughing he seemed to enjoy playing with children it must be hard work with two children stephany said it is said ruth in some ways i find it harder living here in italy but the italians love children said stephany i mean look the waiter is very kind to thomas in england people dont like seeing children in restaurants she didnt add that she understood why i know theyre wonderful with him said ruth but if your own family isnt here its hard there are not so many places for mothers and children to meet each other youve got carlos family said stephany theyre lovely people i love his mother we get on very well hmm said ruth its a bit different living here id love to live here said stephany its so beautiful with the sea and the sun and the lovely people youre very lucky ruth looked at her she has no idea what its really like she thought how can she call me lucky when she has a good job a handsome boyfriend and shes free and she is so goodlooking carlo was probably in love with her perhaps he still is but she said none of this ive an idea carlo said suddenly luigi the waiter was picking up their plates as they were getting up to leave we could all go to the festival tomorrow night up in the mountains its a special day in a village therell be a party with food and wine and dancing itll be fun wont it ruth we went last year and had a very good time yes said ruth oh it sounds great doesnt it stephany said to max but max was silent he didnt know if he was going to spend any evenings of this holiday alone with stephany chapter eight a long way from the truth max woke in the night feeling sick in the morning he felt so sick he couldnt get out of bed wouldnt you feel better if you got up and came for a swim stephany asked she felt a little angry that max was sick it was so english to be sick in a foreign country no i wouldnt said max who just wanted to sleep well im going to have breakfast in the bar then i may go and swim said stephany youre not a very good nurse max said weakly thats because im not a nurse said stephany this was not what she had come on holiday for she wanted to have some fun but on this holiday she had only discovered maxs weaknesses he couldnt speak any italian he couldnt waterski or dive or do any of the things the local italian men enjoyed doing now he was sick and she had to spend the day alone she left max in the dark room and went along to the bar the waiter brought her a cappuccino arent you carlos friend the waiter asked giving her the coffee stephany looked at him she remembered him from last night then she thought she had met him the last time she had been here yes i am she said sorry but i dont remember your name im luigi said the waiter carlos one of my oldest friends we all went out together one night about two years ago remember stephany felt her face go red that night two years ago she remembered clearly but she didnt think anyone else would carlo liked you very much said luigi we thought he would leave his wife and marry you stephany looked at luigi she didnt know if he was being friendly or not what did he know and what did he really think and his mother liked you too he said he smiled and put his hand into his pocket to find change for the money she had given him for the coffee and now youve got a free holiday flat people pay a lot of money to stay here for just one week he said what was he saying stephany felt herself go hot was he saying she had made love with carlo so that he would let her stay in the flat for nothing it wasnt true she had just had a very short affair with carlo last time she was here he had already offered her the use of his flat a long time before they ever had that little affair she had hoped noone knew and that it would be forgotten by everyone except carlo discovering that luigi knew made her feel very uncomfortable she left the bar and walked along the beach deep in thought she found a quiet place and went and sat in the sun after a while she dived into the water and swam but she couldnt relax she felt bad because some of the things that luigi had said were half true she thought about the things that had happened two years ago she remembered seeing how happy carlo and ruth were together and feeling afraid that she was going to lose carlo as a friend surely she had thought she was more interesting to him than ruth although she had never found carlo attractive before she suddenly wanted him now he was married she remembered how she had gone out one evening with some of carlos friends including luigi they had gone to a beach called bianca beach ruth had stayed at home she remembered how they had dived off the rocks and swam in the night water she remembered the moment she and carlo had found themselves alone or so they thought she remembered how they had kissed with the dark water around them afterwards carlo had said they must never let it happen again because he loved ruth he would always be stephanys friend he said but he didnt want to lose ruth well continue as if nothing happened said carlo and stephany pleased that he found her attractive agreed its simple she had told herself but that was a long way from the truth chapter nine on bianca beach max was still ill that evening when carlo came to take them to the festival ruth wasnt with him thomas isnt feeling well either he told stephany so ruth said she would stay and look after him so its just you and me said stephany perhaps wed better forget it said carlo stephany had been looking forward to this evening with max ill she had had a boring day on her own the things luigi the waiter had said to her had made her think this would be a good opportunity to talk to carlo alone although she wasnt sure how she was going to begin to talk about the subject it would be difficult to say luigi thinks i made love with you so i could have your flat but its not true she wasnt sure what she was going to say come on she said why dont we go just you and me i need to get out max has been ill all day carlo looked at her he found her very attractive but he wished he didnt he worried about being alone with her his mother always said he should have married stephany not ruth but stephany had never been interested in him until that time two years ago and by then he was married to ruthi and he loved ruth a lot he and stephany had been friends until that time two years ago so they could be friends again now well yes we could go said carlo he wasnt too sure good said stephany max was still asleep when they left they drove up a road through the mountains there were trees on either side and when they came to corners they could see views of the deep blue sea far below i was thinking said stephany instead of the festival could we go to that lovely beach which one carlo asked the one with the white sand and the pine trees i think its called bianca beach its where we went last time i was here carlo didnt answer immediately he was remembering they drove in silence for a few minutes before he looked at her ok he said are you all right stephany asked him youre very quiet i was just thinking how things change he said now i am a married man with children i dont often find myself alone with a woman im not going to bite you laughed stephany but some were deep inside him carlo felt that was exactly what she was going to do soon they arrived at the beach she had talked about carlo stopped the car and got out he came round and opened her door for her she got out too with the waves the white sand and the wind in the trees the beach looked beautiful stephany he said that night two years ago was mistake you know stephany looked at him so he has been thinking about it too she thought i know she said we can still be friends cant we she said im not sure carlo said the trouble is ruth doesnt feel very happy about you using the flat stephany looked at carlo she realised how much he loved ruth but she couldnt help feeling a bit jealous surely she was more attractive to him than ruth but you feel happy about it dont you she asked softly until you married ruth you wanted me to come here often things are different now he said then was silent it was impossible to tell stephany she couldnt come any more it would be wrong of him he hated breaking promises stephany put her hand up to carlos cheek and touched it before he knew it she was touching his neck against his wishes he was finding himself attached to stephany again this had been such a hard time for him with ruth tired all the time with the children suddenly finding himself alone with stephany like this he couldnt slop himself stephany felt carlo moving as she touched him she thought of max sick in bed and ruth at home with two children she thought of luigi in the bar but suddenly none of this seemed to matter she was kissing carlo wildly and they pulled off each others clothes they fell onto the sand which was still warm from the sun and lay together as the moon came up as they drove back to the village much later carlo breathed deeply no one must ever know about this he said noone will its just one of those things that happened isnt it only you and i know carlo felt terrible he didnt want to hide anything from ruth but if he wanted to keep ruth he thought he would have to hide it from her chapter ten in love with two people the next morning max got up before stephany she awoke to hear him moving across the room i feel much better he said looking at her ive already been for a walk and bought us some things for breakfast ill make some more coffee she lay and smelt the coffee and tell the warm sun on her face as it came through the window if yesterday hadnt happened this could almost be the holiday she had wanted but yesterday had happened she didnt know what to think carlo loved ruth he had told her that and he would never leave her or the children but he had always liked stephany too she looked up at max as he gave her a cup of coffee he looked extremely handsome this morning and now he was better he seemed stronger he was more like the max she first knew and liked perhaps it was perfectly normal to be in love with two people at once heres a coffee for you he said kissing her on the cheek how was last night did you have a good time it was ok said suphany she had decided she would not tell max that ruth wasnt there unless he asked it was best to keep things simple did i miss anything max asked no said stephany putting her arms around him nothing but i missed you max smiled he really felt he was going to enjoy the rest of the holiday how about taking the train to town theres a market on today said max who had been talking to some tourists in the bar that morning i could buy some fresh food and cook us a good meal this evening there are also some interesting churches id like to look at stephany who had been planning a day swimming and lying on the beach did not want to go to town why dont you go alone she said itd be good for your italian i feel like lying in the sun with my book lets meet later on the beach oh ok said max i hope ill be able to understand without you there to help me of course you will said stephany take the dictionary and use your hands a lot so stephany went to the beach and max went to town on the train he was pleased that he knew the italian word for ticket biglietto but at the vegetable stall at the market he forgot the word for courgettes he tried to find some courgettes to point to but there werent any then he tried to describe them but the man selling the vegetables couldnt understand him some people waiting became more and more angry they are called zucchini said a voice behind him max turned round to find ruth standing there thomas was holding her hand and the baby was in a pram oh thank goodness you were there just then said max then he told ruth the vegetables he wanted and ruth asked for them in perfect italian how was last night max asked her as they left the vegetable stall last night ruth didnt understand the festival you and carlo and stephany went to while i was in bed ruth looked at max didnt he know she hadnt gone she thought quickly if stephany hadnt told max then site was trying to hide something ruth felt herself go red with anger but she decided it was best not to tell max now she wanted to talk to carlo first it was fun said ruth ask stephany about it i expect she would like to tell you max looked at ruth but she was now busy with thomas i decided ruth didnt want to talk about last night id like to buy some cheese would you help me he asked sure said ruth follow me i know the best cheese stall here max followed her to a stall with a lot of beautiful cheeses we never get cheeses as big as this in england said max at the supermarkets everything is cut into tiny pieces and comes in plastic oh yes said ruth its one of the things i love about italy food is real food here they bought some dolce latte and some pecorino and now for fruit said max ruth helped him choose some peaches and grapes and then they walked around together for a while look at that church said max i must look inside would you like to yes said ruth there are some pictures in there you might be interested in they went inside the church together but it was a bit difficult to look at the pictures carefully with thomas and the baby its nice to look at architecture and art with someone else said max stephany isnt interested we are very different she likes sports while i like art but i like the fact that were different how about you and carlo ruth was quiet she didnt want to talk about herself and carlo right now she was thinking about stephany and didnt want to tell max what she was thinking she couldnt be sure that her thoughts about stephany and carlo were right if she said anything to max he would think she was jealous of stephany after all stephany was far more attractive than she was would you like to go for a coffee asked max feeling sorry for ruth again she looked so tired thatd be lovely she said then turned to thomas and said would you like an ice cream si si he shouted running round them in circles they found a cafe in the sun and sat outside max enjoyed playing with the little boy he likes you laughed ruth as max made thomas laugh have you and stephany thought of having children yourselves we havent been together very long he said we havent talked about it but i dont think stephany is very interested in having children yet she enjoys her work and she likes being free so much how about you ruth asked well i do like children ive enjoyed playing with thomas but its a big decision im not sure im ready for it either i understand said ruth weve found it harder than we thought it would be we dont get any time alone now how did you and carlo meet were you already in italy asked max yes i was working in a restaurant here carlo was one of my regular customers he loves everything english you know hes an anglophile he was one of the few people i met who could speak english stephany taught him they never went out together max asked no said ruth she stopped for a moment stephany says they were just good friends said max they were said ruth when i met carlo he told me all about how stephany had taught him english and helped him in london in return he said she could use the flat whenever she wanted to hes very kind max nodded its very kind of him after all he could make a lot of money from tourists out of it carlo isnt like that said ruth smiling as she spoke of him he doesnt do things to make money he does things if they feel the right thing to do thats what i love about him max looked at her as she smiled she really loves carlo he thought so stephany and carlo were never boyfriend and girlfriend max asked again he thought if anyone knew ruth would no said ruth she kept her eyes down she was speaking the truth but she thought that perhaps it wasnt so simple she couldnt tell max that she didnt trust stephany thanks for the coffee max i must go now i need to get home ruth called thomas moved the baby to her pram and took thomass hand she turned and waved as she went to get her bus and max noticed a sad look on her face poor woman he thought she seems very tired all the time she is not very happy living here even though it is so beautiful now he had heard from ruth that carlo and stephany were just good friends and always had been he felt much happier he would really enjoy the rest of the holiday and he would start right now on the train back he thought of the nice meal he would cook tonight with a bottle of good wine and of being alone with his new woman at last chapter eleven the perfect holiday max went back to the flat after his trip to town and prepared some food for the evenings meal he wanted to make everything just right for stephany now he felt they had hardly seen each other alone since they left england and after all that was why they had come on holiday he put some wine in the fridge got his swimming things and went down through the quiet street the smell of good food came from the houses on either side of the narrow street and max smiled this place was so wonderful every colour was brighter than in england every sound clearer every smell more delicious he suddenly felt full of good feelings for everything and everyone carlo and ruth were so kind he thought they were good people and he was pleased to have two new friends but right now he wanted to be alone with stephany max found stephany asleep she was lying on her front in a sunny corner of the beach the clear water was only a few metres away as it was early afternoon there was noone else about most people had gone to cooler places or to restaurants to eat large lunches before sleeping all afternoon seeing stephany lying so sweetly in the sun he thought how much he loved her he had never felt like this before he went quietly across the sand and sat down beside her she didnt move he touched her back her skin felt hot and he thought she might be getting sunburn quietly he put a towel across her back and then lay down beside her he put his arm across her shoulder and kissed her cheek her eyes opened she looked at him for a few seconds then smiled hello darling she said hello beautiful said max she turned onto her side and put her head on his chest this was a great holiday he thought a beautiful village the sea sun a beautiful woman and a good meal for them tonight later in the afternoon they went swimming in the clear water they swam out a little way and looked back at the pretty village from the sea this is the perfect place for a holiday said max you were so clever to think of it i know said stephany and smiled now she had had a good rest she felt better she was beginning to forget about last night noone need ever know what had happened and she wanted to enjoy being with max lets come here for all our holidays said max as they swam back towards the beach well get to know all the local people and everyone will welcome us each year stephany laughed youre too romantic she said i know but after all carlo has offered you the flat whenever you want it so lets use it mmmm said stephany and she suddenly went under the water and pulled maxs feet you cant catch me she shouted when she came up and then began swimming away from him she was right she was a much faster swimmer than max was and she reached the beach first well what do you think he asked when he finally reached the beach and sat down beside her picking up her hand about what about having more holidays together i think we should enjoy this one said stephany max became worried that he was asking too much perhaps stephany was not ready to get serious by the way said max i met ruth in town stephany looked up quickly had ruth told him she hadnt gone to the festival but max went on poor thing she always looks so tired your late night last night at the festival didnt help stephany was pleased that ruth hadnt told him that she wasnt there but she also felt worried what did ruth know come on she said wanting to talk about something else lets get dressed the air was cooler by the time they got dressed and walked up to the hill path lets go for a drink in the bar said max stephany stopped for a moment she didnt warn to see luigi in the bar she was afraid of what he might say to her in front of max how about walking over to the next village and finding a bar there good idea said max theres a little church there id like to have a look at i heard about it from ruth this morning it was a beautiful walk with wonderful views of the blue sea below them and they could see tiny white sailing boats they climbed up some steps to the next village and found themselves in a very pretty square on one side was a little church which max went to look at stephany found a table outside a bar and sat and watched the people come and go she liked to look at the clothes the italian women wore they dressed very well as she watched she thought about luigi he seemed to want to make trouble for her yesterday and stephany didnt want any more trouble this holiday she was pleased they had come to a different bar max soon came out of the church and sat down next to her its great he said this tiny unknown church is full of beautiful paintings they would be in a museum in england but here the paintings are allowed to stay where they were painted stephany reached over and took his hand she thought he was very clever they drank their drinks whats the time max asked i need to start cooking or there wont be any dinner this evening stephany then realised her watch wasnt on her wrist thats strange she said i hope i didnt lose my watch when i was swimming this afternoon oh no said max wed better look for it on the way home they walked back looking out for stephanys watch but they couldnt find it never mind said stephany it might be in the flat i dont remember putting it on today max put his arm round her im making you a wonderful meal this evening he said then i think we should go to bed early well worry about your watch tomorrow mmmmmm said stephany and that is exactly what they did chapter twelve a bad argument life was not too easy for ruth at the moment she had to continue working at the restaurant to help pay some of the bills she spent the day cooking food for the children taking care of the baby and reading thomas stories it was tiring and sometimes boring as well she wished she had more friends with children nearby she wished she got on better with carlos parents she wished carlo could get a job in england and she could go and live near her own family but this was not possible at the moment at five oclock that day she gave thomas his tea and then gave him a bath she was changing her clothes to go to work when carlo came home ruth did not want an argument but she wanted to ask about last night max didnt know that you and stephany went to the festival alone she said why didnt she tell him carlo looked at her ive no idea he said how do you know she didnt tell him i met max in town today and he thought i was there last night she replied perhaps they hadnt had a chance to talk ruth looked hard at carlo carlo i want you to tell me the truth is stephany trying to hide something ruth wanted to stay calm she didnt want to get jealous and angry she wanted to believe carlo after all he had told her max was ill last night if he had had something to hide he wouldnt have told her he had other women friends she knew carlo was not the kind of man to go with other women unless he was pushed and stephany ruth couldnt help thinking was the kind of woman who might push him lets not start all this again carlo said he was afraid ruth knew in her heart what had happened last night he didnt want her to find out but i dont understand ruth went on why didnt stephany tell max she spent the evening with you at the festival how should i know asked carlo quite angry now ask stephany if its a problem for you ask stephany ruth shouted i dont want to ask stephany i hope i never have to speak to that woman again you are just jealous of her carlo shouted really angry now youve always been jealous of her yes i have because you were in love with her said ruth carlos voice went quiet ive got too many other problems at the moment to talk about this i just hate it when you get jealous before she knew it ruth had picked up a cup and thrown it hard at carlo he moved his head and the cup flew past his ear watch out he shouted as ruth left the house angrily when she had gone carlo sat in his chair for a long time looking at the carpet he wished stephany had never come back to italy and that he had not spent yesterday evening with her why had he done it he was now really afraid ruth would leave him it was much later when ruth returned from her nights work at the restaurant im sorry ruth said shed had a chance to think and she realised she was being stupid carlo and stephany had always been good friends she had to trust him carlo smiled and put his arms round her im sorry too he said i just feel tired at the moment but if it would help he said i wont let stephany use the flat again it seems to make you so unhappy and i want you to be happy it makes me sound so bad she said but i just dont like stephany or believe her i cant explain why carlo put his face in ruths hair he felt he was going to cry he wanted to tell her everything but if he told her she might leave him and that was something he didnt want to think about ruth felt good with carlos strong arms round her and she went to bed that night feeling better but she would be happy only when stephany had gone back to england there was something about that woman that made ruth very unhappy chapter thirteen an unwanted invitation for stephany and max the next two days were wonderful they swam ate good food and went for walks max visited more buildings and churches stephany was not interested in these so he often went on his own while she sat at cafes with her book one day they went shopping in genoa stephany bought some shoes and a new red dress max bought a new jacket italy is a wonderful country said max good food beautiful architecture and great clothes as well he was enjoying this holiday more than he could have thought on their last afternoon max said this flat almost feels like home i feel as though weve always lived here he didnt tell stephany directly that he was enjoying living with her but he had begun to think they should move in together when they went back to england he was waiting for the right moment to talk about it stephany had begun to think the same thing the more she got to know max the more intelligent and more handsome she thought he was he might not be the greatest swimmer and he had never been on waterskis but he knew so much about architecture and art the days of their holiday passed quickly they hadnt seen carlo or ruth again and stephany began to relax noone would ever know about her evening with carlo she thought in fact she rather liked to remember the evening and she thought of times in the future when she and carlo would meet and make love it was good to think she had a serious relationship with max a parttime lover in carlo and a beautiful flat to stay in in italy max had never asked anything about the evening of the festival and carlo had not phoned since then she thought that carlo understood it was best not to see each other at the moment on their last day in the village max decided he would take stephany out that evening to an expensive restaurant he had seen near the beach it would be the perfect place to ask her to move in with him when they got back to england max felt sure that a beautiful sunset a sea view and good food and wine would mean she couldnt say no but early that evening there was a knock on the flat door it was carlos mother inviting them for a meal i saw you earlier eating in the bar and i decided it was time you had a real italian homecooked meal she said stephany thought for a moment but she couldnt say no the old woman would be hurt thank you said stephany that would be lovely when the old woman had gone max looked at stephany what did she want he asked although he thought he knew already shes invited us for dinner this evening said stephany not looking at max and you accepted well i had to said stephany it wouldnt be nice to say no she thinks we havent been eating good food in the bars and restaurants how does she know asked max feeling angry shes seen us said stephany but i wanted to take you for a meal at a really good restaurant said max feeling very angry we cant say no said stephany shes carlos mother and were staying in his flat shed be very hurt if we didnt want to go max knew stephany was right the trouble with being given something free like a flat to stay in was it meant you had to do things you didnt want to do sometimes you never really got anything free in this world he knew that there was always something to pay and a meal with an old couple was a small price well shes a very good cook said stephany oh well said max well just have to try and enjoy it they got ready for the evening stephany put on the red dress she had bought in town that week you look beautiful said max you dont look too bad yourself said stephany max was brown from the sun and it went well with his dark hair he had put on his new jacket which made him look very handsome stephany felt very pleased to her surprise when they went to the old couples flat at seven oclock it was carlo who opened the door oh said stephany her heart sounding so loud that she was afraid someone else might hear it we didnt know you would be here its my mothers house said carlo naturally she asked us to come too hi max said happy that ruth was there he had thought everyone would be speaking in italian all evening and he wouldnt understand a word of it come in said carlo ruth and the children were playing in the sitting room ruth was wearing jeans and a tshirt she looked very pretty tonight max thought carlo stayed close to ruth all evening he put his arm round her and kissed her and ruth looked at him with her eyes full of love it was as if carlo was trying to show stephany how well he and ruth got on he didnt talk much to stephany stephany tried not to think about it but she couldnt help feeling bad she knew she was looking attractive this evening and she wanted carlo to say something max had said her dress made her look like a film star here thomas carlos mother was saying to the little boy have some chocolate but he hasnt had his dinner yet said ruth she had gone red with anger carlos mother looked a little sad ok ruth said look thomas norma wants to give you some chocolate but stephany could see ruth didnt like thomas having chocolate before dinner how silly she thought just a little chocolate poor old woman she just wants to be kind to her grandson what a lucky boy stephany said and carlos mother smiled at her ruth looked at stephany angrily but stephany didnt notice lets eat said carlos mother and they sat down at the table youre a good swimmer carlos father said to stephany as they sat round the table eating fresh pasta stephany looked at him surprised she didnt know he had seen her swimming and you are very good at diving laughed carlos father youre like one of the italian boys doesnt max like diving asked carlos mother goodness thought stephany they have seen everything we have done since we arrived here they know how we spend our days and where we eat what else do they know she suddenly thought chapter fourteen back in the bar after the meal carlo asked if they wanted to go for a coffee at the bar he wanted to get out of the flat ruth and his mother never got on but it was worse with stephany there he thought his mother seemed to like stephany more and more and that he knew was difficult for ruth to watch thank you so much for a lovely meal stephany said kissing carlos mother on each cheek its nothing my beautiful said the signora but stephany noticed she didnt say goodbye to ruth the two couples went down the narrow street to the bar thomas running ahead carlo carried the baby in his arms carlo and ruth looked like the perfect couple tonight seeing carlo for the first time since their evening together stephany found she still wanted him but he was not looking at her at all they sat round a table in the bar and luigi took their orders luigi was a different character tonight he was friendly and funny with carlo he liked ruth and he played with thomas finally carlo said well we must be going he had his arm round ruth we probably wont see you two again he said youre leaving tomorrow arent you so its goodbye thats strange thought stephany it sounds as if hes saying goodbye for the last time what does he mean by we wont see you again carlo held out his hand and shook maxs hand its been good meeting you he said and you said max and i cant thank you enough for the flat of course i should thank stephany too for being your friend in the first place stephany looked away i hope well meet again one day said max perhaps you could all come and stay with us in england there was a difficult silence one day maybe said carlo then they all kissed each other goodbye and ruth and carlo disappeared up the street lets have one more drink max said to stephany i feel like staying out late tonight weve hardly had any time alone together this holiday ok said stephany she was no longer worried about luigi after all he had been so friendly this evening stephany ordered a hot chocolate and max ordered a glass of brandy they sat at one of the tables outside a light wind blew things about the street and once it blew over the empty bottles on their table the weathers changing said max a lot of people had gone inside the bar away from the light rain which had begun to fall they could hear waves crashing onto the rocks below i was thinking max said looking at stephany across the table and taking her hand its been such a lovely week here weve got on so well better in some ways than in london how would you feel about moving in together when we get back stephany looked at max she was still thinking about carlos final words so suddenly she felt happy she had max alter all he was far more handsome than carlo oh max she said kissing him ive been thinking the same thing just then luigi came over to take their empty glasses he stopped his hands full then spoke in english i expected to see you at the festival the other night where were you max laughed i was ill in bed he said but stephany was there with carlo and ruth no said luigi looking at stephany now they were not there i looked out all evening for carlo and he wasnt there and when i asked ruth she said she stayed at home with thomas max looked at stephany where were you he asked i never asked what you did that evening oh said stephany carlo and i decided not to go to the festival we decided it wouldnt be fun without you and ruth by the way luigi said i found this on bianca beach and he gave something to stephany it was her watch i found it on wednesday morning said luigi well goodbye and he went off looking very pleased with himself bianca beach max asked suddenly feeling rather uncomfortable have we been to bianca beach he knew they hadnt and wasnt sure why he was asking i dont like that waiter stephany said angrily hes got a bad look about him come on ive finished my drink lets go wait said max if you and carlo werent at the festival and ruth wasnt with you then you must have been at bianca beach why didnt you tell me stephany began to feel a little frightened she looked up at max trying to think of something to say i hope its not what im thinking said max suddenly feeling very jealous you didnt you and carlo i dont believe this hey max said stephany she was frightened now max was not going to forget this if he found out the whole truth dont start getting jealous but this time max knew he wasnt being jealous for nothing how could you shouted max carlos got a wife and children why dont you say how could he said stephany back to him suddenly very angry it takes two you know because i dont care what he does i care what you do max shouted shhhf said stephany everyones looking at us lets go we can talk somewhere else as they got up to leave stephany realised for the first time why ruth hated living in a small village it was as if everyone knew everything about her and were never going to let her forget it they walked towards the beach without talking the waves were really big now and they could hear thunder in the distance then stephany said max you must understand it means nothing to me now were talking about two days ago said max how can you do something one day and then say it means nothing two days later stephany couldnt answer were you always lovers asked max remembering now his thought that it would be difficult for any man to be just good friends with stephany only once said stephany i was telling you the truth when i said we were just friends when he offered me his flat the first time so when were you lovers before asked max two years ago the first time i met ruth there was an evening you mean you waited until carlo was married to ruth before deciding to sleep with him max was beginning to understand and he didnt like what he was learning about stephany i was afraid i was going to lose him said stephany but but you had already lost him said max he was married to ruth oh you are so stupid shouted stephany the trouble with men she said is there is always one rule for them and a different one for women these things happen you know then she turned and ran off into the night chapter fifteen lovers or friends it was saturday evening but stephany had nowhere to go she sat on the sofa looking at the telephone max had not spoken to her on the flight home and at stansted airport he had kissed her goodbye and gone to get a train a week had passed and he had not telephoned her how could a holiday end so badly she wondered it had all been going so well with max before the holiday she thought about their last evening in italy it seemed a million years ago now max had asked her to live with him and now he wasnt speaking to her she wanted to cry she had had a bad week she couldnt help thinking about carlo if she had never kissed him that evening they would still be friends now she felt she had noone no friend and no lover she picked up the phone and although she thought max was probably not at home she called his number she waited finally he answered max she said before he could speak i love you please believe me max didnt say anything for a few seconds then said i cant well at least max can we still be friends just friends asked max yes said stephany just good friends to her surprise max started to laugh do you know what a good friend is he asked of course i do ive got lots of good friends said stephany including carlo max said carlo was a good friend but we destroyed it i understand that now i feel so lonely last week you were both my friends now ive got neither of you there was a silence was max feeling sorry for what had happened stephany he said ill tell you what a good friend is a good friend is someone who is honest with you ok max said stephany maybe im not good at being good friends but you know we were good lovers didnt you enjoy being with me yes i did said max sadly but its over stephany i cant have a relationship with a woman i cant trust you can trust me said stephany i promise i shall never let it happen again its too late said max im sorry stephany put the phone down she wanted to cry then suddenly she felt angry if it wasnt for her max wouldnt have had a holiday at all it wasnt fair that she should be left with nothing she went and looked in the mirror well perhaps not nothing she thought looking at herself in the mirror i still look pretty and ive still got other friends she picked up the phone again she called a friend a woman this time and asked her if she wanted to meet her in a club later that night she then put on her red dress made up her face and went out of her flat she didnt need carlo and max she thought tonight was saturday night she wasnt going to sit at home all evening feeling sorry for herself she was going out to have a good time the end
