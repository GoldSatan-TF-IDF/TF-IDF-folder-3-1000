jack higgins the iron tiger the place of silence beyond the mountains the sky was sapphire and blue a golden glow spreading across the ice caps as the sun slowly lifted below the valleys lay dark and quiet the only sound the tiny insignificant drone of the beavers engine as it followed the maze through to tibet jack drummond was tired and a slight dull ache behind his right eye nagged constantly too many late nights too much whisky and he was getting old too old to be dicing in the worst flying area in the world at sixteen thousand in a nonpressurised cabin he turned to cheung and grinnedtheres coffee in a black flask under your seat i could do with some his companion was chinese but it was obvious that he had european blood the eyes were startlingly blue in the bronzed healthy face and his mouth lifted slightly in a quirk of ironic good humour he wore a heavy sheepskin coat and aa astrakhan cap and shivered as he opened the vacuum flask and poured coffee into a plastic cup is it always as cold as this drcmmond nodded the wind comes all the way fiom mongolia there have been times when its stripped pieces off the fuselage cheung peered down into the jagged valley below what would happen if the engine stopped drummond laughed harshly youre joking of course cheung sighed it becomes clearer minutebyminute that you have been earning your money during the past six months and perhaps a little more the chinese smiled amiably my dear jack in formosa we subsist almost entirely on the goodwill of our american friends if it wasnt for their generosity we couldnt even afford such minor gestures as this tibetan venture drummond shrugged it doesnt worry me a couple more trips and im through ive done this run too often im on borrowed time cheung frowned but jack there is no one else what will we do theres always someone else drummond said youll find him in one bar or another in calcutta plenty of exraf types who cant settle down or the other kind whove lost their licences to fly commercially theyll go anywhere if the moneys right they moved on through a landscape so barren that it might have been the moon great snowcovered peaks towering on either side drummond handling the plane with the skill of genius once they dropped sickeningly in an air pocket and on another occasion flew along a canyon so narrow that the wingtips seemed to brash the rock face finally they lifted across a snowcovered ridge and plunged into space beneath them an enormous valley dropped tea thousand feet black with depth purple and gold great shimmering banks of cloud strung across it in broken strands perhaps seven or eight miles away on the other side was the last frozen barrier between balpur and tibet the sound of tjie engine suddenly seemed strangely muted and cheung sighed through the uncanny quiet the most beautiful sight fve ever seen the place of silence thats what they call it drummond told him used to take two days to get across on foot when caravans were still coming through the beaver seemed to glide on through the enormous blue vault drifting through the shadows and then they burst out into golden sunlight and the final barrier rose before them drummond eased back the stick and the beaver lifted the sound of the engine deepening into a fullthroated roar and a deep valley appeared between the peaks sangong pass he called above the roar of the engine they swept into the pass a brilliant red and gold leaf bright against the dark walls and the frozen earth rose to meet them drammond gave the beaver full power and pulled the stick right into the pit of his stomach cheung held his breath waiting for the crash as they rushed to meet the skyline wheels no more than ten feet above the boulderstrewn ground and then they were over the hump and flashing across a great cold glacier rolling steppes golden in the morning sun stretched to the horizon and drummond grinned now you know why i charge two thousand a trip cheung wiped sweat from his forehead with the back of a gloved hand and managed a weak smile im beginning to get the point how much further ten or twelve miles thats all better get ready the chinese reached behind his seat for a sub machine gun cocked it and held it across his knees as the beaver descended he could see a narrow river brawling across a mass of tumbled boulders widening into a shallow lake a hundred yards to the left sheltered against a rock escarpment was a ruined monastery a scattering of houses at its feet drummond pointed to a wide sand flat at the far end of the lake thats where we land if we get the signal and if not we get to hell out of here he circled coming in low across the lake and cheung pointed excitedly there are people down there standing in the shallows women doing the washing drummond said and swung in across the village turning away from the escarpmentandthefireblackenedruinsofthemonastery what happened there cheung demanded it was a headquarters for local resistance back in when the chinese reds first invaded tibet there was a siege for a couple of days but it didnt last long they brought up a couple of field guns and blew the necessary holes through the walls then what drummond shrugged they saved everything worth having then burnt the place to the ground and executed a couple of hundred monks to encourage the others drummond nodded and took the beaver round to the other side of the lake in a graceful curve not that its done them much good in areas like this they only control the towns he took the beaver down towards the village again and cheung touched his arm quickly is that the signal three flares spaced out ia a crude triangle started to burn furiously plumes of white smoke lifting into the cold air and drummond nodded he throttled back turned the beaver into the wind dropped it neatly down on the firm sandy shore of the lake and taxied along to the far end the women washing clothing in the shallows a few yards away moved up on the shore their long woollen shubas tucked into their belts and stood in a tight little group watching the plane cheung reached for the door handle and drummond shook his head not yet weve got to be sure at that moment a horseman galloped over the crest of the slope above them and plunged down towards the plane drummond switched off the engine and grinned in the sudden silence theres our man as he opened the door and jumped to the ground the rider reined in his small tibetan horse dismounted and strode towards them he was tall and muscular with a deeplytanned face and high mongolian cheekbones he wore a long widesleeved robe and sheepskin shuba which left his chest bare and kneelength boots of untanned hide his hair was coiled into plaits and he wore a sheepskin hat his english isnt much good drummond said to cheung as the tibetan approached well use chinese and for gods sake treat him with respect hes a nobleman they can be touchy about things like that the tibetan grinned and held out his hand and behind him another dozen men rode down to the shore it is good to see you again my friend you have more guns for us drummond nodded as he shook hands your men can unload them as soon as they like i dont want to hang around here for any longer than i have to the tibetan shouted an order and he and drummond and cheung moved out of the way moro this is mr cheung drummond said hes the balpur representative of the chinese national government the people whove been supplying the guns and ammunition ive been flying in to you during the past six months moro took cheungs hand warmly before the lord buddha brought the way of peace to this land the tibetans were warriors your guns have helped us prove to the communists that we can be warriors again you will take tea with me before you leave cheung turned to drummond have we time i dont see why not drummond offered the tibetan a cigarette any reds in the area recently one patrol moro said fifteen men they turned tip a week ago what happened the tibetan grinned youll see when we reach the village they went over the escarpment and walked towards the houses the tibetan with the bridle of his horse looped over one arm mr cheung has to make a special report to his government in formosa about the state of things here drummond said he thought hed like to see for himself how strong are the reds in this area cheung asked their nearest real strength is at a town called juhma about a hundred miles from here moro said half a regiment of infantry no more than four hundred men at larger villages like hurok which is thirty miles east across the plain they keep a cavalry troop between the villages they are as nothing there have been no large scale troop movements no road building in this area of the border at all not here but further east towards the aksai chin and the ladakh where they fought the indians in they have built many roads the tibetan looked surprised why would they need roads here they have claimed balpur cheung said simply moro laughed showing strong white teeth they have claimed the whole world is this not so they came to the outskirts of the village a small mean place singlestorey houses of mud and wattle strung along either side of the single street several children ran forward excitedly and followed them keeping a respectful distance from moro who occasionally flicked out with the plaited leather whip that hung from his left wrist as someone moved too close they came to a house near the centre of the village that seemed larger than the others and he opened the heavy wooden door and led the way in there were no windows and in the halfdarkness drummond was aware of the mud walls the sheepskins on the floor on a stone hearth in the centre a fire of yak dung burned brightly and an old tibetan voman was crumbling brick tea into a cauldron of boiling water she added butter and a pinch of salt and the men squatted on a sheepskin beside the fire they waited in silence for the tea as ritual demanded the old woman filled three metal cups and gave them one each moro took a sip nodded in approval and they drank it vas as always curiously refreshing and drummond held out his cup for more how are things going generally moro shrugged they will not be beaten here we cannot hope to accomplish so much but we can keep them occupied make life difficult what about arms cheung said you need more always more we cant right them with broadsword and musket you were going to tell us about the patrol drummond reminded him moro nodded and got to his feet i was forgetting if you have finished your tea i will show you now they moved into the street blinking in ths bright dear morning sunlight and the tibetan led the way through the crumbling houses the small tail of children jceeping pace with them the great wooden gates in the outer wall of ths monastery swung crazily from their hinges halfburnt away and blackened by fire they crossed the courtyard beyond still followed by the children and mounted the broad steps to the ruia of what had once been one of the most famous seats of learning in western tibet the doors had disappeared splintered into matchwood by high explosive shells and inside bright sunlight streamed down through holes in the roof there was a library here drummond told cheung it held more than fifteen thousand books and manuscripts most of them over a thousand years old the chinese burned the lot quite deliberately beyond hi the shadows something stirred and a kite rose lazily into the air great ragged black wings brushing the roof beams and drammond was aware of cheungs breath hissing between his teeth sharply disturbed by the birds passage something was swinging to and fro halfin halfout of the bright shafts of sunlight cutting down through the darkness drammoad moved a little doser it was a chinese soldier swinging by a rope from one of the charred beams tongue protruding obscenely from the black swollen face where the eyes had been were only empty ragged sockets and one ear had been torn off as his eyes became accustomed to the halflight he saw the others each hanging from a beam staring blindly into eternity we were away when they arrived moro said simply when we returned the fools were so busy ravishing the women they had not even thought to post a guard one of the children ran forward with a harsh laugh and grabbed the nearest corpse by the legs swinging it from side to side furiously and the other children followed suit running through the shadows dodging the swinging bodies helpless with laughter drummond turned and moved into the sunlight again his mouth dry i think we should be making a move mr cheung didnt speak his face was strangely pale and there was shock and pain in his eyes as they returned to the village moro whistled for his horse caught the bridle and led the way back to the lake what did you bring this time he asked drummond automatic rifles submachine guns and ten thousand rounds of ammunition the tibetan nodded good but we could do with some explosives next time drummond glanced at cheung enquiringly can you manage that the chinese nodded i think so would a fortnight today be too soon not for me drummond said two more trips and im finished the sooner i get them done the better ill like it a fortnight then moro said and they went over the escarpment and down to the shore beside the lake his men had unloaded the plane and already several packhorses were on their way to the village drurnmond gave him a final cigarette climbed in and strapped himself into his seat as the engine roared into life mr cheung turned and held out his hand we are united in the same struggle lie said and climbed into the plans as he closed the door and fastened ms seat belt the beaver turned into the wind and started to taxi along the shore sand whipped up by the propeller rattled against the windows a moment later the bluff at the far end of the lake was rushing to meet them and they were rising into the air drummond circled once and moro already back in the saddle waved turned his horse and galloped back towards the village drummond checked his instruments and started to gain altitude well what did you think words fail me i thought they would cheung lit a cigarette and sighed heavily to you it is nothing jack dangerous unpleasant yes but something you are mixed up in for one reason onlymoney and to you its a holy war drummond said i know only dont start trying to get me to join the crusade i had a bellyful of that kind of thing in korea enough to last a lifetime ah right qieung said wearilywhat about these explosives moro wants on the next trip if i have them delivered to the railhead at juma by next weekend can you pick them up tm flying down tomorrow with major hamid drommcndsaid hgs taking a weeks leave he thought he might enjoy it more if i went along why dont you join us cheung shook his head td like to but fve been getting behind with the paperwork and im supposed to be dining with the old khan on saturday night suit yourself drummond said another two thousand that brought the total standing to his credit in the bank of geneva to њ two more trips plus the money ferguson owed him and hed have a straight њ after that he was finished time he had a rest he leaned back in the seat humming to himself and concentrated on his instruments as he took the beaver slanting across the glacier and into the pass moro galloped alongside the packhorses whistling slashing their bony rumps with the heavy leather riding whip he urged ms mount forward and entered the village first clattering over the loose stones and dismounted outside his house the children had disappeared and the street was quite deserted as he stood there listening to the sound of the beaver in the distance drawing happily on the english cigarette drummond had given him doors opened in the houses along the street and one by one soldiers emerged in peaked caps and drab quilted jackets as moro turned the door to his house opened and a young officer emerged he wore a beautifully tailored riding coat with fur collar and the red star of the army of the peoples republic gleamed brightly in his cap did well moro said the young officer took the english cigarette from the tibetans lips and inhaled deeply a sunny smile appeared oa his face excellent really quite excellent moro nodded the eager smile still firmly in place and together they stood there listening to the sound of the beaver fade into the pass house of pleasure drummond emerged from the hot room dropped his towel on the tiled floor and dived into the plunge bath swimming down to touch the brightly coloured mosaic face of kali the great mother staring blindly into eternity through the green water as she had done for a thousand years he surfaced and one of the house girls moved out of the steam and squatted at the side of the ancient bath holding a tray containing a slender coffee pot and tiny cups drummond swam towards her and she handed him down a cup as he floated there in the water she was like all the rest of them startlingly beautiful with delicate features and great kohlrimmed eyes her green silken sari was saturated with steam outlining to perfection the firm body the curving breasts as drummond sipped his coffee he heard a harsh laugh somewhere near at hand and hamids great voice boomed between the walls he was singing the first stanza of zukhmeedil a ballad immensely popular on the northwest frontier at one time the favourite march of the khyber rifles wullud sureen shuftauloomaunind duryah ufsose mun nshinaah drummond handed his cup back to the girl and threw the song back at the pathan translating into english theres a boy across the river with a bottom like a peach but alas i cannot swim hamid bellowed with laughter as he moved out of the steam a towel about his waist he was a pathaa of the hazara tribe darkskinned bearded a handsome buccaneer of a man of six feet three with broad muscular shoulders he smiled hugely feeling better jack headache gone ready for anything drummond replied me too the pathan ran his fingers through the long hair of the girl who still squatted at the side of the bath a good song that but where loves concerned im the old fashioned kind he pulled the girl to her feet and the damp sari parted exposing her left breast now theres a thing he swung her up into his arms and grinned down at drummond see you later drummond swam lazily across to the other side of the bath and back again he repeated the process twics and then hauled himself out over the stone edge smoothed by time he picked up his towel wrapped it around his waist and padded across the warm tiles the next room was long and narrow with a vaulted roof and lined with cubicles some with curtains drawn from one he heard hamids deep chuckle followed by the lighter laughter of the girl and smiled to himself he went into the end cubicle pulled the bell cord in the comer climbed on to the stone massage slab and waited after a while the curtain was drawn and ram singh the proprietor entered followed by several bearers carrying buckets of hot and cold water the hindu smiled all is in order mr drummond youve made a new man of me drummond saidwe could do with you in sadar the hindu rolled his eyes to heaven in simulated horror the end of the world mr drummond the end of the world i will send raika he withdrew and drummond lay there staring up at the ceiling the end of the world well that wasnt far off as a description of sadar a capital city with a population of three thousand which gave some idea of the size of balpur itsee a barren ugly land harsh and cruel as its inhabitants the last place god made well not for much longer praise be to allah the curtain rustled and when he turned ms head raika had entered she was strikingly beautiful and wore a ruby in one nostril and great silver earrings with little bells on the end that tinkled when she moved ier head her sari was of blue silk threaded with gold and outlined every curve of her graceful body drummond nodded and without speaking she started to work first came the hot rinse water so scalding that he had to stifle the cry of pain that rose in his throat she worked on his limbs to start with first with the brushes and then with practised hands loosening taut muscles relaxing him so completely that he seemed to be floating suspended in midair and as always he was amazed at the matteroffactness of it all the lack of overt sensuality but then this was india where life and death love and the flesh were all a part of one great mystery she sluiced him down again with another bucket of hot water that was followed immediately by one so cold it drew the breath from his body he gasped and there was a glint of laughter in her eyes barely contained so that at once she became real a creature of flesh and blood she leaned over mm the damp sari gaping to the waist and drummond cupped a hand over one sharply pointed breast she went very still and stayed there ia that position leaning across him her hand still reaching for the brush drummond stared up at her the nipple hardening against his palm and something stirred in her eyes her head came down slowly the mouth slightly parted and as he slid his free hand up around her neck there was a discreet cough at the entrance raika stood back at once completely unconcerned and drummond sat up ram singh peered through the curtain an anxious frown on his face so sorry mr drummond but there is a person to see you dremmond frowneda person a miss janet tate ram singh laughed nervously an american lady in this place hamid appeared at the hindus shoulder a cigarette in his mouth a day for surprises jack any idea who she is theres one way of finding out drummond tightened the towel around his waist left the cubicle and went into the next room it was beautifully furnished with heavy carpets low divans and round brass coffee tables at which several clients were relaxing after the rigours of the bath he crossed the room followed by hamid and the hindu knelt on a divan and peered through the latticed partition of wrought iron into ram singhs office janet tate stood at the desk examining a figurine of a dancer she put it down turned and looked around her with interest moving very slowly across the floor incredibly lovely in the yellow dress the long shoulderlength black hair framing her calm face hamid sighed softly a hour from paradise itself sent to delight us drummond straightened a frown on his face get me a robe will you the hindu was back in a moment and helped him into it arent you going to dress first hamid said drammond grinned my curiosity wont allow me to wait that long when he opened the door and stepped into the office janet tate was examining a tapestry hanging on one wall she turned quickly and stood quite still the man who faced her was about forty the crisp black hair already greying a little at the temples he was perhaps six feet in height well built with good capable hands she noticed them particularly as he fastened the belt of his robe but it was the face that interested her the slight ironic quirk to the mouth of someone who laughed at himself and other people too much the strong welldefined bones of the gael not handsome the ugly puckered scar running from the right eye to the corner of the mouth had taken care of that but the eyes were like smoke slanting across a hillside on a winters day and she was aware of a strange inexplicable holiowness inside her mr drummond im janet tate she didnt hold out her hand it was as if she was afraid to touch him afraid of some elemental contact which at this first moment she might be unable to control and then he smiled a smile of such devastating charm that the heart turned over inside her he shook his head slowly you shouldnt have come here miss tate its no place for a woman thats what the man at the hotel told me she said but they have girls here i saw two as i came in and then she realised and her eyes widened drummond helped himself to a cigarette from a sandalwood box on the desk what can i do for you tm trying to get to sadar i believe you might be able to help he frowned his surprise why on earth do you want to go to sadar tm a nurse she said tve been sent here by the society of friends to escort the khan of balpurs young son to our chicago hospital hes to undergo serious eye surgery there and then drummond remembered father kerrigan had told him about it before leaving but the old priest had said they were expecting a doctor so youre a quaker thats right she said calmly tirst visit to india she nodded ive just finished a twoyear tour of service in vietnam i was on my way home on leave anyway so the society asked me to make a detour some detour you can take me drummond nodded no difficulty there i fly a beaver theres plenty of room just one other passengermajor hamid indian army adviser in balpur not that they have much of an army for him to advise well take off about fourthirty make an overnight stop at juma and fly on through the mountains to sadar in the morning much safer that way hecrushed his cigarette into the benares ashtrayif youll hang on ill go and dress he started for the door and she said quickly was forgetting i have message for you from a mr ferguson when he turned it was the face of a different man cold hard wiped clean of all expression the eyes like slate ferguson where did you meet ferguson on the train from calcutta he was very kind to me he wants you to call on him at the usual place before you leave she smiled brightly it all sounds very mysterious an invisible hand seemed to pass across his face and he smiled again a great one for a joke old ferguson i shant be long he left her there and hurried through the other room to the changing cubicles where he dressed quickly in a cream nylon shirt knitted tie and singlebreasted blue suit of tropical worsted when he returned to the office hamid was sitting on the edge of the desk janet in the chair beside him looking up a smile on her face drummond was aware of a strange irrational jealousy as he moved forward i see alis managed to make his own introductions as usual if i must be formally introduced then i must hamid grinned down at janet jack was at one time a commander in the navy hes never got over it theyre very correct you know he jumped to his feet and stood there waiting for drummond to speak a handsome challenging figure in his military turban and expertly tailored khaki drill uniform the medal ribbons a bright splash of colour above his left breast pocket drummond sighed trapped as usual miss janet tate may i present major ali mohammed hamid dso a british decoration youll notice winchester one of our better public schools and sandhurst rather more class than west point dont you think hamid took her left hand and raised it to his tips gallantly see how the british have left their brand on us clear to the bone miss tate dont look at me drummond said tm a scot the same thing hamid said airily everyone knows its the scots who rule britain he gave his arm to janet and they moved out into the bright hot sunshine across the square there was a low wall and beyond it the river usually two miles wide at this point but as always when winter approached narrowing to half a mile or less winding its way through endless sandbanks is this still the ganges janet asked ganges light amid the darkness friend of the helpless it has a thousand names hamid said as they strolled towards the low wall to bathe in her waters is to be purified of all sin or so the hindus believe janet leaned on the wall and looked down the cobbled bank into the inshore channel at the brown siltladen water it looks pretty unhealthy to me drummond tit a cigarette and leaned beside her strangely enough it does seem to have healthgiving properties during religious festivals pilgrims driak it often at places where the drains disgorge the filth of the town but they never seem to suffer bottled it keeps for a year they say that in the old days when taken on board clipper ships in calcutta it outlasted all other waters down below at the river edge some kind of ceremony was taking place and she glanced up at hamid can we go down but of course anything you wish not me drummond said if im going to see ferguson before we leave id better be moving he glanced at his watch its almost two oclock now ill see you back at fee hotel at four he moved away across the square quickly and janet watched him go a slight frown oa her face i believe mr ferguson said he was in the tea business thats right hamid said jack has an air freight contract with him ferguson usually comes up to see him once a month he has a houseboat lower down the liver from here you said mr dremmosd was oecs a naval commander fleet air arm he was a regular officer then he would have bees too young to have been a full commander during the war quite right the pathan still smiled but there was a slight cutting edge to his voice a look in the eye that warned her to go no further shall we go down they stood on the edge of a small crowd and watched the ceremony that was taking place several people stood kneedeep ia the water the men amongst them stripped to the waist and daubed with mud one of them poured ashes from a muslin bag into a larger paper boat another put a match to it and pushed the frail craft away from the bank out into the channel where the current caught it suddenly the whole boat burst into flames and a moment later sank beneath the surface what were they doing janet asked the ashes were those of a baby hamid said a manchild because the ceremony is expensive and not worth going through for a girl and they do this all the time he nodded it is every hindus greatest dream to have his ashes scattered on the waters of ganges near here there is a shamsan a burning place for the dead would you like to see it do you think i can stand it he smiled down at her two years in vietnam you said if you can take that you can take anything tm not so sure she shook her head indias different like no other place on earth ferguson told me that and he was right as they moved along the shore she could smell woodsmoke and up ahead there was a bullock cart three or four people standing beside it as they approached she gave a sudden gasp and moved closer to hamid a naked man was lying on a bed of thorns eyes closed his tongue protruding an iron spike pushed through it his hair and beard were matted and filthy his body daubed with cowdung and ashes a saddhu a holy man hamid said throwing a coin into an earthenware jar that stood at the mans head he begs from the mourners and prays for the souls of the dead there was nothing to distinguish the place from any other stretch of the shore no temples no monuments only the ashes of old fires the piles of calcined bones and here and there a skull glaring blindly up at the sky the people by the fire laughed and joked with each other and as the flames roared through the crisscrossed logs of the funeral pyre in a sudden gust of wind she caught the sweetlysick distinctive stench of burning flesh and her throat went dry panic threatening to choke her she turned stumbling against hamid and beyond him in the water something turned over in the shallows a rotting body arms trailing a grey headed gull swooping down beak poised to strike there was immediate concern oa ms face and unconsciously he used her first name janet what is it the smell she saidburning flesh i was in a village called nonmng north of saigon last year the viet cong made one cf their night raids and set fire to the hospital she stared back into the past horror on her face the patients we could only get half of them out there are nights when i can still hear the screams she was aware of his hand under her arm and they were climbing rapidly up the bank across a narrow stone causeway suddenly they moved into a different world a place of colour and light scarlet hibiscus and graceful palms they walked through trees along a narrow path and emerged oa to a stone loopholed terrace high above the river a couple of ancient iron cannon still at their stations as they had been for three hundred years hainid pushed her gently forward and behold said the genie she gave an excited gasp and leaned across the wah between the sandbanks hundreds of flamingoes paced through the shallows setting the very air alight with the glory of their plumage hamid picked up a stone and tossed it down and immediately the sky was filled with the heavy pulsating beat of their wings as they lifted in shimmering cloud he looked down at her gravely back there death janet here life in all its magnificence they are both sides of the same coin this you must learn she nodded slowly and slipped her hand into his arm together they walked back quietly through the trees without speaking beyond the old quarter of the town drummond moved into an area of stately walled villas and beautiful gardens the homes of rich merchants and government officials a narrow path fringed with eucalyptus trees brought him to the river bank again a red houseboat was moored at the end of an old stone wharf about forty yards away and fergusons sikh bearer squatted on the cabin roof when he saw drummond he scrambled to the deck and disappeared below drummond crossed the narrow gangway and stepped on to the deck which had been scrubbed to a dazzling whiteness several cane chairs and a table were grouped under an awning at the stern and as he sat down the sikh appeared with a tray containing a bottle of gin icewater and glasses he placed the tray on the table and withdrew without speaking drummond helped himself to a drink and walked to the stern rail staring out across the river and thinking about janet tate as a boat slipped by sail bellying in the breeze there was a clink of a bottle against glass and when he turned ferguson was sitting at the table pouring himself a drink youre looking fit jack nothing like a steam bath to pull a man round after a hard night hullo fergy you old rogue drummond said i got your message it was delivered in person at ram singhs house of pleasure by a rather delectable little quaker girl in a yellow dress god in heaven ferguson said astonishment on his face she didnt did she tm afraid so drummond sat down and took a cheroot from an old leather case her first visit to india apparently shes a lot to learn i found her travelling from calcutta second class ferguson said can you imagine that whats all this about the khans son needing eye surgery the boy fell from his horse a month ago and took a nasty knock the sight started to fail in the right eye so the old man had me fly a specialist up from calcutta hes got a detached retina and his balance has been affected tricky surgery to put that right it seems the big experts on the staff of some quaker foundation hospital in chicago father kerrigan got in touch with them and they agreed to take the case said theyd send a doctor to escort the boy instead you get janet tate who was already in vietnam and due home on leave so they saved on the fare drummond grinned never look a gift horse in the mouth fergy ferguson frowned slightly shes a nice girl jack a hell of a nice girl i wouldnt like to see her get hurt so drummond said coolly ferguson sighed all right let it go what have you got for me this time drummond took several spools of film from his pocket and pushed them across thats the lot youve got the whole balpurtibet border region now youve finished drummond nodded trip before last a good job too cheung decided to fly in with me on the last trip so i couldnt have set the camera up if id wanted to ferguson smiled and shook his head our nationalist friends are still at it are they i wonder what washington would say if they knew i couldnt care less drummond said a couple more trips and im through ive told cheung that already ferguson applied a match to the bowl of his old briar pipe and coughed as the smoke caught at the back of his throat how did you find things last trip any signs of chinese activity swinging on the end of a rope drummond said moro and his band dealt with a cavalry patrol in their own inimitable fashion thats all nothing else youre sure about that drummond nodded moro says that all the activitys still in the aksaichin ladakh region no sign of any large scale interest in the balpur border area at all thats strange you know theyve claimed it officially and the brutal truth is theyre on pretty firm ground this time historically speaking they can have it for all i care drummond said another month and im out ferguson poked a match into the end of his pipe to clear the air hole and said casually what were you thinking of doing nothing youd be interested in im finished fergy ive had enough how long have i given you now four years five ive played this sort of game on every border from sarawak to kashmir i cant go ob forever nobody can youve done a good job jack fm not denying that ferguson said but youve been well paid what about last year when the indonesians shot me down in borneo drummond reminded him they chased me through that jungle for three weeks before i managed to scramble across the border he ran a finger down the ugly scar that stretched from his left eye to the corner of his mouth i spent a month in hospital and what happened you paid me the same as always no more no less ferguson sighed took an envelope from his pocket and pushed it across three thousand deposited as usual with your geneva bankers you know how to get in touch with me if you change your mind thatll be the day drummond opened the envelope examined the deposit slip then put it ia his wallet its been fun fergy he moved along the deck to the gangplank and stepped on to the wharf one more thing jack ferguson called dont forget who the beaver belongs to when youve finished up there government property you know and just how would you like to set about proving that drummond said and started to laugh as as walked away along the wharf the nighiwalkers janet stepped out of the shower dried herself quickly and went into the bedroom the towel wrapped around her slim body the window to the terrace was open and she stood in the shadows and looked out a bank of cloud rolled away from the moca and juma was bathed in a hard white light fiatroofed houses straggling down to the river below the night sky was incredibly beautiful with stars strung away to the horizon where the mountains lifted uneasily to meet them it was peaceful and quiet a dog barking hollowly somewhere in the night in the streets below she could see torches flaring and then a drum started to beat monotonously joined a moment later by some stringed instrument and the sound of laughter drifted up on the warm air there was a discreet tap on the door and she called quicklywho is it ali can i speak to you for a moment she pulled on her dressing gown fastened the cord and opened the door hamid came in resplendent in his best uniform how are you feeling fine i slept for an hour then had a shower good he hesitated and then went on apologetically tm sorry about this janet but fm afraid id already arranged something for this evening he glanced at his watch as it is im pressed for time a lady hope not he said solemnly she chuckled youre quite incorrigible better not keep her waiting lack went out to the airstrip to check on some cargo were taking with us tomorrow motor spare i think he shouldnt be more than half an hour she listened to the sound of his footsteps fade along the narrow passage and then closed the door she stood with her back to it a slight frown on her face and then walked slowly across to the window the drumming was louder now an insistent throb bing that filled the night and someone was singing in high reedy voice hardly movingfromone note to another monotonous and yet strangely exciting she hurried across to the bed opened her second suitcase and took out a sleeveless black dress in heavy silk that she had purchased in a moment of weakness in saigon she held it against herself for a moment in the mirror and then smiled and started to dress when she was ready she pulled on a white linen duster coat against the night air wound a silk scarf around her head and went downstairs the hindu night clerk dozed at his desk but came awake at once when she touched him lightly on the shoulder i want to go to the airstrip can you get me a tongat certainly memsahib come this way he took her out through the entrance and down the steps to the street a light twowheeled tonga was parked at the kerb a magnificent affair a beautiful highstepping horse between the shafts his brass har ness gleaming in the lamplight the driver squatted on the pavement chatting to an old beggar but he sprang to his feet at once and ran forward the hindu desk clerk handed janet in gave the man his destination and then moved away the sky was scattered with the fire of a million stars the moon so large that it seemed unreal like a pasteboard cutout the wind blew in through the darkness carrying the last heat of the day across the river and she breathed deeply wondering what the night might bring her body shaking with a strange nervous excitement the airstrip was half a mile outside juma on a fiat plain beside the river it was not an official stopping place for any of the big airlines and had been constructed by the raf as an emergency strip during the war there was one prefabricated concrete hangar still painted in the camouflage of wartime and the plane squatted inside the scarlet and gold of its fuselage gleaming in the light of a hurricane lamp suspended from a beam drummond leaned against a trestle table beside a walleyed bengali merchant named samil cheungs agent in juma and watched two porters load the aarrow boxes into the plane whats in this one he asked kicking a wooden crate that carried the neatly stencilled legend machine parts f cheung esq sadar sikkim samil produced a bunch of keys unfastened the padlock which secured the lid of the crate and opened it he removed a mass of cotton waste and revealed a layer of rifles each one still coated in grease from the factory drummond took one out it was a garrand automatic a beautiful weapon he examined it closely and frownedwhat about this he indicated the legend united states army on the butt platea bit stupid isnt it i dont think our american friends would be amused thats what they sent me this time samil shrugged surplus stock always comes cheaper you should know that somehow i dont think cheung is going to like it he raised the garrand took an imaginary sight out of the door and stiffened suddenly as janet tate moved out of the shadows what in the hell are you doing here he demanded tm sorry she said her face serious hamids gone off for the night before he left he called and told me you were out here i thought you might like to take me to dinner or something exactly what i intended to do the two porters had stopped working and glanced at samil uncertainly drummond was still holding the garrand in both hands close to his chest and janet said gravely hamid said he thought you were loading motor spares he put the rifle back with the others wiped his hands clean oa a lump of cotton waste and nodded to samilyou finish up here nothing to worry about ill handle it he turned straightening his tie how did you get here i came in a tonga from the hotel i told the driver to wait shall we go then he took her arm aware of the stiff restraint the tilt of her chin and knew that in some way he had disappointed her in the tonga she sat silently in her corner as far away from htm as possible and drummond chuckled tm sorry to spoil the image of the big bad gunrunner for you but ali knows damn well what i fly up to sikkim in boxes labelled machine parts she turned quickly in the darkness and he was aware of her perfume delicate oa the cool air so does everyone else including the khan himself he groped for her hand in the darkness and held it tight look fll tell you about it because its coming to an end anyway and because i dont want my dinner spoiled ive been looking forward to it go on she said therss a chinese gentleman called cheung tjp at sadar hes been there for six or seven months now hes supposed to be a general merchant but he happens to be an agent of the chinese nationalist government on formosa he supplies the guns and i run them over the border into tibet to help tibetan guerrilla fighters against the communist government exactly she reached over and touched his arm the breath going out of her in a gentle sigh oh jack im so glad well thats a hell of a thing for a clean living quaker girl to say he said and dont go putting me on any pedestal i do it for hard cash not out of any political idealism you dont think the tibetans stand any chance of winning then he laughed harshly not in a thousand years their battle will be won or lost in other places vietnam malaysia sarawak perhaps on the floor of the united nations but to hell with that where would you like to eat somewhere full of colour not just a tourist trap i want to see the real india good for you well make a woman of you yet they were moving into the centre of juma now and he tapped the driver on the shoulder and told him to stop well walk from here you want to see the real india ill show it to you he paid the driver took her arm and they moved along the street as they neared the centre it became busier and busier vendors of cooked food squatted inside their wooden stalls beside charcoal fires busy with their pans the scent of spices and cooked meats pungent on the cooling air and then they turned into the old quarter where lamps hung from the houses and the bazaar was even more crowded than during the daylight hours as people walked abroad to savour the cool night air the pavements were jammed with wooden stalls overflowing with masses of paper flowers shoddy plastic sandals imported from hong kong aluminium pots and pans looking somehow incongruous and out of place craftsmen sat crosslegged in their booths behind the stalls of the brass merchants still plying their ancient craft next to the silversmiths and the garmentmakers where they embroidered dancing girls clothes there were bohara carpets rugs from isfahan and atthe far end prostitutes waiting in their booths unveiled and heavily painted and even here the curtain of night the flickering lamps shining on cheap bangles and jewellery cloaked the filth and disease the squalor of the daylight hours they moved on drummond pushing to one side the numerous beggars who whined for alms and finally turned into a narrow quiet street leading to the river faintly on the night air janet could hear music it grew louder and then they came to a narrow arched door you wanted india well this is it drummond said they went along a narrow passage and came out oa to a small landing at the head of a sight of steps overlooking a large square room it was crowded with indians mainly men most of them wearing traditional dress they were all eating hugely and talmng loudly at the same time in the centre on a raised platform a young womanish tabla player eyes rimmed with kohl beat his drums with an insolent skill looking around at the crowd as he did so a bored and haughty expression on his face ids companion an older man in baggy white trousers threequarter length black frock coat buttoned to the neck looked strangely formal and played the zita his fingers moving across the strings with incredible dexterity a small neat hindu in scarlet turban his eyes flickering towards janet with frank admiration approached with a ready smile a table mr drummond you wish to dine a booth i think drummond told him they threaded their way between the tables all eyes turning towards janet and gasps of admiration even clapping followed them to their booth they sat facing each other across a small brass table a bead curtain partially obscuring them from the other diners and drummond ordered it was a simple meal but superbly cooked curried chicken so strong that janet gaaped for breath swallowing great draughts of cold water thoughtfully provided by the proprietor to cool her burning mouth afterwards they had green mangoes soaked in syrup followed by yemeni mocha the finest coffee in the world in tiny exquisite cups satisfied he asked her as he lit a cheroot she nodded her eyes shining marvellous i wouldnt have missed it for anything theres a floor show of sorts he said do you want to see it not exactly the copocabana i warn you there was an unmistakable challenge in his voice and she responded immediately tve never refused a dare since i was old enough to walk suit yourself there was a sudden roll on the drum the lights dimmed a little and there was silence there was an atmosphere of expectancy that she could sense at once and then a gentle universal sigh echoed through the room a woman stepped through a curtain at the rear and poised for a moment a dark silhouette against the light saida saida i the name echoed faintly through the crowd one of the few great nautch dancers left jjrummond whispered to janet shes fifty if shes a day but youd never guess it the right arm extended slowly and a tiny tinkling cymbal sounded immediately the musicians responded on the tabla and zita and saida started to sway sensuously moving into the centre of the room her face was heavily painted a symbolic mask that never changed expression but the body beneath the swirling silkea veils was that of a young and vibrant girl gradually the music increased in tempo and she moved in time swaying from side to side discarding her veils one by one until she stood before them naked except for a small beaded girdle low across her loins she stood quite still as the music stopped and the audience waited the tabla players fingers broke into a fast monotonous tattoo and she started to sway hands above her head clapping rhythmically and the audience swayed with her clapping in time crying aloud with delight round and round the perimeter of the floor she moved faster and faster sweat glistening on her body until with a sudden fierce gesture she ripped the girdle from her loins and fluag herself forward on her knees sliding to a halt in front of a large richly dressed merchant who squatted oa cushions before a low table with two companions there was another abrupt silence and then the drum sounded again slower this time the beat becoming more insistent each moment as she writhed sinuously thrusting her pointed breasts at him twisting effortlessly from knees to buttocks sliding away from his grasping hands sharp cries rising from the crowd and then he had her fingers hooking into her buttocks as the crowd roared its approval the drum stopped she twisted from his grasp her ofled body slipping between his hands ran across the floor and melted through the curtain the musicians started to play again on a more muted key and the audience returned to their food discussing the performance with much laughter and joking when prummond turned to look at janet her face was strangely pale i warned you he saidyou wanted to see the real india and this is a country where sex is as much a part of daily life as eating and drinking an appetite to be satisfied thats ail do you believe that depends what a mans looking for doesnt it had enough she nodded and he called for the bill and paid it the room was by this time heavy with smoke and there was the sound of drunken laughter everywhere as they threaded their way between the tables eyes turned on janet there were winks and leers and sly nudges someone stood up at the edge of the floor and made an obscene gesture there was a roar of spontaneous laughter and as she turned her head flushing angrily she was aware of a hand on her right leg sliding up beneath the skirt she cried out in rage and mortification and swung round there were four men seated at a low table three of them typical of a breed to be found the world over in spite of their turbans and loose robes young vicious animals spoiling for trouble the man who had grabbed at her was older with wild drunken eyes in a bearded face he wore a black outer robe threaded with gold and his hands were a blaze of jewels as his chin tilted the mouth wide with laughter her hand caught him full across the face his head rocked to one side there was a general gasp and the room was silent his head turned slowly and there was rage and madness in the eyes as he grabbed at her coat drummond spun her to one side the bearded man was only half way to his feet when drummonds right foot swung into his crutch the man screamed doubling over and drummond raised a knee into the descending face smashing the nose sending him crashing back across the coffee table and the thing janet couldnt understand was the silence no one moved to stop them when drummond turned straightening his jacket took her arm and pushed her through the crowd to the stairs outside in the street he urged her on turning and twisting through several alleys until finally they emerged on an old stone embankment above the river why the rush she said did you think they might follow us thats the general idea he lit a cheroot the match flaring in his cupped hands to reveal the strong sardonic face the young squirtabouttown i treated so roughly back there happens to be the son of the town governor will there be trouble not the official kind if thats what you mean hes got away with too much in the past for anyone to start crying over ms ruined looks at this stage he might put someone on to me privately but i can handle that did you really need to be so rough it never pays to do things by halves not here this isnt tourist india you know the only thing im sorry about is taking you there in the first place i should have had more sense tm not she said you werent responsible for what happened to tell you the truth i rather enjoyed myself including the nautch dance she laughed til reserve my opinion on that part of the programme it was very educational mind you something of aa understatement you know youre quite a girl and for someone who believes in turning the other cheek you throw a good punch you certainly rocked mia back there a quick temper was always my besetting sin shc said my old grannie used to warn me about that when i was a little girl back home in maine quakers are really quite nice when you get to know them fsesi and blood too he grinned and took her armah right i suneader letswalk they went on to the beach below the embankment and strolled through the moonlight without talking for a while now and then sandbanks collapsed into the water with a thunderous roar and cranes threshed through the shallows disturbed by the noise huge pale flowers swam out of the night and beyond the trees the sky was violet and purple more beautiful than anything she had ever seen before they passed a solitary fisherman cooking a supper offish over a small fire of dried cowdung and drumiaond gave him a greetmg la urdu what do you do in balpur beside fly in guns for mr cheung she said after a while survey work for the indian government freight general cargo or passengers anything that comes to hand i shouldnt have thought there was much of a living in that there isnt but cheung pays well for the tibetan trips and ill be leaving soon anyway ive had enough of de place whats it like balpur he shrugged barren treacherous mountains a capital of three thousand people thats more like an overgrown village an army if you can call it that of seventyfive when winter comes its absolute hell and thats in another month the roads are the worst in the world at the best of times but during the winter theyre completely snowed up what about the khan an old mountain hawk proud as lucifer quite a warrior in his day to his people something very special not only king but priest and that makes for quite a distinction youe like kerim his son a great pily about his accident i hope your people in chicago can fix him up all right hes eight isnt he nine in three months my instructions told me to get in touch with a father kerrigan when i arrive apparently hes in charge of all the arrangements youll like him drummond said hes about sixty a marvellous old irishman who just wont give in hes been twelve years in sikkim and hasnt made a single convert and the people adore him its fantastic if he hasnt got a congregation what does he do with himself as it happens hes a qualified doctor runs a small mission hospital about a mile outside of sadar completely on his own theres one other european up there a man called brackenshaw a geologist for some british firm or other theyve also made him british consul but dont let that impress you it doesnt mean a thing f you dont like him i take itt not much he stopped to light another cheroot and she said casually why did you leave the navy jack he paused the match flaring in his fingers his eyes dark shadows you really want to know she didnt answer and he shrugged flicking the match into the night they kicked me out or advised me to leave which comes to the same thing for a career officer she could sense the pain in his voice and put a hand on his arm instinctively what happened i was a fleet air arm pilot during the korean war one bright morning in july took my squadron to the wrong target when we left it was a smoking nun we did a good job we managed to kill twentythree american marines and ten royal marine commandos who had been serving with them there was bewilderment in her voice but how could such a thing happen the briefing officer gave me the wrong information so it wasnt your fault depends how you look at it if id checked my orders more carefully id have spotted the mistake i was too hied lhat was the trouble overtired too many mis sions not enough sleep i should have grounded myself weeks before but i didnt so they couldnt courtmartial you a quiet chat with someone with gold rings all the way up to his elbow thats all it took i got the message tra sorry jack sorrier than i can say her voice was warm and full of sympathy they had reached a flight of stone steps leading up from the shore and he paused and looked at her her mouth opened to cry a warning and he ducked turning to meet the rush of feet from the darkness a fist grazed his cheek he lost his balance and rolled over and over hands protecting his genitals as feet swung in viciously he sprang up and backed to the wall there were three of them dark shadowy figures in tattered robes scum from the market place hired for a few rupees above them on the steps below the lamp stood the man from the cafe supported by two of his friends blood on his face a knife gleamed dully and janet ran in past the three men to join drummond against the wall kill him the bearded man cried kill the swine drummond was tired it had been a long evening his hand disappeared inside his coat reaching to the leather holster on his left hip and reappeared holding a smith wesson magnum revolver with a threeinch barrel he fired into the air and there was a sudden stillness go on get out of it he shouted angrily and fired a shot towards the man on the steps that ricocheted into the night the men from the market place were already running away along the shore cursing volubly and the gover nors son and his two friends staggered into the darkness drummond slipped the revolver back into its holster and looked down at her calmly you know i really think its time we went back to the hotel dont you she started to tremble uncontrollably and he reached out pulling her into his arms its all right everythings all right now he stroked her hair gently with one hand and his lips brushed her forehead in the heavy stillness of the night she could almost hear her heart beating when he tilted her chin and kissed her gently on the mouth it was like nothing she had ever known before he slipped her arm in his without speaking and together they went up the steps to the embankment the last place god made the air was bumpy as they flew out of the pass for a fortyknot wind was blowing across the mountains they climbed through a heat haze that was already blurring the horizon and levelled out at feet to cross the mountains between india and balpur janet tate was in the front passenger seat beside drummond and hamid sat behind her she was wearing a white blouse collar turned down over the neck of a cashmere sweater cream whipcord slacks and a sheepskin coat that drummond had provided hamid poured coffee into a plastic cup and handed it to her were moving into balpur now he said the mountains to the east are in bhutan with assam far beyond in the haze the chinese broke through in strength there in were you there he shook his head no i was on the ladakh front in the northwest it was supposed to be pretty bad up there wasnt it a vision from hell he said grimly can you imagine what its like trying to live at feet never mind fight the mules died of asthma the men of pulmonary oedema youve heard of it i suppose she nodded the lungs fill with water dont they an ironic way for a man to die in battle by drowning we could never get them down to the base hospitals in time for treatment that was the trouble hadnt you any air support helicopters he laughed harshly until october we hadnt needed them the way of peace was the way for india he shook his headno we didnt have the necessary planes even if we had there werent the pilots certainly not the kind who could fly hi that sort of country thats where i met jack you know she turned to drummond in surpriseyou were flying for the indian army five hundred quid a week he said good money by any standards dont listen to him hamid broke in a game he plays from leh he flew three operational flights a day into the ladakh mountains to one small airstrip at feet taking in supplies and ammunition bringing out the sick and wounded in five weeks he flew just over a hundred sorties then collapsed and spent three weeks in hospital suffering from complete exhaustion his contract called for five flights a week no more he should have added that they didnt pay me for the time in hospital drummond told her thats the wily oriental for you he increased speed and banked in a long sweeping curve that took them out of a shallow pass and into a valley beyond a broad river flowed sluggishly snaking between jagged cliffs a thread of silver in a landscape so savage and sterile that it took the breath away remember what i told you drummond said the last place god made and to think the chinese have laid claim to this bloody lot but why she said the same psychology the roman emperors used hamid told her give the mob circuses to take their mind off the more important problems in china in the harvest was bad and thousands starved so their army invaded india a country completely unprepared for such an attack and presented their people with a ready made victory in pekin they were able to tighten their belts and wave banners have they really laid claim to balpur along with almost every other border country actually balpur was a part of the chinese empire in ancient times the people are mongolian only the ruling class are muslims descendants of the original invaders but no one seriously imagines that they would invade for one thing the old khan has preferred to stay completely neutral hes the only ruler of a border state who hasnt signed a mutual defence pact with india yet he accepts you as an adviser to an army of seventyfive men a political gesture only in pekin they laugh about it she almost mentioned mr cheung but remembering what drummond had told her on the previous evening kept silent even if hamid did know the troth that cheung was in fact a chinese nationalist agent that drummond was flying in guns to tibetan guerrilla fighters he would probably prefer to know nothing officially remembering vietnam she sighed heavilythe same pattern violence blood and suffering turning on each other in a circle that had no ending they were flying at no more than a thousand feet above the floor of the valley and suddenly in a bend of the river she saw sadar flatroofed houses scattered untidily across a broad plateau the khans palace like a fortress in a walled garden the beaver banked tightly and swept in past the graceful tower of a mosque and beyond the town on the plain to the south she could see the airstrip a narrow slot laboriously carved out of the rough terrain a windsock on a tall pole at one end dnimmond circled once then turned into the wind for a perfect landing between two rows of empty oil drums there was a small improvised hangar constructed of lusting corrugated iron barely large enough to house the beaver from the look of it he taxied towards it and switched off the engine he unfastened ms seat belt jumped to the ground and turned to give janet a hand at the same moment land rover appeared from among the houses on the edge of the town and came towards them in a cloud of dust she shivered and wrapped her sheepskin coat more tightly around her its colder than i thought it would be winter coming drummond said maybe itll be early this year an old army jeep still painted in the greygreen camouflage of wartime its canvas tilt patched and mended in many places was parked inside the hangar he and hamid had just started to transfer the luggage to it from the plane when the land rover arrived mr cheung jumped out of the passenger seat and came towards them wearing a heavy blue quilted jacket and an astrakhan hat his driver was a young fairhaired man with a bronzed reckless face he wore a sheepskin jacket in untanned hide and kneelength boots a revolver slung low on his right hip in a black holster seemed theatrical and out of place he came forward with a ready smile eyes fixed oa janet and hamid said maliciouslywhy the gun tony expecting trouble the young man flushed tm driving up to my base camp at howeel for a couple of days theyd cut your throat for the shoes on your feet up there fve come for that new theodolite i ordered if drussmonds remembered to bring it its in the plane drummond said coldlyhelp yourself so this is miss tate cheung took both of her hands in hiswe must try to make your stay a pleasant one you knew i was coming hamid grinned i had indian army headquarters in juma send a signal to warn the khan cheung nodded colonel dil got the message last night by radio and probably told you before the khan brackenhurst jumped down from the beaver and turned to lift out a wooden case containing his theodolite a hell of a lot of machine parts you seem to bring through these days he commented and turned to janet before drummond could reply tm tony bracken s burst miss tate fm doing geological survey work up here but im also the british consul if i can help you in any way dont hesitate to ask she happens to be an american so thats hardly likely drummond said acidly brackenhurst ignored him holding her hand for longer than was necessary an eager smile on his lips and it was the smile which betrayed him somehow revealing an essential weakness a lack of strength why thats very kind of you mr brackenhurst til be back in two days he said youll probably still be here from what they tell me of the boys condition he carried the theodolite across to the land rover and cheung said quickly til go back with him youll have enough in the jeep with the three of you and the luggage youll call on me this afternoon jack after lunch ill take janet out to the mission first is the boy still out there cheung nodded and smiled down at her and you i will have the pleasure of seeing you again this evening miss tate the khan is to give a small dinner party for you he has honoured me with an invitation til look forward to that mr cheung the land rover moved back towards town and drummond drove the jeep out of the hangar he and hamid pushed the beaver inside and padlocked the door tfl take janet out to father kerrigan now what about you ali hamid shrugged you can drop me at colonel dils headquarters ill probably see you both tonight at the palace unless the old boys decided to change his usual guest list they got into the jeep and drummond drove towards the town following the rutted track that did service as a road he changed down scattering a herd of goats and they entered the outskirts of sadar janet looked about her with interest but there was nothing of the gaiety and colour of jusna and altaf here the people were small squat mongolians with skins the colour of weathered parchment and slanting eyes the men wore boots of untanned hide baggy trousers and sheepskin jackets only a few sported the turban the majority preferring conical sheepskin caps with earfiaps the womens attire differed in only one significant detail instead of the sheepskin jacket they wore threequarter length blanket coats of black and brovra relieved in some cases by a necklace of silver coins they were dour and unsmiling drab as the rocky land that bred them even the children in the market place lacked the energy and humour of their indian counterparts and there was a strange absence of bustle and vitality as they drove through the bazaar no oae seems to smile janet said have you noticed that this is a poor country hamid told her anything they get has to be squeezed out of the very rocks life is hard work from dawn till dusk it leaves little time for laughter across the square stood a barracklike building the sag of balpur a black eagle against a grey and gold background lifting in the slight breeze above the entrance two sentries almost incongruously smart in neat khaki uniforms and military turbans presented arms as drummond braked and hamid got out he reached for his canvas grip and an orderly ran down the steps and relieved him of it th see you tonight then he said and his hand lifted in a brief salute the palace was a hundred yards further on and looked considerably less forbidding than it had done from the air wrought iron gates standing open to reveal a gravel drive tall cypress trees fringing the wall a profusion of greenery beyond to where a fountain lifted gracefully into the calm air i must say that looks rather more inviting janet remarked not surprising drummond said the khans a muslim remember at least they know how to live whats the religion of his people generally a lot pay lip service to islam and a great many still adhere to buddhism but in a bastardised form and then theres a minority group of hindus whove kept themselves apart over the centuries not more than two or three thousand in the entire country they were by now moving out of the town again and the houses were more scattered twostoreyed walled villas in the main obviously the homes of the rich of sadar whoever they were drummond slowed swung the jeep in through an arched entrance and braked to a halt in the courtyard of a small bungalow surrounded by a walled garden this is my place he said if you dont mind hanging on ill drop my things and be straight out again as he got out a small greying woman swathed ia a dark robe her face seamed and wrinkled opened the front door and moved out on to the verandah inclining her head in greeting hands together indian style your housekeeper janet asked he nodded and reached for his canvas holdall wont be a minute mind if i come in she said td love to see inside he hesitated perceptibly and then shrugged if youd like to but there really isnt much to see she followed him up the steps at the top he murmured something quickly to the old woman who went back in then stood to one side after you she found herself in a narrow entrance hall with rough cast walls and a floor of polished wood he opened a door to the right and she moved iato the main living room there was a great stone fireplace skin rugs on the wood floor and the furniture was of the simplest a dining table several easy chairs and a couple of shelves of books til be with you in a minute drammond said and he crossed the room and went through another door she walked slowly around the room examining everything and paused at the bookshelves there was a small figurine of a dancer on the table beneath carved from some dark wood of incredible hardness she picked it up and examined it closely the breasts were of a ripeness that was almost lifelike hands extended in a ritualistic pose the unsmiling grave face fixed for all eternity there was a slight sound from behind and she swung round and found a woman steading in the doorway to the hall like the old housekeeper she was an indian but quite young with a pale flawless complexion set off to perfection by her scarlet sari there was a silver rope necklace around her neck gold bracelets on the wrists and her dark eyes were rimmed with kohl in that same moment drummond came in from the bedroom he said something quietly ia urdu and die girl turned at once and disappeared into the hall who was that janet said the old girls daughter famia he took the figurine gently from her hands you hkr yes is it very old she replied automatically grecobuddhist probably second century youll find things like this all over balpur as i said before buddhism used to be very strong up here real buddhism i mean monasteries all over the place are there any left one or two he glanced at his watch wed better get moving its almost eleven oclock and father kerrigan holds his daily surgery at halfpast well try and catch him before it starts they went out to the jeep and he handed her in and drove away as if nothing had happened but things were not the same and there was a constraint between them that had not been present before janet remembered the girl her shapely body the pale beauty of her skin against the scarlet sari and a burning anger took possession of her that she found impossible to analyse the mission was on a hill above the river it was a long low flatroofed building walled in by grey stone as seemed to be the custom with all houses in this stark country and the tiny belfry of a small chapel reared above it flocks of goats sheep and a few small horses grazed on the sparse grass at the entrance and thirty or forty people waited patiently squatting on the ground or leaning against the wail as drummond slowed the jeep to drive through janet leaned out her trained eye quickly taking in the evidence of disease rickets and ringworm in the children old people with faces eaten away by yaws eyes encrusted with dried pus and here and there a broken limb held awkwardly in a crude bandage he doesnt handle all this on his own she demanded turning to drummond as they drove in through the entrance and braked at the bottom of a flight of stone steps he switched off the engine and nodded dont ask me how but he does has an old woman to do the cooking but thats all here she comes now the woman who opened the front door and came out into the porch had the same ageless mongolian face as the people in the market place but wore a long cotton skirt and an indian army issue khaki sweater with cloth epaulets the red scarf around her head and gold earrings made her look like a gypsy drummond went up the steps with janets two cases put them down and spoke to her in slow careful english he came back down the steps and took janets arm hes in the chapel they crossed the courtyard to the tiny greystone building he opened the heavy wooden door and they went inside the lights were very dim and down by the altar the candles flickered and the statue of the holy mother seemed to float out of the darkness father terence kerrigan knelt in prayer his rugged stubborn old irish face momentarily relaxed almost childlike in its purity his white hair gleaming like silver when he crossed himself and got to his feet she saw that he was a big man built like a tree with shoulders as wide as hamlds he turned narrowing his eyes shortsightedly when he saw them there la the shadows and came forward with a ready smile jack is it yourself and this will be miss tate he took her hands in his holding them tightly its good to see you here my dear i got word from colonel dil that you were coming in today he bad a message last night from ah hamid over the radio feel like a fraud father she said i believe you were expecting a doctor nonsense my dear a qualified nursing sister with two years experience in vietnam fefugee camps will do for me any day of the week he chuckled at her astonishment major hamid is always most thorough they crossed the courtyard mounted the steps and went inside the entrance hall had been turned into a dispensary the stone walls whitewashed drugs medicines and equipment neatly arranged on whitepainted shelves giving an overall impression of cleanliness and efficiency this is where most of the work is done and as im the only qualified doctor in balpur the pace is usually fast and furious he glanced at his watch youll see for yourself in precisely fifteen minutes what about my patient janet asked kerim the old man sighed frankly hes aot been too marvellous hes been staying here of course so that i can give him constant supervision the elian wanted me to take up residence at the palace but naturally i had to refuse as i pointed out i do haveother patients and how is kerim now rather better hes been very feverish but we seem to be over the worst of that now in any event i think we should wait for a few days before contemplating such a long journey so janet stays here drummond said if she can put up with a crotchety old fool father kerrigan smiled would you like to take a peep at kerim he led the way through into a narrow whitewashed ђ passage and opened a door on the left the boy looked very frail as he slept head turned to one side on the white pillow a heavy bandage crossing his left eye and they withdrew softly the priest opened the opposite door and ushered her into a small room simply furnished with a narrow bed and wooden locker the one touch of luxury was a large sheepskin rag on the floor a french window opened on to a verandah overlooking an overgrown and neglected garden the best i can do im afraid he said apologetically a palace compared to what i was used to in vietnam they returned to the dispensary and found drummond standing at the door looking outside the courtyard had filled with people all squatting together in the dust waiting patiently for the old priest to begin he took out his watch again and pursed his lips five minutes late this will never do ill have to say goodbye for now jack well be seeing you tonight at the palace i imagine i expect so drummond turned to janet but she was touching father kerrigan on the arm as he moved away could i help father the old man looked down at her searchingly and then a slow smile broke across his face td be glad to have you my dear ill find you a robe she nodded briefly to drummond see you tonight jack she turned away different now holding herself straighter competent assured she and the old man stood at the back of the dispensary talking as she pulled on the white robe he had found for her a strange intimacy between them drummond turned abruptly pushed his way through flie crowd climbed into the jeep and drove quickly away dinner at the palace through the french windows the white balustrade of the terrace shimmered palely and the tall cypress trees were silhouetted against the evening sky from the garden came the timeless incessant chirping of the crickets inside the soft lamplight gleamed oa delicate crystal decanters and silver and gold tableware and the great ruby in the centre of the khans turban glowed dimly like an ember stirred by a soft wind he was seventy years of age but carried himself well in his london tailored mohair and silk dinner jacket and the face beneath the turban was still that of a warrior proud and strong wife the touch of arrogance of one bom to rule he sat at the head of the table janet tate on ms left and he turned to her with a smile speaking in careful precise english more brandy miss tate i dont think so thank you a little more coffee then he snapped a finger and a servant came forward quickly there were five of them at the table besides tiie khan janet supremely beautiful in her simple ђ black silk dress and jack drummond on her left in a white dinner jacket father kerrigan sat on the khans right hand next to mr cheung and hamid and colonel sher dil commander of the khans small army faced each other magnificent in dress uniform father kerrigan has made you comfortable miss tate the khan asked he couldnt have done more the khan sighed it would have pleased me to have had you as my guest here at the palace but he is a stubborn old man and if thats true then i know another sot a thousand miles from here the priest said speaking with the familiarity of an old friend and reaching for the brandy decanter would you imagine it janet he wanted me to forsake every other blessed patient i have close the mission and move in here the khan shrugged helplessly what can one do he even refused the soldiers i sent at this moment who guards the hope cf balptnt he challenged the old priest tell me first who in balpur would harm him father kerrigan countered the khan sighed you see miss tate i am not even ruler in my own house if you must know old neridas sitting at the boys bedside this very moment father kerrigan told him shed cut off her arm rather than move from that spot before i return you have seen keriia today the khan said to janet he is well she nodded but still a little weak an injury of this kind is a great shock to the whole system especially for a child a child who will be a man in another itee years an important distinction under oar customs he must then be presented to the people ready to take my place if need be that is why i am anxious that he starts oa the journey to america with as little delay as possible we must wait for another few days father kerrigan said tm sure miss tait agrees with me the khan glanced at janet and she nodded i think father kerrigan is right and weve time to spare kerim can be back within a month of the operation you know he threw his arms wide then i must bow before flie wind you play chess miss tate not very well im afraid father kerrigan considers himself a master it is my painful and frequent duty to prove otherwise indeed so the priest said pushing back his chair and rising glass of brandy in hand if your highness would be good enough to lead the way to the usual place we can get down to tag business of majaag you eat your words a pleasure the khan got to ms feet and looked enquiringly at the others gentlemen hamid glanced at drummond and sher dil billiards they both codded and cheiisg smiled across at janet which leaves miss tate and myself with the khans permission perhaps i could show her some of the treasures of the palace please do it should take me no longer than aa hour to encompass the downfall of this turbulent priest g that a fact now father kerrigan said in mock anger and they went out hamidj sher dil and drammond had their heads together for a moment something to do willi a report over the radio from indian army headquarters about patrol clashes in the ladakh area cheung joined them and janet moved to the window and looked into the garden it was very beautiful great grecianstyle jars were spaced along the terrace filled with dwarf iris and the scent of hibiscus was heavy on the night air lower down in the shadows the slender cypress trees stood like straight sentinels dark against the sky and the moon was full cheung paused beside her a startling contrast isnt it in here all the beauty in the world a garden by night beyond those walls a harsh sterile land where even mere existence is a struggle has it always been this way he nodded in the old days the tribesmen raided into india like wolves their name was a byword for cruelty but those days are gone now they must live off the land and the land has little to give can nothing be done he shrugged who knows brackenhurst may turn up with something in his survey evidence of mineral deposits worth developing perhaps the khan has his hopes but i doubt if they will come to much brackenhurst would not be the first geologist to waste his time here and yet hamid tells me the chinese government in pekin has laid claim to balpur and nepal and bhutan even parts of assam he shrugged words merely words but as a matter of interest there can be little doubt that in other times balpur was part of the chinese empire come i will show you they went back inside moved into the central hall and he opened another door the room was in dark ness janet heard the click of the switch but was totally unprepared for what followed on every side a row of glass showcases each with its own illumination sprang into view to float la the darkness but it was their contents which drew from her aa involuntary gasp of admiration they contained the most superb collection of pottery she had ever seen there were alabaster jars pale translucent and delicate glazed urns in red and black their colours as vivid as on the day they had been fired most were unmistakably chinese and others showed a distinct chinese influence there was also a collection of figurines like the one she had seen at drummoads bungalow jack has one of these she saidhe told me it was grecobuddhist thats right as youre probably aware alexander the great invaded india amazing to what extent greek culture penetrated the entire border area and yet ia india their literature doesnt evea mention his name she reached out and touched a delicate and beautiful wine jar which had been painstakingly put together piecebypiece to judge by tias network of fine lineg that covered it where was this discovered a burial mound south of the city near the river there are many such sites you must visit some of them wmle you are here there is a most interesting ruin of a buddhist temple not far from the mission breathtaking by moonlight i can recommend it he smiled charmingly and jaaet hesitating was saved by hamid who entered at that moment there you are i thought you were playing billiards she said a variation of our own a sort of kaodcoet gosj petition jack and sher dfl were too good for me mr cheung was showing me the khans collection i had no idea the chinese had so much influence in this area in ancient times god knows why he said the damned place must have beea an economic liability even in those days cheung glanced at his watch its getting late i really think i must be going i leave miss tate in your capable hands major he went out quickly and she turned to hamid with a sigh i feel rather sorry for him weve been standing here talking about the splendours of china past and he isnt even permitted to be a part of china present it must be a terrible thing to be an exile from ones own country the tragedy of the twentieth century hamid said did you like him its difficult to say he puts himself out to be pleasant but i feel that hes looking at me from behind his eyes if you know what i mean an excellent description what about sher dil a wonderful man hes so beautifully correct so she hesitated and hamid chuckled so positively british the imperial taint still lies heavy upon us sher dil was a sword of honour man at sandhurst in his day he was also a colonel in the indian army as long ago as what went wrong for many years we tried to follow the way of peace in india nehru was sure that such a neutrality would be respected by all many men like sher dil high ranking regular army officers were not so sure and said so when the army was reduced they were the first to go and so sher dil came here to command an army of seventyfive men for the khan most of them recruited in india the locals dont take kindly to uniforms he laughed but a night like thisis made for love and laughter and nothing else i will show you the delights of the garden which mr cheung has already done not with my superb efficiency they left the display room and moved out to the terrace pausing at the top of a flight of shallow steps for harold to light a cigar the moon was caught in the dark meshes of the cypress trees the night air heavy with the scent of flowers and a fountain splashed into a fish pool amongst the trees as they went down the steps her hand on his arm the hour of the dove they call it he waved a hand theatrically the time for lovers to unburden their hearts to each other they came to the fountain in the centre of the garden and she sat on the low wall that ringed the pool dabbling her hand in the water and somewhere a bird called sweetly through the night this place is like rinding the garden of eden in the wilderness how does he do it an army of gardeners and careful cultivation and the walls keep out the winds remember hamid breathed in deeply and sighed and the strange thing is that it can all die in a single night when winter comes here it strikes suddenly like a sword biting into warm flesh she gazed down into the moonlit water watching the fish nibbling gently at her trailing fingers jack told me about what happened in korea hamid raised her chin with one hand and looked into her eyes you like him dont you very much ive never met anyone quite like him hes a strange man violent and bitter and yet he can be the gentlest person fve ever known the story of my life hamid sighed what would you like to know we stopped at his bungalow this afternoon there was a girl there famia i think he called her his housekeepers daughter she seemed to hesitate and then plunged oa sls she his mistress t so thats it hamid chuckled gently and took her hands hes a grown man janet not a boy there would be something strange if he didnt feel the need for a woman occasionally now wouldnt there momentarily her hands tightened on his as anger swept through her like an uncontrollable fire and hamid touched her gently on the right cheek poor janet india makes a harsh taskmaster i think i love him you see she said in a low voice its as simple as that its never as simple as that he said solemnly and pulled her to her feet i think wed better go back while i can still remember that fact just one more thing she said is he as embittered over this korean business as he appears to be sometimes haiaid shook ms headnot really hes too intelligent to blame himself for what was really aa accident of war but he loved the navy that was ms greatest loss and what does he believe in aowt nothing at least this is what he tells himself and spends his time living dangerously working for the highest bidder to amass a fortune he chuckled gsntiy only to end by betraying all his hard won principles when he looks upon the face of suffering as he did in ladakb during the chinese invasion you like him a great deal dont you i value real friendship he said simply jack drumrnond has shown that to me many times they walked back through the garden in silence as they mounted the steps to the terrace drummond came through the windows there you are father kerrigan tmnks he should be going he doesnt like leaving kerim for too long ill run you back in the jeep til get your coat hamid told her and went inside did you win your game she asked no did you janet smiled faintlyyou couldnt be more wrong she brushed past him and went inside and drummond stood there in the halfdarkness listening to the rise and fall of the voices a cold finger of excitement moving inside him leaving his stomach hollow and empty she sat next to him on the way back father kerrigan on the other side and now and then the wind lifted the edge of her silken headscarf into drummonds face he was aware of her warmth the softness of the thigh against his the delicate perfume and gripped the wheel tightly inhaling her sweetness aware of feelings he had not experienced for a very long time the old priest kept chuckling to himself wish you could have been there the pair of you and didnt i show him itll be many a long day before he comes crowing over terence kerrigan again drummond glanced at janet and grinned as he turned the jeep into the courtyard of the mission i think he must have won ah get away with you the old man snorted as he got out of the jeep and then smiled his face dear in the moonlight a fine night for a drive drummond hesitated and janet said calmly mr cheung mentioned the ruins of a buddhist temple not far from here he seemed to think they were worth seeing by moonlight and maybe he had a point there father kerrigan slapped the side of the jeep with his bare palm os with you now and dont be late drummond took the jeep out through the entrance and turned across the moonlit plain beside the river he had taken down the canvas tilt earlier and the wind was sharp and cold carrying with it the sceat of wet earth a few minutes later they came over the edge of an escarpment and the ruins of the temple lay before them in the centre of a small plateau bare and windswept crumbling with the years he braked switched off the engine and they walked the last few yards the full moon touched the scene with a pale luminosity and the dark shadows of halfmined pillars fell across the mosaic floor like iron bars the statue of the buddha was at the far end chipped and cracked by time and the weather one arm missing but the great serene face was still complete hooded eyes staring blindly into eternity across the river janet walked towards it slowly and dnimmond paused to light a cheroot when he raised his head she was standing at the edge of ths crumbling terrace staring pensively into the night the moon was directly behind her outlining her shapely limbs through the thin silk of the dress and when she turned and looked at him she looked unreal and ethereal like some dark goddess of the night who anight away at any moment they stood like that trapped by a moment of time looking at each other and then she came forward slowly reached up and gently touched his face drummond turned his head brushing her palm with his lips and slipped his arm about her waist she leaned against him trembling a little and in the distance thunder rumbled menacingly she glanced up quickly what was that storm on the way he pointed to where sheet lightning nickered over the mountains wed better get moving she was conscious of the unnatural stillness a blanket of dark moved in from the horizon blotting out the stars as it came drummond took her hand and they ran back towards the jeep he pressed the starter and moved away immediately and in the same moment great heavy drops started to splash against the windscreen he pressed his foot flat against the boards but it was no good there was a tremendous clap of thunder overhead and the skies opened there was no time to put up the canvas tut and he crouched behind the wheel eyes narrowed against the stinging icecold rain and janet huddled at his side he drove into the courtyard at the mission braked to a halt and they scrambled out and ran up the steps to the porch the thin silken dress was plastered to her body like a second skin and she shivered uncontrollably laughing at the same time that was marvellous simply marvellous better get out of those wet things he said youll catch your death you could use a towel yourself she took his hand well go round this way father kerrigans probably gone to bed they followed the verandah to the garden at the rear where the window of her bedroom stood ajar she went in turned up the lamp and found a spare towel do what you can with that while i get changed like me to dry your back he said she gave him a quick push towards the window go on get out of here she pulled the curtain peeled off her wet clothes and towelled herself briskly still shivering after a while the shaking stopped and a warm glow spread through her body she pulled on her dressing gown tying the cord at her waist and went back outside drummond wiped the rain from his head and face and hung the towel across the rail it was bitterly cold by now and he stood there breathing deeply taking the freshness into his lungs filled with a strange inward restlessness feeling better she said quietly he turned slowly janet tate was standing a few feet away by the rail and as lightning exploded her face seemed to jump out of the night the hair like a dark curtain to her shoulders and she was beautiful that was the thing which came to him with a sense of real wonder not just attractive but beautiful and he took two stumbling steps towards her pulling her close the drumming of the rain on the corrugated iron roof increased into a solid roaring that seemed to fill her ears she was aware of his strength the arms crushing her to him and as her loose dressing gown parted his lips found her bare shoulders her breasts she leaned against him caught in a strong current there was no denying and was aware of his hands fumbling at the cord of her dressing gown as it opened she pulled away straggling frantically no jack no p he paused head slightly forward trying to see her more clearly in the halfdarkness and she pushed him away violently with both hands not this way jack im not one of your kept women for a long moment he stood there almost invisible in the shadows staring at her and then without a word he walked rapidly away as another brilliant flash of lightning illuminated the empty verandah janet turned with a dry sob went back inside and threw herself on the bed anger and frustration sweeping through her drummond had left the window of his bedroom open deliberately in spite of the cold he lay in bed propped against a pillow smoking a cigarette and thinking about janet tate as the rain drummed endlessly on the roof if that was the way she wanted it thento hell with her as he reached to stub out his cigarette in the ashtray on the locker at his bedside there was a movement by the window something stirred and famia emerged from the shadows her hair was unbound hanging to her waist and she wore a loose silken robe fastened with a scarlet sash there was a slight rustling of silk and as she moved into the narrow circle of the lamplight the robe slipped to the ground she stood there for a moment magnificent in her nakedness breasts pointed with desire hands flat against her thighs she moved forward quickly and his arms went out to enfold her crushing her softness against him he held her close staring blindly out of the open window at the night as she moaned softly digging her nails into his shoulder and after all why not this was one kind of answer and as good as any other in the darkness of the terrace the old woman listened for a moment then nodded to herself in satisfaction and crept quietly away it was close to dawn when he awakened the sweat cold on his flesh it was still raining hard outside and he hitched the blanket over his shoulders and turned into her warmth to sleep again outside the sound that had awakened him came nearer the roar of an engine thundering through the rain there was a squeal of brakes boots running across the courtyard drummond got out of bed reached for his dressing gown and padded to the window as he moved out on to the verandah tony brackenhurst stumbled on the top step and dropped to one knee his face wild and strained in the light of the porch lamp tor gods sake man what is it drummond demanded chinese troops brackenhurst gasped at howeel they overran my camp slaughtered my men chinese drummond said a patrol you mean hundreds of the bastards hundreds brackenhurst sobbed drummond stood stockstill for a moment and then pulled brackenhurst to his feet have you told anyone else about this brackenhurst shook his head no i havent had time good if word gets out too soon we might have a general panic and that plane of mine can take no more then fifteen in this kind of flying country thats what i thought brackenhurst said bet you did now this is what we do from here we go to the mission to warn father kerrigan and janet well leave them my jeep and they can follow us in with kerim as soon as theyre ready what do we do then come back to town in your land rover and break the news to the khan this might prove to him just how useless it was to rely on the border tribes for information he returned to his bedroom and dressed quickly pulling on furlined boots and his old naval flying jacket famia sat up in bed the blankets clutched to her breast and watched him when will you be back she said he took the smith wesson from a drawer checked that it was loaded and slipped a box of spare cartridges into his pocket god knows but youll bs all right you dont need me you never did he went out through the window and a moment later she heard the two engines break into life one after the other and the sound of them faded into the rain the door creaked open and the old woman crept indid you hear the girl said softly in urdu the woman nodded and pulled the blankets aside come girl there is not much time and you know what must be dons famia dressed quickly in an old pair of drummonds drill pants and a white naval sweater that dropped over her slim hips she pulled on slippers nodded to her mother and moved out on to the verandah a moment later she was running through the quiet streets head down against the rain within five minutes she came to a bungalow almost identical with drummonds ran up the steps to the verandah and knocked on the door furiously mr cheung mr cheung she called action by night it was the rain which saved brackenhurst the sudden torrential downpour which turned a normally quiet mountain stream into a brawling torrent in one place filling a dip in the road with a ford of icecold water he had spent a long hard day in the mountains on his own prospecting for ore specimens and now on his way back to his base camp at howeel the sudden rush of water gleaming white and brown in his head lights caused him to stamp hard on the brake he got out found a branch at the side of the road and poked it carefully into the water it was at least four feet deep he might be able to drive through but on the other hand if the damned thing bogged down hed had it he climbed back into the land rover and reversed to the top of the hoi switched off his headlights and returned on foot the water was cold damned cold and it swirled around his thighs numbing him to the bone he floundered forward with a curse and found dry land again thank god the camp was no more than half a mile away he trudged along the dirt road head down against the driving rain the light from his electric torch reaching into the darkness somewhere up ahead he seemed to hear a cry and then another confused shouting and the dull flat report of a gunshot muffled by the rain a second later came the deadly staccato of a machine gun he stood at the top of a small rise a slight frown oa his face as he looked down through the pine trees at the flickering light of the campfire there was a flurry of movement the noise of vehicles a shouted command ha moved off the road and went down through the trees cautiously until he was ao more thaa twenty or thirty yards away from the camp but above it on the hfflsids the hollow was alive with chinese troops little stocky peasants in quilted uniforms and peaked caps shining burp guns in their hands and the heart seemed to freeze inside him he could see two of ms men galur and old abdul standing beside the fire hands raised high in the air there was the sudden roll of an automatic weapon and abdul fell back across the fire galur turned burst through the ring of men and ran for the trees head down for a moment it seemed that he might make it and then a burst from a submachine gun drove him on to his knees the soldiers were calling excitedly to each other as they started to search the tents more and more of them pressed into the camp and with a sudden roar a troop carrier came down the road followed by another and yet another halftracks at the rear for mountain warfare instead of wheels brackenhurst had seen enough he turned and scrambled back up the hill from somewhere to his left there was a cry and a bullet passed through the trees severing a branch he put down his head and ran faster one arm raised before ms face to ward off flailing branches a moment later he floundered across the ford and staggered up the hill to the land rover the engine was still warm and it burst into life with a surge of power when he pressed the starter he reversed quickly the tyres skidded for a moment searching for a grip on the soft crumbling edge of the track and then they found it and he drove away rapidly sitting at the whesl of the land rover in the courtyard of the mission and remembering what had happened at howeel brackenhurst shivered involuntarily he could hear the rise and fall of voices and looked put again at father kerrigan at drummond standing in the doorway the old priest holding a lamp in one hand after a moment father kerrigan went back inside closing the door and drummond ran down the steps and scrambled into the passenger seat right lets get moving what did the old man have to say brackenhurst asked as lie drove away what could he say hes going to pack up as fast as he can and follow on in the jeep with janet and the boy no sense in staving to face whats coming you know what they do to people like him what do you think the khan will do what in the hell can he do except get out he hasnt got a defence pact with india which means theyre going to sit tight on their side of the border and if i know them the chinese will be smart enough to go just that far and no further but why brackenhurst demanded what in the hell can they possibly want with a dump like this theres nothing here thats worth having you could say the same about the aksai chien and the ladakh but they moved in there and for the same reason prestige a paper victory the glorious army of the peoples republic takes back what was part of the chinese empire a thousand years ago the fact that balpur is a few thousand square miles of the most sterile territory on gods earth doesnt matter itll take the peoples mind off the bad harvest back home as they drove through the deserted streets the sky was beginning to lighten over the mountains and beyond the scattered flatroofed houses grey and sombre the river roared through the valley gwollea by the rain later at the palace waiting for the khan in the room where they had dined in what now seemed another age another time drummond opened the french windows and stood on the terrace in the rain listening the khan was taking his time but when he came in he was wearing a khaki drill uniform the medals above the left hand pocket a splash of vivid colour in the grey morning the major domo to whom drummond had given the original message followed him with a decanter of brandy and glasses on a silver tray the khan had dropped twenty years and there was a new vitality in his step it seemed to me that a drink might be in order gentlemen if what ahmed has told me is anywhere near the truth it may well be some considerable time before we have another the major domo filled three glasses passed them round and left the room the khan toasted them silently now mr brackenhurst perhaps you would be good enough to tell me in your own words exactly what happened at howeel when brackenhurst had finished the old man turned to drummond what do you think i dont understand it drummond said last time i was up there there was nothing not a damned thing but that was ten days ago now am i right what are you going to do tm not sure first i must confer with colonel sher dil and major hamid i have sent messengers already telling them both to meet me urgently at army headquarters seventyfive men drummond said they wont go far and you cant rely on the tribesmen theyll simply take to the hills and stay out of trouble and i dont think the indian army will interfere a pessimistic view but a correct one i fear how many can your plane take not more than fifteen in this kind of country ive got to get over those mountains remember and if were going we must go quickly once the people get hold of the news well have a howling mob running for the airstrip father kerrigans the only other person ive told so far we called at the mission and left my jeep hes going to pack up as quickly as he can and follow us in with kerim and miss tate the khan nodded good my soa must certainly be saved at all costs then by my reckoning that gives us a possible passenger list consisting of yourself kerim father kerrigan miss tate brackenhurst here and major hamid colonel sher dil too of course if he wants to come what about cheung brackenhurst put in i was forgetting him drummond turned to the khan your highness is probably well aware of mr cheungs true politics god alone knows what the reds would do if they got their hands on him the major domo returned and handed the khan a polished leather belt and holster containing a heavy british army service revolver he belted it around hi waist and smiled grimly then i think it is time to move gentlemen you may drop me at colonel sher dils headquarters i suggest you then continue on to the airstrip and prepare the plane for immediate takeoff outside it was even lighter now the sky a heavy uniform grey the rain turning the dirt road into a quagmire as they drove down through the streets to the main square braking to a halt outside the grim barracklike building that was sher oils headquarters there was already a bustle of activity and as the khan got out the colonel came down the steps to meet him major hamid at his shoulder the pathan glanced enquiringly at drummond who held his thumb down and brackenhurst drove away quickly beyond the city one or two tents were pitched a sock of heavy mountain sheep crowding in close to where a herdsmans fire already trailed grey smoke into the morning they bounced over the rutted track skidding slightly in the mud and went over the escarpment and dowa towards the airstrip the cprrugated iron hangar looked ugly and forsaken in the grey morning and brackenhurst braked to a halt a few yards away and nodded towards the airstrip itself already a sea of mud not much of a surface to take off on anything will do for a beaver drummond said thats why theyre so good for this kind of country he took out his key unlocked the padlock and pulled the doors wide revealing the red and gold plane and a quiet precise voice said excellent my friend now move away please cheung came round the corner of the building an automatic pistol in one hand in the other he held a grenade going somewhere jack that was the general idea drummond slipped his hands casually into the slanting pockets of his flying jacket fingers closing around the butt of the smith wesson what is this fauna moved from behind one of the doors and stood at cheungs shoulder looking faintly ridiculous in drummonds sweater which was by now so sodden and heavy with rain that it almost reached her knees well ill be damned he said cheung smiled gently no one is going anywhere jack it was not in the plan in one quick movement he pulled the ring from the grenade with his teeth and tossed it inside the hangar in the same moment drummond pulled the smith wesson from his pocket and loosed off a wild shot that splintered the door behind cheungs head sending him running for cover drummond turned and ran brackenhurst was already scrambling behind the wheel of the land rover as the engine roared into life the grenade exploded hot air reached out to enfold drummond and the entire hangar seemed to sag as he jumped in the land rover shot away wheels churning the mud to liquid cheung moved into the open firing steadily the gun held in both hands with all the expertise of the marksman brackenhurst took the land rover into a gully that slanted up the hillside giving them some kind of cover and a moment later the beavers fuel tank blew up and i hope thats taken the bastard with it he shouted they roared out of the gully on to a plateau which jutted like a shelf from the side of the mountain and gave a view of the plain below cheung was standing a little distance away from the burning hangar looking up towards them and the girl lay face down in the mud a yard or two away from him drummond was conscious of nothing no anger no pain there was no time to wonder about what had happened or why survival was the thing from now on the only thing that mattered brackenhurst braked on the edge of the plateau seeking the safest way down and beneath them the town was spread out like a map already people were stirring moving in the streets in spite of the heavy rain bad news travels fast drummond said in the square outside headquarters there was considerable activity three trucks moved up and parked outside and the drivers got down and stood in a small knot obviously discussing what was happening somewhere drummond was conscious of the noise dulled by the rain and then brackenhurst screamed and pointed up into the sky to where a couple of planes flew out of the grey morning side by side turned and broke formation spiralling down like leaves falling from the branches of a tree the leading jet roared down the valley beside the river banking so close to the mountain that for one frozen moment drummond was able to distinguish the red stars on the wings god in heaven chinese migs brackenhurst cried la the town below there were cries of alarm people were standing in groups looking up at the sky and as they scattered to run the leading mig swooped and fired its rockets ploughing a double furrow across the square and scoring a direct hit on the first truck in line outside sher dils headquarters the trucks petrol tank exploded and debris and flames cascaded outwards to enfold the panicstricken people who ran past the second mig came in fast rockets ploughing into the other two trucks and the flimsy mud and wattle houses beyond as it swooped up into the grey morning the leader was already banking turning in to make ms second run he roared down rockets hammering into the closely packed houses and scored a direct hit on the ammunition store on the other side of sher oils headquarters a tremendous explosion sent a column cf flame shooting up through the dark pall of smoke that was already enveloping the town as the second mig followed the other in fast lets get moving drummond slapped bracken hurst on the shoulder brackenhurst turned his face very white eyes staring down there you must be mad drummond didnt argue he dragged brackenhurst across the seat and scrambled into his place behind the wheel he took the land rover down the steep hillside and across the plain and the smoke enveloped them so that he had to drive blind for several moments swerving as a halfruined house loomed out of the gloom they bounced across a tangled mass of timber and masonry and turned into the main square a man ran out of the swirling darkness his petrolsoaked body flaming like a torch he vanished in the direction of the river someone screamed monotonously above the crackling of the flames and ammunition started to explode the land rover crunched across a burned and blackened body and drummond braked hard the screaming had stopped and the silence was somehow intensified by the crackling of the flames on this side of the square there was hardly a house standing and one end of sher oils headquarters was a heap of rubble as drummond jumped to the ground hamid staggered out of the entrance and leaned against the wall at the top of the steps gasping for air his uniform smouldering in several places drumtnond ran up the steps and caught him as he started to fall easy does it ive got you what about the khan there was blood on hamids right cheek and he wiped it away mechanically i dont know inside somewhere the place is a bloody shambles as brackenhurst came up the steps to join them the migs came down the valley again they grabbed hamid between them and ran as they staggered in through the door and hit the floor cannon fire ripped up the surface of the square again fragments of stone rattling against the shattered windows drummond lay against the wall and waited while the earth trembled two soldiers sprawled on their faces in the centre of the room and brackenhurst crouched ia the far corner eyes wide and staring the firing ceased as quickly as it had begun and the migs faded into the distance leaving only the smoke and the flames and the ruins behind drummond got up and helped hamid to his feet and brackenhurst joined them when he spoke his voice shook a little weve got to get out of here drummond weve got to get moving drummond ignored him and turned to hamid who was leaning against the wall shaking his head from side to side like a wounded bull where was tlie khan when the attack began something clicked in hamids eyes and he took deep breath in the radio room through here the door was off its hinges and the room beyond was a shambles four or five meni dead or badly wounded lay sprawled amid the wreckage and colonel sher dil knelt by the window the khan in his arms in one corner the wireless operator still crouched by us seat earphones in place sher dil was covered in dust his uniform singed and torn but he seemed otherwise unharmed drummond dropped on one knee beside him and looked down at the khan the front of the old warriors uniform was soaked in blood and when he opened his eyes death stared out he gazed uncomprehendingly at drummond for a moment and then his eyes seemed to clear he reached put one bloodstained hand and held on tight his mouth opening and closing as he tried to speak kerim he croaked you will save kerim your word on it its all right drummond said i give you my word well get the boy to safety i promise you the hand tightened on the front of his flying jacket there was a hollow rattling in the khans throat and blood erupted in a sudden flow between his lips drummond forced the bloodstained fingers apart and sher dil laid the khan gently down on his back the colonel removed his tattered tunic and covered the face and drummond stood up and turned to hamid any sign of the party from the mission hamid shook his head as brackenhurst stepped in through the shattered doorway the land rovers still intact thank god at least weve got transport i hope that bastard cheung rots in hell hamid turned to drummond whats he talking about it seems our good friend cheung was working for the opposition all along he got to the plane with a grenade before the migs came in but we checked him out with formosa hamid said he was a nationalist agent there can be no doubt about that they communicated with him regularly we looked the other way for obvious reasons but we knewall about it probably a double agent brummond said and toned to sher dil if you heard that youll know were on our own and its one hell of a step to the border have you managed to contact the indian army yet no but the operators still trying there was the sound of sporadic gun e and they all turned and looked out of the window a current of warm air had momentarily snatched away the veil of smoke revealing a small sugar loaf hill on the other side of the town people were running towards the river refugees from the townmen women and children a few herdsmen on horseback their panicstricken flocks rushing this way and that getting ia everyones way a second later the top of the hil was alive with troops in drab quilted uniforms they started to firr as they swept oa and the screams of the mob rose into the air like the smoke as they started to fall the tidal wave surged oa the soldiers calling to each other like hounds in full cry running down the hill towards sadar and hie pall of smoke dropped back into place hamid turned to sher dil weve got perhaps five minutes before they get here you must contact indian army headquarters a section of the roof crashed through into the room scattering same and sparks and as hamid and drummond ran forward to stamp it out brackenhurst rushed outside a second later the engine of the land rover roared into life when drummond reached the door it was already disappearing into the smoke hamid cursed savagely and went back inside and drummond stayed there listening to the sound of the land rover fade into the distance aware of the wireless operators excited voice as he finally contacted indian army headquarters the smoke swirled around him touched with crimson and the sicklysweet stench of burning flesh was everywhere in the great heat things seemed to lack definition and nothing was real any more a bullet splintered the wooden framework of the door and several chinese ran out of the smoke he ducked inside as hamid appeared at a shattered window and emptied a sten gun driving them back into the smoke sher dil turned from the radio and dropped the hand mike he had been using from the sound of things wed better get moving every man for himself and try to get across the river theres a village called bandong ten miles due south on the load well meet there the rear door led into a fenced yard it was strangely quiet and the smoke hung low ia the heavy rain reducing visibility considerably the wireless operator climbed up on the fence and swung a leg over there was a sudden cry and a group of chinese appeared about forty yards to the left several of them fired at once and he screamed and fell backwards into the yard clutching his face sher dil scrambled through a gap in the fence and started up the slope and drummond went after him weaving desperately from side to side as the chinese continued to fire he was aware of hamid hard on his heels of sher dil disappearing over the rim of the escarpment he could taste blood in his mouth as he clawed his way up slipping on the wet earth and then the jagged rocks on the skyline loomed above him he went over the top head down sobbing for breatihi and tripped over aa outstretched foot he had one brief impression of sher be sliding down the steep slope of shale to the river below picking himself up at the bottom and plunging into the water and then they moved out of the swirling smoke to surround him small and misshapen in their quilted uniforms each carrying a rifle that seemed too large for him an oldfashioned sword bayonet on the end hamid was lying on the ground a few yards away and a soldier stood over him a foot on his neck drumraond backed against a boulder and the brown peasant faces moved in on him edge of the sword the town gaol was one of the few major buildings left undamaged by the attack and from the small cell on the comer of the second floor drummond had an interesting view of the city through the barred window it was am four hours since the initial attack but smoke still drifted across the stricken city through the heavy rain and a heavy grey mist moved up from the river and crouched at the end of the streets it was unbelievably cold and rain drifted in a fine spray through the bars as drummond dropped to the ground its going to be aa early winter this year i feel it in my bones tor us a matter cf academic interest only hamid said from his bunk you think so there was e sullen chatter of a machine gun from down by the river and hamid smiled bleakly theres your answer nothing like cutting down on the opposition they havent stopped since this morning then why have they let us last this long why the special treatment there was no time for a reply a key grated in the lock the door opened and a small sergeant stepped in flanked by two privates armed with submachine guns hamid got to his feet and the sergeant shook his head not you this one they pushed drummond into the corridor before he had a chance to say anything and the door clanged into place with a grim finality the sergeant turned without a word and started along the corridor and drummond followed the two privates bringing up the rear they mounted a flight of stone steps to the top floor and halted outside a door the sergeant knocked listened for a moment and then led the way in the room had once been the governors office thc walls were hung with bohara rugs sheepskias covered the floor and logs burned in the large stone firepkce a chinese officer stared down into the fire one foot on the hearth and tapped his booted leg with a leather swagger stick impatiently the heavy greatcoat wife the fur collar which swung from his shoulders carried the epaulets of a full colonel he turned and examined drummoad calmly tota dont look too good jack no thanks to you you bastard nothing personal jack we just happen to be on different sides regrettable but true what are you military intelligence thats right am i allowed to ask for how long youve been making a monkey out of them back on formosa tve never been to formosa cheung said the nationalists did have an agent called cheung and they did send him on a mission to nikkim he got as far as singapore i took his place from there what about the guns i flew into tibet and moro and his boys all that was a fake too i suppose an elaborate pretence which enabled me to communicate constantly with my superiors to help pave the way for the regaining of what has always been legally a part of the chinese empire by the army of the peoples republic i can do without the speeches drummond said where did famia fit in she and her mother were of no particular importance i paid them well to keep me informed of your movements you speak in the past tense only where famia is concerned she was struck in the head by a piece of sharpnel back at the airstrip remembering the months of pretence drummond dismissed her with no particular regret do you really think youre going to get away with this why not cheung said india will not interfere she is interested only in maintaining the status quo and the two countries have never had a mutual defence pact in the united nations there will be an emergency session they will talk far into the night and do precisely nothing no one wants to rock the boat jack a phrase you taught me youve got it afl nicely worked out havent you except for one rather important detail the khan is dead which is something of a convenience but these are a superstitious people and to them the khan is priest as well as king prince kerim can be his only successor and as such an obstacle to the setting up of a peoples republic not at all cheung smiled briefly with our guidance he could be of great help to his people he could jead them along the true path now fvs heard everything drummond said good then perhaps you will be sensible enough to help me in this matter after all you always did have aa eye to the main chance where is the boy drummond stared at him in astonishmentyi mean you dont know he is not at the mission neither are father kerrigan not the american girl my men have spent hours checking the crowds and searching the immediate area of the city and you expect me to help know you went straight to the mission from your bungalow after brackenhurgt brought you news of the invasion famia told me drummond decided to take refuge in tiie truth thafs right we left my jeep and told father kerrigan to pack up as quickly as possible and meet us at the airstrip your mea moved too fast for him i suppose but brackenhurst also is proving difficult to locate you arranged an alternative plan in case of trouble i know you jack i know how your mind works can i go now you might find it wiser to cooperate i could things easier for you do me a favour for gods sake drummond said thats like a line from a bad play colonel cheung stared at him apparently calm the leather swagger stick beating against his right boot all right take him away sergeant he said abruptly in chinese bring the other one drummond paused in the doorway and shook his head now you really are wasting your time he said chinese headquarters had been set up at the palace and the commanding officer general ho tsen stood on the terrace and looked out over the garden he seemed far from happy and paced up and down impatiently there was a slight cough from behind and he turned to fold cheung standing in the window you have found him he demanded eagerly tm afraid not general ho tsen slammed a hand hard down on the balustrade this is your direct responsibility colonel i expected to find the boy ready and waiting when i arrived it seems that the priest and the american girl left the mission with the boy shortly before our men arrived weve confirmed this by questioning herdsmen at a camp up river ive just had a report that their jeep has been found abandoned ten miles north of here at a village called quala there was a vehicle ferry there which has apparently been destroyed so im assuming theyve crossed by boat a land rover belonging to the man brackenhurst has been found in the same place has the patrol gone after them unfortunately there were no other boats the village was quite deserted obviously the entire population had crossed over since then the level of the water has risen with the rains there any place where the river may be crossed with vehicles certainly not here the current was always too swift for a ferry cheung spread out a map on a wrought iron table twenty miles north of here at kama the river is very wide and shallow there we could cross in halftracks his finger traced a line to the border there is only one road to india and they have no transporfrasember we should catch them easily they must stay on the road the priest is an old man and in any case with the woman and the boy he couldnt hope to get through the mountains on foot by any other route ho tsen nodded hope so for your sake pekin will not be pleased if you fail i w also send other patrols south on this side of the river in troop carriers they should find boats sooner or later once across they can proceed on foot and cut the road ahead of you an excellent idea ho tsen put a cigarette in his mouth and leaaed to the match cheung offered one thing worriesme what if the priest had an alternative plan perhaps a vehicle waiting on the other side it would explain why they did not drive north to kama and attempt to cross in the jeep this man drummond you spoke of yon are certain he knows nothing he is a difficult man to be sure of and tko pa aa is as stubborn as the breed usually are yu have exhausted the accepted methods they take time general and in any case drummond must be preserved for a more searching examination in pekin why is this he is known to have worked for british intelligence i see cheung hesitated i would like to have one last try before leaving in case they do have information of value a small subterfuge which often has remarkable results which sounds interesting general ho tsen said think i shall accompany you colonel let us hope fm not wasting my tune the wind across the river was like a bayonet in the back and drummond shivered as it cut into him he flexed his hands to ease his cramped muscles and winced with pain as the wire that was twisted about his wrists bit into his flesh hamid was next to him and on the other side one of sher oils soldiers in tattered uniform was silently weeping every few moments the man coughed and a trickle of blood came from his mouth after a while he slumped on his face and lay motionless the guards standing talking a few yards away took no notice two troop carriers halftracks biting into the mud drove up and parked thirty or forty yards away each containing a dozen men and a heavy machine gun mounted on a pivot drummond eased back on to his heels and looked along the line of kneeling men there were at least thirty of them mostly sher dils soldiers with a few tribesmen whod been caught carrying weapons in his minds eye he saw them keel over one by one as the machine gun curved in an arc and finally reached him and he shuddered a jeep drove up and parked behind the troop carriers and hamid said quickly weve got company jack cheung walked across the broken ground towards them general ho tsen at his side they paused a few yards away and the general said calmly these are the men cheung nodded they both speak chinese excellent the general came closer let us not waste any more time gentlemen i find this rain most unpleasant we wish to know the whereabouts of the catholic priest and the young khan if you are sensible and help us i will see that you are well treated if not drummqnd and hamid stared up at him without speaking and cheung sighed with exasperation youre a damned fool jack he said in english you always were weve found the jeep at quala which means theyve crossed the river they wont get far i promise you he and the general turned and walked back to the troop carriers ho tsen climbed into the shelter of the jeep and cheung looked up at the sergeant who stood beside the heavy machine gun in the first troop carrier you have your orders stop firing when you reach the indian and the englishman if you harm either of them til have your head he climbed into the jeep beside the general and ho tsen smiled and offered him a cigarette you were quite right colonel this should prove most interesting drummond stared at the sodden earth numb with cold and waited for what was to come he wondered about father kerrigan and janet and the boy somewhere on the other side of the river in the mist and prayed that the old man would have the sense to keep on the move but the indian border was a long way oflj all of three hundred miles a burst of shrill girlish laughter came from the chinese and he stiffened they strutted towards the line of prisoners their thin voices birdlike on the wind and dnunmond dropped his head and waited a boot thudded into his chest and he rolled on his face and fought for breath the wire was torn from his wrists and a kick in the side drove him to his feet the chinese soldier grinned amiably and held out a spade drummond glanced once at hamid and they started to dig the soil was soft and sandy and lifted easily beside them the other prisoners worked silently and as drummond bent to his task he knew with a feeling of utter hopelessness that it wouldnt take very long the rain increased into a heavy downpour and the chinese turned and ran to the shelter of their vehicles leaving one man on guard a submachine gun crooked in one arm the trench was now a couple of feet down and drummond wondered how deep they wanted it six feet was the statutory requirement for a grave back home but it was unlikely that the chinese bothered about such niceties he leaned on his spade for a moment and hamid moved closer i dont suppose weve got much longer drummond said hamid glanced once over his shoulder at the mist rolling up from the river not if i can help it any good at the hundred yard dash jack drummond frowned in bewilderment what in the hell are you talking about this hamid said crisply and slapped mm heavily in the face as drummond staggered back momentarily dazed the guard hurried across to see what the disturbance was about he leaned over the trench the submachine gun pointed threateningly and hamid swung the edge of the spade against his neck the man fell into the trench without a sound the rain was now a heavy grey curtain that almost shrouded them from the troop carriers and the jeep hamid snatched up the guards submachine gun scrambled out of the trench and ran towards the river drummond went after him slipping and stumbling in the mud behind him he heard a cry and glanced over his shoulder the other prisoners were strung out in a ragged line running for dear life beyond them the first chinese had already reached the trench firing as they advanced and one of the troop carriers heavy machine guns opened up above then heads the river was very close now and he increased his pace as he smelled water a bullet plucked at his heel and he tripped and fell heavily hamid was beside him in an instant he dragged him to his feet and together they stumbled down the slope to the water the river was in a sullen angry mood it ran smoothly through the heavy rain but sudden swirls on the surface indicated dangerous currents and the speed with which tree branches drifted by argued against any attempt to reach the other side there was a rattle of stones and earth behind and one of sher dils soldiers ran past his face purple with effort so that a scar which stretched from one eye to the corner of his mouth gleamed whitely he plunged into the water and began to swim furiously in a few moments the swift current had carried him out of sight into the heavy rain others followed some bleeding from wounds crying with fear as they stumbled down the slope and flung themselves into the river they wont last five minutes hamid shouted the water must be near freezing a bullet landed at their feet showering them with dirt he turned as four chinese appeared at the top of the slope and swung the submachine gun in a wide arc firing from the hip two of them crumpled to the ground as their companions dropped behind an outcrop of rock several more appeared on the skyline and hamid drove them back with a long burst that emptied the gun as one of the troop carriers came into view hamid tossed the useless weapon to one side and they ran into the river and splashed through the shallows towards a line of dense thorny bushes that grew down into the water bullets churned around them and then they were waist deep and hidden by the rain the water was bitterly cold and drummond could feel it eating its way into his bones they could hear the cries of the soldiers coming nearer and began to move further downstream aided by the strong current the land curved out for about fifty yards making a natural breakwater imprisoning a floating mass of smashed trees and branches they pushed towards it and the current taking pity on them swept them into the safety of the floating jungle they rested side by side holding the branches of a tree gasping for breath voices came from the shore and half a dozen soldiers appeared pushing their way through the bushes along the waters edge they were no more than ten yards away from the shore and through the branches drummond could see the chinese clearly the peaked caps pulled down over the eyes the red star prominent the shining burp guns and rubber kneelength boots the breathless minutes passed slowly and the cold gradually numbed their limbs the soldiers appeared to be having a conference after a while they split into pairs and disappeared into the driving rain now what drummond said only one thing for it hamid said his lips blue with the cold well have to try to get across on one of these logs theyll be swarming around like flies on this side of the river we wouldnt last five minutes he let go of the tree and splashed to the next one progressing slowly through the floating mass and drummond followed when they reached the edge they found a krge tree that was already swinging out into the river straining to be free hamid pulled himself into the branches and drummond said til try to guide it from the other end he lifted a foot from the water and pushed against the next tree there was a snapping of branches and the tree lifted into the current in a few moments they were drifting rapidly away and the floating mass of trees and the promontory disappeared into the mist drummond soon found that it was impossible to guide the tree it went with the current and his feeble kicking had no effect he gave up the struggle and tried to heave himself into a more secure position but his frozen limbs refused to help him he trailed helplessly through the water arms hooking over a projecting branch and gradually all discomfort and pain left him when cheung scrambled up the steep bank from the rivers edge he found general ho tsen still sitting in the front of the jeep a cigarette in a long jade holder between his teeth well the general demanded cheung seemed tired as yet there is no sign of them general a small subterfuge which often leads to remarkable results said ho tsea wasnt tliat what you promised mst cheung wiped rain from his face mechanically what can i say nothing ho tsen told him that would be much better as it happens in such weather it is more than likely that drummond and his friend are akeady floating face down somewhere out there in the flood in any case i shall take charge here colonel take your men and go north to kama cross the river and bring me back the young khan he paused and neatly ejected the end of his cigarette from the holder when he looked up again his eyes were cold without him there would be little point in returning at all you follow me cheuag stood there in the rain staring at him for a moment his face quite white he seemed to pull himself together saluted turned and clambered up beside the driver of the first troop carrier a moment later the two vehicles moved up the slope their tracks spurning file wet earth and disappeared into the mist forced march vaguely through his numbed mind drummond became aware that something was digging into him after a while he realised that another large tree had drifted into them they floated together branches intertwined their combined weight considerably slowing down the speed at which they were travelling hamid was still secure in ms perch amongst the branches and after a while he called can see the other side the river must be narrowing drummond turned his head through the torrential rain the opposite bank was just visible and it seemed to draw nearer every moment the water became rougher and trees and flotsam of every description raced through the whitecapped waves suddenly the bank was very close and seemed to increase in size as the river churned through a deeper and narrowing channel there was a sickening bodyshaking jar and the tree grounded drummond heard a cry and saw hamid flung into the water he unhooked his cramped limbs and found that he could stand waist deep he forced his way along pushed by the current and caught hamid by the belt before the river took him there was a crashing sound behind and as he turned the trees were lifted by a sudden swell of the water and swept away again the water boiled around them as they braced themselves against the current slowly they forced their way to the steeply shelving banks and scrambled to temporary safety they lay face down their battered bodies heaving as they retched up river water after a while they got to their feet and clambered up the mud bank away from the river they stood looking across the river through the mist listening hamid was shaking with cold his uniform moulded to his body although strangely enough his turban was still intact sooner or later theyll get men across by boat he said theyre bound to find an odd one or two missed by the refugees but theyll be on foot just like us drummond reminded him the nearest place they have a hope of crossing with vehicles is kama and thats twenty miles north from here the shallows there could well be impassable because of the rain well one thing is certain hamid said with a savage grin theres only one road out to india and theres only one way were going to get to it they began to walk south through the rain slowly because the ground was fast turning into a quagmire drummond found it an effort to lift one foot in front of the other and after a while found himself falling behind the hardy hiliman they moved into a grey impenetrable mist that shrouded them completely from the outside world nothing existed now except the two of them and the rain and drummond stumbled on through the mud wondering what he was doing here and where it was all going to end it was perhaps half an hour later that he became aware that hamid was calling to him he was standing on top of a small hill about fifty yards away when drummond joined him he saw a herdsmans hut in a small hollow below there was no sign of life and they moved cautiously down into the hollow drummond didnt feel tired any more he didnt feel anything he knew he was alive and that was about all it was a poor place of mud and wattle construction and a thin tracer of smoke lifted through a hole in the straw roof hamid opened the door and led the way in the fire on the stone hearth was banked with earth and smoke drifted in a heavy layer against the ceiling it was filthy and it smelled and drummond knew the place was very probably lousy with fleas as well but it was warm and dry and at the moment that was all that mattered he raked the soil from the fire and brought wood from a pile in one corner hamid rummaged amongst the sheepskins at the back and came up with a couple of stone jars he brought them to the fire with a grin goafs mhk and cheese pretty rancid but good for the constitution at the moment i could face anything except going out there in these wet clothes again drummond said he built the fire into a great roaring pyramid and hamid gave the sheepskins a shake god alone knows what well get from this lot but it didnt matter nothing mattered except that it was warm and the fire was hot on the skin drummond crouched there watching the steam rise from his clothessuspended from the ridge pole a sheepskia around his shoulders and after a while he slept he awakened slowly and stared through the dim grey light at his clothes hanging from the ridge pole of the hut wondering where he was after a while he remembered and sat up hamid squatted on the other side of the fire he was wearing his uniform again and grinned how do you feel bloody awful drummond stretched his arms and blood started to flow through cramped limbs how long have we been here a couple of hours thats ah must be about two oclock wed better get moving your clothes are pretty dry by now better than they were anyway drummond started to dress and hamid peered outside from the looks of it this rain is never going to stop i think itll turn to snow before it does as if we havent got enough to worry about hamid shrugged the weather should help if anything it makes things just as difficult for the chinese drummond moved to the entrance zipping up the front of ms flying jacket and looked out the rain was lancing into the earth with steady force and a slight mist rising from the cold ground combined with it to reduce visibility to a few yards i think youre right about the snow which means weve got to move fast we cant be more than seven or eight miles from the road anyone else who got across the river is bound to move in the same direction theyve no other choice youre thinking of father kerrigan and janet or sher dil but the chinese will follow the same route once they get across and we must keep ahead of them if we can only reach the village sher dh mentioned bandong and get horses we might stand a chance he picked up a couple of sheepskins and tossed one to drummond better wear that over your shoulders itll keep out some of the rain in the same moment he drew back from the entrance a finger to his mouth and dropped to one knee they crouched side by side soundless and waiting at first there was only the savage drumming of the rain and then drummond heard it a slipping stumbling sound of feet trailing through the wet ground outside as the steps approached the hut and paused hamid launched himself through the entrance there was a sudden splashing through the mud outside the sound of a blow drummond went after him fists ready but there was no need hamid stood over the huddled figure of a man who crouched in the mud he grabbed a handful of hair and jerked the head back savagely a great scar ran from the mans right eye to the corner of his mouth the tattered remnants of a khaki uniform with corporals stripes on the right sleeve still clung to ms wiry body its the one who plunged into the river ahead of us drummond said you remember hes one of sher dils men the mans face split into a wide impudent grinyou know me major hamid ahmed hussein corporal in number one section his english was almost perfect but with a slight singsong accent drummoad sahib i have seen many times hamid started to laugh i know this one all right one of the greatest rogues youll ever meet in your life an old indian army man khyber rifles wasnt it thats right sahib ahmed got to his feet and indicated the row of medal ribbons above his left breast dcm from king george himself sahib probably bought in the bazaar at peshawar hamid said but hes an afridi theyre good fighting men they went outside and ahmed crouched over the fire warming his hands what are we going to do with him drummond said we cant afford to wait for him to dry oe no need sahib ahmed picked lip another sheepskin this will do fine the cold is nothing to me hardship is nothing he grinned hugely tm an afridi which also means liar cheat and rogue hamid said theres goats cheese in one of the jars if youre hungry youll have to carry it with you and eat oa the way where do we go sahib to the road where else the road out of this accursed country colonel sher dil told us to meet at bandong if we managed to cross the river do you know it about eight miles south sahib i take you there when they climbed out of the hollow drummond paused for a moment and looked down at the small hut the smoke rising into the air somehow it represented security and safety and now he was moving into the unknown again he shivered and hurried after his two companions for the first quarter of a mile ahmed trailed at the rear scooping handfuls of the soft cheese from the jar devouring it avidly with groans of delight finally he tossed the jar to one side and ran ahead to take the lead drummond kept a pace or two behind hamid the world was a few cubic feet covered on all sides by walls and a ceiling of mist and rain and they were the only inhabitants they had been marching for about half an hour when he stumbled into hamid who grabbed bis arm listen for a moment ahmed joined them and they stood in a small group strange figures in their sheepskins streaming with ram and somehow symbolic like a piece of modern sculpture i thought i heard firing hamid said and at that moment it sounded again a faint echo to the west sounded like a machine gun drummond said again there was a faint deadly echo of small arms fire and then there was silence probably back across the river hamid said were still moving parallel with it remember but i think one of us should scout ahead from now on will go sahib ahmed said with a grin and ran into the mist they commenced to march again drummonds senses were on the alert for danger at first but gradually he succumbed to his surroundings there was a safety an anonymity about the rain and the mist that was vaguely comforting he withdrew into himself an old trick forgot about fatigue discomfort the danger of his present situation he didnt even feel fear when ahmed suddenly emerged from the mist and ran towards them hamid grabbed hold of the afridi and steadied him what is it there is a village up ahead sahib good lead the way he walked into the mist and they followed him drummond found that he was sweating a little the ground sloped and then dipped suddenly as they descended into a large hollow the houses loomed out of the mist there were no more than six of them poor mean places of mud and wattle like the herdsmans hut scattered alongside the banks of a small stream they went forward quickly and drommond was aware of the acrid smell of woodsmoke on the damp air ahmed opened the first door and went in he reappeared a moment later empty sahib everything gone he ran along the line of huts opening the crude wooden doors and finally came back to meet them despondently picked clean sahib picked clean hamid looked in through the door of the nearest house at the embers of the fire which still glowed on the hearth i said bad news travels fast didnt i theyve gone every last one of them horses livestock the lot taken to the hills i suppose to wait things out and see what happens ahmed looked at them enquiringlywe move on now nothing for us here thats right ahmed drummond said nothing for us here they moved up out of the hollow and started to march again the rainsoaked earth made the going very heavy and the ground itself was boulderstrewn and very difficult so that they had to pick their way with care gradually a change became noticeable the air seemed colder and drifted steadily into their faces and the ground began to slope steeply they paused to take stock of the situation we must be coming to the edge of the rift valley hamid said and that means the road cant be far away we should cut across it in another mile or so they started to make their way down the hillside the ground began to fall away until at times they were compelled to climb very carefully feeling for handholds finally they found themselves on the lower slopes and the going was easier over rough mosscovered ground ahmed moved ahead again and was soon lost to sight for as they descended through the rain the mist became thicker until visibility was almost nil it was drummond who heard the motor he stopped quickly and called to hamid they both stood there on the hillside listening and heard the sound of truck engines ahmed came running out of the mist bandong just below in the valley sahib he said to hamid four trucks stopping there big ones sahib i think they are ours what do you mean ours drummond said army trucks sahib convoy from india making its way to sadar hes right drummond said td forgotten about that dont they make the run once a month only one difficulty hamid said if it is the usual convoy to sadar then its going in the wrong direction not if theyd heard whats happened they covered the rest of the distance quickly running and sliding down the slippery slopes until they came to a boulderfilled stream bed on the other side they scrambled up on to a dirt road and ahmed motioned them to silence as a flatroofed house loomed out of the mist bandong he whispered the truck engines had stopped and the whole world seemed to have died with them a vague unease stirred in drummond and then he heard the voice the rough familiar irish voice and ran forward between the houses scattered on either side of the road four trucks were drawn up in a line old bedford threetenners pointing south towards india father kerrigan stood bareheaded in the rain talking to a tribesman in sheepskin coat and fur hat who held an old enfield rifle in one hand and the bridle of a rough hill pony in the other a stone rattled under drummonds foot and they swung round the hihman was colonel sher dil well praise be father kerrigan said softly the door of one of the trucks opened and janet tate dropped to the ground she was wearing the same clothes she had worn on the flight in fur lined boots cord pants and the sheepskin jacket drummond had provided for her but he didnt really notice these things only her eyes and the deep incredulous joy in them as she ran towards him ill council of war a corporal and three privates walked forward slowly curiosity written on their faces and behind them kgging slightly ms left arm heavily bandaged came tony brackenhurst we didnt expect to see any of you again father kerrigan said the chinese arrived so quickly that we only got out of the mission by the skin of our teeth i drove upriver to quala and found that the headman had already had the vehicle ferry destroyed to prevent the chinese crossing the river with transport everyone in the village was being ferried over by small boats in relays mr brackenhurst arrived while we were waiting our turn janet continued he was pretty badly burned he told us what happened at sadar he thought he was the only one to get away so he was for a while hamid replied calmly brackenhurst looked very pale and swayed slightly groping for the side of the truck to steady himself two of the soldiers moved to catch him and father kerrigan said i think you ought to lie down again my boy you dont look too good will you see to him janet brackenhurst stumbled away between the two privates janet walking beside them and the priest turned back to the others i dont think ive ever had a greater surprise in my life than i did ten minutes ago when this tribesman here emerged from the mist and turned out to be sher dii i arrived on foot about four hours ago sher d said when i told the villagers what was happening they decided to move into the mountains while they still could they wanted me to go with them but id told drummond and major hamid to meet here if they managed to get across the river he grinned i was beginning to think you werent going to make it we very nearly didnt hamid said they insisted on our staying for a while youll be interested to know by the way that friend cheung is an intelligence colonel god bless my soul father kerrigan said are you sure about this weve the best of reasons for knowing father drummond said hows kerim taking it all surprisingly well of course hes not had things too bad as yet after crossing the river we were in an ox cart for nine or ten miles but then we met the convoy as soon as corporal nadin heard our story he turned round at once he didnt have much choice he couldnt have gone any further does he know about his fathers death so its certain brackenhurst seemed to think so but i kept hoping he might have been mistaken father kerrigan sighed no ive told the boy nothing later perhaps when were safe across the border if we can get there father a debatable point at the moment ahmed splashed towards them through the rain two tin mugs in each hand tea colonel so you survived you rogue sher dfl said in mock anger am i never to be rid of you as allah wills colonel ahmed grinned impudently he wore brand new leather combat boots and a quilted khaki parka of the kind specially issued for winter warfare the furlined hood pulled up over his head where did you get the clothes drummond asked one of the tracks was carrying general equipment for the army sahib there is still some left although we unloaded most of it back there on the road to make room for the women and children women and children refugees we found on the road we could not leave them for the chinese tell corporal nadin to bring me a map sher dil said they squatted on the verandah of the nearest house to drink their tea and nadin a thin sinewy indian with a brown face and long black moustache brought the map sher dil unfolded if three hundred mfles to the indian border and one road outthis one the usual way to cross the river with transport was by the ferry at quala but according to father kerrigan the villagers have burned it it might be possible to cross in the shallows at kama drummond said especially with halftracks and theyve got those do you think theyll try father kerrigan said hamid nodded tm afraid so they want the young khan cheung made that quite plain a puppet to sit on the throne of balpur a mouthpiece for the peoples republic as sher dil says theres only one road out theyre certain to follow then we must keep moving we have a good lead only for a time sher dil ran his finger along the course of the river here seventy miles south of sadar is a village called huma it the chinese get their hands on the boats there they can put men across but not vehicles that is true but see how the river swings to follow the valley they would be no more than ten to fifteen miles from the road no distance for active welltrained troops so you think they may try to cut the road ahead of us drummond said hamid shrugged i dont know who their commanding officer is but thaf s what id do if i was in his place then the sooner were on the move the better sher dh looked up at the leaden sky about two hours of daylight left we can go a long way in that time you dont think ws should push oa through the night on this road hamid laughed harshly it would be suicide in vehicles like these much better to camp at a suitable spot and move on at first light the chinese wont have anyone across the river yet there hasnt been enough time well have a good start on them sher dil got to his feet and turned to corporal nadin what about petrol there is plenty colonel enough for all the trucks why not dump two and push on in the others drummond said plenty of room for all of us if we unload sher dil laughed and made a sweeping gesture that took in all four of the bedfords look at them twenty years old if theyre a day theyve been running since the burma campaign and it shows he turned to nadin how often do they break down the corporal shrugged all the time colonel first one thing and then another that settles it we push on with all four if one breaks down we still have three left and so on one of the damned things is bound to last out to the border in any case the ammunition they carry may prove useful the three privates had been standing in a little group a yard or two away listening to this conversation and as corporal nadin turned to move away one of them grabbed his sleeve and muttered something quickly sher dil frowned and stepped down into the mudwhats going on nadin turned indecision on his face two of the men sir piroo and yussuf they are local men their wives are in sadar they would rather stay they do not wish to return to india only the rush of the rain and the rattle of water in the stream bed on the other side of the village disturbed the silence after he had finished speaking father kerrigan looked worried and hamid was quite composed ready for anything when drummond glanced quickly at sher dil the colonels face had turned pale with anger and lie eyes blazed fire for a soldier who disobeys an order in the face of the enemy there can be only one punishment he unslung the old lee enfield rifle and rammed home a round the bolt making an audible click is that understood the two men in question looked scared to death sher dil slung the rifle over his shoulder again right corporal nadin prepare to move out nadin and the three privates hurried away and father kerrigan heaved a sigh of relief you almost frightened me a bad business hamid said once it starts you can never tell where its going to end sher dil nodded weve wasted enough time get what you need in the way of arms and so on and well move out the refugees a dozen women and five children huddled together in the shadows at the back of the truck clutching the pathetic bundles which contained theur worldly possessions they sat there patiently watching with no visible emotion as drummond and haraid looked through what was left of the general equipment the truck had been carrying they found quilted parkas similar to the one ahmed was wearing and drummond discarded his hying boots still saturated from their immersion in the river and helped himself to a pair of heavy mountain warfare combat boots he pulled on waterproof mittens and jumped to the ground hamid was at the second truck with sher dfll the colonel had discovered a case of submachine guns aad had broken it open these are very good he said with a grin a gift from moscow one of the happier results of adopting a policy of strict neutrality he prised open a box of ammunition and another of grenades and turned as corporal nadin approached bring the others im going to issue automatic weapons nadin called and a moment later ahmed and the third driver a tall bengali named amal hurried out of the mist tussuf and rroo where are they the two men glanced at each other uncertainly and nadin ran along the line of trucks he was back in a moment they have gone colonel sher dil grabbed ahmed by the front of ms parka did you see them go you rogue ahmed raised his hands palms outwards on my fathers grave colonel they were here only five minutes ago i was talking to them what about they were very angry with the colonel they said that the chinese would catch us all that we would never reach india he shrugged they didnt want to stay sher dil cursed and hamid shook his headwere better off without them theres no problem weve enough drivers between us i can take a truck myself sher dil nodded very well til go first with corporal nadin you follow in the supplies truck major father kerrigan miss tate and the young khan can travel with you what about me drummond said you can bring up the rear with ahmed mr brackenhurst can travel with amal in the third truck with the refugees as soon as everyones in well move out as they broke away drummond heard his name and saw janet leaning over the tailboard of the second truck he climbed up beside her quickly anything wrong no whats been happening a couple of drivers have deserted but theres nothing to worry about hows kerfm asleep at the moment weve made him as comfortable as possible boxes had been moved away from title far end creating an alcove in which the young khan lay covered with blankets his face very pale against the white bandage janet leaned down to straighten a blanket and when she stood up again drummond took her hands are you worried she shook her head nothings really sunk in yet i cant quite believe its happening his hands tightened pulling her dose and he kissed her not even this she looked up at him her eyes dark and serious and then she smiled and touched his face gently she didnt speak there was no need and they kissed again til see you later he said and left her there when he vaulted over the tailboard father kerrigan was standing in the rain a long cheroot jutting from his teeth beneath the shovel hat and would it be all right if i got ia now he demanded drummond grinned and gave him a push up over the tailboard where did you get the smokes see ahmed hes been foraging amongst the supplies again drummond trudged through the mud to the rear truck when he climbed up into the cab he found ahmed sitting behind the wheel wreathed in tobacco smoke the afrldi grinned and took a carton from the dashboard cheroots sahib very strong specially mads for indian army the way i feel i could smoke any damned thing drummond said he lit one coughing as the smoke caught at the back of ms throat the door was pulled open and slier dil appeared the next village is hasa which is a good ninety miles further on we havent a hope of getting that far before darkness in weather like this drummond said sher dil nodded if we can make forty miles th be satisfied well camp at the side of the road and push on at dawn he slammed the door and ahmed pressed the starter after several moments and a liberal use of the choke the engine rumbled into life the truck in front of them lurched forward and he eased off the handbrake and followed there was a warm smell of petrol and oil in the cab and rain splashed against the windscreen suddenly drummond had that same feeling of temporary security and safety hed known in the herdsmans hut after theyd got across the river he leaned back in his seat laid the submachine gun across his knees and started to clean the grease from it with a piece of rag as the sound of the track engines faded into the mist and rain piroo and yussuf scrambled up from the stream bed and stood in the rain listening as the last echo died away piroo nodded in satisfaction good they have gone sher dil was very angry no matter yussuf replied his day is done he looked up at the smoke rising from the headmans house there is still a fire on the hearth we will stay here for the night we can move on in the morning they went up the steps to the verandah opened the heavy door and went inside leaving the street empty again rain hammered into the mud mist enfolded the silent houses and the village waited as night fell the truck rocked violently as it ground its way along the muddy potholed road and drummond leaned forward straining his eyes into the swirling mist the truck in front stopped suddenly and ahmed stamped his foot on the brake drummond opened the door submachine gun ready and sher dil appeared weve bogged down youll have to lend a hand drummond and ahmed tramped through the mud to the front truck its offside wheel was deep in a waterfilled pothole and nadin and hamid were already busy with spades it took twenty minutes of hard work on the part of everybody to get it moving when drummond climbed back into his seat he was plastered with mud to the knees and his fine new parka looked as if it had been through a hard campaign half an hour later the whole performance had to be repeated when he settledhimself back in ms seat for the second time he was past feeling anything his feet were numb his hands raw and bleeding from handling the rocks and stones which had gone to fill the potholes visibility was bad now and he began to feel very tired as he strained ms eyes through the gathering gloom the front trucks horn sounded once and as the convoy slowed he was aware of scattered pine trees on the left ahmed turned off the road and followed the dimlyseen tail of the truck in front and there was a sudden stillness as all engines were cut nightwatch the camp site sher dil had chosen was a rocky fiat thinly scattered with pine trees that gave them some sort of a screen from the road when drummond walked up the line hamid sher dil and father kerrigan were standing at the rear of he second truck talking in low voices janet leaned over the tailboard weve decided we dont need to worry too much about a blackout in this mist sher dil said well set up one of the oil stoves in the back of the supply truck miss tate can cook in there away from the rain the refugees can do the same theres plenty of food to go round a good hot meal should go a long way towards raising everyones spirits father kerrigan said drummond nodded what about the boy hell be all right ive kept him under strong sedation so far what about sleeping arrangements hamid asked in the trucks well need a guard of course two at a time one here the other at the roadside ill work out a rota after weve eaten sher dil moved away and father kerrigan smiled up at janet hand me my bag my dear id better have a look at brackenhurst til go with you hamid said they walked away together and drummond called to ahmed and helped janet down the little afridi arrived on the run yes sahib miss tates going to cook a meal for us in the back of the supply truck drummond said get the spirit stove going for her and open a few tins if you dont do everything she tells you at the double ill cut your throat ahmed grinned at janet the sahib has a kind heart memsahib he could never do such a terrible thing you come with me i will see to everything they moved away and drummond went after father kerrigan and hamid he found them in the back of the third truck with the refugees an engine inspection kght bad been rigged up to illuminate the interior brackenhurst sat on an ammunition box stripped to the waist as father kerrigan carefully peeled layers of bandage away from his left arm and the women and children watched solemnly ke looked pale and drawn and every so often glanced furtively at hamid who watched calmly the priest removed the final bandage examined hie arm and nodded nothing like as bad as i thought at first youll be fine in a day or two it hurts like hell brackenhurst said what a shame drummond pulled himself up and looked over the tailboard dont you think thats a shame ah undoubtedly hamid replied calmly you must rest tony we wouldnt want anything to happen to you brackenhurst threw them both a glance of pure hatred and drummond dropped to the ground and moved back to the supply truck he could smell cooking and a sudden hollow ache told him how long it had been since hed eaten when he climbed inside janet and ahmed crouched over the stove and sher dil sat on a packing case the map across his knees you look worried tm thinking about tomorrow we swing very close to the river again if the chinese have moved fast along the other side in their troop carriers and get a few patrols across we could run into trouble the bridge across the sokim ravine for exampleif that was destroyed we would be on foot we can worry about that in the morning drummond said tm only interested in one thing at the moment food m ahmed passed plates of stewed meat and beans across and as they started to eat father kerrigan climbed up followed by hamid will you see that mr brackenhurst gets something to eat the priest said to ahmed and frowned at drummond werent you a little hard on him back there any mans nerve can go for a while in a situation like this he never had any in the first place drummoad said flatly the old priest frowned glancing from one to the other aware that there was something here that he did not understand drummond jumped over the tailboard and went round to the cab he sat in the warm darkness smoking and ahmed brought him a mug of strong scalding tea a little later sher dil opened the door tve worked out a guard rota td like you to take over from amal up on the road at ten youll also ba on guard down here for an hour from am i want everyone up at five weve got a long day ahead of us he vanished into the darkness and drummond pulled the furlined hood of his parka over his head ten oclock that left tune for a couple of hours sleep he settled into the comer and closed his eyes he was naming down a long dark road and somewhere ahead of him was janet she was calling to him and he knew that something terrible was close behind he ran faster and then the surface of the road changed to mud and his feet began to stick in it ankledeep clouds of rain blew across his path blotting her from sight and only the sound of her voice told him she was still there it became fainter and fainter and then he felt terribly afraid and the thing behind him the nameless evil that made him so afraid grabbed him violently by the shoulder he awakened suddenly to the cold night and realised that somebody was shaking him he groaned and sat up ahmed said from the darkness you were having a bad dream i think sahib is it time yes sahib drummond breathed deeply a couple of times to steady himself then pulled on his mittens he picked up his submachine gun opened the door and jumped down into the mud he rain rushed steadily through the darkness and the mist still blanketed the wet ground as he moved through the pine trees to the road after a while he paused and called in a low voice amal where are you the bengali moved out of the night to join him drummond sahib anything doing nothing only the rain and yet more rain soon it will be snow i have known it happen before this early in the year lets hope not drummond said and the bengali faded into the darkness he found a fallen tree and sat on it arms folded submachine gun across his knee but the cold ate into his bones and from time to time he stood up and walked around a little stamping his feet to restore the circulation finally with a complete disregard for caution he lit a cheroot it tasted terrible but the glowing end somehow comforted him when he had finished it he lit another he became aware of the noise very gradually he straightened up and listened carefully he could hear the sound of feet squelchng through the mud from the direction of the camp there was silence for a moment as if the person approaching was momentarily at a loss and then the steps sounded again this time much more cautiously very carefully drummond placed his still burning cheroot in a branch of the fallen tree then slipped quietly into the darkness he vorked his way round in a wide circle until he was certain he was behind the intruder and then moved forward the dim bulk of a man appeared from the gloom and glowing faintly through the dark beyond him was the cheroot it was the stillness of the man that decided drummond that and the slight ominous rattle of a gun sling as he eased from one foot to the other still peering towards the glowing cheroot drummond took a pace forward tapped him on the shoulder and punched him in the stomach as he turned round he lay moaning on the ground and drummond struck a match it was brackenhurst one of the russian submachine guns lying in the mud beside him the match hissed and was extinguished by the rain after a while brackenhurst groaned and sat upwhat happened his voice quavered aad he sounded sick you shouldnt go creeping around in the dark like that drummond said people might get the wrong idea i wanted a word with you thats all brackenhurst said away from the others i wanted to explain about what happened at sadar when the roof started to come down i panicked didnt know what was happening i got to the land rover and when no onr else followed i thought youd all bought it which was a straight lie but drummond let it go thats all right these things happen brackenhurst hesitated have you told anyone else drummond shook his head only hamid and i know and weve more important things to worry about he stood there calm and somehow uncompromising in the darkness youd better get some sleep youre going to need it he picked up the submachine gun and held it out better take this with you brackeahurst stumbled away without speaking and drummond went back to bis tree half an hour later sher dil relieved him anything happened drummond shook his head no everything quiet up here he replied and trudged through the mud back to the camp he climbed into the back of the truck and lay down hitching a blanket over his shoulders he was cold numb all over and yet he wasnt miserable he was long past that point he came awake slowly yawned and turned on one side janet crouched over the oil stove waiting for the kettle to boil her face half in shadow in the subdued glow what time is it he asked softly she glanced at her watch just after three i couldnt sleep she made tea in two tin mugs and handed him one and they sat in companionable silence in the glow of the stove after a while he said gently what is it janet are you afraid i think i am she said simply even vietnam didnt prepare me for anything like this do you think well get out he was tempted to answer witih a false assurance and then looked into that calm grave face and knew that he couldnt im not sure as sher dil says if the chinese have moved fast along the other side they could be ahead of us theyre bound to find boats at huma or one of the other riverside villages they could put men across to cut the road with no trouble this bridge up ahead that sher dil mentioned do you think there may be trouble there trouble is where you find it theres never any sense in worrying too much in advance he smiled what will you do when all this is over carry on to chicago with kerim i suppose that still stands whatever else may be changed im due three months leave anyway and afterwards tm not sure i go wherever the society sends me isnt it tune you thought about settling down is that a straight ofier he shook his head i could offer you money janet enough and to spare but take a look at the debit side im forty years old a beatup exnavy flyer whos seen too much of hot countries and strange cities had enough of flying to places where no one else will go i want to rest my head somewhere for a while that doesnt sound like much of a catch to me i know one thing she said quietly if we dont try well regret it for the rest of our lives he sat staring down at the light of the stove her hand in his sighed and got to his feet til get a little air fve got some thinking to do janet sat there in the darkness and after a while hamid climbed over the tailboard he helped himself to tea and squatted on the other side of the stove from her i should wake jack hes supposed to take over from me at four thats all right he was here hes just gone for soraa air trouble hamid said she shrugged four oclock la the morning talk thats ah hes just decided hes too old for me hamid nodded hes tired thats all he hesitated and then decided to carry oa jack isnt aware that i know this janet but for the past five years at least hes been working for british intelligence mainly flying illegal reconnaissance flights across the borders of what might be termed the less friendly powers the breath went out of her in a long sigh tbure sure about this oh yes the information comes to me from friends la indian army intelligence a long time for a man to live on ms nerves which explains a great many things last year he crashed in the borneo jungle and was badly wounded they nearly got him that time and the indonesians do not care for the british these days his fate would hardly have been a pleasant one is that when he got that terrible scar on his face he nodded and leaned across his face grave in the diffused light of the stove hes a good man janet but hes had enough take him home wherever that turns out to be there was an obvious change in her she seemed confident assured smiled suddenly and squeezed his hand i will ali i will she got to her feet id better check on kerim hamid poured himself some more tea feeling strangely sad and after a while drummond climbed over the tailboard and joined him wheres janet gone to have a look at kerim whos on duty at the road ahmed i think drummond hesitated and then went on brackenhurst turned up when i was doing my hour up there last night what did he want tra not sure i rather got the impression he was toying with the idea of killing me but basically he just wanted to make sure that we hadnt told the others what really happened at sadar he explained what had taken place when he had finished hamid nodded slowly a frown on bis face of course he could argue that he was carrying the gun merely as precaution in case of trouble he could never have used it far too noisy the knife is the weapon for darkness jack tm not sure that hes rational enough to look at things in that way any more drummond said hes badly scared and hes certainly never possessed the kind of coldblooded guts it takes to go after a man with a knife well have to watch him from now on thats all hamid shivered suddenly i dont like it at this time in the morning jack makes me think of other dawnings other places and a lot of good men dead he laughed in a peculiar fashion i must be getting old arent we all drummond said he got to his feet and moved to the tailboard it was already dawn a grey light seeping through the mist the heavy rain lancing into the ground and he stared out at it morosely wondering what the day would bring wrapped in a sheepskin on the floor in front of the fire in die headmans house at bandong piroo was awakened suddenly by a savage kick in the side he sat up with a start aware as if ia a dream effaces staring down at him the shining burp guns the red stars in the peaked caps somewhere yussuf cried aloud running for the door a foot tripped him and a rifle butt thudded savagely against the back of his skull cracking the bone hroo was dragged to his feet gibbering with fear and then a sharp voice cut across the noise and confusion and there was silence colonel cheung paused in the doorway the fur collar of his greatcoat pulled up around his neck the face beneath the fur hat lined and drawn with fatigue there had been considerable delay in crossing the river at kama for one thing the shallows had been deeper than usual owing to the heavy rain and one of the troop carriers had bogged down they had wasted several hours in trying to salvage it it had been almost dark when he had finally decided to push on with the remaining vehicle and a dozen mea he had kept on the move for most of the night often at no more than ten miles an hour in the appalling conditions on several occasions almost losing the vehicle but there was always the hope that father kerrigan and his party might be at bandong it was an obvious stopping place when they had reached the village he had sent the sergeant and ten men in on foot giving them five minutes start before following in the troop carrier whats going on here he demanded the sergeant a small hardfaced cantonese named ng hurried forward the village is empty colonel except for these two deserters from the look of them deserters cheungs face changed went pale with excitement as he pushed his men aside and examined piroo who are you he demanded in urdu one of colonel sher dils men did you escape across the river no sahib piroo said i was with the supply convoy the convoy was here cheung said where is it now gone sahib to india with colonel sher dil and the young khan they are hoping to reach the border sher dil was here cheung said in amazement oh yes sahib piroo babbled also major hamid and druramond sahib they all crossed the river from sadar when did they leave yesterday two hours before dark they intended to camp somewhere along the road when night fell i heard the colonel say so cheung laughed excitedly slapping his leather swagger stick across his gloved palm get the men together at once sergeant were going on he turned to the door and sergeant ng said quicklywhat shall i do with this one sir cheung looked at piroo with something close to affection let him go free he has served us well he went out and piroo to whom the interchange in chinese had been completely unintelligible turned eagerly to sergeant ng a strange man the colonel the sergeant told himself full of wild fancies but a good officer for all that he nodded to one of his men who grabbed piroo suddenly clamping a hand over his mouth piroo saw the knife coming up felt a coldness streaking under the ribs to the heart and plunged into darkness they left him there by the fire and a moment later the troop carrier moved away its tracks scattering mud from the street across the walls of the houses the bridge at sokim i can see the bridge sher dil said and its still standing thank god for that drummond took the binoculars and focussed them quickly there certainly doesnt seem to be anybody about and no cover for an ambush hamid said wed better cross now while the goings good they dispersed to the trucks and drummond ploughed through the mud and heaved himself up beside ahmed glad to be back inside it had rained without pause all morning turning the road into a nitted quagmire through which they had progressed at little more than fifteen miles per hour they went over the hill and the road dropped steeply towards the great ravine which cut its way through the heart of the mountains ahmed selected bottom gear and followed sher dil cautiously the bridge was a narrow spindly thing fit only for oneway traffic as the road levelled off to approach it the other trucks slowed to a halt and ahmed braked quickly til see whats happening drummond said and jumped down sher dil leaned over the parapet examining the web of rusty steel girders he turned as drummond approached it would take the chinese a long timeto construct another a demolition experts dream thinking of doing it yourself i dont see why not it wouldnt take long well cross over first though as drummond went back to his own vehicle hamid leaned out of the cab of the supply truck what was he up to he wants to stop and blow up the bridge what do you think an excellent idea it would block the road for months dont you think it might advertise our presence i cant see that it makes much difference if theres anyone up ahead theyll still be there whether we blow the bridge or not drummond climbed up beside ahmed and the truck lurched forward and started the slow ascent on the other side when they pulled over the hill they saw that sher dil had stopped a little way up the road they joined him as amal and brackenhurst drove up behind brackenhurst came forward ms face white and strained why are we stopping tve decided to destroy the bridge before moving on sher dil said father kerrigan climbed down to join them and janet stayed in the cab an arm around young kerim who was now sitting beside her tor gods sake brackenhurst said havent we lost enough time if we blow the bridge the chinese will lose even more sher dil said patiently well use the contents of my truck grenades ammunition and some demolition charges you can all help well unload the stuff more quickly that way he turned to father kerrigan you stay with miss tate and the khan we shant be long he took the wheel himself on the journey back down the hill when they reached the bridge he turned and reversed as far as the centre drummond climbed into the back with hamid and handed the boxes out to the others they worked fast and each time he passed a box down to brackenhurst he noticed that he was sweating thats about it sher dil said at last as he surveyed the boxes stacked across the bridge when that lot goes up theyll hear it in sadar what now hamid said til set the fuses myself corporal nadin and amal can stay and help me the rest of you better get back up the hill youll have to walk well need the truck to make a quick exit before the big bang brackenhurst was already hurrying back across the bridge and nadin stood rooted to the spot dismay in his eyes sher dil tossed him a coil of fuse wire which the indian almost dropped pull yourself together corporal the colonel snapped the sooner we get this set up the sooner we can get out at the top of the hill drummond turned and looked down the bridge and the truck seemed like toys and the whole scene had an unreal fake look hamid came up the hill carrying sher oils binoculars he sat on a boulder and adjusted them until the truck and the bridge jumped sharply into focus how are they doing drummond asked hes laying the charges i must say nadin doesnt look too happy neither does amal theyre both scared to death i think thats why sher dil made them stay below on the bridge they worked rapidly nadin running the fuse wire to the far end he walked back towards the colonel paused and pointed dramatically his cry rose thin and clear in the rain as a chinese troop carrier came over the crest of the hill on the other side of the ravine hamid focussed the binoculars quickly and the face of the officer standing upright beside the driver jumped out to meet him its cheung as the troop carrier started the descent drammond said they havent got time to blow the bridge now wed better get moving in the troop carrier they would catch us within five minutes hamid said calmly sher dil knows that he will blow the bridge he will do it for the young khan drummond turned to watch the drama being enacted below saw sher dil take a step towards the charges and knew with cold certainty that hamid was right that he intended to blow the bridge even if it meant going up with it amal seemed rooted to the ground but nadin rushed at him in complete panic clawing at his shoulder sher dil knocked him down with a blow of his fist and turned again to the charges nadin scrambled to his feet wrenched the trucks spade from its fastenings near the door and struck sher dil on the head with all his force he turned and jumped into the cab the track moved forward and stalled and amal seizing bis chance scrambled over the tailboard sher dil managed to reach his knees he took a grenade from one of his pockets pulled out the pin and tossed it towards the stacked boxes at that moment the truck lurched forward it had moved perhaps ten yards when the centre of the bridge erupted in a cloud of smoke pieces of stone girder lifted skywards as a series of violent explosions sounded one after the other and then the entire middle section of the bridge fell in the truck slipped back into the gaping chasm and disappeared the troop carrier had slewed to a halt on the other side and now its heavy machine gun opened up firing blindly through the pall of smoke bullets ripping up earth and stone on the hilltop beside the trucks brackenhurst was already behind the wheel of amals track lurching down the road to a chorus of terrified screaming from the women and children in the back there was no time to talk hamid scrambled up behind father kerrigan and drove away quickly and drummond and ahmed followed in the supply truck for a heartstopping moment bullets ripped through the canvas hood and then they were over the hill ten minutes later hamid sounded his horn brackenhurst slowed turning in to the side of the road and ahmed and drummond pulled in ahead of him drummond jumped down to join the pathan and brackenhurst stumbled towards them his eyes wildwhat do we do now for christs sake hamid ignored him and held up sher dils map he left this in the cab thats one good thing they leaned over it and he nodded i thought so theres another village fifteen miles further on and the border fifty miles beyond that one things certain drummond said cheung cant hope to catch us now hamid nodded as long as theres no one waiting at the next village we should be all right what about ditching a couple of the trucks hamid shook his head if anything went wrong with the track we were travelling in we really would be in trouble another thing three tracks give us more of a show of strength than one that could be useful if we run into any small patrols what about the women brackenhurst demanded dont you think its time we left them for the chinese to get their hands on even for you that isnt such a sparkling idea get back to your truck and take up third position the contempt in hamids voice was obvious to them all brackenhurst turned as if he had been struck and stumbled away tor heavens sake major father kerrigan said leaning out of the cab of hamids truck the mans at the end of his tether cant you see that which means hes got to be driven father its the only way im afraid hamid turned to drummond you and ahmed take the lead in the supply truck jack and ill follow if you do run into trouble try to block the road with your truck thatll give the rest of us a chance to turn round if you run fast enough you should be in time for a lift i hope so drummond said he went round the front of hamids truck and waved to janet she waved back and so did the boy the first real sign of life drummond had noticed from him he climbed up beside ahmed and they drove away the mist had lifted even more which wasnt too healthy and the rain sluiced down relentlessly it was bitterly cold and there was a bad taste in his mouth he ran a hand over the stubble on bis chin and leaned back in the seat watching the road a submachine gun in his lap they had been driving for no more than twenty minutes when hamid sounded his horn a couple of times ahmed tamed in to the side of the road and hamid pulled in ahead he jumped down and came to meet them bracken hurst doesnt seem to be following i wonder what the stupid bastards up to now drummond said as far as im concerned id leave frim to stew but weve the women to think of drummond nodded you wait here well run back in the supply truck its always possible that hes just broken down i cant understand how the things have kept going this long ahmed reversed and drove back along the road within five minutes they saw the track parked at the edge the women and brackenhurst standing beside it tie drove past turned in a tight circle and parked a few yards away drummond jumped down and walked back brackenhurst was smiling nervously relief on his face thank god you came i knew you would what happened drummond asked its the brakes theyre hydraulic on this track theyve stopped working there must be a leak thats all we needed well have to leave the women now brackenhurst said take a look underneath ahmed drummond said and he climbed into the cab of brackenhursts truck he pumped the brake pedal up and down several times but there was no answering pressure at that moment ahmed called to him he jumped down pushed his way through the women who had crowded silently around and crawled under the truck see sahib ahmed said grimly the pipe has been deliberately fractured as drummond started to examine itj the engine of the supply truck burst into life he scrambled out frantically but he was too late as he shoved the womea out of the way brackenhurst accelerated for a little while there was the sound of the engine and then that too died away and there was silence ahmed moved to ms side i think there must be a special place in hell reserved for mr brackenhurst what do we do now sahib go after him what else can we do without brakes sahib it wouldnt be the first time ill take the wheel he turned wearily to the women as a small child started to cry its mother hushed it and there was silence again as they waited stolid and patient get in he said go on all of you get back inp god knows what brackenhurst would do when he reached hamid and the others probably keep right on going and there was no means of knowing what hamid might do best to try and catch up with him as soon as possible they could unload the ammunition and transfer the women if he drove carefully and used the gears he could manage without the foot brake he climbed behind the wheel eased off the handbrake and took the truck slowly forward after a while he gained more confidence moved into top gear and put on speed within five minutes he reached the place where he and hamid had stopped and rolled slowly to a halt he could see the tyre marks at the side of the road and an oil splash but that was all which wasnt good and he took the track forward again grimly there was hail mixed in with the rain now building up against the windscreen and the wipers were having difficulty in handling it after half an hour the road started to slope down he changed to a low gear and proceeded more cautiously the valley widened until it stretched away into the rain for about half a mile lifting into the mountains that could be seen dimly on his left the road dropped even more abruptly and peering through the misty windscreen he saw a small bridge he crawled the rest of the way down the hifl in bottom gear the bridge consisted of a flat surface of planks crossing what would otherwise have been a deep ford there was still no sign of either of the other trucks and he drove across and kept on moving the road started to lift steeply hugging the side of the mountain which now towered above his head and he began to sweat a little the truck churned steadily upwards through the mud drummond gripping the wheel tightly an expression of utter concentration on his face he rounded a curve and came to the crest of a hill and the road dropped steeply into the valley below he leaned across quickly and looked out there was no fence only the crumbling rainsoaked edge and two hundred feet of steeply sloping mountainside the truck began the descent skidding occasionally with a sickening lurch drummond was trembling and beside him ahmeds face was wet with sweat the truck lurched again as he negotiated a corner and then thewheels skidded on the shaky surface and slid forward for about fifteen yards he turned into a skid and then out of it and by a miracle regained control the sweat soaked through his shirt ran from his forehead into his eyes and he took the truck forward again hail rattling against the windscreen in a flurry of wind the road curved around a great outcrop of black rock and he followed it hugging the side turning the corner to where an apron of brown and white water flooded the road rushing down from the mountain above and cascading into space as he started across the front wheels dipped and the surface of the road dissolved beneath him washed out in a great sliding scoop and the track slewed towards the edge for a moment it seemed to halt and drummond tugged frantically at the handbrake but it was not enough the truck lurched and one of the front wheels dipped over the edge jump for it he cried to ahmed he got the door open and went out head first landing on his hands and knees slipping in the thick mud as the track slid past him and went over the edge it hung there for a split second and ahmed whose door had jammed got it open a second too late the truck went over with a chorus of screams from the wretches imprisoned inside there were three terrible metalwrenching crashes as it bounced its way down the valley a brief moment of silence and then a tremendous explosion drummond moved cautiously to the side and looked down at the bright orange tongue of flames and turned away his body heaving in a great uncontrollable spasm that emptied his stomach he leaned against the rock for a while and then scrambled across the washed out portion of the road and walked on into the rain for half a mile the road dropped steeply into the valley and he caught a brief glimpse of the river winding through the mist below the rain became colder and darkness started to fall there was only one way to go though god knew where it would take him he wasnt even armed his submachine gun had gone over the edge with the truck something brushed his face he raised a gloved hand and saw that it was covered with large melting snowflakes he looked up and all around him snow fell intermingled with the rain from further along the road came the rattle of small arms fire and he paused for a moment the snow gently covering him who was it hamid or brackenhurst but there was no means of knowing and he started to walk again darkness increased and the snow gradually took the place of the rain until it was falling all about him covering the muddy road with a white mantle again there came the rattle of small arms fire much nearer this time the situation was beginning to look desperate if he stayed on the road he was bound to run into trouble sooner or later to judge from the sound of that firing without shelter he would freeze to death on a night like this trees had now begun to cover the valley bottom and he moved into their shelter and stumbled along parallel with the road his gloved hands tucked into his armpits against the intense cold somewhere up the road there was the clatter of a hoof against stone and a horse snickered softly drummond dropped behind a tree and waited there was a soft drubbing of hooves muffled by snow and half a dozen horsemen cantered by they wore the typical rough sheepskin coat of the hillmen but the red stars in the peaked caps the burp guns slung across their backs told him what they were what do i do now he said softly as the hoofbeats faded into the night there was a quiet chuckle almost in his ear and all hamid said exactly what i was wondering the long night when i first heard you coming i thought it meant trouble i was about to become most unpleasant hamid smiled his teeth gleaming in the darknessa good thing those soldiers rode by the moment you took cover i knew you were on the right side it was impossible to see his face in the darkness and drummond reached out to touch him in sheer relief ah you old bastard what happened you tell me we were waiting for you to come back with news of brackenhurst and you went by as if half the chinese army was on your tail that was brackenhurst not me drummond said and explained quickly what had happened including the loss of the truck there was a moments silence when he finished and hamid said softly there was heavy firing up ahead i think he may have paid the price already jack he couldnt drummond said flatly its too heavy perhaps but since sadar i dont think hes really been responsible for his actions wheres the truck about fifty yards back in the woods i decided to leave the road when we heard the firing up ahead we obviously werent going to get any further i came back to make sure that the snow covered our tracks judging by the soldiers the next village is obviously in chinese hands what are we going to do havent the slightest idea well discuss it in more comfortable surroundings at least we should be safe here for the night drummond stumbled after him through the darkness and the truck loomed out of the nightnot exactly the savoy hamid said but better than a snowdrift on a night hlce this careful there are boxes all over the place i dumped half the load the canvas curtain at the back of the truck moved slightly showing a chink of light and father kerrigan said softly major hamid and guest hamid said the wanderer returns drummond followed him over the tailboard he dropped the canvas curtain back into place and turned as hamid had said half the vehicles load had gone and the remaining boxes had been stacked so as to create a small enclosed alcove an oil stove was set on a box hi the centre throwing out lifegiving warmth as well as a dim light father kerrigan murmured something a hand on his shoulder but drummond had eyes only for janet kneeling on the other side of the cooker next to the young khan jack she said in a whisper jack he moved close dropped on one knee and took her hand there were no words none that would say the things he wanted to say and he touched it to his lips briefly what happened he told his story again in a few brief sentences when he finished there were tears in her eyes those women those poor women and children and ahmed there was nothing i could do he said nothing i thought wed never get round that mountain ourselves hamid said in the silence that followed janet seemed to puu herself together and put the kettle on the stove father kerrigan said slowly then the shooting we heard earlier that must have been brackenhurst hamid nodded there were chinese on horseback up on the road that means they must be in the next village are we safe here tor tonight and in the morning hamid shrugged i dont honestly know even if we could get the truck out of here again which i doubt theres nowhere to go wed never get through the village and we all know whos coming up behind he held out his hands to the stove weve got shelter food and warmth and thats a lot under the circumstances beans janet said beans and tea sufficient unto the day isnt that what the bible says she poured tea into two tin mugs and passed them to hamid and drummond those are all weve got well have to share drummond took off his mittens and wrapped his frozen hands around the mug conscious of the warmth and from the shadows opposite kerim watched him solemnly swathed in blankets he smiled showing even white teeth and drummond smiled back at him hes beginning to liven up father kerrigan nodded the natural resilience of the young i suppose drummondsat there staringinto the fire remembering many things the city burning the old khans eyes blazing into his as he exacted that final promise cheungs pale handsome face strange how things turned out theyd beenvery good friends really and what happened now he emptied the mug and passed it to janet wheres the map harold produced it from a pocket of ms parka any ideas not at the moment how far are we from the village here hamid pointed as drummond spread the map on the floor perhaps five miles its called chamdo the borders about fifty miles on the other side drummond examined the map carefully and frowned where does this track go to running over the mountain from the village theres a place up on top on the plateau ladong gompa ladong gompa father kerrigan put in but thats a monastery a buddhist monastery theres a shrine in the next valley very famous in the old days pilgrims used to cross over the mountain and stay overnight at the monastery i believe thats why it was built in the first place the old khan told me about it once hamid examined the map and shook his head thats eight or nine thousand feet up jack and the snow starting father kerrigan and janet could never get across but you could with the boy the priest said drummond cut in quickly we all could if we had horses horses hamid said with a frown and where are we going to get horses as you said the village is only five miles along the road if we slipped in just before dawn we shouldnt have too much trouble all of us hamid said drummond shook his head just you and i the others can wait for us here when we come back with the horses we can cut up across the shoulder of the mountain and join the track above the village if we come back with the horses at least it gives us a chance drummond shrugged can you think of anything better hamid shook his head slowly thats the trouble jack i cant i dont suppose we have much choice then i suggest we get some sleep were going to need it janet passed him a blanket and he wrapped himself in it and lay down next to hamid and the old priest surprising how warm the stove had made the interior now he looked across at janet sitting against the boxes head bowed the young khan sleeping in the hollow of her arm a wonderful girl the shadows thrown by the stove on to the canvas hood moved in and out now coming together now separating just like people he thought now they need each other now they dont now they mingle with each other now they go their own way he slept well in spite of the cold that crept into the truck during the night and found himself crushed between the old priest and hamid when he awakened he sat up and lit the stove the bright flame reflected suddenly from kerims unbandaged eye and drummond grinned at the little boy huddled in the corner next to janet he motioned him to silence and looked outside it was that time just before dawn when things begin to take on shape again to have definition there wasnt anything like as much snow as he had expected quite obviously it had stopped falling hours before he felt curiously refreshed and jumped down into the snow enjoying the fresh air in his nostrils after the close atmosphere of the truck as he stood there the trees started to stand out with a sort of hard luminosity and he knew that dawn was not far away enjoying the morning air janet said quietly from title truck he turned and smiled i dont know if you could say that exactly he spread his hands in a vaguely french gesture i feel funny this morning close to home wherever that is and yet i know im not she reached down for his hand in the darkness and gripped it tightly well get there jack i know we will well just go on believing that he grinned better put some tea on the stove and wake ali we havent got much time no need hamid looked out of the canvas screen beside her and janet moved back whats the day like could be worse it cant have snowed for very long itll be back i can promise you that wed better get ready drummond climbed back into the truck and found father kerrigan crouched at the stove beside janet opening tins of beans how do you feel drummond asked father kerrigan smiled the old bones are beginning to creak a little but til manage one thing i didnt check last night can you both rider janet nodded since i was a child the priest smiled i should imagine youve been used to a rattier more sedate mount than tile local variety my dear intractable brutes i know from bitter experience til manage she said confidently what about you jack i get by but only just alis your man hes a hazara they spent about a thousand years galloping down into india and back again usually with a woman across the saddle hamid grinned and broke open a case of garrand automatic rises and drummond cleaned one quickly he found a box of ammunition and slipped several spare clips into his pockets hamid primed half a dozen grenades and they took three each janet called softly and they sat in a circle round the oil stove drinking hot tea and eating beans thats the last of the food she said i can fill the big thermos with hot tea before we leave but after that weve had it drummond finished his tea and handed her the mug he glanced at hamid ready as ready as i ever will be drummond shouldered his garrand and dropped over the tailboard when he turned to look up father kerrigan and janet were pale shadows in the darkness well be back in a couple of hours he said trying to sound confident and they moved off hamid led the way through the trees his boots crunching the crusted snow and as drummond pushed frostcovered branches to one side with a gloved hand a feeling of exhilaration took possession of him it was going to be all right it had to be theyd come too far suffered too much hamid raised an arm and they halted the road lay just in front of them as they stood in silence looking at it snow began to fall quietly in large firm flakes a tall black finger of rock lifted out of the gloom on the other side and he pointed to it thats as good a marker as any we might as well use the road itll be quicker but keep your eyes open ive a nasty feeling weve left a little late its getting lighter by the minute and he was right one by one the trees seemed to step out of the darkness as they marched along the road the muddy rats were icebound and ironhard with just enough snow covering them to make walking easy they moved quickly hamid in the lead drummond behind him and keeping to the other side the snow was quite heavy now and reduced visibility considerably there was that strange absolute quiet that snow always brings and it affected drummond powerfully so that for a while he walked with his head bowed oblivious to all possible danger alone with ms thoughts they had travelled for no more than half a mfle when he was brought back to reality sharply by hamids low urgent call he was standing at the side of the road and drummond hurried to join him the tail of a truck was sticking out from the trees at an unnatural angle perhaps twentyfive yards into the wood they stood there for a moment not speaking both thinking the same thought and then hamid led the way forward following the snowcovered path the vehicle had made for itself it was the supply truck drummond brushed snow from the side of the vehicle and his glove snagged on rough edges he regarded the bullet holes dispassionately the things like a sieve he must have run straight into trouble hs wrenched open the door but the cab was empty and then hamid called from the other side brackenhurst lay huddled under a tree his face turned slightly fingers frozen into tallons there were three gaping holes in his chest they stood looking down at him and somewhere a horse snorted softly there was the jingle of harness and voices soft on the morning air someone laughed and hamid and drummond slipped into the shelter of the trees at the end of the jagged lane the truck had made into the wood two horsemen appeared chinese dressed in great sheepskin coats and peaked caps guns slung across their backs they reined in looking down towards the truck and one of them laughed again hamid handed his submachine gun to drummond and said softly give me your rifle we cant let them go on theyll spot the other truck drummond gave him the garrand and hamid rested the barrel against the tree trunk in front of him the horsemen had just started forward again when his first shot tumbled the lead man from the saddle he screamed turning on to his face in the snow as both horses plunged in panic the second rider fought to turn his mount he was still trying when two bullets in the back lifted him from the saddle as drummond and hamid ran forward one horse cantered away slowly back towards the village the other stood patiently beside the body of its rider hamid slung his rifle across his back gathered the reins and vaulted into the crude sheepskin saddle til catch the other one jack he urged his mount forward and disappeared into the curtain of snow drummond checked the action of the submachine gun and waited impatiently somewhere in the distance he seemed to hear a faint cry and then hamid galloped back along the road the reins of the second horse in his right hand wed better get moving more horsemen back along the road the bastards are out early this morning drummond slung the submachine gun across his back and took the reins the horse moved away from him rolling an eye and he pulled it back savagely and scrambled into the crude saddle hamid urged his mount into a gallop and drummond hung on grimly as his own horse followed there was excited shouting somewhere to the rear but no shooting and then the black finger of rock loomed out of the falling snow on their left and hamid turned into the trees father kerrigan vas standing anxiously beside the truck and janet leaned over the tailboard as they dismounted what happened the old priest said never mind now drummond told him get the boy weve got to get out of here janet handed kerim down slung a small military haversack over her back and followed him swathed in the grey army blankets the boy looked like a little old woman and didnt seem to be in the least afraid his large dark eye taking in everything with interest drummond gave janet a leg up on to his horse and handed her the child she settled him in front of her and took the reins across the road and up the hillside he said and dont waste any time getting there as hamid helped father kerrigan into the saddle of the other horse there was movement up on the road voices called excitedly and then quite suddenly the sharp report of a rule and a bullet thudded into the side of the truck drummond unslung his submachine gun and gave hamid a violent shove get out of it all til hold them hamid didnt argue he vaulted up behind father kerrigan and smashed his clenched fist against the horses hindquarters it bounded forward into the trees and the other horse followed instinctively drummond fired a quick burst through the brush towards the excited voices and someone cried out sharply he ran from the shelter of the truck and dropped on one knee behind a tree he could hear the sound of his friends progress somewhere to the left as hamid took them away on a diagonal course obviously intending to cross the road lower down a mounted soldier burst through the trees towards the truck another behind him drummond loosed off a long burst that sent both men and horses down in a confused heap turned and ran headlong through the trees following the trail left in the snow by the others there was movement over to his right dark shadows against the snow and he emptied the submachine gun in a great sweeping arc and ran on as he emerged into a small clearing a chinese soldier ran out of the trees on his right drummonds submachine gun was empty he dropped it and rushed straight at the chinese at the same headlong pace the man was badly shaken instead of trying to aim his burp gun he raised it defensively drummond ducked under the flailing weapon grabbed for the throat and lifted a knee into the mans crutch as the chinese sank into the snow he tore the weapon from his grasp and ran on he was sobbing for air as he stumbled through the trees and scrambled up the little slope to the road he slipped and fell to one knee as he stood up and made to cross he heard voices through the falling snow at least a dozen soldiers were running towards him but these werent mounted they were on foot and wore normal quilted uniforms and then he saw cheung in his long greatcoat with the fur collar mouth open in a soundless cry drummond emptied the magazine in one continuous clumsy burst that ripped up the surface of the road for twenty yards in front of the chinese ran across and started to scramble up the hillside he heard the roars of the men behind as they followed then a cry of alarm echoed by an explosion a few seconds later there was another he kept on moving and fell oa his face hands dragged him to his feet and hamid said a good thing i had those grenades drummond leaned against him feet splayed and fought for breath the lot i ran into just now he said not soldiers from the village cheung and his men they must have followed on foot from the bridge isnt the bastard ever going to give up i shouldnt imagine so hamid slapped him on the shoulder wed better get moving hell need horses if hes going to follow and that means going to the village itll take time he grinned savagely with any luck one of my grenades may have finished him off he could be lying down there in his own blood right now and then the wind tore a hole in the curtain and for a moment they saw the road below the bodies sprawled in the snow the living moving amongst them and one man who stood quite still staring up at the mountain the fur collar of his greatcoat framing the pale face no such luck drummond said with a shudder as the curtain swept back into place he turned and followed hamid upwards into the driving snow on the road the carnage was absolute as cheung turned to examine the dead and the dying only sergeant ng and three men were left on their feet and then one of the soldiers from the village limped out of the wood clutching a bloody arm his sheepskin wet with snow cheung went to meet him the sergeant at his sideyou are from chamdo the next village yes colonel how did you get there by boat from huma two patrols crossed straight over we came down river and there are horses there as many as you need colonel cheung took out his map and examined it quickly the sergeant peering over his shoulder he traced a finger along the track leading from chamdo up over the mountain to ladong gompa so thats where theyre going he said softly and turned to the sergeant a tibetan name a monastery from the sound of it colonel the sergeant said cheung folded the map and turned to the wounded soldier from chamdo how far is the village from here five miles colonel then weve no time to waste he nodded to the sergeant well march there as quickly as possible and get horses and the wounded colonel leave them well send someone from the village he pulled up his collar and started to walk along the iron hard road into the falling snow the mountain of god the snow was a living thing through which they stumbled blindly death and the valley had slipped far away and they were alone with mans oldest enemy the elements the hillside was rough strewn with boulders and the carpet of snow made the going difficult and unsure at one point father kerrigans mount plunged to its knees and hamid grabbed its bridle pulling it up again by brute strength janet reined in and drummond moved up beside her she was covered in snow and her cheeks were flushed as she smiled down at him how are you doing fine and so is kerim the boy was so swathed in blankets that only his single eye showed but it sparkled suddenly and drum raond knew that he had smiled these horses are used to this kind of country hamid said let them choose their own way they know what theyre doing do you think well find the track drummond said i dont see why not if we keep climbing on a diagonal line to the east i cant see how we could miss it they started again hamid leading followed by father kerrigan drummond bringing up the rear the slope steepened as they moved higher and the fuh blast of the snow driven by the wind hit them as they came out on to the bare mountainside at one point halfway up a shelving bank janets horse started to slide drummond scrambled forward beating it hard across the rump with his clenched fist and it plunged forward it was the snow that showed them the track the shape of it clear under the white carpet zigzagging up the steep slope beneath them and turning into a narrow ravine about a hundred yards to the right when they moved into the ravine they were sheltered from the wind for a while and climbed upwards the clatter of hooves against the hard ground echoing between the walls gradually the slope steepened the walls of the ravine fading into the ground and they came out on the bare mountainside again as they climbed the mountain seemed to rise more steeply and after another hour they went over the rim of an escarpment and looked across a narrow plateau to where the rock face tilted backwards in great overlapping slabs most of which were split and fissured into a thousand cracks they moved on heads down against the driving snow and after another hour hamid grabbed the bridle of father kerrigans horse and led it into the shelter of some boulders well rest for a while he said janet handed kerim down to drummond and slipped from the saddle she wiped the snow from her face and smiled wanly its cold too damned cold drummond said father kerrigan walked forward stiffly slapping his arms to restore the circulation td better have a look at kerim drummond crouched down in the shelter of the boulders and father kerrigan knelt beside him and gently parted the blankets god bless my soul but the childs sleeping is he all right janet said anxiously hes warm enough isnt he warmer than any of us in that cocoon the old man sat down against the rocks did you bring the contents of my medical bag janet nodded and slipped her arms through the straps of the military haversack shed been carrying on her back she opened it and took out the thermos flask of tea she had prepared at breakfast what was it you wanted never mind ill find it for myself the old priest looked grey and haggard and the lines in his face scoured deep into the flesh he searched through the contents of the haversack and found what he was looking for a small bottle of red capsules he slipped a couple into his mouth and janet passed him tea in the one tin mug that she had brought father kerrigan took a mouthful down and leaned back with a sigh hamid said anxiously are you all right father the old man opened his eyes and grinned lets just say im not as young as i was but the pills tve taken start acting straight away ill make it the luck of the irish the mug came round in turn and when it reached drummond he swallowed the hot tea gratefully hamid produced a couple of cheroots from one of his breast pockets and they lit them and moved away from the others looking back down the track into the snow the old man doesnt look too good drummond said how long till we reach the monastery maybe three hours hamid said it afl depends on the state of the track tve been thinking drummond saidwhat guarantee have we got that there will be anyone there when we do reach the place it could have fallen into disuse years ago there are ruined monasteries all over the mountains you know that as well as i do at least well find some sort of shelter hamid said and thats something were going to need just as soon as we can find it its no use pretending the old man or janet and the child for that matter can stand much of this sort of thing they moved back to the others and father kerrigan got to his feet whatever he had taken had certainly had a miraculous effect and he smiled cheeks slightly flushed tm ready when you are hamid helped him into the saddle drummond passed the boy up to janet and they moved on skirting the base of the great face of rock slabs over the years the track had been marked by pilgrims placing their stones on conical cairns which marked quartermile intervals and these were still clearly visible in the snow an hour later the track turned into a narrow ravine that slanted up into the rock it was choked with boulders and loose stones an indication of years of neglect hamid took the lead holding father kerrigans horse by the bridle and drummond did the same for janet he was soon tired and his arm ached with the strain of holding in the unwilling horse he constantly slipped on the snow sending loose stones rattling through the maze of boulders below once or twice when they paused he looked up at janet and was shocked at the weariness in her eyes somehow she managed to smile and he smiled back half an hour later they emerged from the ravine on to a ledge perhaps forty feet across that slanted upwards to the left jutting out from the cliff face hamid turned still holding on to the bridle of the old mans horse everyone all right drummond glanced up at janet and she nodded fine keep going the ledge lifted steeply following the curve of the wall and a sea of swirling snow cloaked the valley below drummond followed hamid and father kerrigan holding the horse as close in to the wall as possible and then the ledge narrowed until there hardly seemed room for man and animal together he pushed forward frantically and came out on the edge of a great plateau beyond them the ultimate peaks of the mountains stabbed into the sky and great sterile valleys ran between cutting their way through to the other side the main plateau hamid shouted above the wind the monastery cant be very far away well keep on going it was cold at that height very cold no more snow fell but the wind blew harder and harder until it cut through their clothing whipping their bruised bodies with cold fingers and the child started to cry janet held him close in her arms and drummond took the reins of the horse pulling it forward and then they moved over the crest of a small hill and paused below them was a great natural arena into which many valleys spilled and squarely in the entrance of one of them stood the monastery of ladong gompa hamid urged father kerrigans mount forward with a savage cry and drummond went after him the monastery walls had been painted red green and black to signify the nature of the order but the colours had faded with the years it was of no great size and had a bleak deserted look about it there was no encircling outer wall a usual feature of larger establishments and the entrance was at the top of several steps protected against the weather by a stone porch snow had drifted in an unbroken line across the steps and a chain hung through a hole high in the wall jingling faintly as it swung in the wind when hamid pulled hard on it a bell rang hollowly somewhere inside and they waited as its brazen sound died after a while they heard a rattle of wooden clogs on stone and a metallic rasping as bolts were withdrawn the door swung back to reveal a buddhist monk in faded yellow robes he showed no particular surprise and came forward at once to give his hand to father kerrigan as the old man stumbled up the steps drummond held kerim until janet had dismounted then handed him to her and she followed father kerrigan another monk a younger man came down the steps and hamid said what about the horses like the other one the young man did not speak but motioned them to follow him and when he tucked his robe into his girdle so that it didnt trail in the snow drummond saw that his feet were bare there was an enclosed courtyard at the rear they waited at the gate and after a while it was opened from inside and they moved in there were the usual stables and a young novice took the horses from them and they followed the other monk into the monastery they walked along a narrow stoneflagged corridor and entered a large poorlyfurnished room at the far end with a fire of logs burning on a large stone hearth janet was sitting by the fire kerim nursed in her arms while father kerrigan sat on a bench by a large wooden table engaged in animated conversation in english with a much older monk in a yellow conical hat with ear flaps father kerrigan got to his feet and the monk rose with him major hamid and mr drummond he made the introductions in english this is the abbot of ladong gompa ive been giving him a brief account of our misfortunes apparently they still get a few pilgrims across during the summer lucky for us eh i suppose were pilgrims in a sense drummond said pilgrims of hope the abbot smiled tve been explaining to father kerrigan that the other members of our order here are under a strict vow of silence please accept that they mean no discourtesy his english was slightly stilted and technically excellent but was delivered in the grave expressionless tons of a man who did not use his voice often can we stay here for a while drummond said as long as you wish has father kerrigan told you that we are being followed by communist troops the abbot nodded sound travels great distances at this height we could hear your party coming when you were still crossing the main plateau there will be ample warning i will have food sent to you and then blankets i suggest you all try to get some sleep and thats the most sensible thing ive heard ia a long time drummond said i shall pray for your continuing good fortune the abbot left the room hot food was brought to them steaming in a great copper bowl and afterwards blankets drummond draped one over his shoulders and hamid spread the map out on the table where do we go from here hamid ran his finger along another valley following the track over the top and down the other side of the mountain about fifteen miles to the indian border from here thats all drummond looked across to where father kerrigan and janet were already asleep in front of the fire wrapped in their blankets kerim between them do you think they can make it theyll have to we dont have any choice he lay down on the floor beside the others pulling his blanket over his head and drummond stayed at the table it was peaceful quiet after the storm the regular breathing of the sleepers rising and falling gently and after a while he rested his head in his arms and slept he awakened suddenly yawned and stretched his arms so that the blanket fell from him as he bent down to retrieve it he became aware that the abbot was standing just inside the door watching him how long have i been asleep the abbot came forward and sat on the bench on the other side of the table about three hours it is almost night drummond glanced across at the others sleeping quietly beside the fire theyre very tired theyve been through a great deal the abbot nodded and brooded quietly face expressionless and calm as the firelight played across it drummond felt completely rested and wide awake but his feet pained him and the toes on his right foot were numb and lifeless he fumbled halfheartedly with the laces of his com bat boots but the knots were swollen and tightened by the constant damp of the past two days and he finally gave up trying it would interest me to know what you think of my country the abbot said frankly i cant get out fast enough fve seen enough of places like this smoke rising from burning cities refugees on the move but you came by choice in the first place did you not i once read somewhere that life is action and passion drummond said that if a man failed to take part in it he wasnt really living he absentmindedly banged his right foot against the floor in an endeavour to restore the circulation and the abbot saida mistake to take that too literally it was said by a man who having experienced the horrors of war devoted himself to the rule of law for the rest of ms life the abbot crossed the floor and opened a pair of large wooden shutters revealing the night and the mountains drummond joined him on a small stone terrace it was very cold and he pulled his blanket more closely about him and shivered during the past few days his body had been alternately wet and frozen so many times that he was now at a stage where his resistance was at a very low ebb night was beginning to fall cold and clear with great scatterings of stars brilliant and luminous strung away across the peaks as he looked it darkened quickly from east to west and the stars were blotted out before his eyes as though someone moved among them quickly snuffing them out between finger and thumb it will snow very heavily soon the abbot said a small wind lifted the hair on dnimmonds head as it skidded round tlie corner of the building gradually the shadow moved across the night sky until there were no more stars to be seen and the wind howled mournfully as it sped down the valleys towards them it isnt a night id like to be out in the abbot lifted a hand motioning him to silence drummond strained his ears but heard nothing he was about to speak when quite suddenly as the wind lifted there was a faint jingling sound they are coming the abbot said simply are you sure the abbot nodded crossing the main plateau iї there anywhere we could hide the abbot shook his head this is a small place not like some as they are looking for you they will search thoroughly drummond dropped his blanket moved to the fireplace and shook the others awake quickly hamid sat up at once what is it trouble drummond nodded were about to have company well have to get moving again im afraid i will have your horses made ready the abbot said and he hurried out as father kerrigan and janet got to their feet hamid and drummond moved across to the shutters hamid opened one and peered out he closed it his face grim its snowing again how long are we going to last in the open on a night like this drummond turned to father kerrigan and janet standing by the fire if we stay cheung will catch us theres no doubt of that hell take this place apart looking for a hiding place thats all right jack father kerrigan said in a tired voice it isnt your fault the door opened and the abbot came in with one of the monks bundles of sheepskins in their arms a sheepskin coat for each of you our shepherds find them very useful at this time of the year as they pulled them on hamid said urgently is there anywhere we can go anywhere at all we wont last long on a night like this i think i can help you the abbot said ill show you as you leave kerim was still asleep janet lilted mm gently in her arms and the abbot led the way along the dark corridor to the courtyard at the rear a monk brought the horses forward and helped father kerrigan and janet into the saddle they all crossed to the gate and the abbot moved outside with them he pointed to the valley beyond this is the best way the only way eight miles and youre through to the other side of the mountain youll find a shepherds hut at the end with wood for a fire a lantern everything you need from there into the valley is easy five miles from the mountain and you will come to an indian border post powdery snowflakes were already beginnut to stick to their sheepskins as the small cavalcade moved away hamid leading janets horse father kerrigan behind thanks for everything drummond said the wind lifted snow around his legs as he walked away and the abbot called quietly do not worry my friend you will reach india the snow began to fall steadily till it filled the night and they were alone with it as they advanced towards the end of the narrow valley the going became heavier and drummonds feet sank ankledeep into the snow he walked with his head bowed against the wind alone with his thoughts and when a sharp stab of pain cut into his face he winced and came to a halt to his surprise he found that he was kneedeep in snow when he wrenched off a mitten and touched his face he felt caked snow and ice on his cheeks and his flesh had split in several places he frowned and pulled on his mitten and when he looked up saw that he was alone the wind was whipping the snow into a frenzy and it spun around his head and sliced at his cheeks until his face was so numb he could feel no pain how long since they had left the monastery an hoar two hours there was no knowing and as a horse whinnied somewhere near at hand he blundered forward he peered down at the ground and saw great slurred hoofprints leading away through the snow and stumbled forward halfbent so that he could follow them time had stopped and his frozen mind had difficulty ia thinking what to do next the wind was howling like a lost thing and he was completely covered with frozen snow until he no longer resembled an ordinary man he fell several times and each time lay in the snow for a little longer before getting up a terrible iron band settled around his chest and he seemed to be struggling for breath again he heard the whinny of a horse and then it appeared from the whirling darkness rearing up above his head father kerrigan falling over the hindquarters and knocking him to the ground as drummond sat up the wind carried the sound of the horses desperate cry and there was a coldness sweeping into his face a sense of space of limitless distance he crawled forward feeling the ground ia front of him and then ms hand touched nothing but air he crawled backwards turned and went back to the old man father kerrigan was on his hands and knees like an animal his body coated with snow and drummond heaved him to ms feet and they staggered forward it was no good he was on his knees the old man beside hm in the snow ms arms moving feebly drummond took a deep breath something deep inside some essential courage that refused to be beaten giving mm the strength to haul the old man to ms feet they stood there swaying together and then the other horse loomed out of the night hamid in the saddle what happened after that was something drummond could never really remember afterwards he was aware of hamid pulling the old man up across the saddle with a supreme effort of shouted directions that were snatched away by the wind and then the horse plunged forward taking him with it ms right hand hooked firmly around the saddle girth it was janet at the door of the hut with the lantern that savedthem and the light drew them out of the storm hamid slid to the ground pulling father kerrigan after him and staggered towards the door while drummond hung on to the horse it was no use as a sudden gust of wind slashed in from the valley driving razorsharp particles of ice before it the terrified animal reared up knocking drummond to the ground and galloped madly into the night he was on ms hands and knees again crawling towards the doorway and the wind seemed to have got inside ms brain dragging mm down into the whirling darkness the last round hb awakened slowly and lay for several moments staring up through the gloom trying to decide where he wasrealisation came suddenly and completely and he tried to sit up the hut was low roofed and built of blocks of rough stone he was lying on a pile of mouldy hay with bamid beside mm in the middle of the floor a fire burned brightly all his outer clothing had been removed and he was only wearing his underwear he had been covered with sheepskin coats and he pulled them aside and examined his swollen chapped hands gingerly he touched his face and winced as fingertips probed great splits in his flesh his right foot felt heavy and numb and when he sat up he saw that it had been bandaged he reached to touch it and hamid opened his eyes and pushed himself up on one elbow how do you feel bloody awful whats wrong with my foot a touch of frostbite nothing serious all your toes are still there if thats what youre thinking cant feel a damned thing manet gave you an injection something from the old mans medical kit drummond looked across to the other side of the fire to where janet father kerrigaa and the young khan slept peacefully how is he he had a heart attack when i got him inside last night luckily hed brought the right sort of drugs along and janet was able to give him an injection hes in pretty bad shape then couldnt walk another step and in case you dont remember we lost both horses last night he took a cheroot from his pocket broke it in two and handed drummond half the last one so make the most of it he walked to the door opened it slightly and peered out dawns coming and the snow seems to be lifting he returned to the fire and pulled on his boots til take a walk and find out exactly where we are the door closed behind him softly and a small trapped wind raced round the walls seeking an outlet and then died there was a sudden movement in the shadows on the other side of the fire and janet sat up jack are you all right fine he said softly alis gone to have a look round he started to dress fumbling over the buttons with ms swollen fingers and she threw some more wood on the fire hows your foot tm just beginning to feel it again td better give you another injection he was hardly aware of the needle going in how long will that last four or five hours he found the laces of his combat boots quite impossible and she tied them for him after fitting the right boot over the bandaged foot gently hows that fine he took her hand you look just about ready to fall down hows father kerrigan not too good im afraid he needs hospital treatment andtcerim she chuckled in better shape than the rest of us put together i think there was a sudden draught as the door opened then closed and hamid dropped by the fire cursing softly and holding his hands to the flames whats it like drummond said cold enough to freeze you to the ground but its stopped snowing what about getting out of here were in the hollow of a small plateau overlooking the lower slopes of the mountain according to the abbot its five miles down to the big valley and the indian border how rough is the going hamid shrugged impossible to teh its not quite dawa yet but it shouldnt take us more than a couple of hours even if conditions are bad its all downhill drummond got to his feet and swayed slightly suddenly lightheaded are you all right janet said anxiously he nodded and walked carefully to the door outside it was still dark but towards the east a pale grey light was lifting over the peaks he followed the line of hamids footsteps climbing up out of the hollow and stood on the rim looking down into the darkness of the valley after a while he turned and went back to the hut hamid glanced up at him as he dropped beside the fire well what do you think the old man will never make it we could carry him drummond shook his head wed have enough trouble getting ourselves down there on foot even janet would find it a struggle then what do we do hamid said we cant leave him there was a tired chuckle from the other side of the fire and father kerrigan said in afaint voice you havent any choice have you tm damned if i will drummond said if we assume that cheung and his men stayed overnight at the monastery because of the storm then weve got to expect that hell start out again at first light especially as its stopped snowing hes come this far he wont stop till he reaches the border and has to accept the inevitable so what do we do hamid said stay here and try to beat him off he picked up the garrand with one rifle whats your suggestion if we got to the border post fast enough we could get help and come straight back thats right for all we know they may have air support down there helicopters even theyre bound to be reinforcing the entire area in view of whats happened drummond stood there indecision on his face and janet said quietly hes right jack its the only plan that makes any sense ill stay here with father kerrigan now just wait a minute drummond began she shook her head her face grave tm staying jack he needs me but you must take kerim with you but why for gods sake drummond demanded well be coming back for all of you you may not be in time she stood before him arms hanging straight at her sides calm and determined her eyes very tired and then she smiled and there was all the love in the world there for him hurry back jack hurry back he reached blindly for her and hamid took him firmly by the arm were wasting time jack drummond turned and stumbled to the door and hamid offered her the rifle th leave you this she shook her head i couldnt use it ali shs said simply hamid stood there for a moment a frown oa ms face and then he slung the rifle over his back and went round the fire to where kerim slept beside the old priest swathed in his blankets he picked the boy up gently cradling him la his arms and father kerrigan smiled td take it as a personal favour if youd run all the way major hamid turned and went out the lump that rose in his throat threatening to choke him drummond was waiting outside and the pathan walked past him without speaking the boy held close to his chest drummond stumbled after him on the rim of the hollow he paused to look back at the hut janet was standing in the entrance she gazed towards him for a long moment and then went back inside the door closed with a strange finality and drummond turned and went down the slope after hamid progress was slow at first for on the upper slopes sheltered by a shoulder of the mountain the snow had not been swept away and had fallen in a deep blanket that made walking difficult drummond soon realised how weak he was they had not covered a mile before he was gritting his teeth and placing one foot in front of the other with a dogged persistence hamid seemed tireless and ploughed ahead through the snow without faltering but his face when they rested in the lee of a large boulder told another story kerims single eye over the edge of the blanket was round with wonder and hamid laughed i wonder how much of this hell remember in the years to come god knows drummond said hoarselyhere give him to me ill take him for a while hamid didnt even try to argue a bad sign and they started to walkagain the boy seemed heavy which was a strange thing and drummond held him close and leaned well back as he went down the slope another mile and his legs were trembling and when he tried to take another pace forward he overbalanced and rolled over and over down the mountainside he held on tight to the boy and the world spun and red sparks flashed before his eyes faintly through a great roaring he heard hamid calling to him aad he came to rest in a great drift of snow the boy was crying and hamid picked him up and brushed snow from his face as drummond got painfully to his feet hamids eyes seemed to have receded into their sockets and lines of fatigue were etched deeply into his face they didnt speak there was nothing to say he started to march the boy against his chest and drummond followed time no longer had any significance for drummond he placed oae foot doggedly in front of the other and after a while they left the slopes and struggled over a flat plain of deep snow halfway across they had to rest completely exhausted darkness had fled across the mountains and day had dawned grey and sullen more snow threatening in the heavy clouds as they finally struggled out of the deep snow and entered a thinly wooded stretch that sloped down to the valley bottom drummond sucked a piece of ice delighting in the coolness of it as it melted in his mouth and trickled down his throat and hobbled along in a strange trancelike mood it was with a sense of shock that he found himself lying in the snow the taste of it cold in his mouth and then a foot dug into his side and he heard hamids dead washedout voice get up jack i havent the strength to lift you he turned away and drummond with a supreme effort got to his feet and went after him he bowed his head and placed one foot in front of the other he repeated that simple action until he had lost count of time and suddenly heard a shout in front hamid had stopped on top of a slight rise twenty or thirty yards away and called to him in a strange cracked voice drummond broke into a stumbling run and reached the top of the rise in time to see hamid staggering down towards the camp in the hollow below there were field guns deeply entrenched supply trucks parked at the rear and a sprinkling of snowcovered huts men were flooding forward men in familiar uniforms and khaki turbans some riding supply mules they reached hamid and drummond saw him hand the boy carefully to a great bearded sikh he turned looked back at drummond took a single hesitant step and fell on his face in the mow drommond slid to the ground and sat there tears rolling down ms cracked cheeks as the soldiers moved towards him it was warm in the hut and he sat before the stove a blanket round his shoulders and sipped hot tea slowly holding the mug in both hands after a while the door to the other room opened and a young bengali medical corps sergeant came in how is he drummond asked tine the sergeant said hes fallen asleep now quite exhausted and the boy having a meal in the officers mess such as it is the sergeant laughed theres nothing wrong with that one he seems to have enjoyed himself if anything during the past few days more brandy drummond nodded and held out his mug how much longer will your commanding officer be he shouldnt be long now the main command post is only three miles away but since the snow of course were having to use mules the door swung open a cold wind whistling round the room and young lieutenant singh entered major narus coming now mr drummond thank god for that drummond got to his feet and hobbled to the window in time to see the major and an escort of two privates ride up on mules they dismounted and the major came up the steps to the hut brushing snow from his parka with both hands lieutenant singh opened the door for him and he came in and moved straight to the fire a tall handsome man with a clipped moustache mr drammond he pulled off ms gloves and held out a hand a pleasure to see you here sir believe me its a pleasure to be here major drummond said did lieutenant singh give you the whole story the major nodded we spoke over the field telephone where is major harold asleep in the other room hes done the work of ten men during the past few days and the young khan were looking after him in the officers mess sir lieutenant singh put in what about my friends major drummond saidwhen can we make a start i wanted to return with men and mules straight away but the lieutenant said he couldnt move without the good word from you major naru sighed tm afraid its rather morecomplicated than that the chinese invasion of balpur is something my government must handle with the greatest care an emergency session has already started at the united nations under these circumstances all units on the border have been ordered to avoid any confrontation with chinese units at whatever the cost it would be impossible for me to evenconsider sending a patrol into balpur territory but that huts no more than five miles from here drummond said with mules we could be there in less than an hour and time is vital as i explained to lieutenant singh colonel cheung could beat us to the punch all the more reason to avoid a situation which could lead to possible military action well see what major hamid has to say about this drammond said angrily and he moved to the door of the inner room major hamid is en officer of the indian army he will do what i have to do obey orders major narus voice cracked suddenly do you think im enjoying this mr drummond if i had my way id move over that border now with every man ive got he pulled on his gloves tm going to get in touch with headquarters by radio immediately if they give me the word fli lead my men in myself i promise you how long will that take to get a reply major naru shrugged an hour perhaps two it is something they will have to consider carefully he moved to the door and singh opened it for him i am sorry mr drummond the door closed behind them and drummond went to the window major naru walked across to the command post singh at his shoulder the three mules he and his escort had used were tethered outside drummond looked at them for a moment then made his decision the medical sergeant was standing by the stove his face troubled and drummond moved past him and opened the door to the inner room hamid lay on his back on one of the bunks breathing gently the harsh lines smoothed from his handsome face when they had carried him in someone had brought his rifle and it stood in the comer by the window drummond slung it over his back and looked down at hamid for a moment good luck ali he said softly and returned to the other room he uncorked the brandy bottle poured some into his mug and swallowed it quickly and the medical sergeant watched a frown on his face why the rifle mr drummond tra going for a little ride drummond said it might come in useful he went to the door and opened it the sergeant hurrying at his shoulder but this is madness drummond ignored him went down the steps pulling on his mittens and crossed to the mules as he unhitched them the medical sergeant ran past him mounted the steps to the command post and went inside drummond took his time lopped the reins of two of the mules to the pommel of the saddle of the third mounted and rode away he passed between the field guns men standing up to stare at him and then major kara and lieutenant singh emerged from the command post the medical sergeant at their backs and hurried after him as drummond passed the last gun emplacement they caught up with hup and major naru reached for the bridle of the mule he was riding i cant let you do this mr drummond then youd better start shooting drummond said calmly its the only way youre going to stop me he jerked the bridle from the majors grasp dug his heels into the mules flanks and moved forward when he reached the crest of the small hill and looked back into the hollow major naru was still standing there in front of the gun but lieutenant singh was running back towards the command post the clouds had dropped down towards the jagged peaks heavy with snow and as the mules moved out of the valley and started up the mountain the first few flakes started to fall drummond no longer felt tired but there was a strange singing inside his head perhaps the brandy talking and he was alone in a great white silence following the double track in the snow that he and hamid had made on their way down he pushed the mules as much as he could moving up into the white stillness towards the peaks as the snow continued to fall it was just under an hour after leaving the camp that he came out of a ravine on to the final slope and moved up towards the plateau from the rim of the plateau sheltered by a group of jagged rocks sergeant ng watched his progress from the moment he emerged from the ravine as drummond drew closer he turned and hurried down to colonel cheung who stood beside the horses outside the hut in the hollow below cheung looked tired and the skin of his face stretched tightly over his cheekbones was raw with frostbite one man coming with three mules sergeant ng said take the horses inside cheung told him and he moved up out of the hollow to the rim of the plateau he watched drummond for a full minute and there was no excitement in his heart he had failed utterly and completely and in pekin he would have to face the consequences of that failure but at least he would have something of value to take back with him he ran down into the hollow and went inside the hut the horses had crowded to the far end and were quietly feeding on the hay father kerrigan was sitting up on the other side of the fire janet standing beside him and ng waited by the door its drummond cheung said til stay down here you wait for him in the rocks on the edge of the hollow let him ride past you before you make your move do you want him alive ng asked calmly at all costs ng went out closing the door behind him and cheung drew his revolver he smiled gently across the fire at janet and father kerrigan it would be unwise for either of you to attempt to make the slightest noise do i make myself clear drummond came over the edge of the plateau and reined in it was a peaceful scene the hut standing below in the hollow smoke rising into the gently falling snow he had unslung the garrand as a precaution while still in the ravine and now it rested across the saddle in front of him he dug his heels into his mules flanks and started into the hollow he was perhaps half way down the slope when there was a commotion inside the hut the door was flung open and janet ran outside behind you jack she called behind you drummond released the two lead mules and jerked savagely on the bridle of his own mount pulling it round as sergent ng emerged from the rocks at the top of the hollow submachine gun in his hands he fired a warning burst into the air and drummonds mule reared throwing him over its hindquarters as he reached for the garrand he came to his knees in deep snow the garrand still in his hands the three mules milling around him sergeant ng crouched trying to get a clear view and drummond fired twice in rapid succession the bullets somersaulting the chinese back over the rocks as the mules broke away trotting down to the hut he turned and saw janet on one knee cheung holding her by the hair the barrel of his revolver rammed against her neck drummond walked forward the rifle at his hip and stopped a yard or two away let her and the old man go cheung take me i could be of real value more than you could ever realise no bargains jack quickly now cheungs voice was as soft as ever but quite implacable and as he thumbed back the hammer of his revolver drummond threw the garrand far away into the snow thats better as cheung released his hold janet came to her feet and ran into drummonds arms he held her close for a moment is father kerrigan all right she nodded what about m and kerim we reached the border safely but the indian army has strict orders about crossing over i had to come back alone how very fortunate for me cheung said and he pulled janet back against him youve caused me a great deal of trouble jack i tried to follow you from ladong gompa last night and got caught in the blizzard we had to turn back only sergeant ng and i made it i knew id be too late and yet i still came on this morning thats the kind of man i am father kerrigan and the girl cant be of any use to you let them go i wont give you any trouble they want you in pekin jack cheung said they know all about the work youve beendoing for ferguson when you stand before a military tribunal these two will stand beside you ill see to that personally drummond shook his head youll be facing your own tribunal colonel you lost the young khan remember something glowed in cheungs eyes he pushed the girl away from him and the revolver came up drummond tensed himself to spring knowing already that he was too late cheung took a deep breath and shook his head oh no jack nothing as easy as that i promise you somewhere horses plunged and snorted and a hard familiar voice called over here cheung hamid was already sliding from the back of a mule tip on the rim of the hollow an automatic rifle in his hands cheung turned crouching and hamid fired three times so quickly that they sounded like one the first shot catching cheung in the shoulder spinning him round the second and third driving him hard against the wall janet turned away quickly stumbling into drummonds arms as cheung struggled for life clawing for the revolver he had dropped and then blood erupted from his mouth in a bright flow and hecoughed once and lay still lieutenant singh came over the skyline on a mule reaching for the bridle of hamids mount following him down into the hollow hamid turned cheung over with his toe and looked down at him the face of the damned what happened drummond said i thought the indian army was supposed to stay on its own side of the border it still is hamid said young singh here woke me just after you left he thought i might have other ideas which i did being a young man of spirit he decided to come with me and major nam most unhappy do i detect the possibility of a court martial in the near future a matter of supreme indifference to either of us but in any event unlikely the newspapers wouldnt like it is father kerrigan all right as right as he ever win be the old priest said appearing in the doorway nothing that a bottle of jamiesons and a decent meal wouldnt cure then i suggest we take you to where we can obtain both items as quickly as possible poor naru will be most uncomfortable until we cross the border they brought out the horses and helped father kerrigan and janet into the saddle the old man looked down at cheung crossed himself and muttered a prayer as he moved off between singh and hamid and janet followed drummond was the last to leave and after hed mounted he sat on his mule for a moment or two looking down at cheung feeling strangely sad but nothing mattered now except that life began again and as he rode up towards janet waiting for him on the edge of the plateau he was smiling the end
