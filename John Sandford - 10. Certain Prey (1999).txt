chapter one clara rinker of the three unluckiest days in barbara allens life the first was the day clara rinker was raped behind a st louis nudie bar called zanadu which was located west of the city in a dusty checkerboard of truck terminals warehouses and light assembly plants zanadu as its chromeyellow billboard proclaimed was ez on ez off the same was not true of clara rinker despite what zanadus customers thought rinker was sixteen when she was raped a small athletic girl a dancer an ozarks runaway she had bottleblonde hair that showed darker roots and a body that looked wonderful in vnecked redpolkadotted thincotton dresses from k mart a body that drew the attention of cowboys truckers and other men who dreamt of nashville rinker had taken up nude dancing because she could it was that fuck for money or go hungry the rape took place at two oclock in the morning on an otherwise delightful april night the kind of night when midwestern kids are allowed to stay out late and play war when cicadas hum down from their elmbark hideaways rinker had closed the bar that night she was the last dancer up four men were still drinking when she finished three were houndfaced long distance truckers who had nowhere to go but the short beds in their various kenworths freightliners and peterbilts and a norwegian exoticanimal dealer drowning the sorrows of a recent mishap involving a box of boa constrictors and thirtysix thousand dollars worth of illegal tropical birds a fifth man a slopeshouldered gorilla named dalesomething had walked out of the bar halfway through rinkers last grind he left behind twelve dollars in crumpled ones and two small sweat rings where his forearms had been propped on the bar rinker had worked down the bartop stopping for ten seconds in front of each man for what the girls called a crack shot dalesomething had gotten the first shot and he had stood up and walked out as soon as she moved to the next guy when she was done rinker hopped off the end of the bar and headed for the back to get into her street clothes a few minutes later the bartender a university of missouri wrestler named rick knocked on the dressingroom door and said clara will you close up the back ill get it she said pulling a fuzzy pink tubetop over her head shaking her ass to get it down rick respected the dancers privacy which they appreciated it was purely a psychological thing since he worked behind the bar and spent half his night looking up their anyway he respected their privacy when she was dressed rinker killed the lights in the dressing room walked down to the ladies room checked to make sure it was empty which it always was and then did the same for the mens room which was also empty except for the ineradicable odor of beerflavored urine at the back door she snapped out the hall lights released the bolt on the lock and stepped outside into the soft evening air she pulled the door shut heard the bolt snap rattled the door handle to make sure that it was locked and headed for her car a rustedout dodge pickup crouched on the lot twothirds of the way down to her car a battered aluminum camper slumped on the back with curtains tangled in the windows every once in a while somebody would drink too much and would wind up sleeping in his car behind the place so the truck was not exactly unprecedented still rinker got a bad vibe from it she almost walked back around the building to see if she could catch rick before he went out the front almost but that was too far and she was probably being silly and rick was probably in a hurry and the truck was dark nothing moving dalesomething was sitting on the far side of it hunkered down in the pea gravel his back against the driversside door hed been waiting for twenty minutes with decreasing patience chewing breath mints thinking about her somewhere in the deep recesses of his mind breath mints were a concession to gentility as regarded women he chewed them as a favor to her when he heard the back door closing he levered his butt off the ground peeked through a car window saw her coming alone he waited crouched behind the car he was a big guy much of his bigness in fat but he took pride in his size anyway and he was quick rinker never had a chance when she stepped around the truck keys rattling in her hand he came out of the dark and hit her like an nfl tackle the impact knocked her breath out she lay beneath him gasping the gravel cutting her bare shoulders he flipped her over twisting her arms clamping both of her skinny wrists in one hand and the back of her neck in the other and he said his minty breath next to her ear you fuckin scream and ill break your fuckin neck she didnt fuckin scream because something like this had happened before with her stepfather she had screamed and he almost had broken her fuckin neck instead of screaming rinker struggled violently thrashing spitting kicking swinging twisting trying to get loose but dalesomethings hand was like a vise on her neck and he dragged her to the camper pulled open the door pushed her inside ripped her pants off and did what he was going to do in the flickering yellow illumination of the dome light when he was done he threw her out the back of the truck spit on her said fuckin bitch you tell anybody about this and ill fuckin kill ya that was most of what she remembered about it later lying naked on die gravel and getting spit on that and all the wiry hair on dales fat wobbling butt rinker didnt call the cops because that would have been the end of her job and knowing cops they probably would have sent her home to her stepdad so she told zanadus owners about the rape the brothers ernie and ron battaglia were concerned about both rinker and their bar license a nudie joint didnt need sex crimes in the parking lot jeez ron said when rinker told him about the rape thats terrible clara you hurt you oughta get yourself looked at you know ernie took a roll of bills from his pocket peeled off two hundreds thought about it for a couple of seconds peeled off a third and tucked the three hundred dollars into her backup tube top get yourself looked at kid she nodded and said you know i dont wanna go to the cops but this asshole should pay for what he did well take care of it ernie offered let me take care of it rinker said ron put up an eyebrow what do you want to do just get him down the basement for me he said something about being a roofer once he works with his hands ill get a goddamn baseball bat and bust one of his arms ron looked at ernie who looked at rinker and said that sounds about right next time he comes in huh they didnt do it the next time he came in which was a week later looking nervous and shiftyeyed like he might not be welcomed rinker refused to work with dalesomething at the bar and when she cornered ernie in the kitchen he told her that goddamnit they were right in the middle of tax season and neither he nor ron had the emotional energy for a major confrontation rinker kept working on them and the second time dalesomething showed up which was two days after tax day the brothers were feeling nasty they fed him drinks and complimentary peanuts and kept him talking until after closing rick the bartender hustled the secondtothelast guy out and left himself not looking back he knew something was up then ron came around the bar and ernie got dalesomething looking the other way and ron nailed him with a wild outoftheblue roundhouse right that knocked dale off the barstool ron landed on him rolled him and ernie raced around the bar and threw on a prowrestling death lock together they dragged a barely resisting dalesomething down the basement stairs the brothers had him on his feet and fully conscious by the time rinker came down carrying her aluminum baseball bat or rather tball bat which had a better swingweight for a small woman im gonna sue you fuckers for every fuckin dime you got dalesomething said sputtering blood through his split lip my fuckin lawyer is doin the money dance right now you fucks fuck you you aint doing shit ron said you raped this little girl what do you want clara ernie asked he was standing behind dale with his arms under dales armpits his hands locked behind dales neck you wanna arm or a leg rinker was standing directly in front of dalesomething who glowered at her im gonna he started rinker interrupted fuck legs she said she whipped the bat up and then straight back down on the crown of dalesomethings head the impact sounded like a fat man stepping on an english walnut ernie startled lost his death grip and dalesomething slipped to the floor like a twohundredpound blob of jello holy shit ron said and crossed himself ernie prodded dalesomething with the toe of his desert boot and dale blew a bubble of blood he aint dead ernie said rinkers bat came up and she hit dale again this time in the mastoid process behind the left ear she hit him hard her stepdad used to make her chop wood for the furnace and her swing had some weight and snap behind it that ought to do it she said ernie nodded and said yupthen they all looked at each other in the light of the single bare bulb and ron said to rinker some heavy shit clara how do you feel about this clara looked at dalesomethings body the little ring of black blood around his fat lips and said he was a piece of garbage you dont feel nothing ernie asked nothing her lips were set in a thin grim line after a minute ron looked up the narrow wooden stairs and said gonna be a load n half getting his ass outa the basement you got that right ernie said adding philosophically i coulda told him there aint no free pussy dalesomething went into the mississippi and his truck was parked across the river in granite city from which spot it disappeared in two days nobody ever asked about dale and rinker went back to dancing a few weeks later ernie asked her to sit with an older guy who came in for a beer rinker cocked her head and ernie said no its okay you dont have to do nothin so she got a longneck bud and went to sit with the guy who said he was ernies aunts husbands brother he knew about dalesomething you feeling bad about it yet nope im a little pissed that ernie told you about it though rinker said taking a hit on the budweiser the older man smiled he had very strong white teeth to go with his black eyes and almostfeminine long lashes rinker had the sudden feeling that he might show a girl a pretty good time although he must be over forty you ever shoot a gun he asked thats how rinker became a hit lady she wasnt spectacular like the jackal or one of those movie killers she just took care of business quietly and efficiently using a variety of silenced pistols mostlys careful close range killings became a trademark rinker had never thought of herself as stupid just as someone who hadnt yet had her chance when the money from the killings started coming in she knew that she didnt know how to handle it so she went to the intercontinental college of business in the mornings and took courses in bookkeeping and small business when she was twenty getting a little old for dancing nude she got a job with the mafia guy working in a liquor warehouse and when she was twenty four and knew a bit about the business she bought a bar of her own in downtown wichita kansas and renamed it the rink the bar did well still a few times a year rinkerd go out of town with a gun and come back with a bundle of money some she spent but most she hid under a variety of names in a variety of places one thing her stepdad had taught her well sooner or later however comfortable you might be at the moment you were gonna have to run carmel loan carmel was long sleek and expensive like a new jaguar she had a small head with a tidy nose thin pale lips a square chin and small pointed tongue she was a swede way back and blonde one of the whippet swedes with small breasts narrow hips and a long waist in between she had the eyes of a bird of prey a raptor carmel was a defense attorney in minneapolis one of the top two or three most years she made comfortably more than a million dollars carmel lived in a fabulously cool highrise apartment in downtown minneapolis all blondwood floors and white walls with blackandwhite photos by ansel adams and diane arbus and minor white but nobody as gauche and comelately as robert mapplethorpe amid all the blackandwhite there were perfect touches of bloodymurderred in the furniture and carpets and even her car a jaguar xk had a custom bloodymurderred paint job on the second of the three unluckiest days in barbara allens life carmel loan decided that she was truly genuinely and forever in love with hale allen barbara allens husband hale allen a property and realestate attorney was the definitive heartthrob he had nearblack hair that fell naturally over his forehead in little ringlets warm brown eyes a square chin with a dimple wide shoulders big hands and narrow hips he was a perfect size fortytwo a little over six feet tall with one slightly chipped front tooth the knot of his tie was always askew and women were always fixing it putting their hands on him he had an easyjock way with the women chatting them up playing with them hale allen liked women and not just for sex he liked to talk with them shop with them drink with them jog with them all without losing some essential lupine manliness he had given carmel reason to believe that he found her not unattractive whenever carmel saw him something deep inside her got plucked despite his looks and easy manner with women hale allen was not the sharpest knife in the dishwasher he was content with boilerplate law the arranging of routine contracts and made nowhere near as much money as carmel that made little difference to a woman whod found true love stupidity could be overlooked carmel thought if a woman felt a genuine physical passion for a man besides hale would look very good standing next to the stone fireplace at her annual christmas party a scotch in hand and perhaps a cheerful bloody murderred bowtie shed do the talking unfortunately hale appeared to be permanently tied to his wife barbara by her money cartnel thought barbara had a lot of it through her family and though hales cerebral filament might not burn as brightly as others he knew fifty million bucks when he saw them he knew where that sixteenhundreddollar black cashmere giorgio armani sportcoat came from allens tie to his wife or to her money anyway left few acceptable options for a woman of carmels qualities she wouldnt hang around and yearn or get weepy and depressed or drunk enough to throw herself at him shed do something like kill the wife five years earlier carmel had gone to court and had shredded the evidentiary procedures followed by a young st paul cop after a routine traffic stop had turned into a major drug bust her client rolando daquila had walked on the drug charge though the cops had taken ten kilos of cocaine from under the spare tire of his coffee brown continental the cops had wound up keeping the car under the forfeiture law but rolo didnt care about that what he cared about was that hed done exactly five hours in jail which was the time it took for carmel to organize the onepointthreemillion dollars in bail money and later when they walked away from the courthouse after the acquittal rolo told her that if she ever needed a really serious favor really serious to come see him because of previous conversations they both knew what he was talking about i owe you he said she didnt say no because she never said no she said see ya on a warm rainy day in late may carmel drove her second car an anonymous blueblack volvo station wagon registered in her mothers secondmarriage name to a ramshackle house in st pauls frogtown eased to the curb and looked out the passengerside window the woodenframe house was slowly settling into its overgrown lawn rain water seeped over the edges of its leafclogged gutters and peeling green paint showed patches of the previous color a chalky blue none of the windows or doors were quite level with the world square with the house or aligned with each other most of the windows showed glass a few had black screens carmel got a small travel umbrella from the back seat pushed the car door open with her feet popped the umbrella and hurried up the sidewalk to the house the inner door was open she knocked twice on the screen door which rattled in its frame and she heard rolo from the back come on in carmel im in the kitchen the interior of the house was a match for the exteriorthe carpets were twenty years old with paths worn through the thin pile the walls were a dingy yellow the furniture a crappy collection of plasticveneered plywood chipped along the edges of the tabletops and down the legs there were no pictures on the walls no decoration of any kind nailheads poked from picturehanging spots where previous tenants had tried a little harder everything smelled like nicotine and tar the kitchen was improbably bright there were no shades or curtains on the two windows that flanked the kitchen table and only two chairs one tucked tight to the table another pulled out rolo looking smaller than he had five years ago was dressed in jeans and a tshirt that said enigmatically jesus he had both hands in the kitchen sink just cleaning up for the occasion he said he wasnt embarrassed at being caught at housecleaning and a thought flicked through carmels lawyerhead he should be embarrassed sit down he said nodding at the pulledout chair i got some coffee going im sort of in a rush she started you dont have time for coffee with rolando he was flicking water off his hands and he ripped a paper towel off a roll that sat on the kitchen counter wiped his hands dry and tossed the balledup towel toward a waste basket in the corner it hit the wall and ricocheted into the basket two he said she glanced at her watch and reversed herself on the coffee sure ive got a few minutes ive come a long way down huh she glanced once around the kitchen shrugged and said youll be back i dont know he said i got my nose pretty deep in the shit so take a program yeah a program he said and laughed twelve steps to jesus then apologetically i only got caffeinated only kind i drink she said and then so you made the call not a question rolo was pouring coffee into two yellow ceramic mugs the kind carmel associated with lake resorts in the north woods yes and shes still working and shell take the job she its a woman yeah i was surprised myself i never asked you know i only knew who to call but when i asked my friend said she shes gotta be good carmel said shes good she has a reputation never misses very efficient very fast always from very close range so theres no mistake rolo put a mug of coffee in front of her and she turned it with her fingertips and picked it up thats what i need she said and took a sip good coffee very hot youre sure about this rolo said he leaned back against the kitchen counter and gestured with his coffee mug once i tell them yes itll be hard to stop this woman the way she moves nobody knows where she is or what name shes using if you say yes she kills barbara allen carmel frowned at the sound of barbara allens name she hadnt really thought of the process as murder she had considered it more abstractly as the solution to an otherwise intractable problem of course she had known it would be murder she just hadnt contemplated the fact im sure she said youve got the money at the house i brought your ten she put the mug down dug in her purse pulled out a thin deck of currency and laid it on the table rolo picked it up riffled it expertly with a thumb ill tell you this he said when they come and ask for it pay every penny every penny dont argue just pay if you dont they wont try to collect theyll make an example out of you i know how it works carmel said with an edge of impatience theyll get it and nobodyll be able to trace it because ive had it stashed its absolutely clean rolo shrugged then if you say yes ill call them tonight and theyll kill barbara allen this time she didnt flinch when rolo spoke the name carmel stood up yes she said do it rinker came to town three weeks later she had driven her own car from wichita then rented two differentcolored differentmake cars from hertz and avis under two different names using authentic missouri drivers licenses and perfectly good paidup credit cards she stalked barbara allen for a week and finally decided to kill her on the interior steps of a downtown parking garage in the week that rinker trailed her allen had used the garage four times and all four times had used the stairs to get to the skyway level once in the skyway shed gone straight to an office with the name star of the north charities on the door when rinker knew that allen was not at star of the north shed called and asked for her im sorry shes not here do you expect her shes usually here for an hour or two in the morning just before lunch thanks ill try again tomorrow barbara allen on the last of the three unluckiest days of her life she got out of bed showered and ate a light breakfast of raisin bran and strawberries with hale for a husband it paid to watch her figure as the housekeeper cleared away the breakfast dishes allen turned on the television to check the dow jones opening numbers sat at her desk and reviewed proposed charitable allocations from the star of the north charities trust then at ninethirty gathered her papers pushed them into a tan coach briefcase and headed downtown rinker in a red jeep cherokee followed her until she was sure that allen was heading downtown then passed her and hurried ahead allen was a slow careful driver but traffic and traffic lights were unpredictable and rinker wanted to be at least five minutes ahead of her by the time they got downtown rinker had picked out another parking garage also on the skyway system a little less than a twominute fast walk from the killing ground she wheeled into the garage parked walked to her own car which shed parked in the garage earlier that morning and climbed into the back seat she glanced up and down the ramp saw one man leaving heading toward the doors she reached down grabbed the carpeting behind the passenger seat and popped open a shallow steel box which held two remington semiautomatic pistols silencers already attached on a bed of styrofoam peanuts rinker was wearing a loose shift with a homemade elastic girdle beneath it she pushed thes into the wide pockets of the shift through another slit cut through the insides of the pockets and into the girdle thes were held tight against her body but she could get them out in a halfsecond with the guns tucked away rinker hopped out of the car and headed for the skyway barbara allen a sturdy german blonde with short expensively cut hair a dab of lipstick a crisp white cotton blouse a navy skirt and matching navy low heels went into the stairwell of the sixth street parking garage at am halfway down she met a small woman coming up a redhead as she passed her looking down the other woman smiled and allen who knew about such things looked at the top of her head and thought wig that was the last thing she thought on the unluckiest day of her life rinker climbing the stairs had mistimed it she knew the lower ramp was clear and wanted to take allen low but allen came down the narrow steps slowly and rinker now in plain sight didnt feel she should stop and wait for her so she continued climbing allen smiled and nodded at her as they passed and as they passed rinker pulled the righthand pivoted and fired it into the back of allens head from a range of two inches allens hair puffed out as though somebody had blown on it and she started to fall the silencers were good the loudest noise in the stairwell was the cycling of the pistols action rinker got off a second shot before allen fell too far then stepped down to the sprawled body and fired five more shots into allens temple as she stepped away from the body ready to head down the stairs a cop came through the door in the stairwell above them he was in uniform a heavy guy carrying a manila folder rinker had thought about this possibility a surprise from a cop though shed never experienced anything like it still shed rehearsed it in her mind hey the cop said he put up a hand and rinker shot him chapter two baily dobbs first day on patrol had taught him that police work was more complicated than hed thought and more dangerous than hed expected baily had seen police work as a way to achieve a certain authority a status he hadnt thought about fighting people bigger than he was about drunks vomiting in the back seat of the squad about freezing his ass off outside the target center when the wolves were playing so baily resolved to keep his head down to volunteer for nothing to show up late for trouble calls and to get off the street as fast as he could he was inside in less than two years one halloween responding late ѓeto a domestic hed walked up a dark sidewalk stepped on the back axle of a tricycle flipped into the air and twisted his knee he was never exactly disabled but it became clear that if he couldnt run he couldnt work the streets his hobbling progress around a gymnasium track baffled the docs and amused his former partners the phrase im gonna baily on that came into the vocabulary of the minneapolis police department baily went inside and stayed there he still wore a uniform carried a gun and got paid for being a cop but he was a clerk and happy with it which is why he didnt respond as quickly as he might have when he saw rinker execute barbara allen his cop reflexes were gone bailys lunch started at eleven oclock but on this day hed taken some under time he snuck out through the basement of city hall into the country government building carrying a manila folder that contained a few sheets of paper addressed to a court bailiff his coveryourass file if he was spotted by his supervisor once in the government building he took a quick look around then dodged into the skyway that went over to the sixth street parking garage from there he planned to take the stairs to the street level cross over to the hennepin country medical center which had a nice discreet cafeteria rarely visited by cops hed eat a cheeseburger and fries enjoy a few cups of coffee read the newspapers then amble back to city hall just in time for lunch that perfectly good plan fell apart when he stepped into the stairwell two women were in the stairwell below him and one of them a redhead appeared to be sticking something in the ear of the other who was lying on the stairs hey he said the redhead looked up at him and in the next quartersecond baily realized that what she had in her hand was a pistol the pistol came up and baily put a hand out and the redhead shot him there wasnt much noise but he felt something hit his chest and he fell down backwards he fell in the doorway which saved his life rinker standing below him on the stairs looking over the sights of her pistol couldnt see anything but the bottoms of his feet baily groaned as he fell and he dimly heard a mans voice call are you all right rinker had taken two quick steps toward him to finish him when she heard the new voice complications were increasing quick as a blink she decided down was safe she went down not running but moving fast baily struggled to sit upright to crawl away from the stairwell and heard a door bang closed in the stairwell below his chest hurt and so did his hand he looked at his hand and it was all scuffed up apparently from the fall then he discovered the growing blood stain on the pocket of his white uniform shirt oh man he said the other voice called again hey you okay oh jesus oh god jesus god said baily who was not a religious man he tried to push himself up again noticed his hand was slippery with blood and started to cry oh jesus he looked up the ramp where a man carrying a briefcase was looking down at him a woman was beyond him also coming toward them he could sense her reluctance help me baily cried help me ive been shot sloan banged into lucas davenports office and said baily dobbss been shot he looked at his watch twelve minutes ago lucas was peering glumly into a sixhundredpage report with a blue cover and white label which said mayors select commission on cultural diversity alternative lifestyles and otherabledness in the minneapolis police department a preliminary approach to divergent modalities which hed been marking with a fluorescentyellow highlighter he was on page seven he put down the report and said incredulously our baily dobbs how many baily dobbs are there sloan asked lucas stood up and reached for a navyblue silk jacket which hung from a governmentissue coat tree is he dead no an accident he shoot himself sloan shook his head sloan was a thin man hatchetfaced dressed in shades of brown and tan a homicide investigator the best interrogator on the force an old friend looks like he walked in on a shooting over in the sixth street parking garage he told lucas the shooter killed a woman and then shot baily i figured since rose marie and lester are out of town and nobody can find thorn you better haul your ass over to the hospital lucas grunted and he pulled on the jacket rose marie roux was the chief of police lester thorn and lucas were deputy chiefs anything on the shooter no well baily said something about it being a woman the shooter was the woman she shot is dead and baily took two rounds in the right tit last goddamn guy in the world lucas said lucas was tall lean but not thin broadshouldered and darkcomplected a scar sliced across one eyebrow onto his cheek and showed as a pale line through his summer tan like a vagrant strand of white thread another scar showed on the front of his neck over his windpipe just above the v of his royalblue golf shirt he took a in a cliprig out of his desk drawer and clipped it inside his pants under the jacket he did it unconsciously as another man might put a wallet in his back pocket how bad is he hes going into surgery sloan said swansons over there but thats all i know lets go lucas said does anybody know what dobbs was doing in the stairwell the other people in the office say he was probably sneaking over to hennepin medical for a cheeseburger hed pretend he was going to the government center then hed sneak over to the hospital and drink coffee and read the papers thats the baily we know and love lucas said the emergency room was a warm fourminute fast walk from city hall a cop was shot hurt bad but life went on the sidewalks were crowded with shoppers the streets clogged with cars and sloan intent on making it to the hospital nearly got hit in an intersection lucas had to hook his arm and pull him back youre too ugly to be a hood ornament lucas grunted the emergency room was oddly quiet lucas thought usually after a cop shooting thirty people would be milling around no matter who the cop was here there were three other cops a couple of nurses and a doc all standing around in the alcoholscented reception area nobody seemed to be doing much place is empty sloan said picking up the thought word hasnt got out yet lucas said one of the three other cops was talking on the phone while a second a uniform sergeant talked into his ear swanson a blandfaced overweight homicide detective in a grey suit was leaning on a fluidsproof countertop talking to a nurse a notebook open on the counter he saw lucas with sloan a step behind and lifted a hand wheres baily lucas asked hes about to go in swanson said meaning surgery they already got the sedative going so they can plug in the airway shit he wont be talking the surgeons down the hall scrubbing up if you wanna talk to him anybody tell bailys wife were looking for the chaplain swanson said hes at a church thing up on the north side some kind of yard sale dicks on hold for him now he nodded at the cop on the phone well get him in the next couple of minutes lucas turned to sloan get the chaplain going send a car lights and sirens sloan nodded and headed for the cop on the phone lucas turned back to swanson whats going on at the scene goddamndest thing woman was executed i think executed she took at least four or five in the head with a smallcaliber pistol short range you can see the tattooing on her scalp swanson said nobody heard a thing which might mean a silencer everything in that stairwell echoes like crazy off that concrete and baily told me he couldnt remember hearing the gun baily saw the shooter but all he remembered was that it was a woman and she was a redhead nothing else no age no weight nothing we figure the shooter was white if she was a redhead but shit therere probably five thousand redheads downtown everyday whos working it sherrill and black i heard about it first call and ran over took a quick look at the dead woman and then came over here with baily and the paramedics so the dead womans still over there swanson nodded yeah she was waydead we didnt even think about bringing her in okay you say the docs scrubbing dan wong right down the hall by the way baily says he was only shot once but the docs say hes got two slugs in him so much for eyewitnesses lucas said yeah but it means that this chick is fast and accurate the holes are a half inch apart of course she missed his heart if she was shooting for it if it was a thats what it looked like then she might have been worried about punching through his breastbone swanson shook his head nobodys that good i hope not lucas said lucas brushed past a nurse who made a desultory effort to slow him down and found wong up to his elbows in green soap wong turned and said uhoh the cops how bad is it lucas asked not too bad wong said going to work on his fingernails hes gonna hurt for a while but ive seen a hell of a lot worse two slugs in the pictures they look pretty deformed so they were probably hollowpoints they went in at his right nipple lodged under the right scapula two little holes he hardly bled at all though his body fat makes it a little hard to tell whats going on his blood pressures good looks like some goddamn gangbanger with a pieceofcrap so hes gonna be okay lucas could feel the tension backing off unless he has a heart attack or a stroke wong said hes way too fat and he was panicking when they brought him in the surgery i could do with my toes so whatu i tell the press wong is doing surgery with his toes wong shrugged as he rinsed hes in surgery now listed in guarded condition but hes expected to recover barring complications you gonna talk to them afterwards i got a two oclock teetime at wayzata wong said he flicked water off his hands and stepped away from the sink you might have to skip it lucas said bullshit i dont get invited all that often danny ill give them a few minutes wong said now if youll get your germ infested ass out of here ill go to work randall thorn the newlypromoted deputy chief for patrol showed up ten minutes later fifteen cops stood around the emergency area now the crowd was beginning to gather i was all the way down by the goddamn airport he told lucas his uniform showed sweat rings under his armpits how is he lucas briefed him quickly then sloan came over and said the chaplains on his way to bailys house he oughta notify the old lady in the next five minutes or so lucas nodded and looked back at thorn can you hold the fort here i ran over because rose marie is gone and i knew you and lester were out of the house but hes sort of your guy thorn nodded ill take it you going over to the scene for a minute or two lucas said i want to get a picture in my head thorn nodded and said you know what picture i cant get in my head baily dobbs getting shot last goddamn guy in the world lucas finished for him if the emergency room had seemed unnaturally calm the sixth street parking ramp looked like a lawenforcement convention a dozen homicide and uniform cops medical examiners personnel a deputy mayor the parkinggarage manager and two possible witnesses were standing in the skywaylevel elevator lobby and the stairwell above it lucas nodded at one of the uniform cops controlling the traffic and he and sloan poked their heads into the stairwell marcy sherrill and tom black were going through the victims purse the victim herself was lying on the stairs at their feet her skirt was pulled up over her ample thighs showing nude panty hose one hand bent awkwardly away from her face she might have broken her arm when she landed lucas thought and her eyes were frozen halfopen a pool of blood coagulated under her stillperfect hairdo her face was vaguely familiar she looked like she might have been a nice lady sherrill turned and saw lucas and said shyly hi hey lucas said nodding he and sherrill had ended a sixweek romance or as sherrill put it forty days and forty nights of sex disputation they were now in the awkward phase of no longer seeing each other while they were still working together looks nasty he added the stairwell smelled of damp concrete overlaid with the coppery odor of blood and human intestinal gas which was leaking out of the body sherrill glanced down at the body and said gonna be a strange one swanson said she was executed sloan said she was bigtime said black they all looked down at the body arranged around their feet like a puddle i can see seven entry wounds but no exits you dont need to be no forensic scientist to see that the gun was close maybe an inch away who is she lucas said barbara paine allen shes got a notify card in her purse looks like her husbands a lawyer i know her face from somewhere and the name rings a bell lucas said i think she might be somebody sherrill and black both nodded and sherrill muttered great lucas squatted next to the dead woman for a moment looking at her head the bullet wounds were small and tidy as though shed been repeatedly stabbed with a pencil there were two wounds high on the back of her head and a cluster of five in her temple her heart had kept pumping for a while after she landed a thin stream of drying blood ran down from each of the holes the seven thin streams were neatly defined which meant that she hadnt moved after she hit the stairs professional and very tidy lucas thought he stood up and asked the other two you got witnesses besides baily baily said the shooter was a redheaded woman and weve got two people who say they saw a redheaded woman walking away from the scene close to the time of the shooting no good description she was wearing sunglasses they said both of them said she was wiping her nose or sneezing into a handkerchief covering her face lucas said i dont believe this shit sloan said looking down at barbara allen people dont get hit not in minneapolis sherrill said not by a pro said black lucas scratched his chin and said but she did i wonder why are you buyin in sherrill asked could be an interesting trip dont have the time lucas said i have the otherness commission maybe if we find the shooter we could get her to kill the commission theyre not killable lucas said gloomily they come straight from hell well keep you updated sherrill said do that lucas shook his head and looked back down at the cooling body and he said aloud again i wonder why chapter three barbara allen was killed a month to the day after carmel loan took out the contract on her when word of the murder swept through the firm carmel immediately told herself that she had nothing to do with it shed made the arrangement so long ago that it hardly counted carmel learned of the killing as she sat reading the deposition of a latenight dogwalker who claimed that he saw rockwell miller her client go into the back of his failing steak house with a fivegallon can of gasoline the prosecution would argue that it was the same gas can found by the arson squad in the shambles of the restaurants basement the fire had been so hot that it had melted the fire extinguishers in the kitchen carmel was looking for what she called a peel if she could get her fingernails under some aspect of a story or some aspect of a witness she could peel the testimony back and damage the witnesses credibility shed begun to think that she could peel the dogwalker he was divorced and carried two convictions for domestic assault which hurt any witness if there were enough women on the jury she could get the women all right the problem was getting the assault conviction before the jury since the average judge might mistakenly consider it irrelevant the dogwalker lived near the restaurant and knew the restaurant owner by sight had the dogwalker and his exwife ever eaten at the restaurant had they ever had an argument in the restaurant when they were breaking up might the dog walker have bad feelings about the restaurant or its owner even if they were unconscious it was all bullshit but if she could implicitly ask can you believe the testimony of an admitted brutal wifebeater of twelve women good and true that would be a definite peel she was dialing her client when her secretary stuck her head into carmels office unannounced and asked did you hear about hale allens wife carmels heart jumped into her throat and she dropped the phone back on its base no what she asked she was one of the topthree defense attorneys in the twin cities and her face showed all the emotion of a woman who has been asked the outside temperature shes been killed murdered the secretary couldnt quite keep the relish out of her voice in a downtown parking garage the police are saying it was a professional assassination like a mob hit carmel hushed her voice while letting the natural interest show through barbara allen the secretary stepped in and let the door close behind her jane roberts said the cops came and got hale and they rushed to the hospital but it was too late she was already dead oh my god the poor woman carmels hand went to her throat and she thought didnt do this and she also thought was sitting right here where everybody could see me were thinking we should get some money together and send some flowers the secretary said do that thats a good idea carmel said she found her purse beside her desk and dug inside ill start it with a hundred she rolled the cash out on the desk is that enough late that afternoon on the openair balcony of her fabulous apartment a gin andtonic in her hand carmel worried gnawed a thumbnail a bad habit shed carried with her since grade school chewing the nail down to the quick for the first time since the infatuation with hale allen had begun she stepped outside of herself and looked back shed often told her clients those who were moreorless professional criminals that they could never think of all the possible ways to screw up a crime however many ways you cover yourself theres always some way that you are not covered carmel had considered the possibility of killing barbara allen herself shed never killed anything before but the thought didnt particularly bother her she could pull the trigger all right but the devil was in the details and there were too many details how would she get a gun if she bought one thered be a record of the purchase she could use it and throw it away but if the cops came asking for it the dog ate it would be insufficient she could steal one but she could get caught stealing it and shed have to steal it from one of two or three people she knew who had guns and that might point a finger at her she could try to come up with a fake id a crime in itself but she was memorable enough that a gunstore clerk asked later about the purchaser might well remember her especially if prompted by a photo then there was the killing itself she could do it she could do anything she put her mind to but as shed warned her clients mistakes accidents or even random chance could ruin even the bestplanned crime with murder in the state of minnesota a mistake accident or random error meant spending thirty years in a nonfabulous room the size of a bathtub in the end shed decided the least risky way was to go with a pro she had plenty of untraceable cash stashed in her bank deposit box and she had rolando daquila the connection she also had a safety margin neither her connection nor the shooter could tell the cops about their involvement because that would make them as guilty of firstdegree murder as carmel herself was the shooter even if she were eventually run down would be eminently defensible in court as a competent professional she was unlikely to leave obvious clues and would have no apparent previous connection with the victim so carmel was probably safe but after a few moments of reflection drink in hand she decided to stay away from hale allen for a while let him recover from the murder let the cops talk to him they would of course since shed never demonstrated her infatuation to hale there was no reason to think shed become involved from that direction she was working out the various possibilities her thumbnails red with blood and raw when rinker called the line was carmels unlisted homebusiness number and nobody called who didnt already know her yes she said picking up the receiver i need to get some money from you the woman on the other end had a dry mid south or texas accent the corners of words bitten off but there was also an undertone of good humor are you okay carmel asked im just fine you make me a little nervous carmel said id prefer to see you in a public place the woman chuckled a pleasant homey sound rattling down the phone line and she said you lawyers worry too much and you aint gonna see me honey maybe carmel said so how will we do it you have the money with you yes thats what rolo said good get in your volvo drive down to the university of minnesota parking lot at huron and fourth street thats a big open lot lots of students coming and going theres a ticketdispensing machine at the entrance park as far as you can from the pay booth but park in a spot where there are other cars around you dont lock the drivers side door leave the money in a sack one of those brown grocery sacks would be best on the floor on the drivers side walk over to washington avenue do you know your way around over there yes i went to school there shed spent seven years at the university good walk over to washington then walk down to the river after you get to the river its up to you whenever you want walk back to the car ill lock it when i leave it and all the time youll be out in the open in public safe what if somebody takes the money before you get there again the pleasant chuckle nobody will take the money carmel the woman said carmul while carmel always pronounced it carmel when right now howd you know i have a volvo ive been watching you offandon for a week or so you drove it down to that rainbow store the day before yesterday i wouldnt have bought that sweet corn myself it looked a couple of days too old it was carmel said ill be there in fifteen minutes carmel did exactly as rinker asked taking an extra few minutes in her walk along the mississippi when she got back to the car the door was locked and the money was gone she drove straight back to her apartment and when she walked in the phone was ringing this is me the dry voice said i hope everything went all right carmel said went fine im leaving town but i wanted you to know that your credit is good do you have a pencil yes if you ever need me again call this number the woman recited a phone number with a area code that carmel recognized as downtown washington dc and leave a message on the voice mail that says call patricia case patricia case then ill call you back within a day i dont think ill ever need this dont count on it you lawyers have strange ways okay and thanks thank you click and the dry voice was gone the phone rang again before she had a chance to turn away carmel and for the second time that day her heart was in her throat yes this is hale then like she might not be able to sort out her hales he added allen hale my god i heard about barbara how terrible she leaned into the telephone vibrating with the urgency of the emotion tears started at the inner corners of her eyes poor barbara poor hale a tragedy carmel god i dont know im so screwed up hale allen said now the police think maybe i had something to do with it the murder thats crazy carmel said absolutely they keep asking about how much money ill inherit and barbs parents are saying all this crazy stuff thats terrible he needed help and he was calling her look what im calling to ask is could you handle this for me could you deal with the police youre the best i know of course she said briskly where are you now im at home im sitting here with all of barbs stuff i dont know what to do sit right there carmel said ill be there in half an hour dont talk to any more cops if anyone calls tell them to talk to me wont that make them suspicious not the sharpest knife they already are suspicious hale i know exactly where theyre coming from its stupid but thats the way they think so give them my office number and this number and do not do not talk to them okay he sounded better already half an hour oh god the thing about hale allen she thought was his hands he had these big competentlooking hands with clean square nails and fine dark fuzz on the first joints of his fingers a hint of the underlying masculinity he had beautiful thick hair and wonderful shoulders and his brown eyes were so expressive that when he concentrated on her carmel felt weak but it was the hands that did it and did it one afternoon in a nice lawyer bar with lots of plants in copper kettles and antique dressers used as serving tables thered been three or four of them sitting around a table different firms no agenda just gossip hed been laughing with those great white teeth and hed looked deep into her a few times all the way she felt to the bottom of her panty hose but the main thing was hed been drinking something light and white a california chardonnay maybe and he kept turning the wine glass in those strong fingers and carmel had begun to vibrate theyd been together two dozen times since but always in social situations and never too long she thought though that he must know somewhere in his soul now with this call she took fifteen minutes with her makeup making it invisible and after applying the lightest touch of chanel no she went down to the parking garage and climbed into the jaguar she forgot all about her resolution to stay away hale allen needed her chapter four lucas felt light psychologically light nothing left to lose he hadnt spoken seriously with a woman since his breakup with marcy sherrill and he felt good hed been working out shooting some hoops running through the neighborhood though he could feel it in his knees if he did more than five miles age coming on money in the bank all bills paid the job under control except for the cultural commission even that had a calming effect on him like a boring concert where the music never changed the commission gave him three hours a week in which he had to sit still his brain in neutral his motor idling he couldnt get away with sleeping during the meetings but hed managed to catch up on his reading earlier in the year before the forty days and forty nights hed felt himself on shaky ground poised between sanity and another bout of depression marcy sherrill had changed that at least he felt as good as he could remember if somewhat detached disengaged floating his oldest childhood friend a nun who was also a professor at st annes college had gone on a summer mission to guatemala giving thanks for a successful recovery from a terrible beating half of his friends were on vacation crime improbably was down across the board and it was summer a good one lucas had been working four days a week spending the threeday weekends at his cabin in wisconsin five years past a northwoods neighbor a flatnosed guy from chicago had stocked a pond with largemouth bass now the pond was getting good every morning early morning lucas would walk a halfmile over to the chicago guys house push an old green flatbottomed john boat into the water and throw poppers and streamer flies at the lily pads until the sun got high the weight of the world dissolved in the mirror flashes of the smooth black water the smell of the summer pollen hot in the sun the sun on his shoulders ѓeand the stillness of the woods barbara allen had been killed on a thursday lucas tucked the memory of her sightless upsidedown body into a large mental file stuffed with similar images and closed the file on thursday night he left for the cabin he missed fridays paper but saw a pioneer press in a hayward store window on saturday morning the main page one story was headlined husband questioned in heiress slaying on sunday the startribunes frontpage piece started under a headline that said allen murder baffles police while the pioneer press went with allen murder puzzles cops lucas said to himself uhoh on monday morning he walked whistling into city hall and bumped into sherrill and black you were gonna keep me updated he said thats right black said as they clustered in the hall we were heres your update we aint got dick thats not entirely true sherrill said with an edge of impatience theres a really really good chance that hale allen did it paid for it well good lucas said jingling his office keys this was somebody elses job ship his ass out to stillwater ill call ahead and reserve a cell im serious sherrill said we looked at him all weekend and we found out three things one the first thing he did after we talked to him is he called carmel loan ouch lucas said he knew carmel if you were a cop pushing a marginal case or a difficult one you didnt want carmel on the other side which doesnt make him guilty of anything but common sense black observed mildly second sherrill said hes gonna inherit something like thirty or forty million dollars tax free so much that we cant even find out how much it is her parents say the marriage was in trouble and that divorce was a possibility nothing solid on the divorce lucas asked the way you said that nothing solid sherrill said grudgingly the thing is if hale allen is convicted of killing his wife he cant inherit the money would probably go to her parents who dont need it but would definitely like it black said cant ever be too rich or too thin as the duchess of windsor once told me in a personal communication the money didnt come from them in the first place lucas asked black shook his head nope the greatgrandparents were timber barons here and land speculators in florida the money comes down through a whole bunch of trusts its hers her parents got theirs the same way hasnt one of them worked a day in their lives third lucas asked looking at sherrill he added the first two werent so good sherrill said three hes fuckin a secretary in his firm hes been doing it for a couple of years and push was coming to shove she was gonna go see the old lady and tell her about the affair allen was stalling but the hammer was comin down lucas looked at black now thats something black shrugged yeah thats something though they usually kill the girlfriend not the wife lucas said going back to sherrill sherrill shrugged it off not always you look at the girlfriend yeah she was working when barbara allen was hit taking shorthand in a conference about some guys will shes got about six hundred and fifty dollars in her bank account so we figure she probably didnt hire a pro maybe she saw a movie lucas said or read one of those murder for dummies books said black what about allenyou hit him with the girlfriend lucas asked not yet sherrill said she looked at her watch were gonna do it in about ten minutes by the way black added we should also update you on the feebs the feebs are they in this lucas eyebrows went up maybe they want a meet so were walking over this afternoon black said got some guy in from washington the nations capital sherrill said you wanna come black asked we could use some of that deputychief bullshit that special shine they love you so much anyway sherrill concluded give me a call lucas said ill be around all afternoon carmel loan wearing bloodyred lipstick arrived at city hall to find hale allen sitting in the homicide office across a grey metal desk from black and sherrill the homicide office looked like a movie set for a smalltown newspaper why are we here she asked taking charge she dropped her purse on blacks desk pushing aside some of his papers a calculated move she was the important one here i thought we covered everything on friday and when are you going to release mrs allen we need to make arrangements well release her as soon as the chemistry gets back which should be this afternoon or tomorrow black said were rushing it you know the sensitivity of the issue carmel said leaning into him she had an effect on most men black was a notquiteoutofthecloset gay and the effect was blunted of course black said with equanimity were doing everything we can so whyre we here carmel pulled a chair over from another desk sat solidly in the middle of it turned to allen before black or sherrill could answer and asked howre you feeling he shrugged not so good i cant catch my breath we need to get something going on the funeral he was absolutely gorgeous carmel thought the weariness around his eyes added a depth he hadnt seemed to possess before a certain fascinating sadness so she said turning to sherrill what sherrill leaned across the desk and asked allen do you plan to marry louise clark allen sat back as though hed been slapped carmel took one look at him instantly understood the question fought down a surge of insane anger and blurted whoa no more questions hale out in the hall when they were gone sherrill looked at black and grinned he didnt tell her carmel literally saw red as though blood clots had drifted over her pupils in the corridor outside homicide she grabbed hale allen by his coat lapel and shoved him against the wall she was not a large woman but she pushed hard and allens shoulder blades were pressed against the stone what the fuck are they telling me she hissed who is louise clark shes a secretary allen mumbled ive been sleeping with her i guess you guess carmel demanded you dont know for sure yeah i know i should have told you allen said but i didnt think anybody would find out jesus h christ how dumb are you how dumb what else didnt you tell me are you fuckin anybody else no no no god i hate that word fucking carmel closed her eyes for a moment she couldnt believe this she could believe that he was sleeping with another woman she just couldnt believe that an actual lawyer could be this damn dumb you have a law degree she asked opening her eyes from an actual college carmel i dont ah shut up she said she turned away took a couple of steps then swung around to face him i oughta quit if i werent a friend of yours and barbaras i would quit im sorry allen stuttered ive told you everything else honest to god carmel let out a breath all right i can yell at you later and i will now tell me about this louise clark are you gonna marry her allen shook his head no no it was never like that it was physical shes really into sex shes a goddamn sex machine what can i tell you she kept hitting on me and finally one day we had a closing on a motel over in little canada and one of the rooms was unlocked ah man carmel pressed the heel of her hand against her forehead what youve heard the word motive right its a legal term often used by lawyers i didnt know barbara was gonna get murdered for christs sake allen said his voice rising a little angry now flushing tousled hair falling down over his forehead all right all right is it done with this woman if you say so allen said i say so carmel said but ive gotta talk to her all right ill call her well have to talk to the cops about it sooner or later but not right now maybe tomorrow how do we avoid it gotta work em carmel said she chewed at her thumbnail tasted blood spit and chewed some more carmel walked back into the homicide office with allen trailing behind black and sherrill were still sitting at the desk black with his feet up before carmel could open her mouth sherrill asked wanna hear a horsewalksintoa bar joke sure carmel said horse walks into a bar sits down and in this sad voice says give me a bourbon straight up the bartender gets the drink slides the glass across the bar and asks hey fella why the long face carmel showed an eighthinch of smile and said her voice flat thats fuckin hilarious i dont get it said allen looking worried sit down carmel saidto black and sherrill my client tells me that he has had a sexual relationship with louise clark he hadnt told me earlier because he assumed it wasnt relevant hes right its not relevant on the other hand we can see how you might think it is ive got to talk to him some more and also to louise clark if you dont leak any of this to the papers well come back tomorrow and answer your questions if you do leak it then screw ya were done cooperating so come back black said nobodys gonna hear about this from us ten oclock tomorrow morning carmel said i assume youve already talked to louise clark and suggested that she not talk to anybody about it including me sherrill nodded of course of course carmel said sherrill called lucas a little after three oclock were going over to the bureau office if you want to come lets go lucas said he tossed the equality report on the floor let me get my jacket the sunlight was blinding another good day lucas thought as he slipped on his sun glasses a great day up north a day to stretch out on a swimming float listen to a ball game on a tinny transistor radio and let the world take care of itself thought she was gonna kill him sherrill was saying lucas caught up with the conversation so carmel didnt know no she wasnt faking it either when we hit her with it her eyes actually bulged sherrill said happily i didnt see what happened out in the hall but when they came back in he looked like a sheep thatd been shorn huh any vibe off the affair was he hiding it sherrill shrugged but black shook his head i didnt get a goddamn thing he looked surprised like surprised wed even ask he didnt look scared he didnt look like he was covering the heavily armed male whiteshirtandtie receptionist rang them through into the fbis inter sanctum where they found a lightly sweating assistant agentin charge waiting in a conference room with a man who looked like an economics professor a little harassed a little unkempt the lenses on his glasses a little too thick on the other hand he had a thick neck he smiled pleasantly at lucas looked closely at sherrill and nodded at black im louis mallard he said pronouncing it louie mallard like the duck you know bill bill benson the assistant aic nodded said hey lucas whats going on lucas asked the allen killing mallard said anything at all lucas looked at sherrill who looked at mallard and said were looking at her husband a lawyer here mafia connections mallard asked breaking in no nothing weve seenyou have information never heard of him mallard said couldnt find any record of him at all in our files he never served in the military never even got a traffic ticket as far as i can tell a dull boy weve been looking at his wife too sherrill said trying to figure out something in her background that might get the attention of a pro if this was a pro it was mallard said what go ahead with what you were going to say about the wife he had a precise way of speaking just like an economics professor weve been looking at her black said picking up for sherrill weve had some of our business guys looking over her assets but theres nothing there her moneys been managed for decades no big losses no big gains just a nice steady eleven percent per year no changes we looked at this charity she works with too her grandfather set it up and she and her parents are on the board with some other relatives but its mostly taking care of old folks we can give you all the stuff if you want it but we dont see anything mallard looked at lucas then at benson the assistant aic then said goddamnit in a professorial way tell us lucas said the woman who did it is a pro mallard said shes not very tall maybe fivethree or fivefour she once lived in st louis or the st louis area she might have a southern accent she became active about twelve or thirteen years ago and we think shes killed twentyseven people including your mrs allen we think shes got some tie with some element maybe just a single person in the st louis mafia crowd and thats wht we got we would really like to get more twentyseven lucas said impressed could be more if shes taken the time to get rid of some of the bodies or if it took her a while to develop her signature the silenced pistols close up but were sure its at least twentyseven she does good research gets the victim alone kills them and vanishes we think she does her research to the point where she picks out the precise spot for the murder in advance how would you know that black asked because the caliber of the pistol is always appropriate for the spot if its out in the open its usually nine millimeter or a if its enclosed with concrete like it was here and a few other places its always a you dont want to be in a concrete stairwell with nine millimeter fragments flying around like bees she uses standardvelocity hollow points which turn the brain into oatmeal but stay inside the skull for the most part thats it thats what youve got black asked not quite we think she drives to the city where the hit takes place weve torn passenger manifests apart for the airlines all around the suspect killings looking for anything that might be a pattern and nothing black said oh no we found patterns mallard said all kinds of patterns we just didnt find her pattern weve looked at several hundred people and weve got nothing she always works for pay sherrill asked we dont know what she works for some of the hits have been internal mafia business but some of them maybe half look like straight commercial deals we just dont know twentyseven murders and theres never been a conviction mallard said there have been a couple of situations in which wives were killed and we suspect the husband was involved but theres nothing to go on nothing in none of the cases was it even remotely possible that the husbands were present for the killing they were always in some welldocumented other place can we get your files on her thats what im here for mallard said he reached into his coat pocket and took out a square cardboard envelope and slid it across the table at sherrill duplicate cds everything weve got on every case where shes been involved names dates techniques suspects photographs of everybody and all the crime scenes the first file is an index thanks anything you get mallard said no matter how thin it is please call me i want this woman louise clark decided that she could talk to carmel only after hale allen convinced her it was okay im a lawyer louise allen said its all right to talk to carmel the cops are just busting our balls if youre sure clark said anxiously she was a thin mousy woman with lank brown hair a fleshy nose and nervous bony hands its just that the police said clark did not look like any sex machine carmel had ever seen but she thought to herself you never know hes sure carmel said abruptly they were sitting in dennys and had been talking for ten minutes and the woman had started whining carmel didnt like whiners she looked at hale allen why dont you take a walk around the block i want to talk to louise alone so hale allen went for a walk his hands in the pockets of his light woolen slacks wearing a great bluechecked sportcoat over a black tshirt the coat emphasized the breadth of his shoulders and both women watched him as he held the door for a woman coming into the restaurant with a child the woman said something to allen who gave her the great grin and they had a little conversation in the doorway after a few seconds allen continued on his way and carmel and louise had their talk carmel had a kingsized bed with two regular pillows and a fivefootlong body pillow that she could wrap her legs around when she slept although she told people that she slept nude all part of the image she actually slept in an extralarge jockey tshirt and boxer shorts with the shirt loose around her shoulders and her legs wrapped around the pillow she lay in bed that night and reran mousy louise clark for the most part clarks story was the same of story she and allen spent time alone in their work they shared a lot of stress his wife didnt understand him they developed a relationship based on mutual respect blablablabla they fell into bed at the up north motel then the mouse stuck it to carmel the first time i saw him naked in the motel there it was afterwards really after we made love he was just so beautiful hes a beautiful manthen her eyes flickered and she added girltogirl a little giggle a halfwhisper and hes really large beautiful and really really large he filled me up carmel squeezed the pillow between her legs and tried to squeeze the image out of her head hale allen and the mouse large the alarm went off at seven oclock sharp carmel pushed out of bed slow and grumpy robbed of her usual sound sleep large how large she scratched her ass yawned stretched and headed for the bathroom a halfhour later she was drinking her first cup of coffee eating her second piece of toast and checking the startribune for leaks about allen and clark when the phone rang yes miz loan this is bill downstairs bill was the doorman what still grumpy we got a package for you says urgent i was wondering if we should bring it up what kind of package small one feels like looks like could be a video tape bill said all right bring it up bill brought it up and carmel gave him a fivedollar bill and turned the package in her hand as she closed the door bill was right probably a video plain brown wrapping paper she pulled the paper off found a note written with a ballpoint pen on notebook paper all it said was sorry carmel frowned walked the tape to the media room plugged it into the vhs player and brought it up a womans image came up and carmel recognized it immediately she was looking at herself sitting in the nowunderstandably bright light of rolandos kitchen just a little more than a month ago the onscreen carmel was saying only kind i drink and then so you made the call a mans voice offcamera said yes and shes still working and shell take the job she its a woman yeah i was surprised myself i never asked you know i only knew who to call but when i asked my friend said she shes gotta be good the onscreen carmel said the offscreen carmel decided that the camera must have been in the cupboard shooting through a partly open door shes good she has a reputation never misses the mans voice said very efficient very fast always from very close range so theres no mistake a mans hand appeared in the picture with a mug of coffee carmel watched her on screen self as she turned it with her fingertips then picked it up thats what i need she said onscreen and she took a sip of the coffee carmel remembered that it had been pretty good coffee very hot youre sure about this asked the mans voice once i tell them yes itll be hard to stop this woman the way she moves nobody knows where she is or what name shes using if you say yes she kills barbara allen the onscreen carmel frowned im sure she said the offscreen carmel winced at the sound of barbara allens name shed forgotten that youve got the money the man asked at the house i brought your ten the onscreen carmel put the mug down dug in her purse pulled out a thin deck of currency and laid it on the table the mans hand reached into the picture and picked it up ill tell you this the voice said when they come and ask for it pay every penny every penny dont argue just pay if you dont they wont try to collect theyll make an example out of you i know how it works onscreen carmel said theyll get it and nobodyll be able to trace it because ive had it stashed its absolutely clean then if you say yes ill call them tonight and theyll kill barbara allen carmel offscreen had to admire her onscreen performance she never flinched she just stood up and said yes do it the tape skipped a bit then focused on a black telephone im really sorry about this but you know about my problem im gonna have to have twentyfive thousand like tomorrow the mans voice said ill call and tell you where the tape ended carmel took a long pull on her coffee walked into the kitchen poured the last couple of ounces into the sink and then hurled the cup at one of the huge plateglass windows that looked out on her balcony the cup bounced without breaking carmel didnt see it she was ricocheting around the kitchen sweeping glasses dishes the knife block a toaster silverware off the cupboards and tables and stove and onto the floor kicking them as they landed scattering them and all the time she growled through clenched teeth not a scream but a harsh humming sound like a hundredpound hornet she trashed the kitchen and then the breakfast area and finally cut herself on a broken glass the sight of the blood flowing from the back of her hand brought her back fuckin rolo she said she bled on the floor fuckin rolo fuckin rolo fuckin rolo chapter five for the rest of the evening carmel worked her way through alternate rages and periods of calm fantasized the painful end of rolando daquila and finally admitted to herself that she was in a corner she called rinker left a number and said this is really urgent weve got a big problem the next day a little after one oclock in the afternoon rinker called on carmels magic cell phone she didnt introduce herself she simply said in her dry accent im calling you back i hate problems carmel said hold on i want to lock my door she stuck her head out into the reception area said to the secretary i need ten minutes alone stepped back inside and locked the door all right she began but rinker cut her off is your phone safe yes its registered under my mothers name shes remarried and has a different last name like the volvo its good for special contacts you have a lot of those in your job enough carmel said anyway im calling about rolando daquila who is the guy who put me in touch with you what happened rinker asked carmel explained quickly then said i would have thought the people on your side would have been warned against this you push somebody into a corner what what would you do carmel could feel the warning edge on the other womans voice im sure as hell not going to turn you in or talk to the police if thats what youre worried about carmel said defensively but there has to be some kind of resolution rolos a junkie if i give him every dime ive got hell put it up his nose when hes got every dime hell still have the tape and hell start looking around for somebody to sell it to like tv then im gone and you too the cops will put rolo through the wringer before they give him any kind of immunity and you cant tell whatll come from that maybe nothing rinker said hes off there on the edge of things bullshit sooner or later hell

you insist that he meet you in person because i thought you might want in at that point carmel said rinker chuckled all right you ever kill anybody no you might be good at it with a little training probably carmel said but it doesnt pay enough rinker chuckled again and said see you at eleven fiftyfive bring the jag and wear jeans and walking shoes carmel hadnt known what to expect a toughlooking squarefaced hillbilly with bony wrists and shoulders maybe or somebody beefy who might have been a prison guard at auschwitz the next day at noon she looked right past the first passengers getting off the plane from kansas city looking for somebody who fit the assorted images shed created in her mind when rinkers voice came out of a welldressed young woman with carefullycoiffed blondeoverblonde hair and just a slight aristocratic touch of lipstick carmel jumped startled the woman was carrying a leather backpack and was right at carmels elbow hello what rinker grinned up at her looking for somebody else carmen wagged her head once and said its you its me honey i checked a bag as they started up the concourse carmel said god you really dont look like you well what can i tell you rinker said cheerfully she looked past carmel to her right where a tall tanned man was angling across the concourse to intercept them carmel he said dragging out the last syllable james carmel turned a cheek to be kissed and after james kissed it asked wherere you off to los angeles my god you look like an athlete i never suspected you had jeans or nikes the guy was at least sixsix and looked good with a receding hairline like an athletic adlai stevenson he turned to rinker and said and youre cute as a button i hope youre not a raving leftwing feminist like carmel i sometimes am rinker said but youre cute as a button your own self the guy put one hand over his heart and said oh my god the accent i think we should get married youve been married too often already james carmel said drily she took rinkers arm and said if we dont keep moving hell drown us in bullshit carmel then they were past him and rinker glanced back and said nicelooking guy what does he do hes an accountant carmel said hmm rinker said carmel caught the tone of disappointment but not a boring one carmel said he stole almost four million dollars from a computersoftware company here jesus rinker glanced back again they caught him they narrowed it down to him they figured out that he was the only one who could have pulled it off carmel said he hired me to defend him but he never seemed particularly worried eventually the company came around and said if he gave the money back theyd drop charges he said that if they dropped charges and apologized for the mistake hed tell them about the software glitch that they might want to patch up before their clients started getting ripped off and they found themselves liable for a billion bucks or something they did it took them a week to agree carmel said they hated to apologize hated it but they did it then he insisted on a contract that would pay him another half million for isolating the bug said it was severance pay and he deserved it they eventually did that too i guess they got their moneys worth rinker shook her head dont people just work for money anymore carmel didnt want to think about that question instead she said um listen what do i call you pamela stone rinker said by the way do you know how to get to south washington county park no i dont think so til show you on a map rinker said we gotta get my guns back cant fly with them you know carmel kept looking at rinker as they headed out of the airport to the parking ramp looking for some sign that she could be an executioner for the mob but rinker wasnt a monster she was a chick chattering away about the flight about an airlinemagazine article on body piercing and about the jaguar as they pulled through the pay booths i drive a chevy myself carmel listened for a while and then rinker put a hand on carmels forearm and said carmel youve gotta relax youre tightern a drum you look like youre gonna explode thats because i dont want to spend the next thirty years locked in a closet like some fuckin squirrel carmel said theyre locking squirrels in closets now rinker asked carmel had to smile despite herself and loosened her grip on the steering wheel you know what i mean aint gonna happen anyway rinker said well get this rolo fellow in a quiet place explain the situation to him and get the tape and kill him rinker shrugged maybe hes made three or four copies if he tells us about two of them and the third one is hidden somewhere maybe if hes gone itll never be found we cant take the chance that theres the third one we have to make sure we can get them all before we do it kill him well scare him rinker said i can guarantee that but theres no way we can finally be sure howll we do it leave it to me ill pick him up with you tag him and when hes alone ill take him is there a farm store around here or a truck store or a big hardware place yeah i suppose were gonna need some chain and a couple of padlocks and some other stuff south washington county park was twenty miles south of st paul a complex of hiking and skiing trails only two cars were parked in the entry lot but their drivers were nowhere to be seen park down at the end rinker said pointing carmel parked and they got out rinker carrying her leather backpack led the way down a trail along a tiny creek then up a hillside covered with thicktrunked oaks at the top of the hill she took a long look around then led the way off the trail back into the trees after a minute they came to a fence separating the park from a farm field rinker turned down the fence finally said here she stepped away from the fence knelt next to an oak and probed between two of its roots the dirt was soft and came away easily after a minute she pulled two automatic pistols from the ground the dirt still clinging to them at that moment carmel was aware that she was out of sight of everyone in a nearly deserted park with a killer who now had two guns if rinker killed her here and now who would know until some hiker way off the beaten path found her body rinker could take the jag and park it downtown or who was to say that she hadnt somehow prepositioned one of those cars in the parking lot down below the whole scenario flitted through carmels mind in a halfsecond rinker brushed dirt off the two pistols put them in her leather backpack and said you worry too much i anticipate carmel said why didnt you anticipate that rolo was making a movie rinker asked politely carmel didnt dodge the question she grimaced and said i fucked up i knew something wasnt right i remember thinking that he wasnt embarrassed by the fact that he was living in a shithole after years of being a bigtime dealer wasnt embarrassed that was wrong at least you know you messed up rinker said the guns clinked in the bag as she hung it over one shoulder we need to get some oil when we get the chains and padlocks oil for the guns doesnt burying them sort of wreck them yeah it would if i left them buried for more than a couple of days in a week theyd be rusted wrecks then even if somebody found them thered be no way to connect them to the death of barbara allen so you were just going to leave them sureyou can get them for a couple hundred bucks apiece i just didnt have time to deal with the airlines and all that rinker glanced at her watch four hours to rolo she said wed better get back to town the crystal court is the interior courtyard of the tallest glass tower in minneapolis a crossroads of the minneapolis skyway system carmel met rolo on the ground floor she was furiously angry which rinker said was perfect if you werent pissed hed be suspicious the madder you are the better i can fake it if i have to but i dont think ill have to carmel said i hate this being extorted somebody else squeezing you like this and youre powerless she ground her teeth felt control slipping away held on tight not powerless rinker said just the appearance of it but he has to think i am the goddamn humiliation that cocksucker there was nothing faked about her anger when rolo showed up carrying the videotape in a brown beer sack from a convenience store she was carrying the money in a cloth bookbag you fuck carmel hissed at him you piece of shit i should have let you go down for life you fuckin greaseball rolo took it calmly enough just give me the money carmel i got your little movie right here and were all done wed better be all done carmel snarled a whitehaired man in a golf shirt glanced at her face as she passed and it occurred to her that she probably looked like a cornered wolf her face twisted with hate anger and maybe fear she took a breath straightened up tried to pull herself together give me the tape she said give me the money first for christs sakes rolo i can hardly grab it and run can i if a cop gets involved im dead meat rolo thought about it for a minute then said let me see the money carmel pulled open the top of the bag let him look in he nodded grudgingly and handed her the sack she looked inside saw the tape shook her head and said you fuck and he said the money carmel and she handed him the bag youd better not be back carmel said i couldnt handle that check the tape rolo said stepped into a stream of traffic followed it to an escalator and went up a minute later he was gone the crystal court was five minutes from her apartment carmel had walked because parking would have taken as long as walking and now she hurried back jaywalking when she caught a red light wondering what was happening with rinker rolando d aquila had parked his brokendown pieceofshit dodge on the third floor of the sixth street parking ramp the same ramp where barbara allen had been shot rinker was pleased the situation had a nice symmetry and she knew the ramp well because of her previous scouting carrying her big green daytons department store bag shed stayed well behind rolo in the skyways blending with the crowd of headinghome shoppers and whitecollar office workers when she realized where they were going she closed up and when they pushed through the skyway door into the ramp was a dozen steps behind with two other people between them she followed rolo down the ramp making no effort to hide but keeping a grey suited man with a briefcase between them then grey suit turned off toward a black buick and she and rolo continued on single file rolo glanced back at her once barely seeing her and as he did she glanced at her watch and looked diagonally past him as if heading for a car at the end of the floor but when rolo turned off to the brownshoecolored dodge she was only two steps behind him he didnt even notice until she was a foot away then he turned key in his hand and before he could open his mouth rinker took the last step and the muzzle of the pistol came up from the shopping bag she was carrying and she said if you make one fuckin noise i will shoot you in the fuckin heart if you think about it you will know who i am and youll know that ill do it rolo stood stockstill for a long beat then said quietly you can have the money back well take the money back but weve got to talk for a while you and carmel and i just take the money were gonna get in the car rolo and im gonna slide across the seat and youre gonna stand there by the door and if you make a noise or make a move to run im going to shoot you i dont think so rolo said trying to recover there are too many people around she shot him in the left leg the little silenced made a sound like a clapping hand and rolos leg dipped and he slumped against the car his eyes wide you shot me he said his voice almost a whisper he clasped the money bag under one arm his free hand felt down his left leg and came away to his face scarlet with blood and he could feel more blood trickling down his leg rinker glanced around two other people walking down the ramp neither one paying attention to the two of them the gun itself was below the level of the cars where it couldnt be seen open the car door rolo she said quietly but the quiet tone carried the menace of death or the next one goes right in your eye the black hole on the end of the pistol came up and d aquila was seized with the sudden conviction that he could see the head of the bullet that lay down its maw he fumbled the key into the car lock opened the door stand still rinker said she stepped close to him so close that they might have been lovers sharing a carside kiss before heading home and she pushed the muzzle of the under his breastbone and said im going to get in if you make a noise or try to run ill kill you do you understand that youll kill me if i get in the car rinker shook her head no we cant be sure about the tape how many copies youve made but we figure youve got at least one and we want that one after that youre on warning if a third tape ever shows up were gonna kill you no questions but we want to make that clear to you my legs killing me no its not but i might be follow me into the car rinker said she sat down the end of the muzzle never leaving his breastbone she slid across the seat and rolo followed drive she said wherere we going home rinker said your place carmel found them sitting in the front room rolo in an easy chair with a ripped sheet wrapped tightly around his left leg rinker was on a couch her pistols held carefully across her lap carmel noticed that the pistols now had silencers attached to their muzzles i had to shoot him a little rinker said her voice flat uninflected as though shooting rolo was nothing at all did you look at the tape yeah i looked at the tape carmel said she was carrying her handbag and a sack from a hardware store which clanked when she dropped it by her foot it starts out with him telling me that it was only a copy that he has another and that he needs a little more money ill give you the tape rolo said just get me to the hospital carmel pulled a chair up and sat in front of his and said look at me rolo how many tapes did you make just two he said honest to god i was gonna give you the only one but then i got to thinking so i made another one why would i make any more as long as i got the original i can make as many as i want where is it the second one not here he said i put it in my safedeposit box i figured if anything like this happened you couldnt kill me youd have to take me to the bank you put it in a safedeposit box carmel asked yeah at us bank look at me rolo he looked at her his eyes clear and honest where are the keys to the safedeposit box well i gave them to a friend to hold this chick i know oh bullshit rolo carmel looked at rinker hes lying im not lying rolo protested look i can call my friend she turned back to him yeah you are you wouldnt give the keys to anyone youd hide them someplace im not lying rolo protested look i can call my friend whats her name carmel asked quick rolos eyes went sideways and he stumbled over a couple of syllables ummm mary he said would that be the virgin mary carmel asked sarcastically to rinker hes lying should i shoot him again a little more this time carmel looked at rolo for a moment pulled on her lower lip then shook her head slowly nope i think we should just chain him up she touched the hardware store bag with her foot see about this mary tear the house apart see if we find any safe deposit keys i dont think there is one rinker said i think i should shoot him again jesus christ rolo said listening to the argument lets just get him on the bed so we dont have to watch him every minute and try to work this out carmel said to rinker she touched the bag again with her foot and looked at rolo were gonna chain you to your bed and tear this place apart either that or pamelas gonna shoot you again and then were gonna tear this place apart are you gonna give us a hard time youre gonna kill me he said not if we dont have to carmel said youre both fuckin crazy which you should keep in mind into the bedroom rinker said gesturing with the muzzle of the gun my leg is killing me rolo said rinker dropped the muzzle toward his other leg and rolo lurched forward said im going for christs sake im going rinker moved with him just behind him the gun pointed at his spine just stretch out on the bed she said when they got to the bedroom door no problems theyd gotten a package of lightweight chain at the hardware store the kind used for childrens swings a roll of duct tape at a pharmacy and four keyed padlocks and two pair of yellow plastic kitchen gloves at a kmart while rinker leaned on the end of the bed the gun ready carmel took a couple of turns of chain around rolos neck wrapped the chain around the end of the bed and snapped on a lock and his feet she said she did his feet the same way his arms rinker said hmm carmel said looking at him finally she took a tight wrap of chain around one of his wrists snapped on a padlock leaned over the side of the bed threw the chain beneath it fished it out from the opposite side took a wrap around rolos other wrist and snapped on the last padlock thats it for the chain carmel said she went back to the sack for the duct tape whatre you going to do with that rolo asked tape up your mouth carmel said rolo thrashed a little against the chain but it cut into his neck and he stopped and looked up at carmel dont hurt me he said his voice suddenly quiet how many copies carmel asked just the one rolo said and its in your safety deposit box thats right ill get it for you shut up carmel said she pulled off two feet of duct tape and wrapped it around his head taping up his mouth carmel and rinker spent an hour ripping through the little house working in the yellow plastic gloves they dumped cupboards closets and dressers looked through the small dank empty basement poking their heads up into cobwebs and bug nests they probed the equally empty ceiling crawlspace which was stuffed with pink fiberglass insulation that stuck to their skin and tangled their hair they dumped all the icecube trays out of the refrigerator dumped all the boxes in the cupboard looked in the toilet tank ripped the covers off all the electric outlets they found a halfdozen tapes under the television but their labels said they were pornographic and when they pushed them into rolos cheap vcr pornography was what they got they found two address books checked his billfold and found more phone numbers the video camera was on the floor of a closet rinker opened it said empty and tossed it on the wooden floor where it hit hard and rolled they also found a few tools a lot of clothing and odd bits of cheap jewelry they checked rolo every few minutes the chains immobilized him and though he grunted at them they ignored him and went back to pulling the house apart after an hour it had become obvious that they werent going to find the tape it might still be here rinker said finally after shed torn out the under seat lining of the couch and chair we cant look everyplace wed need a wrecking ball carmel was in the bedroom doorway looking at rolo finally she walked around and ripped the tape off his mouth he sputtered and she said last chance rolo tell me where the fuck it is in the bank he snarled hed won he thought fuck you carmel got the roll of tape and reached forward to slap it over his mouth but he turned his head away turn your head this way she said hey fuck you he said and there was a tone in the way he said it hes just achin to be shot a little more rinker said from the doorway youll kill me if you shoot me a little more rolo said im still bleeding from my leg and if you kill me the cops are going to open the safety deposit box hey he said hey because carmel had crawled on top of him she sat on his chest grabbed his head by the hair and pulled forward hard until he was choking on the chain he thrashed some more but had started making gargling sounds when she let his head drop keep your head straight she said as he took a half dozen rasping breaths you fuckin he kept his head straight and she took a halfdozen wraps of duct tape across his mouth now what rinker asked as carmel crawled off him im very good at crossexamination carmel said one thing you could do is to get out a mop and get the broom and brush over every place weve walked weve walked everywhere rinker said yeah you dont have to clean it you just have to stir it up good so if the crime lab comes through they wont know whats old and whats new the crime lab yeah carmel said she leaned close to rinker its pretty clear that after i crossexamine him were gonna have to kill him eventually theyll find him and then the crime lab will come through what about the video tape rinker asked well have the tape carmel said they were in the kitchen and she went to the tool drawer theyd dumped and picked up the electric drill and a box of drill bits we will have the tape carmel went back to the bedroom and as rolo strained to watch plugged the drill into an electric outlet and said to rolo did i ever tell you that i was crazy i mean absolutely fuckin nuts well i am and im gonna prove it she said she climbed back on the bed and sat on his legs this is an eighthinch drill bit she said im now going to drill a hole through your knee cap he flopped and strained against the chains and grunted and she shook her head no no no no negotiation wed just waste more time screwing around so ill drill first and she did it he bucked against her but with his neck and feet tightly chained was unable to move enough to lose her she rode his legs and with brutal efficiency drove the drill bit through his knee cap the drill whining and sputtering bringing up flakes of white bone and black blood driving it in until the drill chuck touched his jeans rolo bucked against it his screams muffled by the tape at the end with the drill silent he made an eerie dying animal sound a high keening groan across the room rinker turned away finally walking to the living room where she sat down on a chair and put her hands over her ears when the drill bit had gone in as far as it would go carmel wiggled it and said feel good fucker feel good tape is in the bank what a crock of shit a little spot of white saliva appeared at one corner of carmels eyes rolo fainted now you probably think im just gonna take the tape off and ask you again but im not gonna carmel said conversationally when he was conscious again im gonna drill a hole in your other knee instead and she did it all over again rolo strangling himself on the chain kicking his heels carmel riding his legs then you know what i bet would really hurt a hole in your heels and she drilled a hole through both of his heels taking her time developing a technique halfway through the first heel rolo fainted again and again halfway through the second get me some ice cubes out of the sink carmel called to rinker if there are any left there were a few and carmel dumped a bowl ofice water and cubes on rolos face a minute later his eyes flickered open carmel said a guy like you you know what would really hurt what would hurt a lot her fingers went to his belt line and she unbuckled his belt unbuttoned his pants and started to drag them down rolo lay limp unresisting carmel got his pants down on his thighs and then the animal keening began again and carmel stopped and said whatyou wont want me to drill out your dick id be happy to do it he went uhuh uhuh and carmel asked are you gonna tell us where the tape really is uhhuh uhhuh carmel pulled the tape off his face and he turned toward her his eyes glazed and groaned im dying he said my heart busted look if youre gonna bullshit us ill put the tape back on and start the drill again i could do this all night tapes in the car rolo said in with the spare carmel looked at rinker and she said oh shit how could we be that stupid ill go get it rinker said youve got some blood carmel looked down at her blouse the droplets of blood looked like fine embroidery rinker went out another nice evening she could hear music playing up the block through an open window somewhere she stopped to listen but couldnt identify the music then went to rolos car popped the trunk and pulled the cover off the limiteduse spare the tape was tucked behind it she looked at it weighed it in her hands sighed and went back inside get it carmel asked got a tape rinker said she pushed it into the vcr the picture came up immediately and carmel came to watch good light rinker grunted he had all the windows open thats another thing i should have noticed hes not an openwindows guy boy rinker said as the tape wound out you were gone if the cops got this thats why i had to get it back carmel said you think this is it rinker asked i dont know i could go drill him some more carmel said rinker looked toward the bedroom he looked pretty rough in there i dont think he could take any more and i dont think well get any more out of him moren what weve got so we gotta call it carmel said its your face on the tape carmel looked at the bedroom door for a moment then said all right were done if theres a copy well have to deal with it later but i think were still gonna have to kill him after the drill he might be so pissed hed go to the cops carmel said you wanna do it rinker asked i mean you yourself sure if you want carmel said not if youd feel bad rinker said no no i dont think i would not really carmel said what do i do rinker explained as they went back into the kitchen rolo saw them coming with the gun and didnt bother to struggle see you in hell he said theres nothing as silly as hell carmel said dont you know that yet and then to rinker what i just put it at his head and pull the trigger easy as that rolo turned his head away and carmel put the muzzle of the pistol at his temple and then waited a few seconds do it rolo said made you sweat didnt i carmel asked rolo started to turn his head back a little hope she could see it in his eyes carmel shot him six times then the bullets ran out rinker and carmel spent another ten minutes in the house closing up obscuring anything that might even theoretically provide evidence against them we can drop the guns in the mississippi i know a good spot down by the dam carmel said and burn the tape rinker said as soon as we get back to my place we oughta go back to my place and change and get rid of these clothes and get showered off and everything maybe we could go out someplace tonight rinker said my plane isnt until the day after tomorrow thatd be fun carmel said maybe we could rent a movie or she stopped in midsentence looking back at the kitchen what rinker asked without answering carmel went back to the kitchen squatted next to the video camera that rinker had tossed on the floor touched it turned it over what rinker asked again that fuckin rolo this camera is a vhsc this tape she held up the tape theyd found this tape is a fullsized vhs tape if you were making a copy using your cheapass vcr and the camera this is what youd use to pick up the copy so theres another tape avhsc youre sure rinker asked look carmel said she picked up the camera turned it over opened the cartridge compartment the tape they had was at least twice as big as the compartment bad news rinker said carmel glanced at her sideways and quickly if rinker were to shoot her now at least all of rinkers troubles would be over she could walk away and not have to worry at all you worry too much rinker said i anticipate carmel said she looked at rinker lets get back to my place do you still have those address books yeah and lets get his wallet and the phone book and whatever else that might have names in it ive got to think about this you dont think its in a safedeposit box hes a drug dealer hed never have a safedeposit box not under his own name anyway we didnt find any fake ids that he could use to get to a box under a different name and we didnt find any keys i suspect he did what drug dealers usually do he left it with somebody he trusts like who like a lawyer except that im his lawyer he could have another one i suppose i can find out but hes a spic so its probably a relative anyway weve got to do some research in a hurry ill cancel my plane ticket rinker said i guess we keep the guns on the way back to carmels rinker glanced at her and asked how much did you enjoy that back there carmel started to answer then changed directions and asked a question of her own have you been to school to college well yeah really i didnt think you know professional killer and all rinker said yeah carmel nodded whatd you major in psychology actually im about eight credits away from my ba i should have it finished next spring good school okay school but youre not going to tell me which well thats okay carmel said anyway i did sort of enjoy it just a little bit maybe whether i did or not he had to go you enjoyed it just a little bit maybe didnt you carmel asked no i couldnt stand that sound he was making that smell when he you know i didnt like it at all now carmel took her eyes off the road for a moment to look at rinker dont worry im just a sociopath like you im not a psychopath or anything how do you know im not a psychopath from what rolo told me what hed heard about you quiet professional clean you do it because you can and because you can make money at it and because youre good at it not because you have some slobbering lust to kill people slobbering lust listen ive handled a couple of cases carmel had rinker laughing by the time they got back to her place and as they got out of the car rinker looked at her over the roof and said wichita state what thats where i go to school carmel had the sense that rinker had told her something important after a few moments realized that she had shed told carmel where she could be found where home was chapter six three st paul cop cars and a crimescene van were parked outside the frogtown house when lucas arrived up and down the street people sat on their short wooden stoops looking down at rolos house watching the cops come and go lucas parked climbed out of the porsche and started toward the house a st paul uniformed cop saw him coming and squared off to stop him but a plainclothes cop stuck his head out the door and yelled hey dick let that guy in youre in dick said and lucas nodded and went up the steps sherrill was standing just inside the door she was a darkhaired darkeyed madonna in a crisp yellow blouse with a grey skirt in place of her usual slacks and a black silk jacket to cover the she carried under her arm ah dressed up lucas said a girls gotta do what she can if she wants to catch a guy sherrill said batting her eyes at him too early in the morning for bullshit lucas muttered he looked past her into the house which had been ransacked whats going on come look youll like it too early lucas said again but he went to look a st paul homicide cop named lemaster showed him the body on the bed chain around the neck ankles and hands pants pulled down around the thighs one of the neighborhood junkies found him about two hours ago he came by looking for a wakemeupthe dead guy used to be a bigtime dealer no more lemaster shook his head he got his nose in it lately hes been down to selling eightballs aint that the way of the world lucas said one day its kilos the next day its one toot at a time he kept his hands in his pockets as he squatted next to the bed bunch ofs in the head yup could be your barbara allen killer or could be somebody who read about it in the paper and liked the sound of it lucas nodded and stood up scratched his nose and looked at the stilldamp pools of blood around the bodys feet and knees whats all the blood from and whats his name rolando daquila was his name everybody called him rolo and the blood comes from some drill holes in his kneecaps and his heels and his leg was bleeding from what might be a gunshot wound drill holes in his heels yeah look at thisthe drill was lying on the floor at the end of the bed three inches of stainlesssteel drill bit sticking out of the chuck dried blood mottled the steel bit jesus christ lucas said he looked back at the body they drilled him looks like gotta get his pants and socks off to know for sure and the mes guy hasnt been here yet but thats what it looks like bet that hurt lucas said looking at rolos face his face looked compressed leathery like a shrunken head lucas had seen on television he looked hurt see the pieces of duct tape on the floor you can still see what look like chew marks on some of it they probably taped up his mouth while they drilled him and the house was all torn up so they were probably looking for something lucas said like cocaine yeah but boy the gunshots in the head all together like that just like in the allen case none of the neighbors heard anything and there are a lot of windows open these hot nights just like nobody heard anything with allen and the way they tortured him it all looks professional they had the tape and the chains and the padlocks and the drill they knew what they were gonna do before they got here it looks professional like allen you keep saying they lucas said i cant figure out how one guy could get him on the bed and get him all locked up like that had to be awkward the way i see it there had to be one to hold a gun on him and at least one more to do the chains get the slugs to the lab they need to do a metallurgical analysis if theyre like the slugs in the allen shooting theyll be so bent up that theyre just about useless for trying to match by the land marks well push it through lemaster cop said if theyre the same gonna be trouble lucas said sherrill was thumbing through a mens magazine when lucas picked his way through the trashed living room what do you think he asked i think this magazine is gay she said its basically a gear catalog overlaid with pictures of guys who are gay you can tell from a picture sure look at this guy she showed him a photo of a slender shirtless sweat covered biker with a shock of dark hair falling carefully over his moody black eyes hes either gay or he wants you to think he is theyre all like that mountain climbers canoeists and look at the clothes you see a guy walking along the street dressed like this and you say i coulda looked like that when i was a kid lucas said she made a face rolled her eyes up lucas believe me you did not look like this he looks like hes been hurt by somebody they all look like theyve been hurt by somebody look at the bruised lips you on the other hand always look like you just got back from hurting somebody else like a woman thanks he said no charge i just dont think you can make that judgment based on a picture she looked at him closely then smiled and said ah i get it youve been reading the wholeness report or the wellness thing or whatever it is the otherness report you gotta stop reading that shit its putting holes in your brain yeah its i dont know but listen what do you think about this he gestured over his shoulder with his thumb copycat coincidence i havent been that much on top of it not a copycat i dont think we didnt give the details to the papers we didnt tell them it was a we didnt tell them that the shots were all grouped like that we didnt tell them how close it was you see the same tattooing on the scalp and it was cold nobody coldern a wholesaler whos trying to make a point lucas said maybe he held out on somebody was trying to get back into the big deals sure but its not just the coldness its all the other stuff that goes with it it just doesnt seem like a copycat could be a coincidence lucas said then admitted but itd be a pretty amazing coincidence you know the rule on coincidences yeah its probably a coincidence unless it cant be you gonna jump in now she grinned at him come on we havent worked together since old audrey mcdonald tried to take us off we have spoken a few times though is that what you call it she was teasing him im thinking of getting in if you and black dont mind lucas said the otherness commission is driving me nuts this would give me an excuse glad to have you sherrill said thats why i invited you over the first thing we gotta do lucas said is we gotta get that lawyer in allen and bust his balls a little does he know rolando whateverhisname is does he use cocaine has he ever his attorneyll be on us like a chicken on a june bug like a what a chicken on a june bug sherrill said jesus id almost forgotten about talking to you lucas said anyway dont worry about carmel i can handle carmel the question carmel said as rinker bent over a display case at neiman marcus and peered at the hermes scarves is whether whoever has it will look at it and if he looks at it if hell come to me or go to the cops a sales clerk was drifting toward them and rinker said whoever it is ill bet the name is in his address book unless he knew him so well that he didnt have to write down a number carmel said the clerk asked can i help you ladies rinker tapped the case let me look at the goldandblack one please with the eggs they spent five minutes looking at scarves and then rinker took the goldand black one and paid with a neiman credit card you shop at neimans often enough to have a credit card carmel asked while the clerk went to wrap the scarf i hit one of the stores once or twice a year spend a few hundred rinker said the name on the cards not really mine but i have all the rest of the id to back it up and i keep the card active and always pay it on time just in case ive got a couple of visas and mastercards the same way just in case just in case in case i ever have to run for it i never thought of doing that carmel said running id run before id stand and fight if a cop ever got close enough to look at me id be screwed anyway do you think could run rinker looked at her carefully and after a minute nodded physically it wouldnt be a problem the question is whether you could handle it psychologically the clerk came back with the wrapped scarf and the credit card thanks very much mrs blake thank you rinker said she tucked the card away in her purse physically id be okay but psychologically carmel was interested sure youve got a hot image bright clothes blonde hair good makeup and perfume great shoes rinker took a step back and took a long look if you dressed way down got some stuff from a secondhand shop you know stuff that didnt go together that well some kind of scuzzy dark plaid drab and if you grew out your hair and colored it some middlebrown color and slumped your shoulders and shuffled maybe got some breast prosthetics so youd have big floopy boobs my god carmel said starting to laugh but rinker was serious if you did that your best friends wouldnt recognize you from two feet you could get a cleaning lady job at your law firm and nobody would know you but i dont know if you could stand it i think you like attention you need it maybe carmel said maybe everybody does i dont i dont want people to look at me thats one reason why im good at what i do i really dont understand that carmel said i was a nude dancer for three andahalf years from the time i was sixteen until i was twenty you get pretty goddamned tired of people staring at you you want privacy carmel was fascinated now you were a her beeper went off a discreet low japanese tone from her purse uhoh she glanced at the beeper dropped it back in her purse took out a cell phone and dialed maybe a problem she said my secretary only uses the beeper if theres some pressure and to the phone marcia you beeped me uhhuh uhhuh okay give me the number okay she clicked off and said cop called he wants to talk to one of my clients doesnt it make you nervous talking to cops all the time why should it carmel asked im not guilty of anything im just doing my job weve gotta spend some time looking for the tape we cant go running around actually my clients name is hale allen carmel said rinker frowned any relation to barbara allen her husband jesus rinker was impressed howd that happen hes a friend of mine and im a good attorney actually im one of the best criminal attorneys in the state the cops think he mightve done it so youre on the inside rinker said somewhat carmel smiled down at rinker makes it kind of interesting certainly could be useful rinker said is that why you took the job not exactly carmel said then her smile disappeared but this cop whos calling he wasnt working the case before hes a deputy chief of police lucas davenport a political appointee he used to be a regular cop but he was canned for brutality or something they brought him back because hes smart hes a mean bastard but really smart well hell as long as he thinks her husband did it but it means weve got to get that goddamn tape carmel said if davenport ever got a whiff of that ill tell you what pam hes the one guy in the world who could run you down the one guy as long as youre on the inside he shouldnt be a problem rinker shrugged and if he gets to be a problem we take him carmel gave her a long look and rinker asked what you dont know him carmel said look if a guy doesnt know its coming and if you spend some time watching him and thinking about it you can take himyou can carmel came swinging down the hall to homicide spotted lucas coming from the other direction carrying a large clipbound report davenport goddamn it have you been stepping on my clients rights again how are you carmel lucas asked whats the big book ah the perfection commission oh my god i tried to read about it in the startribune i felt like id been anesthetized carmel presented a cheek and lucas pecked it he took one of her hands lifted it and stepped back so he could look her over and said you look absolutely wonderful thanks how come weve never slept together youve chased every other woman in town i only chase no thats not right what i was gonna say i only chase women who dont scare me lucas said but they all wind up scaring me i heard you were dating little miss titsy the cop but you broke up that would be sgt sherrill what happened she have a bigger gun carmel carmel lucas held the door for her carmel stepped through and saw hale allen at the far end of the room leaning against a green filing cabinet deep in conversation with marcy sherrill marcy was standing a couple of inches too close to him and was looking up into his eyes with rapt attention uhoh carmel said by the way lucas said in a tone low enough that carmel had to turn to catch what he said im told your client is dumbern a barrel of hair but god hes gorgeous she said she ostentatiously bit her lower lip sighed and started toward allen and sherrill moving like a leopard lucas thought they needed to cover some old ground lucas told allen because he was new to the case he hoped it wouldnt be inconvenient i understand your wife has been released by the county yes finally allen said that took way too long carmel added i dont understand why they had to do twenty different kinds of chemistry when the womans been shot seven times in the brain routine lucas said bullshit routine carmel said now in attorney mode you should give a little thought to what it does to the grieving survivors youre revictimizing the victims all right all right lucas said this will only take a couple of minutes wheres the other guy black carmel asked doing something else lucas said he looked at allen tell me about your relationship with your wife ah jesus carmel said ten minutes later lucas leaned toward allen and asked how well did you know rolando d aquila allen looked puzzled rolando who daquila also known as rolo i understand i dont know anybody by that name allen said never bought a little toot from him lucas asked no i never he shook his head toot when lucas mentioned daquilas name carmel slipped back a step and ran the numbers theyd found the body obviously if they looked up daquilas history and they would get around to that if they hadnt already theyd find her name they might wonder why she hadnt mentioned it why are you interested in this rolando daquila she asked lucas he was murdered last night lucas said he was killed the same way mrs allen was the method was identical he looked back at allen so you never represented him or one of his friends either in a criminal court or in a civil legal matter no no not that i remember ive represented thousands of people in real estate closings so maybe but i dont remember any rolando get off his case carmel snapped hes never represented rolando daquila in anything how do you know lucas asked because rolo only had one attorney everybody was looking at her now and she nodded me after the interview with allen as they got coffee from the coffee machine lucas said you were strangely quiet that always makes me a nervous i was gonna be the good cop if you were gonna be the bad sherrill said i agree he is very goodlooking lucas said sherrill laughed and then said hes got these really amazing brown eyes theyre like perfect little puppy eyes hes about as bright as a perfect little puppy too lucas said and hes sleeping with his secretary a secretary not his secretary besides he had a cold marriage as i understand it sherrill said and i think his intelligence might lie in other areas than than what than like in uh being smart lucas choked on the coffee and said goddamnit you almost made hot coffee go up my nose good sherrill said chapter seven when carmel got back to her apartment rinker was lying on the couch a pillow behind her head reading the nbc handbook of pronunciation did you know that the french nudie bar is called the fohleebairzhair carmel shrugged yeah i guess see thats what people get when they study french rinker said tossing the book on an end table they learn how to pronounce neat stuff i had to take spanish for my ba but theres nothing neat in the pronunciation like in french i always thought it was fohlee beerzhairay i dont know i took spanish too carmel said rinker sat up dropped her feet to the floor and asked what happened with the cops they asked hale about rolo they found his body this morning some junkie dropped by looking for coke did you tell them that youd represented rolo rinker asked for a split second a lie hovered on carmels tongue she rejected it and said yeah i pretty much had to they wouldve found out all right so now they can tie you to rolo but they cant tie you to the crime because nobody knows that youre involved with hale not even hale knows it have i got that right thats right she wandered to a window and looked out over the city it was a hot day and a thin haze hung over the midway area to the east if it werent for that fuckin tape wed be in the clear im thinking maybe we should have strangled rolo instead of shooting him then then there wouldnt be any tie that was a mistake didnt think of it rinker said the gun was just the natural thing to do since we had it right there yeah well theyre waiting for an analysis of the slugs they can tell whether the bullets that killed barbara allen and the ones that killed rolo came from the same batch of lead all right gonna have to get rid of the guns pretty soon or buy a new batch of shells did you come up with any ideas about the tape carmel asked yes i have rinker said she stood up walked to a corner table and picked up rolos address book for one thing do you remember when he said he gave the tape to somebody named mary yeah but there arent any names in the book only initials rinker said but i had a little time so i started going through it there are four sets of initials starting with m so i walked down to your library and looked in the crossreference directories and then i found out he was using a stupid little code on his phone numbers he put the last number at the beginning like hed have a number say that was dash and hed write it down as dash carmel was impressed howd you figure that out because some of the prefixes didnt exist and the ones that did were all over the place one was for a doggrooming service i mean why would he even bother to write it in his book so anyway the assholes i used to work for did some jail time and they told me how guys would use these simple codes so i juggled numbers until i found one that gave me all good prefixes and then everything else worked out all the codes were residential and two of the names that began with m were women or probably women one was martha koch but the other was just initial m m blanca wheres theres just an initial it usually means a woman living aloneyounger woman mary no its something else i called and a woman answered and i asked for mary blanca and she said i had the wrong number she had a little accent maybe mex but i was thinking about how scared rolo was and how he came up with the name mary i bet when you asked him for the name and you said quick i bet her name popped into his head and it almost got out but he switched at the last minute could be martha or it could be this other m carmel was skeptical thats a long chain of couldbes she said it could be some other m or not an m at all yeah but we dont have anything else rolos names gonna be in the paper tomorrow carmel said if this m doesnt know hes dead she will tomorrow morning then shes gonna look at the tape if she hasnt already then shes gonna give it to the cops so lets go talk to m blanco and martha koch after dark yup were hanging by a goddamn thread carmel said martha kochs life was saved by a baby shower she never knew it lotta cars around carmel muttered as she and rinker started up the kochs driveway a dozen cars were parked along the street the house was a neat modest tuckunder ranch across the street from a golf course a curving line of flagstone steps led across a rising lawn to the front door the porch light was on and the livingroom curtains were open at the top of the steps carmen said uhoh and stopped two women were hopping around the front room laughing and one of them was looking back and obviously talking to yet a third one or more forget it rinker said well have to come back they retreated down the steps walked up the street to carmels volvo and left m blancas house was a long step down in affluence one of a row of old asbestosshingled houses just north of a university of minnesota neighborhood called dinkytown four mailboxes hung next to a single door its an apartment rinker said her voice low lot of them are carmel said we gotta take care therell be other people around you got the money yeah a few more steps and carmel asked what do i look like rinker was wearing her red wig theyd both wrapped dark silk scarves around their heads you look like one of those religious ladies who always wear scarves rinker said all right carmel said she added so do you at the front door carmel pointed a pocket flash it at the mailboxes the box on the left said howell the next one showed a strip of paper which had been peeled off the third said in pink ink jan and howard davis with a green ink addition in a childs hand and heather the fourth said apartment a she opened the left one howell and found it empty the box with the strip of paper contained a phone bill addressed to david pence apartment c she skipped the davis box and checked the box on the far right empty i think but im not sure that we want apartment a she whispered to rinker rinker nodded and they pushed through the outer door into a short hallway stairs led away to the right and a hightech schwinn bicycle was chained to the banister not like my old schwinn rinker muttered down the hall on the left wall was a pale yellow door another door this one a pale paris green was at the end of the hall the first door had a large metal b on it the parisgreen door had an a rinker put her hand in her pocket where the gun was and carmel stepped forward and knocked on the door the knock was answered by deep silence carmel knocked again louder this time there was an answering thump like somebody getting up off a couch or a bed a moment later the door opened a crack and a sleepy latino man peered out through the crack and said what we need to talk to ms blanca carmel said quietly shes sleeping he said and the crack narrowed weve got some money for her carmel said quickly the crack stopped narrowing and the mans eyes were back at the crack he didnt argue he simply said ill take it no rolo said we were only to give it to ms blanca if anything happened to him oh he thought it over for a minute as if this somehow made sense and carmels heart did a quick extra beat what happened to rolo quite a bit of money carmel said she wanted to sound nervous and she did just a minute the latino man said the door closed and they heard him call hey marta marta blanca rinker muttered she bakes right what carmel looked at rinker as though rinker were slipping away better biscuits cakes and pies with marta blanca carmel shook her head bewildered then the man was back and the door opened he looked them over for a second made a judgment and said yeah come in carmel led the way into the apartment which seemed to be decorated in brown one lamp with a nicotineyellow shade was turned on the shade at a tipsy angle over a stack of hustler magazines the odor of marijuana hung around the curtains how much money the man asked we need to ask carmel started but then a woman came through the kitchen apparently from a bedroom in the back she was tucking her blouse into the back of her jeans are you marta yeah the woman still looked sleepy what happened to rolando hes dead carmel said flatly somebody shot him the woman stopped in her tracks the blood draining from her face dead he cant be dead i just talked to him yesterday the cops found him this morning rinker said stepping out of carmels shadow was he a good friend he was he was he was she said shakily her brother the man finished rinker flicked a look at carmel who nodded almost imperceptibly her hand moved in her pocket halfbrother the woman said she dropped on a chair ah jesus she said it was on tv rinker said he said he gave you a tape to hold and that if anything happened to him we were supposed to come and get it because if you keep it somebodys gonna show up here and hurt you carmel said squatting to look the woman straight in the face he gave us an envelope to give you money the man said we dont got no tape but the woman said reflexively how much they had the tape carmel thought and she felt a wire tight in her spine suddenly relax five thousand dollars carmel said speaking to the woman the woman looked up at the man who said i dunno carmel took the envelope out of her pocket if we could get the tape the woman stood up but the man put a hand out to her i think we should look at the tape first he said rolando said not to the woman said nervously drywashing her hands we need to get that tape the woman flipped her hands up explaining to carmel its one of those funny little tapes you need to get a special holderthing to run it were gonna look at the tape the man said decisively if you show up here to give us five thousand he smiled brightly and said then i bet its worth a lot more we really need the tape rolando wasnt supposed to get it and the people it belongs to you really dont want to mess with rinker said her voice was flat and sounded dangerous to carmels ear the vibration apparently went past the latino he sneered at her what the fuckin mafia or the colombianos fuck those people he turned to the woman we look at the tape and back to carmel and rinker hitching up his pants you bitches can leave the envelope here if its enough well give you the tape if not well figure out a price goddamnit this isnt necessary carmel said stepping in front of rinker out at the very edge of her vision she could see rinkers gun hand sliding out of her pocket yeah its fuckin necessary the latino man said his voice rising what i fuckin say is necessary thats whats fuckin necessary right he looked at marta is that right she looked away and carmel shrugged if you say so she took another sideways step and felt rinkers arm come up with the gun the man stepped back a little surprised but still smiling slightly what thats supposed to scare me that was the last thing he said rinker shot him in the center of the forehead and he dropped in his tracks the woman marta clapped both hands to her face in disbelief and before she could scream or make any other sound rinker panned the gun barrel across to her face and snapped if you scream ill kill you give us the tape you get the money carmel said oh my god oh my god oh my god the fuckin tape rinker snarled the woman put a hand out toward the muzzle as though she could fend off bullets and slowly backed away still looking down at the man the tape was in the kitchen in a cupboard inside a dutch oven she handed it to rinker who handed it to carmel who looked at it and nodded you didnt make any copies no no no no the woman was staring fixedly at rinker now then the man in the frontroom groaned and rinker turned and walked toward him hes alive marta blanca asked rinker said yeah it happens sometimes the bullet doesnt even make it through the skull bone she casually leaned forward bringing the muzzle to within an inch or two of the mans head and fired three quick shots into his skull his feet bounced once and he laid still marta crossed herself her eyes now fixed on rinker youre going to kill me arent you she said with the sound of certainty in her voice no im not rinker said she showed a tiny smile carmel who had been carrying the second gun shot marta blanca in the back of the head as she fell carmel stepped forward and fired five more times then she smiled at rinker her eyes bright with excitement and said we got the goddamn tape we got the goddamn tape rinker put the gun back in her jacket pocket and said lets get a drink somewhere lets check the tape to make sure its right erase it and then get a drink somewhere carmel said going out into the hall they closed the door behind themselves they took three steps and suddenly a shaft of light fell across their faces they both looked right standing in the hall and then down a small girl stood there looking up at them their faces were illuminated by the light from the interior then behind the girl a crabby mommy called heather shut that door carmel was fumbling at the pistol in her pocket but then another door opened above them and a male voice said a few unintelligible words they both looked up and the little girl closed the door gotta go rinker said urgently she saw us carmel said but there were footsteps on the landing above and rinker thrust carmel toward the door she went hurrying rinker a step behind out the door down the sidewalk the apartment door closing behind them she was just a kid rinker said she wont remember they might not find the bodies for a week why cant this be easy carmel asked they hurried down the dark side walk toward the lights of dinkytown and she added this is just like a dream i had when i was a teenager a school dream where i couldnt find my locker and the bell was about to ring and every time i was about to find it something else happened to keep me away from it everybody has that dream rinker said were in the clear maybe carmel said she turned to look back the dark figure of a man was climbing on a bike and then headed away from them out on the street but i am on the inside if anything comes out of that kid were gonna have to go back and clean up lets get that drink rinker said they had several drinks and two midnight steaks at carmels apartment carmel had a rarely used grill on her balcony and rinker did the honors moving the meat and sauce like a professional i once worked in a bar where we had an outdoor grill place was full of cowboys wanted their steaks burned she told carmel make mine notquiterare carmel said no blood carmel was in the media room looking at the tape the whole episode with rolo was on the tape while the other tapes had only the final sequence so this is the original she told rinker with satisfaction even if theres a copy someplace they could get me into court but id prove it was a copy and could have been altered and id be gone still be best if there werent any copies rinker said you about done out there all done dinner is served good one more thing before we eat carmel stripped the tape out of the cassette by hand tossed the cassette pack into a waste basket squeezed the jumbled tangle of tape into a wad the size of a softball and dropped it onto the hot charcoal in the grill that wont be coming back she said as she watched it burn three people dead because of that tape rinker said shaking her head ah they were nothing a bunch of druggies carmel said nobodyll miss them even druggies have families sometimes rinker said i hated my stepdad and my older brother i dont like my mom anymore but ive got a little brother hes out in la and he does drugs sometimes he lives on the beach id do anything i could for him i do everything i can for him really carmel said impressed theyd moved the steaks onto a seldomused dining table ive never been like that with anybody i mean i give to charity and all but i have to ive never really been where i do anything for somebody not even for hale carmel shook her head not even for hale you killed for him rinker said no i didnt carmel said i killed for me for something want which is hale if hed had his choice who knows he mightve decided to stay with barbara mmm rinker said chewing she swallowed watched for a moment as carmel worked her way into the steak and then asked would you have killed the little girl carmel said you make me sound like a monster no no im just interested rinker said id do it if it was absolutely necessary but id hate doing it why because shes a kid so what none of this means anything this carmel looked around this life were just a bunch of meat when we think something its just chemicals when we love something its more chemicals when we die all the chemicals go back in the ground and thats it theres nothing left you dont go anywhere except in the ground no heaven no hell no god no nothing just nothing thats pretty grim rinker said she pointed a fork at carmel ive seen people like you philosophical nihilists people who really believe all that eventually they cant stand it most of them commit suicide carmel nodded i can see that thats probably what ill do when i get older if i live to get older why not do it now rinker asked if nothing means anything why wait no reason except curiosity i want to see how things come out i mean killing yourself is as meaningless as not killing yourself makes no difference if you do or you dont so as long as youre not bored as long as youre feeling good why do it but youd do it if you had to kill yourself hell i might kill myself if i dont have to carmel said really sure for the same reason that im staying now curiosity i cant be absolutely onemillion percent sure that theres nothing on the other side so as long as its onemillionth of a percent possible why not check man thats almost enough to bum me out rinker said it does bum me out from time to time carmel said but i get over it pretty quickly im just an upper sort of person chemically absolutely carmel said after a couple more bites she asked how about you how do you justify all this stuff im kind of religious i guess rinker said really yeah i dont think anything really happens in this world that isnt part of gods plan and if god wants somebody to die now if thats that persons fate i cant say no so youre just what the finger of god i wouldnt put it exactly that way it sounds too vain i guess too important but what i do is gods will jesus carmel said then quickly sorry if that offends you ill no no jeez i hang around with italians for christs sake catholics man nobody talks the talk like catholics im not exactly religious that way i mean i used to work in a nudie bar its just that i believe in some kind of god not in heaven or hell just in god were all part of it what about stuff like guns whered you learn about that we always had guns in our house when i was a kid my stepdad was a hunter poacher really so i knew about rifles and shotguns then the mafia guys taught me the basic stuff about handguns though most of them dont know a lot rinker said i figured that if i was gonna do this be a hit man id better learn about them you can get most of what you need from books theres an ocean of gun stuff out there so you know all about the bullets and how fast they go pretty much i dont reload make my own ammunition because that would be too much of a trademark rinker said sooner or later they could get me on it but factory ammo is as good as anything i could make up for my kind of work anyway are the guns really special i mean nah most of them are stolen and they get passed around i got a friend who picks them up for me cuts the threads for the silencers he checks them mechanically and i fire them a few times to double check but basically all my work is within ten feet or so up close so i use fairly small calibers and fire several times you carry the silencers separately yeah a little plastic box with a couple of crescent wrenches and a couple pairs of pliers if you saw them on an xray itd look like a tool kit theres no way to hide guns though not conventional guns anyway they talked for a long time nihilism and religion guns and ammo and that night very late as carmel was dozing off she smiled sleepily as she replayed the conversation shed gone to college with a lot of finance and law students theyd stayed up nights studying not talking this night she thought was like what a lot of people did in college a few beers with friends talk about god and death she drifted peacefully away and may have had a dream about a coil of videotape going up in smoke and about guns chapter eight lucas and black followed the ramsey county medical examiner into the work room where the body of rolando daquila was stretched out on a stainlesssteel tray they really fucked this boy over black said with a low whistle of disbelief hed heard about it but hadnt seen the body look at his kneecaps look at his heels if you want to see something that mustve hurt the me said he was a dark hairy man with a beard a rasputin with a boston accent so what are these letters lucas asked ive got a photograph for you but i thought you might want to see it in person the me said he picked up one of the dead mans hands and turned it over on the back of the hand were a series of bloody scrapes that looked like dew lucas and black squatted got down close what is it black asked i dont know the me said but he did it himself because we found the skin under his fingernails he did it not long before he died he had blood on his fingertips which would have been worn away if his hands had been free and he used them for anything so we think he might have known he was going to be killed and tried to leave something behind like the name of the killer black said which is probably dew really the me bent over the hand and said i never saw dew i was looking at it the other way i saw mop black looked at lucas what do you think mop or dew beats the shit out of me lucas said standing up maybe we can actually see it better in a photo to the me what are the chances he cut himself up just thrashing around i mean they were drilling holes in his kneecaps who knows if a guys being tortured the scratches look deliberate the skin looks almost ploughed off the back of his hands and the shapes look deliberate not like thrashing or involuntary contraction i think he did it on purpose yeah lucas scratched his head took some balls you dont see dew black asked yeah and i see mop and i see something else too and i dont know what they hell that might mean lucas said what black and the me turned their heads trying the scratches at different angles i can see clew like the british spelling of clue lucas said but theres no clue unless it was something back at the house near his hands aw man thats too weird black said clew equals clue dont you see it lucas asked i see it but i dont think thats it i think its initials i think hey what now black was scratching his head i was talking to the st paul guys theyre looking for rolandos sister she lives over by the university but they havent been able to catch her at home her name is marta blanca if you read the scratches backwards it could be an m instead of a w and a b instead of a d then whats all that shit in the middle the me asked pointing at the scratches i dont know this is just a theory black said but his hands were chained up how were his hands like this lucas said demonstrating over his head then he couldnt see what he was doing he was in all kinds of pain hes panicked because he knows whats coming i wonder if he was trying to get us to his sister or that his sister had something to do with it lucas said hey black said its a clew with an ew lets go knock on her door a little girl was playing with a plastic dump truck in the hallway of marta blancas apartment house in front of an open apartment door hello lucas said a mommys voice called whos that lucas leaned over the little girl and knocked once on the door jamb minneapolis police maam were looking for a marta blanca down the hall apartment a black stepped down the hall and knocked on the parisgreen door at the end a young woman appeared from the back of the open apartment carrying a dish towel and a pan that she was in the process of drying is there some kind of trouble lucas nodded yes her brother was killed we need to interview her just a routine thing the womans eyebrows were up i havent heard them out this morning heather usually has the door open so she can play in the hall and marta usually stops to talk to her she looked at black and then back to lucas and asked do you have some kind of id yes i do lucas smiled tried to look pleasant took out his id case handed it over she looked at it then back up at lucas ive heard of you you only do murders whats that mom heather asked talk to you later the mother said to the girl handing lucass id case back this is a policeman he catches bad men i didnt see any men at martas the girl said okay lucas said black at the end of the hall said nobody home they were having a party last night heather said her mother frowned i didnt hear a party i didnt see anybody coming or going i heard them popping the balloons like at a birthday party the girl said lucas looked down the hall at black whose face had gone tight black said thats enough for an entry right lucas said to the mother you better take heather back inside what why she turned her eyes down to the other door black had slipped his pistol out of his holster and was holding it by his side where the little girl couldnt see it the woman looked back at lucas suddenly understanding and said oh no no heather cmon cmon inside with mom when theyd gone inside lucas nodded at black who lined up on the parisgreen door then kicked it below the knob the old door punched open and lucas in his hand stepped past black one step and he saw the latino man on the floor another step and he saw the woman just beyond they were both face down okay black said from behind watch me man the two of them edged through the apartment looking for anyone else but the place was empty except for the bodies lucas walked back to the living room no signs of a struggle nor had the little girl apparently heard any but she had heard the balloons popping these were executions then with silencers hed seen enough bodies in his career that two more shouldnt have affected him but these did the cool efficiency of the killer swatting human beings as though they were so many gnats he shook his head asked black got your phone yeah ill call black said he was standing over the man goddamn look at this guys head same deal halfdozen rounds lucas slipping his gun away squatted next to the womans body her face was older than its years he thought careworn but with smilelines too the rims of her nostrils were slightly rough reddened cocaine he thought same here he said and he added this takes it away from hale allen he mightve been willing to kill his old lady for her money but this isnt that this is something else yeah black said he was too fuckin dumb anyway he was holding the cell phone to his ear and said marcy this is me yeah yeah shut up for a minute will you lucas and i are looking at a couple of more dead ones in an apartment in dinkytown no im not no im not i need you to get all the shit rolling over here huh yeah while he was telling her about it lucas moved quickly through the apartment he was going through a scatter of paper on the kitchen counter when he heard a quiet single knock on the door he looked up just in time to see the mommy take two steps through the door she said did you and then saw the bodies oh god lucas stepped toward her please dont come in she stepped back into the doorway her right hand at her mouth the other hand feeling for the door jamb dont touch anything please dont touch the door lucas said urgently dont touch she backed into the hallway lucas followed and said we havent processed the room yet we need to bring in crimescene specialists she nodded dumbly and lucas added id like to talk to you ive got to wait here for a few minutes until we get this going but id like to see you and your daughter heather now she looked frightened just for a couple of minutes lucas said maybe your place would be better why do you want to talk to heather she said she heard balloons popping those were probably guns between the two of you maybe we can figure out a time that this happened the womans name was jan davis she was a small slender woman with dishwater blonde hair and high cheekbones her apartment was pleasantly cluttered with books scientific reprints and a few music cds all classical she scurried nervously around picking up magazines straightening chairs making lemonade when lucas went over heather bounced in a worn oversized easy chair watching lucas smiling when he looked at her outside in the hallway cops were setting up crimescene lines i have a daughter about your age lucas told heather have you started school yet yes she said i was promoted im in first now when school comes back so you wont be the littlest kids anymore therell be kindergarteners who are smaller than you yup but she hadnt thought of that before and she slipped off the chair and ran into the kitchen hey mom mr davenport says therell be kids littler than me at school a minute later davis came out of the kitchen with two glasses of lemonade theres plenty more if the other gentleman wants some lucas nodded and took the glass i noticed on your mailbox on the way in your husband howard howards not living here now she said firmly not for a while lucas asked about seven weeks i just havent taken his name off the mailbox so what youre going to get divorced yes im just finishing my thesis at the u she said ive got a postdoc offer from johns hopkins and heather and ill be moving to baltimore in december howard wont be coming well im sorry lucas said and he was after a moments silence he turned to look at heather and asked what were you doing last night when you heard the party at martas were you in the hall heather looked guiltily at her mother and then said just for a minute i left my truck out there shes not supposed to go out in the hall at night after it gets dark davis said but sometimes she does do you know what time it was we were talking about that before you came over davis said she was out there with her blocks and her bulldozer when i told her to come in but she left her truck and a few minutes later i heard her messing around out there and i went out and got her it was between eight and nine eight and nine you wouldnt have been watching television or anything so youd know what show was on davis was shaking her head no im rewriting my thesis the final edit and id just shut down she cocked her head to the side then said hey i think the word processor has a time thing on it that shows when the file was closed she hopped off the couch and headed for a back room lucas and heather followed davis study was a converted bedroom with a single bed still in it howard slept here the last few weeks he lived with us she said offhandedly she was bringing the computer up cycling through the windows display then bringing up the word processor yup she tapped the screen and bounced in her seat a little the way her daughter had the file was stored at eight twentytwo i stored it and got up and heard heather in the hall and told her to come back inside all right thats something lucas said eight twentytwo he looked at heather did you see anybody when you were in the hallway she shook her head no then added i peeked when mom was gone and i saw two ladies two ladies this was after you heard the party balloons she nodded solemn in the face of lucass interest how did you see them lucas asked when i heard them i opened the door just to peek she said i thought it was marta but it wasnt marta she shook her head again did you know the ladies no never saw them before she shook her head do you remember what they looked like lucas asked she cocked her head in a perfect rendition of her mothers thinkingmannerism and after two or three seconds said maybe i do chapter nine carmel loan learned that the bodies had been found from tv she and rinker were walking through the skyway toward loans office eating frozen yogurt when carmel spotted a printed headline under a talking head in a deliwindow tv two bodies found near university she nudged rinker with her elbow that was quick rinker said looking up at the tv so was the other one we could have gotten a couple days on either of them but we didnt i wonder about that kid rinker said i hope nothing comes out of that carmel nodded and said let me find out when these bodies were found if the cops have released any information i can go over there and ask how it affects the case against hale and maybe find out what theyve got too much curiosity might be dangerous rinker said i can walk that line carmel said confidently carmel went straight to lucas i understand you found them she said i mean you personally yeah not one of the brighter moments in my day lucas said he was tipped back in his new office chair his feet up reading the modality report hed bought the chair himself a grey steelandfabric contraption that felt so good that he was thinking of marrying it ill tell you what carmel said we got one upperclass woman and three spies dead and i would suggest to you that theres something going on besides some guy trying to kill his wife for her money im reasonably sure that youre smart enough to have figured it out i figured it out all right lucas said your goddamn clients a snake he was financing the local cocaine cartel with his old ladys money and she found out after he killed her he rolled up the rest of the group before they could talk about it you cant carmel started then she stopped herself she ticked her finger at lucas and said youre teasing me maybe lucas said i just dont know why we havent slept together carmel said except that my heart belongs to another so does mine lucas said i just wish id meet her carmel laughed let herself laugh a little too long even indelicatelythen so i can tell my client that he can stop the heavy drugs and try to get some normal sleep hes had a problem lucas asked he yawned and looked at his watch he sees himself involved in traumatic rectal enlargement at the hands well not the hands of biker gangs at stillwater yeah well lucas said dismissively dont tell him hes clear because were still looking at everybody but between you and me yeah he seems unlikely and if we get him into court on a murder charge and you ask me if i said that ill perjure myself and say no of course not thatd be a big fuckin change a cop committing perjury carmel said ah right ill tell him youll be easing up thatd probably be right lucas said carmel turned as though to leave then asked ingenuously you got anything on the new killings like potential clients i can chase well we got this out of a kid lucas said he dropped his feet off the new chair pulled open a desk drawer and took out a computergenerated photo were putting it in the paper he passed it to carmel who looked at it for a minute and then asked what is this what the kid saw this is shit carmel said this is nothing i know but its what we got it looks like two aliens a tall one and a short one i thought they looked like grim reapers the head things they have on the silk scarves had helped carmel wouldve spent a moment giving thanks if shed had any idea who she might give thanks to in the picture the scarves gave their heads a tall slender profile the kid must have seen them as silhouettes the faces within the silhouettes were generic enough to be meaningless what are the head things carmel asked the kid didnt know maybe some kind of hat maybe they were nuns good thought carmel said theyre women anyway lucas said at least the kid says they are the shooter in the stairwell was a woman carmel said the triumph of feminism lucas said we got equalopportunity hitters well carmel flipped the photo back on the desk on second thought if you find her call somebody else she might be a little dangerous to know especially if you lose the case carmel snorted as she went through the door as if that might happen she said when carmel got back to the apartment she found rinkers suitcase in the front hall and rinker just getting out of the bathroom freshly showered scrubbing her hair dry so what happened were clear carmel said she gave rinker a short account of her talk with lucas rinker was pleased with the outcome im outa here she said ive got to get back to my business do you have a reservation yeah for four oclock rinker said ill drive you out to the airport carmel said listen what do you do in the winter mostly work rinker said fluffing her hair where i live theres not a hell of a lot to do outside same here you ever go to cancun or cozumel cozumel acapulco a couple of times practice my spanish i try to get out of here for at least three weeks after it gets cold a week in november a week in january and a week in march carmel said we ought to go together ive got connections in the hotels and so on its a good time jeez rinker said she seemed oddly pleased and carmel got the impression she wasnt often invited places thats sounds nice so call me in october and if you can get away ill set up the hotels and everything and you can set up your own plane reservations and well meet down there id like that rinker said what do you do lay on the beach shop i kinda like to boogie listen i know some guys there and there are always guys around wed be going around rinker held up a finger hold that thought but this just popped into my mind before i forget the guns are in the closet you gotta take them down and throw them in the river or bury them somewhere also the box of shells the shells are with the gun theyre the only things left that can hang us i sorta like them carmel said fine spend a few hundred bucks and get a nice clean gun of your own i can make a call and have one sent to you brand new cold no registration to worry about if you want a silencer i can handle that too but the guns in the closet have gotta go im nervous having them here even hidden you gotta do it ill call you every ten minutes until its done we can dump them in the river by the airport carmel said i know a place then you wont have to worry excellent rinker said she cocked her head listen if we go to cancun what about my hair ive always had the feeling that its a pretty smalltown cut you know like im already middleaged or something i thought carmel did cartoon breathintake and held her fingers to her breast theres this woman down there ive had my hair done every time ive gone down shes a genius talking about mexico they almost forgot the guns with the door open and rinkers suitcase in the hall carmel snapped her finger and whispered the guns she went back to get them and fumbled the box of shells there were still thirtyodd shells in the box and they flew everywhere carmel hastily scooped them up pushed them back in the box and hurried to the door before going to the airport carmel took rinker to the flats below fort snelling on the minnesota river the forts just a relic carmel said as they looked up the bluff at the revetments the first thing ever built here thats still around anyway the army had a death camp for indians right where were standing this was after the big revolt they hanged thirtyeight indians in a single drop down in mankato this area this is where they kept the survivors especially the woman half of them died during the winter most of the women were raped by soldiers happy story rinker said i dont know what id do if i got raped but itd be something unpleasant if i got my hands on the guy carmel said i bet rinker said she didnt mention the guy named dalesomething they found a quiet path along the river checked to make sure there was nobody watching and pitched the guns into a deep spot thats it rinker said were all done on the way back from the airport carmel called hale allen allen said god i was trying to get you earlier in the afternoon are you coming to the funeral tomorrow i was trying to get you but all i got was your machine carmel said weve got some things to talk about i spoke to lucas davenport this afternoon what whatd he say allen was anxious im in my car and i hate to talk on this cell phone why dont i just stop by i could be there in twenty minutes twenty minutes he said with an uncertain note in his voice okay see you in twenty not the most eager lover shed ever had carmel thought as she ended the phone call on the other hand he didnt know they were lovers not yet in a couple of hours he would a certain kind of man sharksinthewater attorneys more often than not alone with carmel would produce a pass sometimes depending on her mood and the man carmel would receive the pass and things would proceed carmel was far from a virgin but had never had a long term sexual relationship one woman who was almost a friend had once confided to carmel that one of her exsuitors had said to a number of people at a party that carmel frightened him he felt like the fly and she was the spider carmel pretended to be puzzled by the comment but wasnt entirely displeased fear wasnt the worst thing to instill in a man especially the man who made the comment who was something of a thug himself still after that she tried to soften her bedroom image tried to slow down a little but she really didnt much care for the weight of a man pressing her down the trapped feeling gasping over his shoulder staring at the ceiling while he flailed around on top and she was a little picky she didnt like hairy shoulders even less hairy backs she didnt like chest hair that connected with pubic hair she didnt care for bald men or the untidiness of uncircumcised men she didnt care for men who burped or whose breath smelled of anything cooked or who peed with the bathroom door open or farted orgasms didnt often happen not with men her best orgasms came alone in the bathtub hale would change that she thought if not right away she could train him hale allen lived on a quiet upperclass street off one of the lakes far enough from the crowds to have a certain peace in the evening without the constant to ing and froing of thin young women with earphones and blades but at the same time close enough that residents could walk down and enjoy the mix when they wished to the house was long and white with lakegreen shutters and a yellow bug light over the central door and a long driveway that curved up a slope past fiftyyearold burr oaks a small white sign at the edge of the driveway warned burglars that the house was protected by insula armed response carmel left the jag under the spreading arms of an oak and rang the doorbell a moment later she heard the muffled pounding of stocking feet on a stairs and then hale opened the door a white terry cloth towel in his hand he smiled and backed up and said come on in and rubbed his damp hair with the towel he looked like something off the perfume pages of esquire she had never been inside his house barbara allens house it turned out was decorated with a cool and discerning eye a mix of pieces new and old but nothing fabulous carmel felt the instant chill of class inferiority she moved into the living room turned and said i talked to davenport yeah he was eager its pretty much over with theyve got three more shootings by the same person probably the same person and youre an obvious noncandidate in all three of them so theyre gonna do what talk to the press tell them doesnt work that way carmel said she took a slow turn past a small watercolor no name that she recognized but she did feel a vibration coming from the work a simple street scene probably new york and understood that it was good she looked away from the painting the way it works is they dont say anything to anybody they just go away then if it turns out that you were involved they dont look like dumbshits thats not fair allen protested once again she had to strain to think of him as a lawyer of course its not fair but they have the choice of one being fair to hale allen or two taking the chance that theyre going to look like dumbshits which choice do you think a bunch of city hall bureaucrats is gonna choose by golly that really makes me mad he hurled the terrycloth towel at a couch hey unless something new comes up its over she said about barbara the funeral is at two yes at morganthaus i wont be able to make the service ill be at the cemetery though thanks i he plopped on the couch picked up the damp towel turned it in his large hands i have some questions that i want to ask barbara and ive got some things i want to talk over but i cant cause shes dead i cant get around that like what do you want to tell her real curiosity like i want to tell her about louise now carmel was puzzled why youd only hurt her i wouldnt only hurt her i think its more complicated than that dont you all right carmel said she sat on the couch next to him tell me about it tell me about louise louise liked sex and so did hale barbara liked it better than say a fried egg sandwich but not as much as a good soft back rub when we were having sex i always had the feeling that she was taking care of me not making love with me she was always waiting for me to finish she always wanted it to be good for me but then she always wanted to round out the night with a book uhhuh i know the feeling carmel said the room was closing around them getting tighter the walls moving in until there was nothing in the house but the two of them he talked about barbara about louise laughed a little about some of louises excesses cried a little about barbaras idiosyncracies carmel patted him on the shoulder blades then rubbed his back a little he held one of her hands turned it over fondled it the room closed in and carmel tipped back and there he was a perfect little spread of hair on his chest a tidy circumcision unfortunately she thought afterward he didnt have the best of bathroom habits she sighed so much to do chapter ten sloan was wearing khaki shorts a black fauxleather fanny pack pulled around to his stomach and a pink golf shirt his legs were the color of skim milk and so bony they might have been attached to a short ostrich my wife made me wear them he said looking down at the shorts she said i was gonna get heat stroke and theres no point in getting heat stroke on a vacation day lucas was peering over the top of his desk you got your gun in the fanny pack yeah i got the pack from brinkhoff its allvelcro its not really zipped up see he stood up pulled on the front of the fanny pack and the entire cover came away the revolver inside was attached by a single tab over the barrel which tore away when sloan pulled the gun out pretty slick lucas said he settled back but it looks stupid my wife says your wife has the fashion sense of a cockroach ill tell her you said so if you do ill have to kill you there was a tentative knock at the door lucas called come in the door opened and hale allen stepped halfway inside stopping when he saw sloan with his khaki shorts pink shirt and the pistol in his hand you need to talk to lucas sloan asked if hes not busy allen said i was just about to shoot him sloan said could it wait until after that well do you think hed be better by lunchtime go away lucas told sloan to allen politely with curiosity come in sit down is there anything new with the case allen asked he looked uneasily around the office as he asked the question crossed and recrossed his legs were still working on it but were kind of stuck lucas said a week had gone by since lucas had spoken to carmel loan all the crimescene evidence had been exhaustively reviewed but nothing was coming out in the meantime a ferris wheel at a neighborhood carnival had collapsed two children had been killed and seven more badly hurt the execution killings had disappeared from the media as reporters and state safety inspectors chased down every carnival in the state the lack of both progress and outside attention had taken pressure off the investigation lucas had the feeling that the whole thing was headed for the deadletter file you heard about barbaras parents allen asked just rumors they were going to sue me for wrongful death claiming i was involved in killing barbara like that oj lawsuit allen said indignantly they were gonna try to keep me from inheriting so theyd get her money then it turned out that ninety percent of the money goes to the foundation not to me if they sued me and won a hundred percent would go to the foundation they wouldnt get a dime ho lucas said yeahthey said screw that we arent suing if there isnt any payoff they dropped the whole thing hum said lucas exactly allen was indignant but his eyes kept wandering away from lucas lucas had seen it before in somebody who felt guilty about something and was about to confess allen lucas thought wasnt here to talk about his inlaws so what else is going on lucas asked leaning back trying to sound kindly he wished sloan were back sloan was a master at this how are you doing are you okay we were pretty rough on you for a while well allen smiled and lucas thought here it comes i came to see you because you know about the case and you seemed like a pretty good guy and everybody says youre pretty smart and youve been around okay keep him rolling ive been feeling kind of weird about something about the case you mean psychologically troubled i not exactly allen said he leaned forward intent now you know i really did love barbara she was fun in a quiet way but we were different and this affair you know that i had an affair yes lucas said he gestured with one hand as to say so what havent we all the tentative smile flickered over allens face again when barbara got killed i felt terrible about it your guys found out about the affair and i hadnt told carmel when she found out she hit the roof she went and talked to louise and now everybodys in an uproar lucas nodded i can see why carmel would be unhappy facing the possibility of defending you in court yeah yeah allen said brushing the comment away so that wasnt where he was going lucas thought the day you told her that you werent so interested in me any more lucas glanced at a wall calendar a week ago today exactly a week ago allen said carmel came over to my house to give me the news and we had a drink yadayadayada and then she comes on to me yeah lucas eyebrows went up yeah really hard really hard and you know carmel she gets what she wants lucas allowed a faint mantoman smile to slip onto his face the next thing you knew you were working closely with your attorney what she did was fuck my brains loose and shes been back three more times since then does that sound bad does that sound crazy i cant sleep thinking about it but i really cant talk to any of my friends either theyd go batshit if i told them most of them are barbaras friends too out at the club lucas shook his head i wouldnt worry about it too much ive seen all kinds of reactions to spousal deaths and believe me youre not the first guy to fall in bed with another woman after his wifes been killed maybe theres a drive for intimacy you think so allen said he seemed to brighten momentarily relief lucas wasnt sure its something like that lucas said listen as long as youve told me all this why carmel she doesnt seem like your type detective sherrill told me that you were a pretty relaxed guy carmel on the other hand detective sherrill shes the one he made a figure with his hands yeah she seemed nice his eyes wandered away again and he hunched forward in his chair carmel pillow talks she told me that shes been in love with me for two years and hid it because she thought it was hopeless because i was married to a rich woman she told me that louise thats the woman i was having an affair with was a miserable golddigger and a loser she gets really violent about it really keep him rolling im serious once she grabbed me by the dick and said shed cut it off if i ever put it back in louise whoa and she said she was in love with you for two years yeah ever since a little thing in a restaurant i couldnt even remember it do you believe her that shes been in love i know it sounds vain but i do youd have to hear her talk she remembered me saying things doing things places shed bumped into me times wed just had a word or two lucas thought for a moment and then said are you seeing her tonight of course every night she says were gonna get married in a couple of years huh lucas turned in his chair to face his window his fingers steepled at his mouth and looked out at the street he hoped he looked like sherlock holmes then he swivelled back to face allen do you think if you suggested that you go out to penelopes that shed go penelopes oh heck yes she loves that kind of scene minnetonka the lake all that trendy expensive call her she lives downtown right shes got some kind of fabulous apartment that was in the star tribune lucas knew exactly where she lived hed joked about it with a banker friend who lived in the same building right and it is fabulous allen said call her suggest penelopes and when she gets to your place suggest that she drive make up some kind of excuse sprained your gas pedal ankle or something nothing serious so you have to limp just get her to drive she drives most of the time anyway allen said she doesnt like my car i gotta brownandcreme lexus she calls it a jap car shes got this red jag good dont tell her any of this by the way lucas said dont tell her you talked to me just get her out there and have a nice long meal i will what are you going to do observe lucas said not me another guy observe what allen asked this whole thing sounds a little bit off to me remember whether you think like this or not you are a rich guy and youre goodlooking women are going to come after you and its hard to tell whos sincere and who isnt so i got a guy on the staff who specializes in mmm what would you call it emotional readings i guess ill have him take a look at the two of you and tell me what he thinks hell look at her body language stuff like that ill pass it along to you hes gonna eat with us allen asked dimly no no hell just be there lucas said dont go looking around for him or anything just enjoy yourself and make sure that you stay long enough that my guy can get a reading an emotional reading lucas spread his hands hey its what i got when allen had gone lucas leaned back in his chair and stared at the ceiling for a few moments thinking about carmel loan he ran through everything shed said to him since the allen killing and in running through the various conversations theyd had he stumbled over one small gemstone when hed last talked to her shed made a deliberately crude comment about three dead spies and an upper class woman anyway he remembered it that way and he remembered that theyd had difficulty finding anyone to claim the bodies or anyone who would even admit to knowing who they were had they released the names by the time hed seen carmel he didnt think so but who knows maybe the television people had talked to the cops outside the house and somebody made a comment or maybe a reporter had talked to a neighbor and the names had gotten out maybe that could explain how she knew the two dinkytown dead were latinos carmel loan he scribbled her name on a legal pad looked at it then drew an arrow and scribbled another name rolando daquila another arrow at ninety degrees from the first from carmel to the next name hale allen he looked at that for a moment drew another arrow from carmel to barbara allen and another from carmel to dead spies of course her connection to marta blanca and her dead boyfriend was purely part of his memory nothing that could be proven a cold wind was already blowing through lucas chest he knew what he was going to do he even knew how he was going to do it to the smallest detail but the idea chilled him he felt like a wealthy man about to shoplift something expensive and fooling with carmel loan was not like messing with a doper or a player or a stickup guy if he screwed up he could go to jail after a few minutes he roused himself from the chair and walked down the hall to the homicide office sloan was just leaving the goddamned air conditioning is giving me goose bumps what are you doing tonight lucas asked maybe taking the old lady out for a movie if you take her to penelopes on lake minnetonka ill pay for the meal and sign off on the overtime ya got me sloan said quickly for one thing if i said no the old ladyd murder me sloan had a daughter in college and tuition to pay and luxury was hard to come by what do i have to do when sloan had gone lucas called jim bone president of polaris bank jim are you gonna be home between eight and nine tonight yeah you need something i need to talk ten minutes maybe ive been running around like a mad dog and i cant spring any time during the day and besides youre busy come on over kerin would love to see you hows she doing bones wife was pregnant just starting to show you guys didnt waste any time yeah well were old people myron bunnson told everybody that his mother was a stone freak hippie and that his real given name was bullet blue and that his father had been an oakland hells angel before the angels got old none of that was true his parents were really named myron and adele bunnson and they ran a dairy farm near eau claire wisconsin bullet was working one of the three valet slots at penelopes he saw the red jag swing into the lot and said to the other two this is it this is mine threeway split man said his friend richard schmid who was trying to convince his friends to call him crank the third valet nodded three ways no problem bullet blue said im just workin the chick right crank recognized the jag bullets chances of nailing this particular chick especially dressed as he was like an organgrinder monkey were slim and none and slim was outa town still bullet blue wanted the car and they all had their favorites blue took the jag and ten bucks from carmel who flashed a smile at him thank you maam blue said giving her his best look the look apparently missed over her bare shoulder and she was into the restaurant with her friend a guy who blue thought looked way too straight whatever he hopped into the jag and rolled it into the valet parking area on the side of the restaurant lucas was leaning against a chevy van talking to the man who sat in the drivers seat you got the money he asked lucas keys bullet dropped the keys into lucas hand lucas passed them through the window to the man in the drivers seat who took them and clambered into the back lucas handed bullet blue a small fold of currency ill talk to mckinley if we could just get her off this one time bullet slipped the bills into his pants pocket the threeway split only involved the ten bucks from carmel i didnt say i could do that lucas said bluntly from the van they could hear the grinding buzz of the keycutter the best we could do is maybe drop the charge to something less heavy but shes gonna do some time shes already done time blue protested he was talking about his sister who came off the farm two years after bullet and started calling herself baby blue shes been sittin in jail for a month waiting for the trial cant we get her time served not with this one lucas said if she hadnt had the gun it wasnt her gun it was eddies bullet said heatedly but she had it ill see if mckinley and the guysll go for two or three months as it is shes looking at a year and maybe more anything you can do man and you stay the fuck outa trouble dickweed lucas said go back home if you gotta right spend my life pulling cow tits then get your ass back in dunwoody how much time you got to go there lucas asked one semester one semesteryou get out you start making some good money and you make it wherever you go yeah yeah bullet said you dont want to hear my dunwoody speech i just aint made to fix cars no moren im made to pull cow tits im made to rock n roll youre made to the man in the van spoke over lucas shoulder all done he handed carmels key ring to lucas and lucas handed it to blue dunwoody lucas said rock n roll said blue as he walked away lucas wearing his dark blue lawyer suit and carrying a blackleather briefcase said jim bone to the doorman at the desk who looked at a list and said and your name sir lucas davenport go right on up mr davenport the doorman said making a tick next to lucas name lucas had made a mediumsized fortune when he sold his simulations company bones bank managed it really risky bone said the economy could drop like a rock and whos going to pay a hundred dollars a round after that lucas nodded yeah but i wouldnt have to make a hundred dollars a round i could break even at sixty you dont know anything about running a golf course bone said of course not i wouldnt even try to i dont even like golf thats why theyre talking about professional management its not completely crazy bone admitted finally the whole point lucas said is that i could give my daughter that big chunk right now take a mortgage on the rest put all the excess into course maintenance building value by the time shes twentyfive or thirty she owns the whole limitedpartnership share ninetynine percent while i own the generalpartners share one percent and we sell it and shes fixed she picks up four or five million minimum and who knows maybe five or ten the concepts okay but to tell you the truth you might do better in the long run just to pay the governments bite when they were done lucas said goodbye to kerin who seemed much softer than when hed first met her slower happier pleased with herself bone at the door said ill have the guys work it up for you well have something in a week thanks jim there were five doors on bones floor three apartments in addition to bones and the firestair door no security camera lucas let the elevator doors close behind him and pushed twentyseven as the elevator started up he took a nylon sock out of his pants pocket spread it apart and slipped it over the top of his head like a watch cap if there were somebody in the hallway he could slip it back off maybe without it being seen but the hallway of the twentyseventh floor was dead quiet still in the elevator blocking the door with his foot he pulled the nylon down over his face turned up his coat collar so it looked almost clerical and did a quick peek out in the hall no video cameras he walked quickly down to carmels apartment slipped the first key in the key turned the other he thought must be for her office there was one light on somewhere at the back of the apartment hello he called no answer hello he did a quick tour checking his nerves starting to jangle hed done this before but hed make a poor burglar he thought he started with her home rolodex there were dozens of names most attached to the name of a law firm or a corporation business acquaintances there were a few names with a first and last followed by a number but usually by two numbers an office and a home phone lucas thought probably not a killers number there were ten numbers that involved simply a name and a number and he copied those into a notebook then in the kitchen he found another address book this one apparently purely personal he took a small nikon camera from his briefcase made sixteen shots stopped to reload the camera made eight more and dropped it back in his briefcase then he started through the apartment he found a dell computer in her study with a builtin zip drive hed brought zip jaz and superdisks he brought the computer up clicked on the computer icon and dragged all of her documents to the zip icon as the computer began dumping to the zip drive he began looking through the array of filing cabinets on the other side of the room he pulled the drawers one at a time and in the last drawer found a mass of paid bills nothing big just the usual onceamonth routine he riffled through them quickly separated out the phone bills for the last four months and used the camera again but the last phone bill was almost exactly a month old he went into the kitchen where hed seen a neat stack of envelopes flipped through them found the us west bill with another little jangle of nerves he picked up a teakettle on the stove tipped it to make sure there was enough water and turned it on he looked in the bedroom while he waited for the teakettle to heat nothing obvious he very carefully went through her drawers afraid that he would disturb them in a way she could detect he found nothing he checked the closets quickly and was closing the door when a brassy sparkle on the floor caught his eye the sparkle had a certain quality that he unconsciously recognized he stooped scraped his hand along the rug felt it picked it an unfired shell he took a penlight out of his pocket searched the closet floor but found only the one cartridge he thought about it for a second then put it in his pocket he was closing the closet door when the teakettle began to hum he hurried back to the kitchen let the raw steam play down the back of the envelope pried up the seal took out the bill shot a quick photo of the longdistance calls and resealed the envelope before the adhesive could dry he put the kettle back and sniffed the smell of the adhesive hung in the air only faintly but it was there he thought he hoped carmel would take her time in the office the computer was sitting quietly he paged quickly through a few other folders dragged a couple of them to the zip icon waited a few seconds until the files had been dumped then shut the computer down all right what else he was ready to leave before he went he took a last look around the apartment was fabulous but aside from the stuff in the filing cabinets and stuck away in drawers it hardly seemed to have been lived in obsessively neat everything in its place like a stage set the phone in his pocket rang sloan theyre leaving he said i just got my shrimp cocktail i hope im not supposed to follow them nah let them go but what do you think theyre tight all right it was kissysmoochy all night but i think the guy was expecting somebody else to show he kept cruising the place looking around huh wonder what thats about lucas asked feeling just slightly guilty then how come youre eating a shrimp cocktail and theyre already leaving you having it for dessert well yeah sloan said his voice went a little hoarse i love these things when carmel got home a little after eleven she had to work the next day she stopped at the threshold of the apartment and wrinkled her nose something she thought was not quite right she couldnt put her finger on it the air was wrong or something the apartments chemicals had been disturbed she walked through leaving the hallway door open so shed have a place to run if she needed it but found nothing at all huh she said as she closed the hallway door by the next morning shed forgotten it chapter eleven when lucas got home he took the compactflash card out of his pocket dropped another one out of the nikon and read them into his home computer after transferring the files to photoshop he sharpened the photos as much as he could and dumped them to his photo printer that done he called davenport simulations and let the phone ring until a man answered his voice grumpy at the interruption steve lucas davenport hey lucas whereve you been man steve smoked a little weed from time to time dropped a little acid on weekends and let his beard grow when the acid was on him he could program in three dimensions you dont come around any more id be like the ghost of bad news the former owner hanging around lucas said but i needed somebody who could help me out with a computer problem i thought about you from your phreaking days i dont do that shit anymore hardly ever steve said uh what do you need is there anyone on the net who could track down anonymous telephone numbers lucas asked if there is do you know how you could get in touch with him steve dropped his voice though he probably was alone depends on what the numbers are and how much trouble you want to go to and whether you want to pay for it how much would it cost if you want all the numbers and dont ask any questions i know a guy who does that kind of work he could email them to you for a couple of bucks a name how many do you have maybe fifty lucas said oh jesus i thought you were talking about hundreds or thousands i dont know if hed be interested in a little job like that id pay him more lucas said i can ask steve said say five hundred bucks thats good lucas said im putting my name behind this man ill be stuck for the five hundred if you dont come through steve all right all right i could use any other information they can find on the people who belong to the phone numbers i mean if they can do that thatd cost you more go up to a thousand you got it send me an email with the numbers ill pass it on youll get it back by email jricy lucas copied odd unusual or unidentified numbers from the photos and asked for names and addresses he dumped the email to steve then checked his own email account and found two letters one advertising pornographic photographs of pre teens which he deleted and another from his daughter sarah was in the first grade starting to read and write but her mother a tv news producer had shown her how to use a voicewriting software program using the voicewriter sarah now wrote lucas a couple of times a week lucas took fifteen minutes to interpret the voicewritten text and he wrote back struggling to use words that sarah could sound out while at the same time trying to avoid the dickandjane syndrome he was just finishing when a perky little female voice from the computer said you have mail he sent the email note to sarah then clicked on his inbox the sole piece of mail was a list of names and addresses attached to the phone numbers hed sent out all but two of the names had personal information attached lucas scanned it the information appeared to come from credit bureaus although some might have come from state motorvehicle departments at the end of it all was a price tag send quick he muttered he looked at his watch just under half an hour he printed the numbers out and turned to the documents hed pulled from carmels computer though he spent less than five seconds with most of them virtually all were workrelated it was after three in the morning before he wiped the disk shut down the computer and went to bed the next day he chopped the disk to pieces with a butcher knife and dropped the pieces in two separate trash cans in the skyway he had an almost superstitious dread of computer files turning up when they werent supposed to then while he was still in the skyway between the pillsbury building and the government center he noticed a woman in a shapeless black dress wearing a white scarf on her head babushkastyle he turned to watch her walking away some religious or ethnic group he thought but he didnt know which he went on to police headquarters whistling where he called sherrill can either you or black come by for a minute which would you prefer me or tom stop he said i just want to hear about the allen case and mention a couple of things to you sherrill came down a few minutes later and dropped into his visitors chair were running out of stuff to look at she said let me tell you what hale allen told me yesterday lucas said he laid it out quickly then told her about the ethnic woman in the skyway she looked like the aliens the kid described when she was putting together that composite photo so we need to get a lowangle photograph of somebody in a dark dress wearing a scarf over her head then we need to plug in a bunch of faces including carmels carmel loan sherrill said that could get rough if we went public and didnt have the goods which is why i dont want her to know that were looking at her not unless we get something solid all right sherrill said she pushed herself up i can probably get a picture of carmel from your lady at the startribune library if she still works there she does lucas said and ill have the id guys put together a photo spread we can base it on the composite the kid gave us when do you want to talk to the kid the sooner the better lucas said i dont know how long memories last with little kids ill try to set it up this afternoon something else lucas said he dug in his pocket could you have the lab do an analysis on the slug he tossed the shell to her she caught it one handed looked at it and then asked whats going on lucas nothing its one of mys i just want to look at the difference between a random analysis and what were getting from the slugs we took out of the dead guys do we really have a case based on a metals analysis she looked at him suspicious turned the cartridge in her hand then if i lost this particular shell she said you wouldnt mind if i just sent in one of my own lucas said send that one in huh just send it in this one that one lucas off my case marcy he said she grinned at him and said marcy my ass were operating arent we send the fuckin thing in he said lucas spent the morning running through the numbers hed taken from carmels address books and phone bills hed marked fiftyfive of them to be checked in three hours hed halffilled a yellow legal pad with notes but nothing promising a few minutes before noon he got to the final longdistance call on the last of the longdistance bills a call made two weeks earlier he noticed a couple of days after barbara allens death the note from the hacker said only small business phone listed to tennex messenger service lucas dialed the number and a woman answered on the first ring tennex messenger service yes could i speak to the tennex manager or whoever runs the place im sorry sir mr wilson is out i can give you his voicemail well i was just wondering how i could set up an account with tennex im sorry sir were answering service all i can do is give you his voice mail okay thanks if you could do that he was switched and got a voicemail introduction a slightly vague voice that might have come from a druggedout teenager you have reached tennex messenger service your uh fastest messenger service in the deecee area we are either uh on the phone or out on a call we check back for messages so like leave your name and uh phone number thanks not interested in talking to a strungout bicyclemessenger lucas hung up yawned stood up and stretched and walked down to homicide black was at his desk shuffling through papers sloan had his feet up reading a pioneer press lunch lucas asked yeah i could see my way clear to a lunch sloan said sherrill pushed through the office door spotted lucas and said i sent that slug in and were all set for four oclock this afternoon sloans eyebrows went up really where at he asked sherrill correctly interpreted his tone and implication shut up she saidto lucas mama is not happy with the fact that were coming back to see the kid there was all the loose talk in the newspapers about hit men so ill let you warm her up when we get there lucas said woman talk bonding chitchat that kind of shit sexism sloan said shaking his head sadly and from a member of the difference commission lucass hand went to his forehead ah jesus i forgot theres a meeting tonight they looked at him with sympathy and sherrill patted his shoulder it could be worse how i dont know you could be shot hes been shot sloan said itd have to be a lot worse than that lunch with sloan was a long hour of gossip with brief sidetrips into current styles of crime murder was down even with allen and the two dead in dinkytown the fourth rolo was on the st paul books rape was down ag assault was down coke was down speed was up and so was heroin guiterrez told me that the day heroin started coming back was a happy day in his life sloan said speaking of one of the dope detectives he says targets gonna get ripped off and kmart and walmart but at least theyre not gonna have a bunch of robot crazy coke freaks running around with guns thinkin that nothing can hurt them lucas nodded give a guy a little heroin he goes to sleep give him a little more he dies no problem shoplift like crazy though sloan said a cultural skill lucas said lifting up the top of his cheeseburger to inspect the solitary suspiciously pale pickle passed on by heroin gurus somebody oughta look into it an anthropologist or a proctologist sloan said say with that commission meeting tonight you wont be shooting im thinking of giving it up anyway lucas said that goddamn iowa kid shot my eyes out last time hes a freak sloan said hes shooting olympic now hes got a target on his locker ten bulls every shot in the x ring in the middle of the xring you can see black all around the edges hes good lucas said at my age you cant be that good cant do it your fine muscle control isnt fine enough yeah yeah hes sort of a dumb fuck sloan said i heard he was actually a smart fuck yeah well hes a dumb smart fuck sloan looked at his watch i gotta get going i gotta talk to a guy on the walk back to city hall lucas realized that a mental penny had dropped during the lunch something was packed into the back of his head now but he didnt know what it was but it was he thought something important he dug at it and realized it involved the iowa kid the kid was still a uniformed cop but he volunteered for everything hard and he had a thing about guns all kinds of guns he dreamt about them used them fixed them compared them bought and sold them a throwback to an old western gunfighter lucas thought he tried to think about the coming interview with jan and heather davis the photospread that sherrill was putting together a photospread involved some risks if the child identified carmel as one of the killers and they went to court then a witnessstand identification could be challenged on grounds that the police had contaminated the witnesses memory with the photographs so the whole thing had to be done just right as much as he tried to think about the upcoming interview the shooter from iowa always came back something that sloan said about him something small he just couldnt nail it down this he thought after a while is what its like be senile he had something in his head but he couldnt get it out finally he walked down to the locker room wandered through looking for the iowa kids locker found it with the target on it just like sloan said checking out the competition a tall blond cop asked another shooter and lucas nodded at him i heard about the perfect score lucas said he leaned forward to look at it the bullseye on the target was called the tenring but inside the bull was another much smaller circle the xring not much bigger around than a slug there were ten small target faces on the target sheet and in the middle of each xring a slightly softedged hole around each of the holes the full xring line could be seen lucas whistled guys abnormal the cop asked he was pulling on a bulletproof vest slapping the velcro fastening tabs in place my eyes are supposed to be but i cant even see the x ring on them faces keeping them inside the tenring is one thing keeping them inside the x man thats abnormal its tough lucas agreed ive never done it he took a last look shook his head and started back to the office keeping them inside the tenring was one thing but inside the x he went back to his office scrolled through the list of phone numbers hed sent off on the internet and there it was the last one tennex messenger service sonofabitch he said that had to be a coincidence he was still thinking about it when sherrill and black showed up with a file of fulllength color photos of women silhouetted wearing head scarves with dark raincoats a dozen different faces had been grafted into the folds of the scarf as if the faces had suddenly been hit by light from a doorway not bad lucas said looking through them this one is carmel yeah its weird how context makes a difference i wouldnt recognize her in a thousand years in that getup sherrill said black and sherrill drove over together lucas followed davis met them at the door i hope we can do this without a lot of trauma she said her voice tight theres no reason to be any trauma at all lucas said if she cant pick out a photograph were done what if she does what if this killer hears about it the killer wont hear about it from the police lucas said wed do a videotape deposition and keep her name confidential until a defense attorney did his discovery motion by that time wed have somebody in jail for first degree murder and thered be nobody to come after her the whole thing just scares the heck out of me davis said hugging herself as though she were cold heather was playing with a fleet of trucks in a back bedroom you know what you need sherrill asked you need a farm tractor maybe a cultivator to pull behind it i had a tractor a john deere but it got lost heather said her eyes narrowed the tractor was good but you know what i really need what when we bought the tractor we bought a combine to go with it but i didnt have anything to put the corn in i could use a grain truck yeah well sherrill was out of her depth lets look at these pictures and well get you back to the trucks mom said you could probably get me a ride in a police car heather said mmm if you ask uncle lucas here he could probably fix it hes not my uncle heather said i can probably fix it anyway lucas said come on and look at the pictures she did she looked at them all carefully and when she was done she said nope nope she looked at her mother they dont look right if they dont look right davis said then they dont look right youre sure none of them look right lucas said well they all look sorta right but not really right if thats what you say thats what you say black said they all stood up can uncle lucas still get me a ride in a police car out on the sidewalk sherrill said well goshdarn thats a big goshdarn from me too black said though i dont know if id want to put a kid on a witness stand with carmel loan ready to cut her up id take anything right now lucas said moodily id take a chimp if it was ready to pick her out so whatre you going to do sherrill asked gonna go home lucas said have a beer think about it cry myself to sleep chapter twelve lucas arrived at city hall at little after ten oclock in the morning early for him closed the door on his office typed a memo heading it confidential and recorded his interview with hale allen he handcarried it to rose marie roux the chief of police how was your trip he asked a las vegas convention in the middle of the summer it was so hot that i was afraid to go outside dry heat lucas said sos an oven she said i was so bored i almost started smoking again whatcha got he handed her the memo and she read it and said goddamnit lucas this is awful why dont you ever come up with easy stuff i do lucas said i dont bother you with it and this i dont want anybody to see but you and me sherrill and black and maybe one judge file it and forget it until we need it covering your ass roux said covering everybodys ass lucas said i need to get her phone records for the last few months and i need this to back up a subpoena talk to ross benton roux said hell give you the subpoena and keep his mouth shut hed love to see carmel get nailed she makes a game out of fucking with him in court he had trouble with some decisions in that prolle case and she called him schizo the clown and it got in the startribune ah right ill carry a copy over to him get the subpoena i hope you know what were doing roux said im too old and tired to get burned at the stake by carmel loan lucas talked to benton the judge and got his subpoena let me know how it comes out ross said a light in his eye probably nothing lucas said im beggin you not to leak it dont worry if its nothing and she finds out about this subpoena ill stick a gun in my mouth lucas walked the subpoena over to the phone company presented it to the correct vicepresident emphasized the need for confidentiality and the criminal penalties for any breaches of it the vicepresident responded with the correct pieties and they both walked down to a technical center where the information was printed out lucas asked the vicepresident to note the date and time on the printout and sign it hope this doesnt get me into trouble the vicepresident said were trying to nail a mafia hitman lucas said pretty funny the vp said as he signed back at city hall lucas thought about the pros and cons of asking a favor from the fbi his stomach growled once then again and he answered he walked down to the cafeteria and got a sandwich ate it and read the paper then walked back to his office and dug mallards card out of his desk drawer one problem with the fbi was that once they signed on to a case its agents tended to get a little overenthusiastic lasersighted submachine guns helicopters computerized psychological profiles a further problem was that they also tended to be underexperienced a guy who came out of college went into the fbi and then spent twenty years working as an agent had about as much experience with actual criminals as a patrol cop a year out of techschool so youd look at a slightly greying fortyfiveyearold somebody about lucas age and you might think hmm not too bad then youd find out that in cop years he was about twentyfive on the other hand the experience that they had tended to be with heavy hitters after another moments hesitation he thought about mallards attitude during their meeting mallard was one of the brighter ones lucas thought mallard picked up his phone on the first ring yes i have an intuition lucas said after he identified himself id be inclined to listen to an intuition mallard said our minneapolis guys are strangely impressed by you or scared or something thank them for me the next time you see them i didnt say they liked you mallard said they say you refer to us as the feebs well thats uh the old rivalry sure mallard said so whats your intuition we have a possible suspect not for the shooter but for the woman who hired her to be honest with you im not going to identify her because shes a hot potato and if im wrong shed nail me to the wall i could be looking for a job somewhere way outstate so much for the preface mallard said whats the intuition we uh acquired a number of telephone contacts our suspect made about the time of the killing one of them was in washington right where you are not the state and when i checked it i gottennex messenger service nobody home its an answering service and i was pretty much told that theres never anybody home and just yesterday i was talking to a friend about targetshooting and he told me about this young iowa guy weve got who just shot a round where he not only kept everything in the ten ring but also inside the xring tenx messenger service mallard said thats a pretty farout intuition thats what i thought the odds are about twentytoone against it being anything i was thinking fiftytoone lucas said thats the best odds ive ever had on this woman mallard said id jump at a thousand to one you gotta go easy with this lucas said none of that lasersighted submachine gun shit or black helicopters nobodyu ever know mallard said until we want them to where can i call you direct lucas gave him a number arid mallard said call you tomorrow morning lucas hung up leaned back and looked at the phone mallard the dustdry but thicknecked economics professor had shown a glimmer of genuine excitement as though he shared the intuition sherrill walked in without knocking sat down without asking and said morosely my problem is im a cop goodlooking cop lucas said rolling with it and ya gotta big gun im not being playful here sherrill said its suddenly become a problem lucas frowned recognizing the serious set to her face what happened the slug you gave me she said it came back from the lab yeah yeah lucas the analysis is identical to the analysis on the daquila and blanca killings not the allen though huh he said but he felt a tight kick of pleasure sherrill continued so me being a cop and all i gotta ask you whered you get it i could tell you i found it on the floor at the blanca killing and forgot about it he said thatd be utter bullshit she said such things have happened even to the best of us lucas said not to you not to me either she answered ill tell you if you want to know if you tell anybody else they might put me in jail but if you want to know youd tell me yup she balanced it for ten seconds then said i gotta know lucas nodded i broke into carmel loans apartment searched it found the shell in the closet there was only one i thought about leaving it and trying to get a search warrant then finding it and if it came back confirmed wed have something heavy but i couldnt think of any way wed ever get a search warrant and i could think of about a million ways carmel or any good defense attorney could impeach that kind of evidence you know we just happened to find only one shell in her closet and it just happens to match and we are the only people who handled the other slugs itd be strong but it wouldnt be definitive so you took it that and some other stuff lucas said computer records phone records anything she can trace no dont think so well goddamnit lucas he leaned across the desk intent listen we know about her now with this shell thats the most important thing that could happen in a case like this weve got a fix on who did it now we can start putting things together we were stuck now weve got a focus i wish youd told me before you went in there sherrill said i couldnt it was really best that you didnt know its still best if anybody asks me i didnt tell you even now i suppose she stood up sighed and said all right i just forgot what you said of course you didnt lucas said goddamnit lucas she flared for a minute then settled back so what next i just got a subpoena for carmels phone records and walked over to the phone company and got them he said id already checked them from what i got in her apartment but this gives us some legal support something weird yeah one odd call and she made that phone call just before the daquila killings he filled her in on thetennex messenger service and his call to the fbi tennex sounds like a rock band she said her voice moody youre thinking of the quicksilver messenger service never heard of it she said she slumped in the chair scanning the computer list of phone calls theres nothing before the allen hit no you hear what i just said she asked i actually said hit jesus im a tv movie you know what im wondering lucas asked what if rolando daquila was her contact with the killer from what you guys dug up he had some heavy mafia connections once and this shooter shes supposed to do a lot of mafia contracts but you know what sherrill asked sitting up rolos contacts his drug supply mostly came out of st louis which was unusual at the time most of our traffic came out of la it was just shifting over to chicago back then st louis was nothing never had been and never was again after rolo went down and this shooter has contacts in the st louis mob thats what die feebs say thats something lucas said maybe we can work with that carmel loan was sitting in her office she could feel hale allens touch from the night before the balls of his thumbs on either side of her spine she was trying to read a deposition but her eyes defocused and she suddenly giggled the man was unnaturally sexual a memory popped into her head she thought it was from a movie somewhere back in time a woman telling a man women dont want sex women want love what complete drivel she thought women want sex they just also want love and this must be it she thought giggling in the middle of the day she remembered exactly how hed taken her by the her phone rang a private outside line and she started found herself took a breath and pulled herself back to the day carmel she said not many people had this number you remember me the voice asked sure why dont you send me a few bucks whatever you say pal at twenty percent carmel loanshark hey he laughed at his own pun but im selling not borrowing i dont think im in the market for anything right now but whattaya got first of all ya gotta agree not to do anything about it for a day or two not many people know about this and if you come charging over here they could figure me out as your source okay so what it it lucas davenport tommy black and marcy sherrill put together a photo spread for some witness to look at in those killings over in dinkytown okay she was casual but she felt a chill guess whose face was in the spread uh the virgin marys very close but no cigar actually your face was in the spread mine she was shocked and let it show through the guy on the other end of the line was a cop yup i dont know why maybe because they had a picture because there were a bunch of other faces in there the weather girl on channel three was in there they were looking for tall blondes maybe thats it carmel said but it pisses me off thought youd like to know watch your mailbox she said i will he said with a purr of pleasure some people carmel thought when she hung up get hot at the prospect of cash not because of what it can buy or what it may represent but just with the pure smooth slightly greasy feel of currency the cop was one of those she didnt understand it but then shed never tried very hard she was grateful the need existed and that she could fill it a couple of cops had been useful over the years after she thought about it for a while she took a walk out to a pay phone punched in rinkers number and left a message chapter thirteen bright and early the next morning a cool morning that promised heat in the afternoon with pale blue skies that went on forever mallard called lucas from washington the call came in an hour before lucas had planned to get out of bed he took it in the kitchen we have some news on the tennex connection he said as lucas yawned and scratched ive also got a question two questions whats the news there is no tennex messenger service as far as we can tell and never has been thats nice lucas said thats what i thought the phone number goes into a suite of shortterm offices therere a couple of receptionists out front from eight oclock in the morning until seven at night in the back therere a couple more women running a hightech switchboard the switchboard works aroundtheclock the offices are rented by the week or the month mostly by businessmen here to lobby the government theyre about twothirds full at any given time each of the offices has an individual number which the switchboard women answer with the name of whoever is renting it at the moment the answeringservice calls come in on separate numbers which the switchboard women answer with a specific name depending on which number rings tennex only has the answering service no office so who pays the bills where do the checks come from we dont know yet we want to listen on the tennex line for a couple of more days before we talk to the people who run the place but ill tell you what and this is my question did one of your people a woman call tennex from a payphone yesterday evening no somebody from minneapolis did mallard said the only phone call that came in all day huh what time around fivethirty our time huh we took a photospread over to a little girl who actually saw the shooters you probably read about her in the files yes we had a photo spread with the face of our suspect inserted in it we got nothing but that would have been about an hourandahalf before your call and ill tell you what this womans got some contacts inside our department probably inside yours as far as that goes ours didnt know about the photo spread all right if there was a leak it was us if there was a leak but damn it i would have leaked to her myself if id known she might call do you have a recording of the voice there was a brief pause as if mallard were contemplating the stupidity of the question of course he said i want to hear it lucas said i know the suspect personally ive spoken to her in the past week maybe i could nail it down which leads to my second question mallard said whats her name jesus ive got to have it this is turning into something as long as your case was nothing more than an intuition it was one thing now its another shes a wellconnected defense attorney here in town a millionaire probably and i know she gives money to the politicians us senators congressmen you name it if you fuck this up they could find us both buried in the back yard three people here will have the name thats all if were buried in the back yard the other two guysll be buried under us i guarantee it lucas sighed hesitated and said all right her name is carmel loan i cant tell you how nervous this makes me the woman who called yesterday identified herself as patricia case ill check around but ive never heard of her lucas said he picked up the st paul phone book thumbed through it to case could be some kind of code mallard said although thats pretty far fetched tennex messenger service is farfetched did you get a location on the pay phone yeah just a minute uh its at nicollet mall fiveohfive lucas muttered as he ran his ringer down the case listing in the phone book he said half to himself there arent any patricia cases listed in the st paul phone book i dont have the minneapolis book here at the house we already checked and there arent any patricia cases we also checked the number and got some department stores theres a nieman marcus thats an easy twominute walk from carmel loans office lucas said i can check but it might be the closest pay phone to carmels office interesting mallard said please dont let anything out about carmel lucas said urgently not yet nothing will come out of this end i swear to god one more thing lucas said when are you going to hit this place the office suite go in and talk to the people well give it another day anyway call me the night before im three hours away id like to be there when you do it no problem anything else one other thing one of the victims rolando daquila used to be a heavy drugdealer the word from our drug people is that he bought his coke out of st louis a mafia connection down there not colombian or mexican but oldline mafia and this shooter his woman she seems to tie in down there damn mallard said im letting something happen here that ive never let happen before whats that im getting my hopes up then for two days nothing happened carmel didnt get a callback she stayed close to the magic phone but she never heard from rinker was there a problem with the contact phone was it tapped the fbi was equally frustrated there were no more calls to tennex nothing at the end of the second day mallard called lucas back were going in tomorrow if nothing happens to slow us down we want to get in before the end of the week ill get a flight out tonight we can cover that if you want mallard offered no thanks ill do it from here all right anything new i sent one of my people marcy sherrill down to st louis to schmooze their organized crime people theres nothing going on up here if sherrilps the one i remember from the meeting she oughta schmooze pretty well one of her many talents lucas said see you tomorrow lucas called his travel agent got a businessclass ticket on the nine oclock northwest flight into national and made a reservation at the hayadams he liked the hayadams because the halfdozen times hed stayed there even the first time the doorman said nice to see you again sir then he called donnal obrien at dc homicide and said hey irish jesus christ the outer precincts are heard from obrien said hown the hell are you lucas good im coming to town tonight id like to get together tomorrow if youve got the time want me to get you at the airport ill be really late lucas said obrien had four kids to take care of ill get a cab down to the hayadams ill do my thing with the feebs tomorrow morning and make it over to your shop by when three oclock ill plan on three maybe go out for a couple beers huh see you then lucas said the flight to washington was a nightmare nothing wrong with the plane the flying conditions were perfect and the trip was on schedule but airplanes winged planes not helicopters were the only really phobia that lucas was aware that he had he dreaded getting on one sat rigidly braced for impact from the time the plane backed away from the departure gate until it nosed into the destination gate and was never really convinced that hed survived until he was walking through the terminal at the other end as they came into washington he had a postcard view of the washington monument he ignored it there was no point in looking at the view when you were only seconds away from flaming death somehow the plane got down and the stewardesses suppressed their panic well enough to smile at him and thank him for flying northwest the hayadams was excellent as usual the white house framed in the window over the desk looked like an expensive d photo reproduction of the kind found in commercial aquariums until you understood that it was real he slept very well having been properly welcomed back mallard arrived at ten oclock in the morning in a blue chevy followed by another blue chevy carrying three more agents lucas was waiting just inside the door and when he saw mallard step out of the car pushed through to the sidewalk nice hotel mallard said looking up at the hayadams facade i once got to stay in a holiday inn with suites i didnt get a suite but i walked past the door to one if you guys treat me right ill let you stand in the lobby while i have dinner tonight lucas said youre all heart mallard said he was wearing a blue suit with a dark blue necktie with tiny red dots on it he had a stainlesssteel cup full of coffee in the chevys cupholder he took a sip and said if you want some we can stop at a starbucks im fine lucas said why all the troops there are five of them the two receptionists the two women on the switchboard and the manager so i thought there ought to be five of us yeah well if they charge go for the lead one lucas said as he got comfortable in the lumpy front seat if you can turn the lead one the rest of them usually follow youd be dead in an hour in washington mallard said in washington the leaders are at the back of the stampede the office suite was off dupont circle a nondescript granite building that might on close inspection pass as ordinary lucas mallard and the other three agents went into the building like a mildmannered rugby scrum a tight little group of conservatively dressed shorthaired men all reasonably large and athletic who if they were mistaken for anybody at all would be mistaken for the secret service lucas had seen fbi scrums before but had never been part of one mallard held up his id to the receptionists one bottle redhead and one real blonde and said were from the fbi wed like to speak to mrs markertwo of the agents had peeled off from the group as mallard stopped at the desk and gone through a door into the back covering the switchboard lucas thought the blonde receptionist was a carefully coiffed middleaged woman whose glasses had blueplastic frames with silver sparkles embedded in the plastic when she saw mallards credentials her hand went to her throat well yes she said im not positive that shes in shes in mallard said dial and ask her to come out the receptionist asked no more questions she picked up her phone punched in the numbers and said into the mouthpiece there are some gentlemen from the fbi here to see you thank you mallard said louise marker was a chunky young woman with only one eyebrow a long furry brown stripe that sat on her brow ridge above both eyes she had exaggerated cupids bow lips colored deep red beneath a fleshy wobbly nose in alice in wonderland she would have been the red queen tennex had been a customer for seventytwo months she said and paid the rent and phone bill each month with a cashiers check or a money order she kept the recipients receipt for all seventytwo checks in a green hanging file most of the checks and money orders came from different banks in each of the cities of st louistulsa oklahoma and kansas city missouri four checks came from dallasfort worth and three from denver two checks came from chicago and from miami one each from san francisco new orleans and new york how does she find out how much she owes lucas asked the phone bills are always different marker shrugged we add them up and put a message on the voice mail on the twentyninth of each month a few days later the check comes in end of story and the voice mail goes through the phone company so you wouldnt even handle that call thats right why would you bother with your service at all with a receptionist well you gotta have a phone the phone company wont let you in on the service if you dont have a phone marker said were the phone thats nuts one of the fbi agents said they pay you all this money for a phone it is not nuts marker insisted we dont explore the backgrounds of our clients because we dont have the resources but we know what they are most of them theyre mostly trade associations who cant afford a fulltime office in washington but want people to think they can people like politicians so if a politician calls here a receptionist answers we tell them that nobodys in and switch them to voice mail then somebody at the real office out in walla walla or wherever calls here a couple of times a day gets the message and returns the call and if they have to actually come here to washington we can rent them a suite and all the business machines the whole works were not the only people who do this you know therere a halfdozen others lucas prowled the office and found an airline magazine and opened it to the map of the national airline routes the midwestern and midsouth cities that were the sources of most of the checks kansas city st louis and tulsa lay in a neat circle with springfield missouri at its center on the other hand if the sender of the checks came from springfield or close by and mailed the checks from neighboring large cities to avoid pinpointing herself why hadnt she ever gone to little rock it was hardly further than the others at least on the airline map and the other checks were so scattered that they probably indicated that the killer either traveled a lot or arranged for different people to send the checks though it was unlikely that she would ask other people thatd be too much exposure so she traveled never talked to her marker was saying i dont even know if its really a her i always thought it was a him whyd you think that mallard asked i dont know because he ran a messenger service i guess you kind of think thats like a guy job mallard and his three agents began indepth interviews with all five women taking them one at a time lucas stood outside of markers office for a while watching her talk with mallard her eyes would flick out to lucas then back to mallard and then out through the door to lucas again after ten minutes lucas stuck his head in the door thanks for letting me ride along ill give you a call this afternoon mallard said hold on a second out in the hall away from the five women he said not too exciting i gotta think about it lucas said the problem is we dont have an edge a crack anything we can get a hold of well have our local agents run down these checks maybe somebodyll remember her the most checks she got from one bank is six and those were months apart lucas said id bet she went to a different teller every time paid cash maybe we can run down the actual paper checks and get fingerprints were gonna process all the paper we got here and when the next check comes in do everything lucas said he turned back to look at the building as he walked away and saw mallard looking after him the callin arrangement was clever it was also not quite right donnal obrien was a husky black man with a small brush mustache and four kids at home his wife had gone out for a loaf of bread one night and never came back he said just too quiet in that convenience store i guess with none of the kids around she was now living in north miami beach with a retired dc cop named manners the drug guys called him bad manners i think he retired with a little more than the regular pension seeing as how he didnt bust anybody for the last three years he was on the force lucas had met obrien at a computer training conference when lucas was still hawking his policesimulation software theyd had a few beers shared information a couple of times when obrien was still married he and his wife had once spent a week at lucass wisconsin cabin obrien was sitting in a small greywalled cubicle reading a people magazine story about a lesbian golfer when lucas leaned in the doorway did you know that kitty veit is a lesbo i dont know who kitty veit is she shot a sixtythree in the final round of the womens grandam last weekend at merion and won three hundred and twenty thousand dollars shes the only woman who ever shot a sixtythree there you mean golf obrien sighed never mind anyway shes a lesbo and that offends your golfers sense of propriety no it makes me wonder if i got an operation i could shoot a sixtythree youd probably just sit home all day and play with your tits mmm hadnt thought of that how ya been lucas asked tired lets go get a coke they found an empty booth at a small moderately greasy diner with formica tabletops and cracked red plastic booth seats the counterman drifted toward them and obrien called big coke and big diet coke lucas told obrien that he was thinking of buying a golf course and obrien didnt believe him five minutes later when he did believe him obrien started fishing for a job as a greens keeper lucas laughed i havent bought it yet keep me in mind id be great at it obrien said im two years from retirement if some asshole doesnt shoot me first work in minnesota hell yes then his voice pitched down he asked whats going on youre working right yeah we had some people executed in the cities lucas gave him a quick rundown left carmel loans name out of it and concluded with the fbi entry at the answering service never heard of the place louise marker yeah just like it sounds like magic marker marker four dead never heard of a pro going in for something like that you might get three or four dead all at once but not in a series like theyre hunting them down theres something going on lucas said it could be something really simple a money thing the hit goes sour somebody gets a name or a connection and then this killer chick has to come back and clean up impossible to prove though obrien said i get pretty goddamned depressed about it sometimes crooks are getting too smart they move too fast hit here gone tomorrow be nice to pull this chick down though lucas said id like to see if youve got anything local on this marker or any of the people who work there even wordofmouth the feebs dont have anything thats not on paper ill check around obrien said and ill tell you what i know this guy named george hutton he works in fraud they caught hutton standing at a bus stop where a desk sergeant said he might still be if they hurried george obrien called across the street a bus was rolling down the block wait they crossed at the corner and hutton looked at his watch and said two minutes and im out of here gone for the week then the local black irish shows up with some guy in an expensive suit and i get this really bad feeling all we need is a name obrien said let me tell you a name one name said hutton he looked at his watch louise marker obrien had moved to one side of hutton so he could speak directly into the other mans ear hutton closed his eyes and tipped his head back so that hed have been looking at the sky except that his eyes were closed he stood like that for a moment then opened his eyes and looked at lucas and spoke to obrien whos the guy lucas davenport a deputy chief from minneapolis davenport simulations i know that hutton said then look up maurice marker formerly marx of marker dry cleaners inc new jersey he had a daughter named louise how old is your louise lucas said id say early middle age forty maybe a little chunky hutton nodded thatd be about right whats she doing running an answering service hutton nodded yeah look up maurice marker he peered down the street thats my bus lucas said goodbye to obrien caught a cab to the fbi building and called mallard who came down to get him we need to look up a dry cleaner named maurice marker or maurice marx lucas said whered you get the name from a cop here in dc some kind of savant guy he knows names huh well lets go punch it in maurice marker now retired to south florida had a short fbi biography he had once owned a chain of dry cleaners in new jersey with a sales staff consisting of a dozen men with severely bent noses the bent noses were not around much but they made nice salaries with excellent benefits including full dental and medical as well as life insurance and retirement plans these guys would bring in a chunk of cash from dope or broads or gambling or whatever give it to maurice hed run it through the cash register write off their salaries against taxes take a chunk for himself and everybody was happy mallard said he had thirtythree dry cleaners when he retired he sold the stores to another guy who did the same thing until he went away whered he go mallard peered at the computer about four miles east of atlantic city is louise in there lucas nodded at the computer mallard ran his finger down the monitor screen yep not necessarily the same one of course just a minute he opened a spiral notebook flipped through to the back ran his finger down a page of chickenscratch handwriting then looked at the screen ill be damned same birth date thats our girl lucas turned away paced a few steps paced back turned away again so shes connected could be a coincidence but probably not probably not now mallard got to his feet and started following lucas in the pacing goddamn it davenport im getting a hardon you havent gotten any more calls since the one from patricia case no then its possible that was some kind of a warning call a code its possible that tennex only gets one call a month lucas was shaking his head no you know what it is the answering service is a blind or partially a blind thats why its not just a phone ringing in an empty apartment somewhere i mean why not that itd be easier so what are you saying that one of those women there is a cutout somebody the killer can go to for more information one of the women is really an alarm and we probably rang it itd have to be marker mallard said there are ten different women who work on those switchboards either full or part time and they rotate shifts there wouldnt be any way to know which operator would be answering which call so theyd have to have some special instructions from marker if anything unusual came up on tennex so lets bring her in lucas said on what nothing scare the shit out of her thats uh sort of not our operating procedure mallard said fuck your operating procedure bring her in let me talk to her let me make a call mallard said marker demanded an attorney and mallard was happy to give her all the time she needed if were not out of here by seven im gonna miss my plane lucas said ill have my secretary see if theres another flight out mallard said gimme the ticket markers attorney who showed up two hours after theyd taken her in was a cheery blond named cliff bell he wanted to know what the hell was going on your client is a front for a professional killer were tracking lucas said i dont think bell started but lucas stopped him wait wait lucas said let me make my little speech here this woman the killer has murdered almost thirty people in more than a dozen states a lot of them are those nasty southern states with those strange ways of executing people like florida where the guys eyeballs went up in a puff of smoke when they pulled the switch on op sparky thats unnecessary bell said no its not lucas said he leaned toward marker thats what were talking about here miss marker the electric chair the gas chamber lethal injection when we nail this woman we have the complete option of taking you with her you connected the people who were contracting the killings to the killer and you knew about it i didnt know it was a killer marker sputtered but bell snapped shut up louise louise didnt i thought it was some kind of political or realestate scam for christs sakes shut up louise bell said to lucas whats the deal the deal is we dont have to take her we can we dont have to she can go home right now if she wants but we wont make this offer again right now if she tells us everything she knows about tennex were willing to assume the best that she may have guessed that she was facilitating some kind of criminal enterprise but thought it was a minor political deal i cant see her doing any hard time for that if she doesnt take the deal right now while the trail is hot then tough shit well get this woman some other way and well take louise with her we need some time in private bell said mallard found them a private room when he came back lucas noticed that he seemed to be sweating im not used to this kind of stuff police stuff we usually have four specialists and three lawyers doing the talking spend a couple of weeks prepping for the thing sometimes if you keep the momentum going keep people talking you get something youd never get when everythings a formal titfortat lucas said i know the theory mallard said we usually operate on a different one and im just hoping we dont get our titfor tat in a wringer bell brought marker back fifteen minutes later we want a letter from mr mallard outlining the deal as laid out by agent davenport then well give you a statement the letter took another halfhour bell turned a little sour when he learned that lucas worked for the city of minneapolis but mallard smoothed him over so tell us lucas said he had his feet up on mallards desk a tape recorder running in the middle of mallards blottercalendar marker and bell sat in wooden visitors chairs while mallard sat back on a couch with his legs crossed drinking from his endless mug of coffee the connection marker said had been set up by a man named so he said bob tennex although he sounded like east coast italian sounded you didnt see him no it was all done by telephone you set up the account without seeing the guy that happens from time to time if we get a check and the check is good we offer that service since the connection was set up marker said shed spoken to a tennex representative several times and it was always a woman marker had caller id on her phones purely as a matter of course and had noticed that the calls came in from all over the midwest and sometimes from other parts of the country kansas city was prominent four or five calls had come from there another name that stuck in her head was wichita because while only two calls had come from there the woman had been angry both times about problems with the phone companys answering service she wanted us to get on them they had a couple of breakdowns marker said but thats not the only thing she asked about is it lucas asked you had some other agreement with her about people making inquiries about the messenger service about the police coming in she really just thought it was some kind of minor political hustle those things go on all the time here bell said so what was it lucas asked uh well if somebody came snooping around i wasnt supposed to do anything except wait until what until she called me marker said her voice barely audible youre gonna have to speak up mallard said until she called me marker said and then what shed call and ask is mr warren in and if nobody had been around if i didnt know anything id say youve got the wrong number this is marker answering but if somebody had been around id say no but mr whites here would you like me to put your call through how many times did you do this mallard asked two different times about three or four years go something mustve happened and she called me every day for two weeks marker said her voice dropping again ah shit lucas said then she called you yesterday or today didnt she this afternoon shes been calling for a week every day and today about an hour after you left the first time before you came and got me again marker said she was calling from des moines a pay phone i think i could hear the cars and you gave her the mr white line yes she squeaked did you get the job because of your father maybe tennex said he knew dad wheres your father living now lucas asked well hes not marker said he died of colon cancer last year im sorry mallard said they said it was all the chemicals from the drycleaning marker said ill probably go that way myself a lot of us do there was more but nothing significant they released marker and mallard drove lucas to the hayadams retrieved his bag from the luggage room and took him to the airport so you think shes gone mallard said yeah and i think im the guy who tipped her off by calling into tennex nothing to do about that mallard said you were just running checks on a list of phone numbers it was a long shot yeah but jesus that close weve still got a lot to work with all those checks all the phone calls weve got something now ill bet we have some kind of description of her in a week ill bet we unravel some kind of connection how much what how much will you bet mallard sucked on his teeth for a moment then said about a dime i guess lucas nodded get me to the plane on time the plane as it happened was going to minneapolis with a stop in detroit aw no i gotta fly direct lucas told the checkin attendant nothing tonight except through detroit the clerk said punching up her computer we could get you on a flight tomorrow morning that goes straight through aw man he went through detroit miserably suffering through two takeoffs and landings he was surprised at the safe landing in detroit but quickly convinced himself that it would be the second half of the flight the unnecessary half that would kill him so achingly close to home as miserable as he was two things occurred to him wichita kansas was a large enough city that it might attract the eye of somebody who traveled outoftown to make her calls but marker had said the killer was angry when she called from wichita was it possible that she lived close to wichita and made spurofthemoment calls out of anger when something went wrong with the answering service he got the airline flight magazine out of the seat pocket in front of him and looked at the flight map again wichita he thought would be as viable a home town as springfield something to think about the second thing came to him as they were landing in minneapolis he was looking down at one of the lakes where hed expected the impact to occur he could see himself struggling to get out of the flooding cabin but his legs and arms were broken and he couldnt unfasten the seatbelt and the name des moines popped into his head if the killer came from either springfield or wichita or virtually anyplace around those cities and if she were driving to minneapolis shed go through des moines if she had done that he thought shed be here now he looked down at the broad multicolored grid of lights that made up the cities and thought somewhere chapter fourteen carmel didnt understand the silence days had passed since shed left the message for pamela if pamela was her name which carmel doubted still she should have gotten back had something happened to her had carmels name come up through pamela had pamela been caught was she in one of those stainlesssteel federal pens somewhere sweating through the sensorydeprivation stage of a multilevel interrogation was the phone connection corrupt or discontinued or worse tapped what was going on shed worked through her defense two hundred times and all two hundred times shed walked the cops didnt have a case couldnt have a case there was nothing to build a case on unless that little girl had identified her her contact with the cops said that nothing had come of the photo spread but davenport was running this routine and he was worse than tricky he was bad if he was sure that she was involved he might be sticking together a morality play to frame her with nothing more than a sliver of evidence a woman could go to prison for life if a jury didnt approve of her lifestyle she shouldnt have fucked hale that was the truth of the matter just shouldnt have should have waited even if there were no proof if a jury found out shed fucked hale the night before his dead wifes funeral she was history and where in the hell was pamela she was in her apartment trying to work when the phone rang she glanced at her watch probably hale but she said be pamela and rinker said you got time for a drink casually sure where are you id hoped youd call remember that place we went the bar where we saw the guy with the cowboy scarf lets go there oh sure an hour from now be careful though its dark around there youll get eaten by a stalker ill bring my switchblade carmel said laughing see you in an hour stalker pamela thought carmel was being followed is that what that meant and the place where they saw the guy with the red silk cowboy scarf wasnt a bar but the lobby of her hotel was that where she wanted to meet before she left her apartment carmel changed into a loose longsleeved silk blouse jet black with black slacks and a small gold necklace ten minutes after she hung up the phone she was on the street in the volvo she took a twisting route out of the downtown area eased along a oneway lane on the edge of the kenwood area past homes of the rich and the strange and checked her back trail nothing but if what shed read about complicated tags was right the cops might have three or four cars following her changing off some in front some behind she pulled over to the side of the lane waited two minutes nothing went by what if the car were wired and they were following her from a distance no way she could tell that besides she was beginning to feel that she might be a little delusional shed read hundreds of criminal files in her lifetime and the heavy surveillance never started until the case was made before that they were simply too expensive the cops might go for a phone tap or loose surveillance but there wouldnt be a multicar track across town she looked at her watch she still had a half hour before she was supposed to meet pamela she headed south on and off round and round quiet city blocks looking for anything that might be a follower at the south end of the loop a heavy jet roared five hundred feet overhead and she turned heading north moving fast now she took the car straight into the hotel parking garage got a ticket left it and took the stairs down to the lobby rinker was sitting in a corner she saw carmel step out of the stairway smiled stood up and walked back to the elevators she was just getting in the elevator car when carmel caught up with her did you understand what i saw saying on the phone rinker asked as the elevator car started up i think so im not being followed unless theyve done something electronic and id be willing to bet they havent if they really think im involved its way too early in the investigation to have twentyfourhour surveillance but right now theres nobody with me i sort of bet myself youd be coming out of that stairwell rinker said its what i would have done zip into the garage take the stairs they cant stick too close behind or youll spot them and by the time they sneak in youre in one of five hundred rooms theyll go through five hundred rooms if they have to if it gives them a professional killer carmel said which is why im trying not to touch anything hard except the tv remote control the onandoff faucets in the bathroom and a few things like that ill wipe them before i leave what about the credit card good card fake name rinker said so whats going on i was worried when you didnt call back i thought theyd picked you up you tell me whats going on whyd you call rinker asked this davenport guy the cop remember rinker nodded he took some pictures over to show the little girl who saw us i was in the photo spread ah jeez why i dont know ive got a contact in the police department and nobody knows whats going on but apparently the kid failed to identify me nothing came out of it but why would they take your picture over in the first place thats the question carmel said rinker had a room on the seventh floor inside rinker opened the minibar took out two cans of special export i got glasses she said cans fine carmel said popping the top i really didnt expect you to come all the way back from wherever i just wanted to talk yeah well i got a little problem of my own rinker said she sat on the bed and carmel pulled the chair out from the tiny desk and sat down the day before you called me i got another call at the answering service a guy who was supposedly trying to get in touch with tennex but when the receptionist asked if he wanted to leave a message he said no then two days later the cops showed up thats all i know cops were asking questions i dont have any easy way to find out more huh carmel thought about it for a minute then took a cell phone out of her purse and her address book she checked a number as rinker watched and punched it in calling my guy carmel said to rinker then into the phone this is carmel anything else happen she listened for a moment then said i stopped by to see davenport a couple of times hes never in uhhuh uhhuh well ill probably stop and see him tomorrow then okay and listen ill send along another envelope keep your eyes and ears open this thing is starting to scare me im afraid theyre setting me up on something uhhuh well you know davenport uhhuh talk to you tomorrow whatd he say rinker asked he said davenport was out of town and the rumor was he was at the fbi headquarters in washington shit rinker said it sharply expelling breath whats going on theyre on to you and me how could that happen i called you once from my apartment carmel said this last time i called from a pay phone but i did call tennex that one time the first time about rolo from my apartment if theyre looking at my longdistance billing if theyre checking everything even if they were how did they pick out tennex its a goddamn messenger service maybe they picked on it because they couldnt find anything behind it maybe just luck what does tennex mean would that mean something to somebody no when we were setting this up we were talking in the kitchen of this guys restaurant down in st louis and we were wondering what to call the company and i saw this name on this airfilter thing he had there tennex it sounded like something so i said how about tennex so thats not it i dont see how rinker said all right so weve got to do some prospecting very carefully very and theres something else carmel said if it looks like im in trouble why wouldnt you just shoot me and walk away i mean thats something we ought to talk about well i sorta think of you like well almost a friend rinker said i mean weve done some stuff together and we get along and were probably going to mexico together pick up some guys so i could ask you the same thing i dont know how to find you carmel said so i couldnt even if i wanted to which i dont if you need some other reason i can give you one rinker said swallowing beer i gotta find out why im in trouble these guys i work with if the feds start snooping around or your pal davenport all theyve got to do is dump me and theyre safe they have a couple more people like me out there and id walk out the front of my apartment someday and boom thatd be it so i gotta find out if the feds start bugging my guys i gotta know and take some precautions these guys are mafia rinker shrugged she looked like a slightly over aged cheerleader bouncing softly on the hotel bed yeah i guess if youre gonna put a label on them i mean theyre italian most of them except freddy hes irish or his grandfather was and i guess dave is like a polack theyre always giving him shit about it theyre sorta the mafia but theyre more like a bunch of guys who watch nfl monday night football and pick up stuff that falls off trucks some of them are pretty mean though like italian bikers huh carmel showed a small grin i thought itd be more dignified than that maybe back east not in st louis rinker said so are you gonna be around in and out of town until we figure out whats going on rinker said im going to washington tomorrow i want to talk to this woman who runs the answering service what if theyre watching her then i wont talk to her rinker said im gonna try to get in touch with davenport tomorrow if hes back ill see what he has to say for himself be careful always rinker gave carmel the name she was using at the hotel and as carmel was leaving said hey this davenport do you know where i could get a picture of him carmel shook her head no i mean hes probably been in the paper any number of times but i dont wait a minute i bet i do know he also ran a company called davenport simulations computer simulationthings for cops if you check the library the business section the local business magazines i bet youd find something cut the page out with a razor dont get caught carmel said the library people can be mean pricks when it comes to people cutting up their magazines chapter fifteen lucas was sitting in his office pushing deeper into the equality report reading the perfect politically correct prose had become a zenlike exercise the words flowed softly and without meaning through his brain an unending stream of nonsense syllables that eventually metamorphosed into a cosmic hum and allowed other ideas to bubble up he was on page ninetyfour when carmel knocked he thought it was sloan yeah for christs sakes come in carmel opened the door and stuck her head in surprised lucas stood up sorry about that he said i thought it was somebody else a little mistake like that is nothing compared to what youre gonna get into carmel said stepping into the office pushing the door closed she put one fist on her hip and said a little birdie told me you stuck my face into a photo spread on that dinkytown murder the blanca chick and the other guy i want to know why we were looking for photographs of longlegged blondes and you were available lucas said his voice flat bullshit she said her mouth was like a short stretch of barbedwire she dropped into the visitors chair opposite him and stretched her legs out but didnt really settle in she was like a spring all squeezed down and about to explode so why you are fucking with me and if i dont get a good reason ill see you in court and let the judge ask you why lucas nodded itd be an interesting lawsuit i dont know what you could possibly sue us for some of the best civil lawyers in the us fuckin a sit down the hall from me and i dont doubt that they could find ten reasons that a judge would like she said her voice glassyedged for one thing i represented rolando daquila and several of his associates in the past and now youre hauling my picture around and showing it to people around this crime are you trying to discredit me as an attorney it might seem so all right youre smarter than i am carmel lucas said you want the real reason the reason is that a witness who probably saw the killers described one of the women in a way that you resemble and you admitted to several people that you knew and represented rolando daquila and not only that that you were representing a man suspected of hiring somebody to kill his wife a murder committed by the same person or persons who committed the daquila killing so far you are the only connection we can find between the killing of barbara allen and the killing of the other three and thats why we took the photos around and if you dont like it what tough shit they sat staring at each other for a few seconds then carmel smiled quickly and said all right i wanted to know she stood up to leave i didnt have anything to do with any of these killings ive been trying to work out in my head how they could have happened and i cant come up with anything i cant ask you what connection hale allen has with daquila because youre his attorney and it would be absolutely unethical for me to tell you if there were any ill tell you this just between you and me and the door jamb there isnt any connection my theory is barbara allen was killed by accident or mistake when she got in the way of something else something involving drugs and these latinos then the cop came along by accident and the whole affair went up in smoke but my theory is barbara allen had nothing to do with it and what you really ought to be doing is looking for the other guy who ran from the barbara allen scene the guy that barbara allen got killed for seeing and the cop got there too late to see lucas thought about it for a few seconds then said weve gone over all of that and it worries us it should worry you and you ought to go over it some more carmel said and stop showing those fuckin pictures around there was only one witness carmel lucas said she gave you a clean slate she didnt even say maybe good and she was gone lucas leaned back in his chair fighting back the little trickle of adrenalin carmel was a challenge he picked up the equality report and the zenhum began again while his head worked through carmels visit if she hadnt killed anyone would she have made the visit when she heard about the photo spread absolutely would she have made it if she was guilty he thought about it for three seconds absolutely she would have she had a fine discriminating taste in the mannerisms of innocence so hed learned nothing but the cartridge the hed picked up in her apartment was a fact couldnt use it in court couldnt even admit that it existed but the slug in that said carmel was guilty guilty of something anyway just for arguments sake say the bullet was usable in court how would she defend against it he turned it over in his mind shed say the bullet came from daquila that hed stored a bag in her closet or that hed planted it for some reason daquila another image popped into the back of his brain he leaned forward let his chin drop on his chest closed his eyes concentrated after a minute he pushed himself out of his chair and halfjogged down the hall to homicide neither sherrill nor black was in but the daquila file was in sherrills work tray he flipped through it and found the coroners photo of the fingernail gouges that daquila had scratched into the back of his hand before he was executed lucas looked at it turned it over and thought if you simply separated out some of the lines if you realized that daquila panicked tortured facing execution was not exactly writing in a notebook and couldnt see what he was doing then might resolve itself out this way c loan begin with a c the next letter was an l just a straight upanddown line without the bottom line the next letter he thought was intended to be an o but was confused by the bar across it if the bar were moved over one place it would make an a leaving the final letter as an n c loan goddamnit carmel he said the door opened behind him and he turned to see sherrill looking through my desk looking through the daquila photos lucas said look at this sherrill was looking at him jeez youre really pumped whatve you got he laid it out for her in ten seconds sherrill was convinced black who arrived two minutes after she did was not the problem is you could make anything out of those scratches once you start disassembling them he said i can see five or six different words in there yeah but none of them are words that are relevant to the investigation except this one c loan lucas said maybe thats because we havent figured out all the possibilities black said sloan came in during the argument looked at the photos and shook his head i could take some recreational drugs and maybe believe it but if youve got an unstoned jury you got a problem he said well its a piece lucas said finally we get a few pieces and pretty soon weve got a case black and sloan started talking to somebody else and sherrill said quietly is it possible that we can only see it because we already know because of the slug nah its there lucas said shuffling through the pictures again goddamnit its there rinker flew into washington on a saturday afternoon fifteen hours after lucas had flown out of the same airport she stopped at a magazine store and bought the best map she could find picked up her rental car and checked into the downtown holiday inn from there she called her bar in wichita and talked to the assistant manager a shy cowboy named art durrell and was assured that nothing had burned down that the customers were happy that the fat in the deep frier was hot enough and the refrigerators were cold enough when that asshole from the health department comes back we want a hundred percent clean bill art rinker said you can never tell when those reportsll wind up in the local newspapers were the cleanest place in town clara and everybody down at the health department knows it durrell said stop worrying enjoy yourself at two oclock a ratfaced man with toolong stringy black hair wearing a denim jacket jeans and cowboy boots a man who looked the part of a movie drifter knocked at her door and when she answered handed her a package wrapped in brown paper that had been cut from a grocery sack from jim the phones probably good until sunday he said and left she opened the bag and took out a colt woodsman a silencer a sealed box of shells and one freshly stolen cellular phone the package had cost her eleven hundred dollars she screwed a silencer on the barrel of the pistol loaded the magazine opened a window and fired a shot through the curtain the gun made a loud whuff and the action cycled she stepped over and looked at the curtain and after a second found the small hole made by the slug as it passed through everything worked louise marker lived in an apartment complex in bethesda an expensive place of threestory yellowbrick buildings arranged around a series of swimming pools set in grassy lawns if government employees lived there rinker thought they were generals there were however no uniforms in sight perhaps a hundred residents almost all of them young to middleaged women lay scattered around the pools in conservative onepiece bathing suits none of them was marker marker had never seen rinker but rinker had seen marker a couple of times shed made a point of it for just this occasion wandering casually through the people around the pools rinker punched markers number into her cell phone and a woman answered on the third ring hello and rinker said jean no you must have the wrong number ah sorry getting into markers building was not a problem she timed her step to a couple of women in bathing suits who were headed for a side door she followed them through the outer door just far enough back that one of them had time to use her key on the inner door rinker had her own keys in her hand jingling but caught the door nodded said thanks and kept going and the other two women thought nothing of it marker was on two rinker took the stairs did a quick peek at the door to make sure there was nobody in the hallway then punched markers phone number back into the cell phone as she walked down to markers door there was interference but at least the phone should ring on the other end again the womans voice hello a little asperity this time expecting another wrong number rinker said could i speak to mrs marker and at the same moment she rang the bell at markers door marker said who is this this is mary downstairs at the office did i hear your doorbell ring yeah just a minute rinker heard her put the phone down the hall was still empty and she took the pistol out from her shirt just as the door popped open marker opened her mouth to ask a question and rinker brought the gun up to her forehead and said step back marker the good mafia kid said oh no and stepped back rinker stepped inside then whispered i am going to speak very softly i am going to put my gun in my shirt and we are going for a walk outside but first finish your phone call what finish the phone call marker nodded mystified went back to the phone hello this is mary rinker said into the cell phone you left your car keys down here this morning theyre at the main desk oh thanks marker said shakily uh ill be right down see you rinker said and she punched off the phone then she pointed her index finger at marker crooked it and stepped back into the hallway marker followed like an automaton youre going to kill me marker said when they were in the hall the door closed behind them i should scream if you scream ill kill you otherwise ive got good reasons not to but ive got to ask you some questions what was that about the telephone the feds may be listening in probably are marker said then youre tennex rinker nodded walk down the hall i did just like you told me rinker started her rap i dont want to hurt you because if i do then theyll know for sure thattennex is what theyre after do you understand that right now they dont know for sure uh yes but ill kill you if i have to if i ever have any hint that you talked to them about this visit that youre looking at photographs then ill come back for you and if im caught the people who run me will worry that other connections would be made and theyll come looking for both of us in other words if you talk to anybody about this visit youre dead do you understand marker swallowed hard and nodded so who came to see you rinker asked marker told her all of it starting with the first phone call the call that seemed uncertain about tennex a guys voice baritone educated cool to the raid by the fbi not a cop the guy who called highclass cop maybe she told rinker about the fbi about mallard about going down to the fbi building was one of the guys named lucas davenport i dont think so but they didnt introduce everybody there was one guy who kept wandering away big guy tough guy didnt look fbi he had this really nice suit didnt look government looked like you know a hoodlum rinker dipped in her pocket and came up with the folded page shed taken from bizwiz a computer magazine that covered twin cities business is this the guy marker took it looked at it for a halfsecond and said thats him yeah he looks better in real life though did you hear his voice could he have been the guy who called that first time the confused call marker thought about it for a second yeah you know he could have been she said slowly yeah you know after a few more questions rinker said i just want to reiterate i was very careful coming here very careful about wire taps and even bugs in your apartment so nobody knows if anybody ever knows youre dead marker nodded rapidly okay good thats good i learned a trick in a previous business of mine when i was much younger rinker said and that was how to forget youd just say okay that never happened i just dreamed it and pretty soon whatever happened becomes like a dream and you start to forget it youre forgot marker said fervently honest to god youre forgot before she left town rinker stopped at a bank and rented a safedeposit box she paid a year in advance wiped the gun and left it in the box next time she was through the area in her car shed pick it up from the airport rinker dialed carmels magic cell phone and carmel answered on the second buzz yes you know that guy we saw on tv rinker asked yes he was here for sure shit i wonder how he knew dont know rinker said ill be back tonight at tenfifteen on northwest ill pick you up i think were cool for this very moment but we can talk when you get back on the plane eyes covered with a black sleeping mask rinker dozed and between small patches of sleep she thought about carmel she could solve quite a few problems by simply killing the other woman but there were problems with that carmel wasnt stupid and she might already have taken out some kind of insurance a note written in a check book or left in a safe deposit box with what she knew about rinker a note that would be found only after she was dead another problem this davenport guy was as close to rinker as he was to carmel how had he gotten there did he know even more was he digging around the bar in wichita carmel was a source of information about davenport which could be important a final reason not to kill carmel rinker actually liked her like some kind of sister something rinker had never had rinker smiled when she thought of carmels invitation to do mexico shed been planning to go by god and if they got out of this she would get a couple of thong bikinis and a nice close bikini wax some of those drinks with little paper umbrellas and lots of pineapple and maybe do a couple of those mexican dudes as to davenport himself rinker had read the bizwiz report and davenport sounded like a smart guy and mean he was a stone killer no doubt about it he was like one of those mafia guys shed known a guy running a big coinop company or garbagehauler a businessman who kept a gun in his pocket of course shed killed three or four of those not even geniuses were bulletproof in minneapolis sitting in front of a muted television carmel considered the possibilities maybe if she had a chance she should kill pamela or whatever her name was it would only make sense from a criminaldefense point of view there really was only one perfect witness against carmel and if pamela were gone then davenport could go shit in his hat she sighed got up and wandered into the kitchen got a glass of orange juice shed really hate to kill the other woman she actually liked her pamela could become a friend for gods sakes the first real one carmel would ever have had she sipped the juice and wandered back past all of her perfect blackandwhite photos barely seeing them if she was thinking about killing pamela then it was probable that the other woman was thinking about killing her and maybe was equally reluctant to do it for some of the same reasons if things should change carmel thought if it became really necessary to get rid of pamela she damn well better move first and fast she wouldnt have a second chance she glanced at her watch time to go get her at the airport rinker tossed her light bag in the back seat of the volvo and carmel said i can think of three possibilities which are we do nothing i sat down with a legal pad tonight and tried to work out the worst possible scenario i cant see how they could ever ever have come up with enough against us to arrest either one of us if they did i dont see how they could convict either one of us unless youve left fingerprints behind or dropped your billfold or something nothing like that rinker said what are the other two possibilities our major problem is davenport forget the fbi forget these other cops who are digging around if we get rid of davenport theyll never figure out who we are on the other hand getting rid of him would be more than risky itd be dangerous hes not only violent hes lucky one time he was shot in the throat and would have died except a surgeon was standing right there with a jackknife and did an emergency tracheotomy and they made it to the hospital are you joking no ah man thats the most scary thing youve said about him that hes lucky the third possibility is that we set up and run a little play a little pageant that would somehow make all these killings make sense the alternative theory its one way you can beat what seems like an openandshut case against a client give the jury something that makes more sense or seems to if we created exactly the right pageant even if davenport knew there was something wrong with it they couldnt get out of it what are you recommending rinker asked number one do nothing sit and wait i dont think anything more will happen we know the cops are on the phone in washington so we never use it again id love to see their file on the case but that wont happen unless they make a move on hale all right so we sit they rode in silence for a while then rinker asked what if this car is bugged theyre not that smart carmel said this is moms car she even uses it when i dont need it and she wants to haul something bulbs or plants or something but i need a car that nobody really knows about especially when ive got a hot case sometimes you dont want people looking at you your folks get divorced no my dad killed himself carmel said he was an endodontist did root canals all day he got tired of it sat down in his chair one afternoon when hed finished with a patient wrote a short note to the world and strapped on a nitrous oxide mask jesus yup a good way to go i guess but he had to work at it a little had to override some safety things pinch off an oxygen tank and so on when i go i dont want to have to think about it i just wanna go i dont wanna go not for a while rinker said what about your folks carmel asked my dad took off when i was a baby rinker said and my good old stepdad used to fuck me once or twice a week until took off your stepdad still around no rinker looked out the window he went away one day he hasnt been seen since like your dad carmel said not exactly no said rinker chapter sixteen sherrill came back from st louis with blue circles under her eyes didnt get any sleep lucas asked he tried to keep his voice flat but there might have been a tone to it he thought i had to fuck all the guys on their organized crime squad that kept me up nights sherrill said they were alone in his office hey he was offended hey yourself the way you asked the question she said i was just trying to forget it anyway i didnt get any sleep every night id roll around in the bed and the blankets were too heavy and the pillow was too thick and the room smelled bad and id think about you and me uhoh i tried not to she said i just couldnt help myself i was wondering if we did the right thing i was wondering if i ought to get you someplace and screw you blind just one more time or two or three more times but not forever just sort of goodbye i had the feeling youd already done that lucas said yeah i did sherrill said besides sex wasnt really our problem was it nah the sex was pretty wonderful at least from my point of view so what was it i think uh you might be a natural upper and im a natural downer yeah thats what you concluded i concluded that i oughta get a new boyfriend and you oughta get a girlfriend then wed be done with it im too tired to look lucas said you get one yeah sherrill said she nibbled on her bottom lip maybe lucas said were dead in the water here the feds are still sitting on their wire tap on tennex but nobodys calling are they tapping carmel maybethey say theyre not yet but they could be lying about it the fbi lying yeah yeah you get anything i got about twenty names sherrill said lot of names yeah but if theres a mafiaconnected guy in st louis who can order these hits his name is almost forsure on the list so what im getting to that she said you know how you guys were looking at where all those checks came from and you figured the person sending them must come from southwest missouri or eastern kansas or those other places northern arkansas or northern oklahoma so if we do an analysis of these mafia guys who are all like these uptown dudes wearing loafers with no socks and driving cadillacs and if we find one of them has a lot of calls going out to some farm in east jesus oklahoma lucas looked at her for a second and said thats good you like it first decent idea anybodys had in a week he pulled open his desk drawer and found mallards card even better it involves dealing with bureaucrats from the phone company i mean this is mallards life mallard liked it he had three agents working on it overnight and called lucas back in the middle of the afternoon the next day he was lucas thought a teeny bit breathless have you ever heard of allen kent no hes this italian guy his fathers name was kent he was nobody but his mothers family was tied right to the top of the st louis and the chicago mafia families back when sam giancana was running the world whos he been calling well he calls all over the place hes a booze distributor he calls every little goddamn bar in the midwest but hes got an at t calling card which he uses when hes outoftown and we analyzed all those calls for the past ten years and guess what hes actually lee harvey oswald and hes holding jfk in a cave no but you know we have all these mafiarelated hits attributed to this woman in each casekent was making calls from wichita kansas between twentyfour and thirty days before each hit hed spend two days there each time every time now you figure he goes out to wichita to meet the shooter and give her the assignment and maybe talk about information she needs then she needs time to do some recon we know shes careful we know shes watching the target for a while before she moves and maybe she needs some time to get oriented in each new city and time to drive there if she drives like we think she does you think shes from wichita lucas said we think its a possibility we even think we might have a name yeahwhatisit john lopez lucas grappled with the name for a moment john yeah a guy disguised as a woman which makes a lot of sense when you think about it a woman hitman for the mafia come on never happen we found him in our data base hes puerto rican fivefive one hundred and thirty pounds so he could be a woman hes a mean little bastard too back a few years ago there was a massive amount of cocaine coming in through the south coast of puerto rico and then it was transhipped by plane to the states because theres no customs on puerto rican flights its an internal flight he was one of the mules hauling it up to chicago taking the money back when he was busted he gave up all the puerto rican links in return for immunity and protection but claimed he didnt know who he was dealing with in chicago we now think it might have been the mafia and thats where he hooked up with allen kent howd he get to wichita witness protection god help us but we might have been protecting the biggest professional killer in the states lucas felt slightly deflated the feebs were gonna make the bust are you going out there absolutely im taking everything i got with me lopez supposedly runs a flower shop out there like a longtime hood is gonna run a flower shop mallard laughed and lucas looked at the phone mallard seemed to be running a little hot mind if i watch hell no im going out this afternoon im leaving here in five minutes were staying at the holiday inn uh the holiday inn east we got a warrant going on a wire tap and were getting all of his phone records now listen i gotta run all right lucas said ill see you down there probably tonight if nothing comes up im driving down you could fly in a couple of hours yeah yeah im driving lucas said lucas was a longtime porsche driver he enjoyed driving the car up to a couple of hundred miles but it was not a longdistance cruiser six hundred and fifty miles would leave him both shaken and stirred besides the porsche needed servicing look he told his porsche dealer on the telephone youre gonna charge me an arm and a leg so i oughta get something decent for a loaner i know damn well that youve got that bmw on the lot because i saw larry showing it to a guy yeah yeah i dont want avolkswagen passat how about this ill pay mileage ill pay you fifteen cents a mile and i buy all the gas im driving to wichita which is six hundred and fifty miles more or less so thats thirteen hundred miles youll get a couple of hundred bucks for three or four days and then i wont be hassling you about your slow work on the porsche come on goddamnit whattaya mean fifty cents the government doesnt pay fifty cents and thats supposed to cover gasoline he got the il a long black fourdoor with a cockpit like an fs grey leather seats a cdplayer in the trunk and sixtyone thousand miles on the clock for twentyfive cents a mile he was two miles out of the dealership when he tripped the illplaced hoodcover latch with his left foot without knowing what hed done and the hood began rattling up and down fearing that the hood was about to blow back his face he swerved to the edge of the highway and risked his neck to relatch it he tripped the hood lever again five minutes later and again took the car to the shoulder this time he called the porsche dealer who said youre tripping the hood with your left foot stop doing that lucas found the hood latch and said thats a good place for it thirty miles out of town a yellow light popped on the left dash that said check engine and he took it to the side again fearing that he was about to blow a rod he was still within cell phone distance and he called the dealer again who said the light meant that the emission system wasnt working quite right dont worry about it it doesnt mean anything on any other car check engine means all your oil just ran out on the road lucas said thats not any car the porsche guy said when the oil runs out on the road that one says stop in big red letters so the lights gonna be on all trip thats right pal you wanted it you got it the dealer said without a shred of sympathy theres this whistling noise the windshields not quite right were gonna try to reseal it when you get back im beginning to think this things a piece of shit lucas grumbled what do you want for sixtyfive thousand the porsche guy asked you shoulda took the volkswagen but the car was comfortable and certainly looked good he made the six hundred and fifty miles to wichita in nine hours whipping through des moines and kansas city pausing only for gas and a sack of hardshell taco supremes at a taco bell he got a room at a best western called mallards office in washington where an afterhours secretary said shed relay his number to mallard mallard called five minutes later were downtown at a place called josephs let me read the menu to you lucas ordered a steak medium baked potato without sour cream and a diet coke he found josephs fifteen minutes later just as the waiter was delivering the food to mallard and an angular greyhaired woman named malone she was just about his age lucas thought somewhere in the murky forties malone is our legal specialist mallard said as he went to work on the steak she keeps track of the taps and the warrants and all that and talks to the judge when we need to talk to him are you an agent lucas asked malone had just pushed a tiny square of beef into her mouth and instead of answering opened the left side of her pinstripe jacket so lucas could see the butt of a black automatic pistol nice accessories lucas said trying a little bit cop charm works really well on me malone said after she swallowed i get all atwitter you wanna stop that mallard asked i hate middleaged courtship rituals whats his problem lucas asked malone recently divorced malone said tipping her head at mallard still loves her sorry lucas said not true anyway im all done with that mallard said and for one small second he looked so miserable that lucas wanted to pat him on the back and tell him itd be okay but lucas didnt believe it would be and mallard wouldnt either besides mallard added im not all alone in that condition if youre talking to me youre talking to the wrong person malone said i dont like any of them them lucas asked fourtime loser mallard said jabbing his fork at malone jesus lucas said in the fbi if it hadnt been for the second one id be a deputy director by now malone said whatd he do lucas asked he was an actor bad actor mallard said no he was a good actor he just couldnt stay away from the nude scenes malone said the killer was when the washington post interviewed him nude and he mentioned he was married to an fbi agent not the best career move mallard said we were all still wearing white shirts you got number five figured out yet lucas asked not yet malone said but im looking around this is what it is mallard said breaking into the dialogue is that weve got nine guys here and were watching lopez twentyfour hours a day hes got diree phones were listening to all of them and weve already gotten a couple of ambiguous calls i mean people talking in circles about something besides flowers nothing that would implicate him but somethings going on could i hear them your tapes sure ive got an edited tape you can listen to tonight tomorrow when he moves well hook you up with him good enough lucas said i dont want him to see me though not if hes been in and out of the cities ive been on tv a couple of times with this stuff he mightve caught it you must be sort of a celebrity then malone said a local hero come on guys mallard said please malone mallard sprawled on the bed in his motel room while lucas sat in the single easy chair and malone perched against a credenza they listened while voices said i thought id stop by today not much point really then when do you think would be a good time gotta be by tomorrow unless something happened on the way down i havent heard anything i could give you a ring if you want thatd be good im getting you know lucas said hes peddling dope i already suggested that malone said it sorta made people unhappy cant be sure that its dope mallard said defensively sure it is lucas said i can even tell you what kind heroin suggested malone yup lucas nodded maybe thats the old chicago system working mallard said i dont see a murder contractor trusting a junkie to kill people lucas said maybe hes not a junkie that was a small retail sale you were listening to lucas said if hes a small retail dealer chances are hes a junkie on the other hand since he had somebody coming in from a long way off maybe not malone said he seems to be buying wholesale lucas shrugged could be but its strange behavior for a guy whos supposed to be a paranoid superkiller i could see a killer buying cocaine or maybe speed from a good tight retail connection but i cant see one actually selling the stuff that means hes dealing with all kind of craphead junkies whod sell him out for a dime when they finished with the tapes they all sat around for a minute and then mallard said the yankees are on cable i gotta get outside lucas said ive been sitting in a car all day wherere you going asked malone maybe find a bar lucas said have a couple beers i could do that malone said id like to change into something a little more relaxed mallard sighed and said all right i guess its better than staring at a tv malone glanced at him a thin line forming between her eyes it disappeared in a halfsecond and she said so why dont we meet back here in a half hour lucas got back to mallards room a few minutes before malone when she got back she was wearing black slacks and a soft black jacket over a sheer blouse beneath the blouse lucas thought she was wearing a frilly black bra and to the left under the jacket he could still pick out the slightly lumpy form of the semiauto going out the door malone went first and lucas got the finest possible whiff of something exotic something cool and icy malone got to the front passenger door first mallard got in the back malone looked at all the lights on the dashboard and doors and steering wheel and asked how come smalltown cops get cars like these and we get tauruses because we fight government corruption at every turn mallard said minneapolis is bigger than dc lucas said malone made a rude noise and mallard said stop it on the way downtown lucas spotted a wichita cop car sitting at a corner and pulled in ahead of it mallard asked whatre you doing and lucas answered research he got out of the car carrying his badge case and when the cop in the drivers seat rolled down the window lucas flipped open the case and said hey guys im a cop from up in minneapolis going through with a couple of friends were looking for a bar or cocktail lounge you know something decent the driver took lucas badge case and studied the id for a minute grunted deputy chief huh then handed it back and looked at his partner really arent many places to talk what do you thinkthe rink be about the best the partner said four blocks straight ahead to the second light take a right about four or five more blocks down the rink great lucas said straightening up buy you guys one if were still there when you get off thanks but were working the overnight the driver said say let me ask you this whats your base pay up there in minneapolis they talked about salary vacation and sickleave policy for a couple of minutes then lucas walked back to the climbed inside tripped the hood latch got out slammed the hood got back in and they drove to the rink rinker was standing behind the bar reading a register tape when lucas walked in she was so utterly astonished that she showed nothing at all as though shed been hit in the forehead with a hammer when she recovered after a full five seconds she noticed that he was with a woman who looked like a lawyer and a dryfaced thicknecked man who might be an academic or maybe a college wrestling coach she turned away from them and walked down the bar and into the back where she could stand behind a pane of oneway glass something going on one of the kitchen boys asked picking up her rapt attention guy walked in i thought he might be an old boyfriend from a very long time ago rinker said which guy finish the freezer she said just askin she watched lucas for ten minutes and finally decided that he wasnt interested in the bar if hed come here for her and what other reason could he have for being here he certainly wasnt looking for her he was putting a little light bullshit on the lawyer woman rinker decided and the lawyer liked it rinker wondered what would happen if she simply walked out into the bar would he jump up and bust her were there other cops closing in on the bar or stationed outside if he was here on business why was he drinking beer and bullshitting the woman was he that good she broke away from the glass and walked rapidly back through the kitchen to the flight of stairs that went up to her small office the office had been built under the roof of what had originally been a onestory building so the ceiling slanted and it had windows going out only one end of the building looking out she couldnt see anything unusual nobody in the streets no cars with men lurking inside but it wouldnt be that way anyway she thought if they were coming for her theyd probably wait until they could get her on the sidewalk alone or at her home they wouldnt walk into a bar and risk a shootout in a place full of bystanders rinker had a long couch at the end of the office and she sometimes napped on it now she lay down closed her eyes and tried to work it out she could only find one answer that somebody had given her up somebody who knew where she lived shed told carmel that she went to wichita state so carmel knew where she lived but not her name or about the bar but if carmel had given her up then theyd know almost everything and they would have come in hard she had to call carmel she thought but not from here and right now maybe shed walk out on the floor talk to some people if they were planning to jump her she was dead meat anyway and if they werent maybe she could learn something rinkers bar had two major rooms one for drinking and talking and the second for drinking and dancing the dance floor was polished maple taken from a bankrupt karate studio and probably the best dance floor in any bar in wichita all surrounded by deepbacked booths upholstered in naugahyde when davenport and his friends arrived the band live music on weekends had been taking a break they were setting up for their third and final set when rinker cruised through she worked all the booths around the dance floor talking with people she knew or had often seen in the bar mostly unders whitecollar the band played soft rock and cross over country she bought a beer for a guy whod walked away from a car wreck earlier in the day and for a couple who were out for the first time since a kid was born she listened to a guywalksintoabar joke guy walks into a bar and the bartender says boy i didnt expect to see you today after last night you were really bummed outand the guy says i was so bummed out that i went home and looked in my medicine cabinet i had a big bottle of a thousand aspirins in there and i decided to kill myself by taking them all at once the bartender says so what happenedand the guy says well after the first two i didnt feel so bad she laughed and tracked davenport between the heads of the dancers who were just moving out on the dance floor again as the band cranked into a country dance piece davenport was in a frontroom booth facing her through the smoky atmosphere he was paying no attention to her at all or to anybody else in the bar as far as she could tell he was a goodlooking guy in a hard way just starting to get a little grey around the temples she drifted toward him lucas was laying a very mild hustle on malone while mallard tried to steer the conversation back to police work malone didnt want to know about police work but when lucas suggested that they dance she said i dont dance like that is that a philosophical position i just dont dance to rock or country i never learned i can foxtrot i can waltz i cant do that kind of boppity you know too selfconscious lucas said he was about to go on when a woman stopped at the table and said you all doing all right here all right lucas said looking up at her she wasnt a waitress whore you im the owner clara making sure that everybodys being treated right good bar lucas said you oughta open another one like it up in minneapolis youre from minneapolis i am lucas said these folks are from back east glad to have you in wichita rinker said she started to step away but malone whod perhaps had one more beer than she was accustomed to said your band doesnt play waltzes does it rinker grinned and said why no i dont believe they do honey you wanna waltz this guys got the urge to dance malone said pointing at lucas with her longneck and i cant dance to rock never learned well you oughta rinker said she looked quickly around the bar and then said to lucas im not doing anything at the minute and i like dancing you want to they were dancing for five seconds and lucas realized he was out of his depth youre a dancer a professional he said and rinker laughed and said i used to be kinda well slow down youre making me look bad and im a lot older than you are ah you dance fine rinker said for a minneapolis white guy lucas laughed and turned her around she was goodlooking he thought one of those toughcookie smart blondes whod been around a bit liked a good time and could run a spreadsheet like an accountant maybe was an accountant are you an accountant he asked an accountantthey were shouting at each other over the music why would you think that i dont just making up a story in my head a story youre not a reporter are you nah im a cop just going through i stopped to talk to some friends you dont look like a copyou look like a movie guy or something flattery will get you everywhere lucas shouted back she laughed and they danced but late that night an hour after the bar closed rinker climbed in her car and headed for kansas city she would not break the routine she would not make a business call from wichita she arrived in kc in the early morning hours pulled into a convenience store and started dropping coins in a pay phone when she had enough she dialed carmel and carmel sleep in her voice answered on the second ring the cell phone rinker thought must have been on the bed stand weve got another problem rinker said whats that i just gaily danced the night away with your friend and mine she let it hang who lucas davenport right here in river city goddamnit carmel said she ripped off a piece of thumbnail snapped at it she could hear her own teeth grinding in the telephone earpiece hes working on some kind of information i dont know enough about you or your friends to know where it might be coming from its more complicated than that rinker said he had no idea who i was he must be there for something i mean what are the chances of a coincidence zero less than zero id say so would i he had no idea who i was rinker repeated i was hoping you might get something from your sources in the police department not much chance carmel said my guy thinks of himself as a kind of harmless leaker of information thats gonna get out anyway he really wouldnt tell me anything that he thought might get somebody hurt so maybe we need to put some pressure on him listen to this he did tell me that they keep coming back to me even my source is getting a little strange with me he thinks davenports got something and i think it has to do with that kid damnit even if the kid told him something oh shit what just had a thought if the kid for some reason got the tag number on that rental car i told you that i use fake credit cards and ids to rent them i told you about that yeah you keep the cards good by using them ive paid them from wichita ive been careful but ive gotten bank drafts here to pay those bills you think i dont see how the kid could have gotten the number it was dark and she was back inside when we left and we were way down the block maybe it wasnt the kid maybe wasnt there a guy on a bike from upstairs why would he take our tag number rinker asked i dont know but that would explain a few things can you come up here yeah im in kc now ill be up there tomorrow bring your tools carmel said we may have to talk to somebody and i gotta think about this maybe by the time you get here ill have some ideas chapter seventeen lucas stayed in wichita for two days tracking lopez and listening to the fbi taps the longer he listened the more convinced he became that lopez was a smalltime dealer supplementing the flower shop take with a little side money the side money lucas decided was going straight into his arm a woman named nancy holme carried on lopez state tax forms as an employee did virtually all the work showing up early to take deliveries of freshcut flowers staying late over a hot computer lopez would arrive sleepy nod off at midday and leave sleepy the feebs couldnt decide whether holme was in on the game or not she never took delivery of drugs lucas suggested that they look at her as the killer they did and rapidly concluded that she wasnt the night before he left for minneapolis lucas malone and mallard went back to the rink the woman hed danced with the owner wasnt working he was told shes got to travel on business a couple of times a year and this is one of those times too bad she liked you a waitress told them her overactive eyebrows semaphoring a tale of two ships passing in the night a tragedy malone said when the waitress left with their orders davenport leaves another broken heart in a dusty western town rinker was in the twin cities carmel met her at the hotel and at rinkers direction had ridden up three extra floors on the elevator and had taken the stairs down to rinkers floor rinker when she let carmel in was wearing a black wig how do i look mexican rinker asked as she closed the door youre too pale carmel said you could maybe make italian ill go back to the redhead then rinker said carmel had been thinking about davenport somehow theyre tracking you and for some reason theyre pushing on me i thought about your car and the possibility that theyre tracking it but that doesnt seem likely that would mean that they had to have two pieces of luck to get onto tennex and to get the tag number i dont believe it what im wondering is could they have found a connection with your st louis friends could they be squeezing somebody only one guy in st louis knows exactly who i am and what i do and there are maybe two more who suspect a couple brothers who run a bar down there and the brothers wouldnt know who you are the one guy would he knows your name hes the guy rolo called my contact in the pd says that another detective a woman named sherrill went down to st louis for a couple of days last week and the word around the department is that she was talking to the st louis organizedcrime guys carmel said i dont know why my guy would be dealing me rinker said thinking about it for a moment he takes a lot of power off me you know hes the guy who knows the finger of god as you put it the guy who can hook you up and if i go down he goes down carmel took a short turn around the hotel room checked herself in a bureau mirror turned back and said let me tell you something i learned as a lawyer everybody will deal everybody have you ever heard of this new federal lockup in the rockies no you gotta cement cell about half the size of this hotel room it has a concrete bed platform and stainless steel sink and toilet fixtures in concrete stands no bars just a steel door and an unbreakable window that shows nothing but a rectangle of sky you cant even see the sun theres a blackandwhite tv bolted in a corner thats ityoure in there twentytwo to twentythree hours a day and youre monitored every minute ive had a couple of clients try to commit suicide in there and neither one made it although one made it when they put him in a hospital after his second try he tried to kill himself by standing against one wall and running full speed into the wall across the room with his head down he cracked his skull he finally managed to kill himself in the hospital this was his third try rather than go back you hear what im saying im not sure rinker said what im saying is torture is alive and well in the united states of america carmel said it just doesnt involve physical pain it involves isolation year after year of solitary they could take your mafia friend out there show him through the place let him talk to a couple of inmates and hed give you up but he hasnt rinker said because if he had theyd be on me like a hot sweat but theyre not i swear to god davenport didnt have any idea who i was and neither did the other cops we danced for gods sake that wasnt too great a move carmel said i had to find out if they were there for me i couldnt stand it rinker said to tell you the truth what what if hes fated to find me thats what scares me ive got this guy i cant shake because its my time jesus pam you gotta take a couple aspirins or something carmel said lay down for a while cause believe me its nothing like that rinker sighed and let her shoulders slump carmel actually did make her feel better she was so sure of herself okay so we still have the questionwhat do we do carmel said davenport knows something hes working off something what could they have given him attennex that put him in wichita why is he pushing on me i dont know how he got to wichita i was a fanatic about being careful what about your mafia friend even if hes not deliberately giving you up is there any way he could have pointed them at wichita hmph rinker had to think about it for a minute i didnt let him call me there he always came out to deliver the messages but hes always on the telephone if somehow they managed to sort out his calls while he was there i dont know it sounds weak i mean he goes everywhere why would they focus on wichita theyve got all kinds of ways of doing those things statistics carmel said id be willing to bet its something like that especially if davenport didnt know who you were he didnt im sure of that they went over it several times and finally carmel said you know were coming to the crunch here if davenports mining some kind of line of information it might lead to you or it might lead to me or it might not its hard to put a case together id say its about fiftyfifty whether we should sit tight or move somehow what move one possibility is we could go talk to the kid and the kids mother we could find out what they told the cops then wed know about that angle what if its a trap i dont think it is i dont think any cop would put a kid in play not when youre talking about professional killers carmel said if any cop would itd be davenport but i dont think even he would and youre saying that after we talk to them we kill them the kid and her mom carmel shrugged if we have to wed have to find some other way to do it im not going to kill the kid ive been thinking about it rinker said for the first time since they started meeting facetoface carmel picked up the warning edge in rinkers voice that shed heard when they talked on the phone when the problems began developing okay but if you really think youre the finger of god whats the problem im just not gonna kill that kid fuck the finger rinker said so we find a way not to kill them not unless we absolutely have to carmel said you didnt kill that marker woman in washington we should be able to figure something out you said going after the kid was one possibility whats the other we could do something that would make it impossible for them to prosecute us even if they figured out who we are carmel said how would we do that rinker asked ive been thinking about it ever since you called carmel said i call it plan b plan b took a while to explain rinker was not so much appalled as amazed lucas got back to minneapolis late the next afternoon dropped the bmw at the porsche dealership sank into his own car with a sigh of relief and headed downtown hed told sherrill and black when to expect him and they were waiting in the homicide office not so good sherrill asked lucas shook his head hes not the guy hes a smalltime dope dealer but they still think hes the guy mallard still thinks theres a chance hes got a smart assistant named malone and malone was ready to go back to washington and start over lucas said goddamnit black said did you hear about the sniper lucas shook his head what sniper car got hit by rifle fire last night during rush hour one car one windshield nobody hurt couldnt find a shooter and we thought maybe it was an accident then this afternoon right at the start of the rush hour a little after three the guy came back two cars hit a woman hit in the neck shes in surgery some guy coming down the road behind her stuffed a wad of newspaper in the hole in her neck probably saved her life but the medias going batshit the radio stations all the drivetime guys i mean this is their audience being shot at so everybodys out well you know sloans working the hmong thing and swanson is still chasing down stuff on the parker case so people are making noises like taking us off allen they say just a few days but you know what that might mean ill talk to rose marie lucas said but the question is whatve we got to do whats left that we havent done they all looked at each other and finally sherrill shrugged we were waiting for you to tell us lucas said whatre you doing tonight nothing sherrill said why dont you hang around and see if carmels going anywhere lucas suggested if were gonna start tailing her were gonna need more than two guys black said theyre gonna be hard to come by given the sniper and all that so we dont have a fulltime tail just somebody hanging around maybe we get lucky ah christ sherrill said ill do it but i have a feeling im gonna be pulling my weenie rinker brought a wig with her shed have big hair texas hair when she went in shed wear jeans gym shoes rubber kitchen gloves two pistols under a black sport jacket a handkerchief and a nylon rolled up tight as a watch cap carmel would be wearing a slinky bloodyred dress with spangles matching red shoes and lipstick how do i look she asked you look terrific rinker said admiration riding in her voice god if i could look like that youre beautiful carmel said no im not rinker said im cute i look like i should be in the playboy college issue duke universitys miss perky nipples does miss perky nipples carry colt woodsmans would it be woodsmans or woodsmen no she probably wouldnt i dont know the correct grammar but i got two of them and they were stolen fourteen years ago from a gunstore in butte montana and havent seen the light of day since im cool carmel nodded you are cool she took a last look at herself in a fulllength mirror twirled and said when i get that boy home tonight i am going to fuck him rudely rudely good luck rinker said i sorta wish i was involved with somebody its been a while is it hard to meet guys in wichita carmel asked screwing on an earring clasp its hard for me rinker said you know a gal who runs a bar what kind of guys am i going to attract she answered her own question most of them have got a bottle of jim beam in the trunk too bad you couldnt hook up with davenport carmel said jokingly hed be a possibility rinker admitted he could be fun in a biggaloot way mean biggaloot said carmel i could see that rinker said i could feel it after a second but he sorta handles you moves you around touches you not feeling you up or anything but hes just i dont know all over the place if he sees you here were fucked carmel said unlike when i saw him in wichita rinker said then i thought about coming on to him a little but that wouldve been too much anyway i dont expect to see him again the rest of my life she picked up the first of the pistols jacked a shell into the chamber set the safety and slipped it into her gun girdle under the jacket rinker looked at carmel you ready chapter eighteen black canceled a date and climbed into the back of sherrills mazda with a pepperoni pizza and a bag of hot nacho cheese crackers sherrill said youre a cruel fuck if i ate any of that stuff itd go right straight to my thighs so dont eat it concentrate on other things flowers small children black said im having a hard time concentrating with my future husband on his way up to slip a little english bacon to carmel loan youre so crude and whatever hes got in there i doubt that it resembles bacon you mean in stripes or in flatness she giggled god i love talking dirty with you its so jocklike so she couldnt think of a word through the plate glass doors of carmel loans building they could see hale allens back as he signed into the building then a short redhead came around the corner from the elevators into the lobby and sherrill said here comes nope the redhead walked past allen giving him the onceover pushed through the glass doors looked left and right put her hands deep in the pockets of her black sport coat and headed down the block inside allen walked away from the security desk and around the corner to the elevators as they watched them a patrol car pulled in behind the mazda and the red lights began to flash ah man sherrill said looking in her rearview mirror the loudspeaker on the cop car blared drop your car keys out the passenger window now instead of dropping her keys out of the window sherrill held her badge case out after a minute the flashing lights stopped and the driver of the cop car approached from the back shining a flashlight on the badge case sherrill pushed the door open dropped her feet to the street looked at the cop and said what the fuck are you doing what are you doing im on a goddamn stakeout i was on a goddamn stakeout sherrill said now im in a goddamn comedy routine people had stopped up and down the street to watch well jeez were sorry the cop looked around at the audience and flapped his arms helplessly you shoulda told somebody instead of just lurking around here the doorman called he said youd been here for hours sherrill could see the doorman in carmels building peering at them through the lobby window yeah well now im gonna drive around the block and park again she said and im telling you stay away from me or i swear to christ ill shoot you the cop peered in the back window and said hi tom hi want some nachos nah give me heartburn so youre gonna go around the block yeah well be cool sherrill started the car and they rolled away black laughing in the back then sherrill started god i love police work two minutes later they were back on watch black still relaxed in the back and even deeper into the nachos how you been he asked through a mouthful of chips and cheese since you and davenport i miss him a lot she said hes an asshole sorta i miss him anyway she said besides while i agree hes an asshole hes not an asshole like you think he is oh i think i know just cause youre queer doesnt mean you know youre still a guy black contemplated the statement formulated a reply ate the chips as he worked at it carefully formulated replies were necessary in the stakeout business you could sit for hours and you didnt want to run out of stuff to talk about or piss off your partner too soon let me tell you my theory of queerness as relates to the straight male black said and he did and after a while ten minutes sherrill said i never would have thought of any of that youre not gay its not that its just that i couldnt have come up with such an utter crock of shit black put a final three nachos in his mouth and settled back to formulate another reply before he got a good paragraph together sherrill said here they come and jesus christ look at that dress black peered over the sill of the back window allen and carmel stepped out through the glass doors allen wore a dark jacket that black suspected was lightweight cashmere tan expensivelooking slacks and loafers carmel was in a shocking lowcut red party dress and red shoes nice dress black said nice a little gaudy dont you think and her tits are about coming out i dont know he said color is always good in clothing and skin display is nice in the summer dont give me the fag act look at her shes like a billboard all right shes obviously a tart black said thank you not nearly fine enough to aspire after the lovely hale and she certainly doesnt have your tits you dont think marcy youve probably got the thirdbest tits in minneapolis davenport says sixth best and of course he would know from first hand observation while sloan says second best i dont know about sloans qualifications he has none and shut up were going let me get my big gulp off the floor ah shit rinker missed the foulup with the squad car shed already turned the corner and was headed back to her hotel to pick up her car she felt heavy as she went she might have to kill the two of them the mother and daughter might have to and that felt wrong these were people whod never had a chance they werent people whod screwed up somehow had gotten too stubbornly close to something that was bad for them it was like all that gangbanger talk years ago of mushrooms popping up in the lineoffire this mother and daughter were essentially mushrooms and rinker had always thought of herself more as a surgeon than as a gangbanger shed have to do this right carmel and hale allen went to a club called the swan which had a twelvepiece orchestra and a blonde chick singer with a voice like buttermilk and danced oldstyle dances cheek to cheek hand in the middle of the back carmel could reach hales earlobe with her tongue which she did every few minutes and which had a profound effect on him after the third dance he growled lets get out of here no she said in her best cat voice youve got to be patient sherrill and black watched from a balcony seat as allen and carmel moved around the dance floor stopping now and then to talk with friends all of the friends sherrill decided had a certain slickness that she disliked she mentioned it to black i think they teach you that in law school black said hey i know some pretty nice lawyers so now were gonna be sincere no i was just wondering theres this subset of people who look slick see look at the guy in the white coat and the woman hes with slick they spend too much time looking at themselves without being professionals black said professionals actors can look perfect and look right at the same time these guys try to look perfect and they just look slick much more of this surveillance chitchat and ill throw up rinker scouted the davis neighborhood saw nothing at all of course if it were a trap of some kind the cops might be in an apartment across the street or up the stairs and shed never know until they were kicking down the doors but it didnt feel that way it didnt have the creepy close feeling of movies when a guy was in hiding and somehow she thought it would feel that way thered be that peculiar stillness of the moment when you hide in somebody elses house and they walk in and they know she didnt feel that here rinker had taken two fedex boxes from a fedex stand and taped them together she left the car a block from the davis apartment she noted the lights under the window shades so somebody was home and walked back carrying the box a guy was following his dog down the other side of the street paying no attention to her rinker turned in at the house jogged up the stoop and stepped inside the entry and stopped she could hear a stereo from up the stairs nothing from the back from the davis apartment she moved closer to the davis door listened the rhythm of voices or one voice a womans voice she glanced around took the pistol out of her belt and stuck it under her left arm pinned to her side she knocked once the rhythm of the voices stopped and she heard footsteps the door opened on a chain and a woman peeked out yes we got a fedex upstairs for you the guys did they forgot to bring it down so i did rinker said cheerfully she bounced the box in her hand the woman didnt hesitate said oh thanks just the minute and pushed the door shut and began to work the chain rinker quickly stooped and put the box on the floor then reached up and pulled the nylon down over her face pulling it down like a condom the woman opened the door and the pistol was there pointing at her head and rinker whispered harshly step back or ill kill you jan davis stricken hand at her face eyes wide stepped back please dont hurt us rinker kicked the box into the apartment pushed the door shut and rasped if a cop comes in now ill start shooting and well all be dead are the cops watching this place daviss head was wagging back and forth a no and a little girl called out mom whos that get her out here rinker said flicking the tip of the pistol toward the bedroom door youre the yeah ive never killed a kid in my life and i hope i never have to but you gotta get her out here then im gonna ask you two questions and im gonna tell you something if you answer the questions right and then im gonna leave youre going to kill us mom if i were gonna kill you i wouldnt be wearing a mask rinker said now get her out here davis stared for another moment then said heather honey cmere honey the girl stuck her head out of a bedroom a minute later she was wearing yellow underpants and a yellow shirt and was carrying a curious george monkey doll mom cmere honey davis backed toward her daughter groping for her hand the girl looked at rinker and said did you kill those people her eyes were as wide as her mothers had been her mother said shhh and rinker said heres the first question what did you tell the police about the people you saw in the hallway davis glanced down at the girl and then back at rinker they had pictures we didnt tell them anything because heather didnt see anything she couldnt even make one of those drawing pictures did the police talk to anybody upstairs they talked to everybody in the house but nobody saw anything everybodys been talking to everybody but nobody even saw you and the other person leaving nobody saw nobody no davis shook her head and rinker was struck with the straightforwardness of it she looked at the little girl and what did you do little girl heather told her how she went to the police station how she tried to make a drawing but she didnt know any faces they showed her pictures but she didnt know them as she spoke she stood up tall with her feet together as if she were a marine standing at attention and rinker suddenly knew that the child understood what was happening that she was talking for her life rinker suddenly teared up and said to davis send her back to the bedroom go honey you come too mom heather said pulling at her mothers hand ive got to talk to this lady davis said and the fear lay right on the surface of her eyes heather saw it as clearly as did rinker dont worry kid im not going to hurt anybody rinker said weve just got to have some grownup talk ive heard grownup talk before the girl said rinker looked down at her all right she probably had she looked back at the mother you dont tell anybody i was here you could actually provide them with a little more information about me how tall i am what my voice sounds like i couldnt tolerate that if you do that if you tell anyone i was here ill come back and kill you and if they kill me first then one of my associates will come here and kill you because theyll feel like theyve got to make the point and they wont let you go they dont give a shit about people like you do you understand the vulgarity the shit hung in the air between them and lent rinkers speech authority a killers authority and mom nodded dumbly well never tell honest to god well never tell jan davis said go sit on the couch rinker said dont get up for five minutes no matter how much you want to im going to walk out of the house and i dont want you to see my car mom nodded again and pulled the child across the living room to the couch and they sat down rinker stepped back to the door stopped brought the pistol up and fired a single shot a photograph of davis in earlier years with two other women fell off the wall a perfect pencil thick hole punched through the glass and davis eyeball in the photo absolute and complete silence rinker whispered and she was gone out the door down the stoop up the street in the car and she breathed out lets go home black said theyre gonna be here all night best time to pull something is about five oclock in the morning sherrill said but she yawned yeah and if we really think that we should put a twentyfourhour watch on them but we cant do twentyfour hours ourselves im so fuckin bored i cant think and the back of my boxer shorts is about five inches up my ass because ive been sitting here too long take a walk sherrill said id get mugged not in this neighborhood by the goddamn security patrol you see those guys would you give those guys a gun all right sherrill sighed and turned the key cranked the car theres gotta be something else we can do i cant believe we sat in this car for eight hours and never came up with a decent idea theres nothing left if carmel did it and im not giving you that shes gonna walk jan davis lay in bed all night barely closing her eyes she fought down an impulse to flee to her parents home in missouri she wouldnt be completely welcome since the divorce her parents had liked howard better than they liked her she thought feeling alone and isolated besides shed seen the godfather movies and she knew about these people the mafia running wouldnt help theyd get you anywhere she decided to stick to routine heather had been going to day school all summer getting a head start on first grade davis had hoped against hope that somehow in the morning heather would have forgotten what happened the night before but she hadnt she looked like shed gotten as little sleep as her mother should i go to school she asked first thing yes we are going to forget what happened last nightthat was a bad dream davis tried to be cheery but it wasnt working is she going to come back and hurt us no no no nothing is going to happen lets just pretend that nothing happened nobody came but the lady came davis wanted to shake her wanted to scream at her wanted to impress her with the danger but didnt know how heather listen that was a very bad lady very bad we have to pretend that she wasnt here we have to pretend that she was a bad dream remember the bad dream you had about mrs gartin chasing you we have to forget it just like we forgot the dream about mrs gartin i didnt forget that dream heather said solemnly i just told you i did but you dont have it any more no she ate cornflakes and before she could bring the subject back to rinker davis said im supposed to see your father this afternoon heather looked up from the cornflakes is he going to come to see me not this afternoon i dont think this is business but ill tell him youd like it if he came over okay do you think hell come and the talk went that way all the way to school davis looked for trailing cars looked for short women with red hair looked for those small competent hands but she didnt see anybody exactly like that and heather never mentioned the bad lady not once all the way to school mrs gartins school took children from three to six and taught them letters and numbers and shapes and colors music and phonics for the older children mrs gartin and her two associates tried to keep the little boys from beating each other and victimizing the little girls and encourage the little girls to socialize at the back of the big kids room mrs gartin never even saw it any more just another blob in the background was officer friendlys fullsize standup cut out sponsored by logans rendering co officer friendlys telephone number was on the front of the poster officer friendly had visited the school and talked to them about being careful about bad men and women and how the police were there to help children he left behind the cutout heather saw his picture every day and this day summoning all her intentness of purpose she went into mrs romans cubbyhole when the rest of the class followed mrs roman out to recess and called the number shed called her mom several times and knew about dialing nine officer friendly whose real name was dick ennis was something of a drunk not an alcoholic he said alcoholics go to meetings and was late to work more than half the time not that anybody cared and mostly when he was sober he was a pretty good officer friendly for one thing he liked kids and had several of his own by two exwives for another hed been a decent street cop in any case hed just arrived at his office put his sack lunch in his desk drawer and had turned to go for coffee when the phone rang he dropped into his chair and picked it up heather said is this officer friendly and ennis said yes it is can i help you he thought the little girl on the other end of the line might be five years old yes a bad lady came to my house and scared my mom and me uhhuh who is this what is your name this is heather davis my phone number is smart kid ennis thought as he scribbled down the number okay heather how did the bad lady scare your mom and you she had a gun and she had a mask that she pulled down over her face and she said if we told anybody she would come and kill us and she shooted a picture of my mom and now my mom is scared to tell anybody ennis sat up his forehead wrinkled when did this happen last night when it was dark nobody called a policeman no some policeman came to see us but they went away then this lady came and told us not to talk to any more policeman ever some policemen came to see you do you remember who they were one was a man and one was a woman the girl said do you remember their names either one yes could you tell me what they were his own small children had taught him patience one was named mr davenport and one was named miss sherrill jesus christ officer friendly said chapter nineteen sherrill was still asleep when lucas called we maybe got a break he said she picked up the intensity in his voice heard the traffic in the background he was on a cell phone she sat up rubbing sleep from her eyes with the heel of her hand what happened that little kid called in heather davis she called officer friendly you know the guy whatshisname ennis yeah she says the shooter was at their apartment last night and warned her mother not to talk to us she told them if they did talk to us shed come back and kill them both sherrill hopped out of bed and started for the bathroom trailed by a twenty foot coil of white phone wire what time was that nine or a little after just dark then it wasnt carmel sherrill said we got her coming out of her building around eightthirty followed her to the swan and watched her dance the night away you did that tracked her yeah me and tom you sound surprised she lifted the toilet seat and sat down i wasnt sure you were going to the way we left it yesterday lucas said seemed like a long shot sherrill lost the rest of what lucas was saying suddenly falling off into a mental movie of the previous night she came back when lucas asked marcy are you still there lucas goddamnit i think we might have seen the shooter last night coming out of carmels building what he didnt believe it honest to god she told him about the redhead whod left as hale allen was going in in her minds eye she could see the woman brushing past hale giving him the onceover then stepping outside on the walk and looking up and down the street could you identify her she thought about it for less than a second i dont think so i wasnt paying attention to her i mean theres a good chance its not even her but still she was a shorter woman a small woman but in pretty good shape like a gymnast like baily said and she had big red hair that was her id bet you a hundred bucks it was her lucas said weve gotta throw a net around the building and weve got to get something on carmels phones find somebody wholl sign a warrant to tap them where are you are you at daviss house no im in my car heading for the kids school shes still there ill be there in five ill get dressed and head out the inside cop the tipster called carmel just as lucas and sherrill were breaking off their conversation youre in the clear he said he didnt bother to identify himself what happened im not sure exactly but the rumor is this little kid called in and said that the shooter was back at her house last night and her mother was afraid to talk about it and the rumor is you were being tracked and they know it cant be you because you were out dancing at some fancy place ill tell you what davenport went running out of here like a fullback i mean he was runnin jesus they were following me she was shocked she hadnt felt it shed always thought shed be able to feel it maybe because of hale his closeness all over you i guess the cop said a good thing because youre in the clear why didnt you call me before when you heard they were putting the tail on me after a pause the cop said you know i cant do that carmel promised another payment rang off and dialed rinker and it was the kid who called the cops carmel said as she finished relating the cops tip jesus i never thought about that rinker said shes so small but it works out carmel said excitedly you found out that there really was nothing coming out of them and even if the cops force the mother to talk this time what can she give them and now the cops know i wasnt there they just stepped all over their own case all you have to do is disappear and were cool bout time rinker said although carmel said pensively we still dont know why they were messing with me to begin with let it go rinker said im getting out of here if i move now i can be through kc before the rush hour dont go yet carmel said hang around for a day or two if theyre following me you cant come around here but just hang around you think yeah just overnight to see what happens to see if we need to settle anything else see if the kid and her mom keep their mouths shut see if anything comes of that all right rinker said reluctantly minneapolis seemed more and more like a tarbaby she was anxious to get out one more night lucas arrived at mrs gartins school a little after ten oclock in the morning he parked on the street down the block and walked back under lowhanging maple trees a light summer breeze had popped up and a patch of yellow coneflowers bobbed their bright heads and brown eyes at him from the school garden behind the garden and behind a low wooden fence he could see a playground for small kids with tractortire sandboxes and a gentle tubeslide mrs gartin was a heavy woman in a print dress with small jowls and smile lines she was surprised to see him heather called you yes its important that i talk to her right away i should call her mother her mother may be in some danger which is why i have to talk to her right away he let a little cop show through his polite smile if you could take me to her well i she spasmodically shuffled some papers on her desk cleared her throat and said shes down in mrs romans room heather sat in mrs romans office with lucas and told the story lucas took her over it twice and when they finished had no doubt that she was telling precisely the truth sherrill arrived just before they finished with the second runthrough and davis arrived two minutes later she was panicstricken what are you doing she screamed what are you doing with my daughteryou have no right to talk to my daughter yes we do lucas said as gently as he could but it didnt come off well and davis grabbed heathers arm and would have been out the door if sherrill hadnt been blocking it you cant leave sherrill said heather began to cry and said i only told them ill call a lawyer davis shrilled you can call anyone you want to but life would be simpler for all of us including you if we talked about this for a few minutes lucas said shes going to kill us she said she would kill us shes not going to hurt anyone lucas said you werent there davis snapped she said she was going to kill us and she meant it frankly im not nearly as impressed with you and your cops as i am with her we will put you where she cant find you shes with the mafia davis screamed they can find anybody lucas shook his head and sherrill said listen quiet down whatevers happened has already happened we need to ask you a few questions and then we need to arrange things so youre absolutely safe thats impossible now davis said the anger was still closer to the surface than the fear but now the fear was bubbling up too no its not not at all we have experts in it sherrill said you know why you dont hear about the mafia killing cops because theyre afraid to just think about that when davis had calmed down not before a few nasty moments with mrs gartin who made an illtimed appearance with a box of ginger snaps they took her through rinkers assault heather sat on her mothers knee during the talk and davis even showed a small tremulous smile when told about how her daughter called officer friendly one solid piece of information came out i could see the ends of her hair and id swear that it was a wig there was just something unhairlike about it and i could see her hands and i saw her face when she first came to the door and she just wasnt that real fair complexion that redheads have but you couldnt describe her face no you know she had this box and i looked at the box do you still have the box no i threw it away she said its in the dumpster behind the apartment its a fedex box was she wearing gloves oh yeah i can remember that they were disposable plastic gloves like dentists use oh yeah the gloves impressed her a professional killer after all when they were finished lucas said i cant see you being called as a witness your information helps us a lot in some ways but its not something that wed use in court i wont testify davis said i mean i wont so lets talk about what you want to do now sherrill said what davis wanted to do was to pretend that nothing had happened could she know about this that we talked to you uh word leaks out of police stations from time to time lucas said carefully thinking about carmels sources is there any possibility that you could take off for a couple of weeks or a month ive got a job ive got to go to at the u she said i gotta eat i can fix that lucas said i can probably fix a paid leave and if i cant we can find some money in city funds to make up what you lose do you have some folks davis shook her head i dont want to go there you know what if you can do it ive got a laptop i could do a lot of work on my thesis if i could get somewhere quiet just heather and me when i was still with howard we stayed at these townhouses up on the north shore they were really nice we can do that said lucas he turned to sherrill call bretano down in sex get her going on this he turned back to davis well hook you up with alice bretano she works with abused mothers and kids and knows about hiding them and getting money and so on shell take care of the whole thing and youre sure they wont find us davis asked doubtfully they wont even bother to look lucas said theres just no percentage in it when she didnt appear convinced lucas said let me tell you about the mafia theyre a bunch of guys who are willing to hurt people for money and they hustle dope and prostitutes and they loanshark and all of that but theyre just a bunch of guys they dont have any big intelligence service and they dont back each other up like they say they do theyre just sort of aaa his eyes went to heather who was looking up at him with big eyes jerks but i wont lie to you this one woman the one you saw last night is somebody to be afraid of but were gonna get her and were not going to give her any reason to hurt you if she didnt hurt you last night shes not going to sherrill called bretano in sex explained the problem and bretano said shed handle the whole thing she could be at the school in ten minutes outside while they waited leaning against lucas porsche sherrill asked now what we got two things out of that for sure we know shes a redhead or at least wearing a red wig and that shes a small woman in good shape which means that you probably saw her last night so now we crank everything up we put a twenty fourhour watch on carmels building and if we get her inside we take her this woman on what on nothing on bullshit on assaulting a police officer resisting arrest anything but i want her picked up and identified nailed down i want to know where she comes from i want mug shots of her so we can paper the country with them if she gets out and then runs that means youre gonna be living outside carmels building we maybe see if we can find a place an apartment or an empty office where you can watch from im out of the investigation sherrill asked a little bit out but if we nail this woman quick youre gonna be the one to do it whatre you gonna do first thing im gonna get some guys and im gonna knock on every door for two blocks around davis apartment there are people on the streets there at night somebody mustve seen this woman whoever she is lucas got a halfdozen uniformed cops walking the neighborhood he hated the job himself and wasnt good at it the good ones had open irish or scandinavian faces young guys who looked like they might slap you on the back women who might enjoy the odd bit of gossip empathizers lucas and bretano had brought davis and her daughter back to the apartment and waited while they packed when they left davis gave the keys to lucas use the phone or the toilet if you have to ill pick them up when we get back having the cops around had restored some confidence but she still wanted to get out of town and in a hurry lucas used the apartment as a temporary headquarters while the uniformed cops worked the neighborhood moving back and forth visiting and revisiting homes waiting for people to get home from work sorting bullshit from egg cremes a little after three oclock a cop named lane wandered into the apartment carrying a pepsi and sat down in a kitchen chair lucas was at the kitchen table just getting off the phone what he asked lane leaned back took a hit on the pepsi ive been trying to get a break into plainclothes for moren a fucking year now and i cant get it done i thought i saw you in plainclothes yeah yeah that was just the drug guys looking for a fresh face after a few weeks my face wasnt fresh and i was back sitting in a squad what im saying is you gotta help get me outa this fuckin uniform lucas shrugged i dont know you very well you know i dont know what youd bring to the job especially i was the guy who found that in the mcdonald case last fall you remember i mean there was luck involved but im a lucky guy i pushed it and we rang the bell lucas nodded i remember and being a lucky guy is pretty critical i know but i keep getting this bullshit about being good on the streets and all that how they dont want to lose me off patrol but i dont want to be on patrol and theyre gonna lose me anyway if they dont move me ill go someplace else this is the only place to work in the state lucas said then he tried to put him off anyway you know let me ask around lane cracked a grin i really didnt come in here to make a speech about getting off patrol but i thought id take the opportunity especially since i look so good right now lucas eyebrows went up oh yeah yeah i was down the street at theres a mrs rann gloria rann she got home at about ninefifteen last night she knows because she caught the bus at university and cretin when she got off work at nine and it takes ten minutes to get home and she was hurrying because she had a show she wanted to watch at ninethirty she just had time to put the garbage out before the show started she sees a small athletic woman getting into what she thinks might have been a green car parked on the street right on the curb at her house she couldnt see the womans face but she thought she might be a college kid because she looked athletic and because the neighborhood has a lot of college kids around and she had big hair lucas leaned forward thatd be right lane said yeah she fits the profile you gave us anyway i ask mrs rann if shed ever seen the car before and she said no it wasnt from around here and i say how do you know that and she says because when she was walking home from the bus it was still a little light and she looked at the car because it was parked right in front of her house he paused for dramatic effect and lucas said what it had an avis sticker on it it was a rental car sonofabitch lucas said he took lane with him to the airport tracked down the avis manager who was out at the return area and brought him back to the main officethe manager didnt need a search warrant he said let me run a list for you but i can tell you right now its gonna be eighty to ninety percent guys probably wont be more than ten or fifteen women midsized green car athleticlooking woman small lane said maybe a redhead the managers hands were hovering over the computer keyboard but he stopped turned to lane and frowned small and athletic redhead nice uh figure thats what we understand lucas said could it have been a champagne dodge instead of green because i swear to god a woman who looks like that returned a champagne dodge up at the checkin not more than fifteen minutes ago shes gotta be in the airport lucas snapped where do i find the head guy for airport security a fat young man named herter had handled the return and remembered the woman well lucas and lane spent two hours trolling herter and the manager through the airport gates looking for rinkers face nothing a lot of small athletic women a few of them redheads but no killer the checkin record showed the car in without damage and a full tank of gas twenty minutes before lucas and lane arrived at the avis desk herter said the woman had headed for the main terminal but had been carrying only a small bag like an overnight case there were no security cameras that might have recorded her face at least not on the immediate route into the terminal she might still be here in town lucas told lane and tom black whod come out to help with the hunt the fbi thinks she drives to wherever shes going it would make sense for her to drop her car in the airport garage where there are thousands of cars going in and out all day and then renting a car to do the hit with then if theres any problem she can ditch the car and there wont be any record attached to it we should know about the record any time black said the nebraska cops are running down the address if its her theyre not gonna find anything lucas said but ill tell you what weve got to get to the mastercard acceptance people who clear charges and theyve got to tell us instantly if she makes any more charges he looked at lane you think you could set that up yeah then go do it and get out of the uniform before you start talking to people all right he took off running black said the crimescene guys gotta be done by now if its her there wont be anything and the crimescene guy said i wouldnt hold my breath on these prints i mean we got prints off the passenger side and outa the back seat but we got nothing from the steering wheel from the outside door handle from the inside handle from the radio knobs from the seat theyd all been wiped wiped clean by somebody who worked at it goddamnit lucas said five minutes later a detective from lincoln nebraska called and said theres a street like that and theres an address like that and theres even a woman with that name but shes fortyeight years old shes got nine ferrets that she never leaves shes got black hair and id say she goes about twoten on the bathroom scales she says shes never been to minneapolis and never rented a car and shes got a visa and a sears card and a gas card but no mastercard the shooters outa here lucas said to black after he got off the line with the nebraska cop she might still be in the cities or on her way home but were wasting our time out here except we got a decent picture of her black said weve got two guys who saw her close up and not all that long ago well have a composite photo of her in an hour theres that lucas said he held up his thumb and forefinger a halfinch apart but goddamn we were this close this close so now what so now we paper the town with her picture if shes still here maybe we can shake her out chapter twenty carmel called rinker at the hotel and said without preface or identification get out of there now your pictures on tv what rinkers heart started thumping and she looked wildly around the room looking for clothes looking for anything with prints ready to sprint davenports got a composite photograph of you and its on tv theyre going to show it again on channel three in about one minute hang on rinker picked up the tv remote and brought up channel three a talking head a serious brunette who looked like a former miss america was saying an avis rental car at the airport two avis personnel whose identities are being withheld provided police with a composite photograph shown here if you have seen this woman rinker looked at the picture for a moment then told carmel that doesnt look like me to you it might not look like you but to me it does in a general way carmel replied and theyll be taking it around to hotels and motels and every thing else asking for anybody who fits the general description rinker nodded at the phone all right im outa here in fifteen minutes go on down to iowa carmel said des moines they dont get the cities tv stations there and you can be back here in three hours if you need to be give me a call on this phone when you get there give me a number whatre we going to do we have to go to plan b somehow hes onto us i dont know how but hes working something ah man can you handle it i can handle it carmel said grimly now get out of there im gone two detectives swanson and franklin responded to a tip from a bellhop at the regencywhite and took the composite photograph to the manager who shook his head i dont know the lady but i only see a fraction of the people who come through could we find out how many single woman are in the hotel and go from there franklin suggested then maybe we could talk to the room maids mostve them have gone home already the manager said he had a small mustache but otherwise franklin thought looked a lot like peewee in peewees big adventure i can get the room service people and the bellhops between the available desk people they narrowed it to four women two who more or less fit the composite and two who nobody could remember seeing the bellhop who everybody called louis didnt know what room she was in but swore she fit the picture thats her he told swanson swanson called lucas and told him they had a possible id wait for me lucas said they waited working through people on the restaurant staff two of them had seen the woman they thought but then maybe not the picture wasnt that good was it lucas arrived on the run left the porsche at the curb and said if a cop comes along tell him it belongs to chief davenport he told the doorman right chief the doorman said and saluted just like new york or something franklin met him in the lobby and said were ready to go up any more ids on her lucas asked couple of possibles but they say they cant quite tell from the photo yeah but its the best weve got lucas said he studied the picture for a few seconds with the same strange feeling of deja vu that hed experienced when hed first seen it he felt that he knew the woman because he thought she was a perfect type a cheerleader cute busty athletic he knew a hundred women just like her hell there were twenty just like her on the police force sherrill was just like her take away the black hair michelle jones the manager muttered tapping on a door just a minute a womans voice called the three cops took a step back leaving the manager looking quizzically at them then he realized that the woman might come out shooting and started to take a step back then the door opened just two inches and michelle jones looked out she was black sorry wrong room swanson said were checking a security problem there was no answer at the next room lucas nodded at the manager who used his key and stepped hastily away swanson turned the door knob and they went in christ it looks like somebody was beaten to death franklin said clothing was strewn around the room and across the bed two pair of panty hose apparently damp hung from a door and a wool sweater lay on the rug drying on top of a bath towel two suitcases both open on the floor looked like theyd been rifled by a fastmoving thief nah it just look like my wifes been here swanson said this is just a fuckin woman the manager crooked his head out from behind the protective bulk of franklin i think the gentleman is right he said single women and you should see what they put in the toilets womenll put anything in a toilet we once had a woman whose dog died and she tried to flush it down the toilet small dog franklin asked well yeah the managers eyes seemed to cross i mean nobodyd try to flush a german shepherd the third room was also empty but very empty no sign of a presence other then the disturbed covers on the bed youre sure theres supposed to be somebody in here lucas asked oh yeah the manager said looking around in disgust she skipped i know what that feels like shes skipped then this is her lucas said lets get the crime scene guys in here four hundred bucks the manager said yeah well dont touch anything franklin growled franklin and swanson went to the last room on the list while lucas looked around the empty room and a moment later franklin came back better have a look at this chick this one fit too a cheerleader with the blonde hair blue eyes good shape a little busty and again lucas had the sense of deja vu do i know you he asked no the woman said a little angry and a little more scared who are you im a deputy chief of police lucas said where are you from from seattle lucas spotted a wedding ring and youre married yes and id like to know what are you doing here are you in town on business whats going on she demanded the fear fading and the anger growing just tell me lucas said patiently are you here on business yes im here for the perio convention at the radisson whats a perio franklin asked he was a very large black man in a yellow plaid sport coat and he loomed in the doorway like a dark moon a periodontist im a dentist she said thanks lucas said he glanced at franklin and shook his head and said to the woman weve got a situation here which detective franklin will explain to you outside in the hall swanson said to lucas a gum gardener a what a gum gardener thats what periodontists are called by other dentists yeah ill treasure that piece of information lucas went back to the empty room to wait for the crimescene crew he wanted only one piece of information that the china handles on the bathroom fixtures had been wiped if theyd been wiped this was the room and they were too late franklin went off to check on the last room again then the two crimescene guys arrived and lucas told them what he wanted to know one of them stepped into the bathroom looked at the china handles on the sink took what looked like a perfume bottle out of his briefcase and sprayed a steelcolored dust on the handles then he stuck his head in the sink so he could get a closer look when he emerged he said wiped slick as a whistle goddamn it i knew it lucas said franklin returned last lady came in from that room that was all torn up shes fifty and shed got a dog a small one i offered to flush it for her but she said no okay lucas said to the crimescene guys she probably wiped the place down but i want you to dust everything anything we get look at this the second crime scene guy said he was emerging from the shower and he was holding a small hotelsized bar of soap what lucas asked i think she forgot to wipe the soap she forgot to wipe the what mallard asked the soap lucas said a bar of soap you cant leave prints on a bar of soap wet soap well you can one way lucas said if the soap squirts out of your hand and you leave it on the floor and then get out and dry yourself and remember the soap and pick it up and put it back in the soap dish then you can leave prints at least thats what we think one corner of the soap was squared off and cracked like itd been dropped the hard part was getting the soap back to the office without screwing up the prints that was a goddamned nightmare howre you processing it we put it in a refrigerator down in identification you put it in what lucas was irritated do we have a bad connection or something i can hear you perfectly whyd you put it in the goddamn refrigerator mallard asked he was getting loud for a guy who looked like an accountant even with the thick neck we figure if we can harden it up enough we can dust it and pick up the prints lucas said i mean we can see them were just scared to death of doing anything to them if you blow on them they could fade ah jesus im gonna call the fingerprint guys here and get them in touch with your guys mallard said maybe we can help did you get the composite lucas asked yeah were running it against all former suspects anybody whos ever been around one of these cases what ever happened to the guy in wichita is he still peddling dope little asshole mallard said weve still got a watch on him i still got malone out there with the team but shes bitching thirtysix hours a day about getting back and if you know the suspect was in minneapolis and we know lopez wasnt then ill call her off she was here the shooter was lucas said then ill tell malone to wrap it up still cant believe its a woman anyway im gonna drag the files over to witness protection and have a talk with them we got enough on their boy out there to send him away for three hundred years just because lopez didnt pan out doesnt mean that some kind of wichita connection isnt good lucas said i know that and if youve got any suggestions id be happy to have malone look into them itll take her a couple of days to wrap things up ive got nothing not at the moment lucas said and look have your guys call our id guys right now im scared to death about whats gonna happen when we take that bar of soap out of the crisper the what mallard asked the crisper you know where you keep the lettuce and radishes and dont tell me please just dont tell me a guy named manual found lucas in the homicide office talking to sloan and said were gonna try to take the prints ah lucas and sloan both got up and headed down to id in the identification section they found four people standing around a hippie with shoulderlength hair and a dangly silver earring he appeared to be about sixteen and was holding a nikon f camera with a weird lens the bar of soap sat on a tupperware lid on the desk whats going on lucas asked looking at the hippie dont touch me the kid said if anything falls on the soap spit or anything its all over he was looking down at the soap through the camera which he held no more than a foot above the bar hes my kid a cop named harry muttered to lucas great photographer that theres what you call your basic ringlight there on the end of the lens its really a flash and hes looking right down on the prints with half the ringlight turned off so hell get some shadow shut up the kid said everybody shut up and lucas was about to open his mouth and ask if he knew what he was doing when the flash went then again the kid shot twentyfour pictures in five minutes using the ringlight then no ringlight and finally with reflected light from a sheet of tinfoil when he was done he looked at lucas and said i could see them pretty good three prints a little smudged but coming right up at me you think you got them if i can see them i got them the kid said im gonna run this over to a one hour slide processor by rosedale itd help if you could call them and tell them to put me at the front of the line you did slides yeah i get a lot better resolution that way when i scan them lucas must have looked puzzled the kid added i assumed you wanted a digital file we can phone it to the fbi and they can start the search lucas turned to sloan go find somebody to run this kid over to rosedale in a squad lights and sirens tell the picture people to start running the film as soon as he gets there we want it he turned back to the kid ill sign you up for a consultants fee ill give the forms to your dad if the pictures come out the kid left with sloan and harriet ashler the chief fingerprintspecialist said all right back in the fridge for a minute just to firm things up she put the soap back in the fridge and they all stood around looking at the refrigerator for three minutes it was a small brown office model from sears with two lunch sacks and an aging apple on one shelf and a bottle of cranapple juice in the door and then she took it back out and touched an unmarked piece of it still nice and hard she said lets try it the technique which they agreed upon with the fbi was to blow a light dry graphite dust across the prints then try to softly pick up the dust with a piece of magic mending tape ashler sprayed dust on the smallest leastclear print then squatted next to the bar of soap tape somebody handed her the roll of magic mending tape she gently lowered a loop of the tape across the first print let it rest on the carbon particles for a moment then lifted it shoot she said squinting at the tape she picked up a magnifying glass and looked again what happened no print she said she looked back at the soap it just sorta pulled little tiny pieces of the soap away its totally wrecked all right stop lucas said lets get it back in the fridge and talk to the feebs again maybe we ought to do some experiments on another bar of soap with our own fingerprints before we try again ashler nodded thatd be best but i thought we needed it in a hurry maybe not if harrys genius kid came through harrys genius kid came through sloan had personally taken him to the roseville store because sloan liked to drive fast in city cars with lights and sirens and they were back in less than an hour four of them are pretty good the kid said if mr sloan can take me back to my place ill scan them in and we can ship them over to the fbi lucas was looking at the slides holding them up to a fluorescent light they didnt look like much but they looked better than other prints hed seen they looked better than what hed been able to see with the naked eye harry he said to the kids father your kid is a fuckin genius rinker got to des moines a little after five oclock in the afternoon checked into a holiday inn and called carmel on the cell phone more bad news carmel said my guy in the police department says theyve got your fingerprints i wiped everything rinker said but she could feel the uncertainty in her own voice he says they took them off a bar of soap they found in a room at the regency white carmel said davenports guys a bar of soap yeah he said they were sending them to the fbi ill call you back rinker said she remembered picking up the soap she hadnt thought to wipe it she rang off before carmel could protest and sat quietly on the bed pulling herself together for a moment despite her selfcontrol a tear trickled down her cheek that fuckin davenport she took three deep breaths exhaled then punched nine numbers into the phone this is rinker she said when the man answered i gotta pull the plug after a long silence the man said youre sure its the minneapolis deal theyve been to my place even if they dont know it but theyre sniffing around wichita theyve got a bad picture of me but its a picture one of those computer deals now i think they might have my fingerprints how could this happen disbelief in his voice you wouldnt believe it but you tell wooden head to get out to wichita with the money im gonna clean out the bank there go to my bottomline id im shredding everything else and ill leave him the papers he can take the bar and find a new manager but my printsll be all over the place he should try to wipe everything he can but i dont think hell get everything what about your apartment im gonna try to get in and out quick she said ill check the place first i didnt think anybody had your prints they dont ive never been printed thats the good news but theyve been getting too close and sooner or later they just might put things together i cant take the chance all right jeez clara yeah yeah yeah ill get back in touch when i can where are you now minneapolis ill be leaving here in a couple of hours ive got some cleaning up to do but if i drive straight through the night i ought to be in wichita by the time the banks open when she finished she called carmel back im closing down my life she said ill just be a figment of your imagination by this time tomorrow you mean youre giving up the bar everything rinker said now listen do you still think we go for plan b well if you got caught or if theres something more on me i mean thatd settle things all right ive got to run to wichita ill see you tomorrow night probably she made two calls to the airport then called a cab she left her car and luggage at the holiday inn but took her guns the cab dropped her at shack direct air where a laconic pilot who looked far too young to be allowed in airplanes was waiting in the pilots lounge reading the wall street journal you miss maxwell yes i was supposed to get some money she took two thousand dollars out of her purse and handed it to him were outa here he said she arrived in wichita a few minutes before midnight took a cab straight to the bar said hey johnny to the bartender who said youre back and she said yeah but im running see you tomorrow heavy date something like that im taking the van so dont worry about it okay from the back room she got a dozen liquor boxes and the keys for the bars van a big practical dodge on the way back to her apartment she stopped at a convenience store bought a package of plastic garbage bags and hauled them with the liquor boxes back to her apartment she lived on the second floor and carried the boxes up in three trips four at a time and tossed them into the kitchen after the third trip she shut the door behind her and started packing tried not to think about it just packed she packed a sock bunny that her mother had made her when her mother was still functioning as a human being before her stepdad had beaten the liveliness out of her shed gotten the bunny for christmas when she was six it was the single oldest thing she possessed she packed the photographs taken with other dancers at two or three bars around st louis with people at the booze warehouse where shed worked after the dancing ended she packed the first twodollar bill that the bar had taken in theyd saved the first twodollar bill because theyd forgotten to save the first dollar she packed shed lived in the place for six years and it had been as much a home to her as anything shed ever had and it took a while she hummed while she packed hummed like an angry bumble bee that fuckin davenport she said that fuckin davenport when shed packed everything important to her including her school books and papers she realized that she couldnt pack everything that was important to her she couldnt pack the place she sat on the bed and smoothed the sheet and went once more through the chest of drawers where even the tired cotton underwear suddenly seemed important that fuckin davenport and this time she cried let it go couldnt stop it ten minutes later eyes red she was wiping the place with lysol by threethirty in the morning she was finished if the cops really took the place apart they might find a print or two but itd take weeks she took the last of the boxes down to the van moved the van down the street then went back to the apartment her apartment was at the end of a hall and when shed first moved in shed made a small change shed placed a wireless movement alarm which she bought at wards just above the window at the end of the hall the alarm when tripped set off a buzzer or a strobe on a small console next to her bed she chose strobe put the console next to her face placed her guns on the floor next to her bed and let herself slip into a fitful sleep she hadnt thought that the man in st louis would ever harm her she had almost that much faith in him but not quite that much shed told him she hoped to be in wichita by the time the banks opened if he were going to make a move against her probably using one or the other muscle heads that always seemed to be around the guy most likely would be waiting at her apartment waiting for her to open the bank and then come back coming from st louis even by air would put him in wichita at least a few hours later than her hed have to be found and an airplane would have to be rounded up or hed have to get in his car and drive if he was coming she really wouldnt expect him before six oclock or so he was better than that he arrived at five she thought she actually woke a minute before the alarm went whatever she sat up with the strobe flashing in her face she hit the obutton and looked at the clock five minutes after five she got to her feet picked up both guns cocked them and headed for the kitchen moving slowly careful not to bump anything to set off a vibration absolutely silent in her bare feet she was still wearing the thin rubber gloves hot and tacky on her hands the gloves were ivorycolored and she could see them better than she could see her arms like two disembodied fists floating though the dark whoever was in the hall had hesitated at the door she moved past it and stepped into a closet with sliding doors the left door was half open and she moved behind it where she could still see through the open panel then the man outside knocked and called her voice quietly clara clara another soft knock then a key he had a key which meant the man in st louis must have copied hers stupid she just left her keys laying around the keys to everything she worried that there were more security lapses that shed never known about then she pushed the worry out of her head and focused on the weight of her guns the door opened a darkening shadow then the man stepped inside she was less than two feet away and he stepped inside far enough that she could see that he was carrying something in his right hand from the way he was carrying it it had to be a gun she lifted her own gun ready to fire when the man whispered the softest breath easy she thought he was talking to her and almost blurted something out when she heard more soft movement and the man she could see wasnt moving there were two of them the first moved down the hall toward her bedroom while the second moved quietly across the living room to the second bedroom which rinker used as a tv room and home office after a long minute of silence the man down the hall came back stepped toward the second bedroom and the second man stepped out of the second bedroom not here yet he said quietly then we wait until wooden head calls said the first man in the dark yeah in case she comes im dead on my ass the further man said i get the couch if thats a couch the second man lay down on the couch the first sat in an easy chair lit a cigarette rinker never allowed cigarettes in her house the second man said from the couch what if she smells that smoke the smoker said shit and dropped the cigarette butt on the hardwood floor and ground it out with his foot shed sanded the floors herself and sealed them the mans action almost moved rinker but not quite you seen this chick one man asked once i think gotta nice rack the guy seemed kind of scared of her you know like he was all that get her quick dont give her a shot never seen a chick who could take me said the second man in fact if this is the same chick im thinking about i wouldnt mind fuckin her first dont think that way if the guys nervous we dont want to be fuckin around yeah yeah now shut up im gonna get some sleep listen for the shots the second man said then youll know she got here five minutes later rinker heard the first tentative snore from the man on the couch the man on the chair sat unmoving as far as she could tell they were like that for another five minutes the man on the couch breathing deeper snoring more regularly then the man on the couch stood up lit a cigarette and started toward her she withdrew just an inch into the deeper darkness of the closet when he brushed by a shoulder width away she stepped sideways then out of the closet in a dancestep her left pistol arm coming up he never heard her saw her or suspected her she fired a doubletap into the back of his head and took three quick steps to the couch the man on the couch snorted when the first man hit the floor and may have been about to wake up rinker fired two more shots into his forehead lights she got the lights on the man on the floor was bleeding but the blood was running out on vinyl she could get that the other one wasnt bleeding much just two small bubbles of blood over his brow ridges slugs never exited shed have to hurry she thought the sky outside seemed brighter the summer dawn was not far away she ran to the kitchen got a roll of duct tape and taped the wounds on the mens heads stop the bleeding leave no more traces than she had to the back window overlooking the communal dumpster would open wide enough she thought and the screen would swing free she dragged the man on the couch to the window opened it laboriously shoved him into the window hole took a last look around and pushed him out he hit the tarmac below with a dull sloppy whock the second guy the one on the vinyl was smaller and she moved him more easily over the sill out the window the impact broken by the man already on the ground was softer with the two men outside she hurried quietly as she could down to the van backed it up to the dumpster and dragged the two bodies into the back she was tired the bigger of the two guys probably went twoten maybe two twenty he was a lot of work she sat for a moment in the van catching her breath and then started out ten minutes later she was in the countryside fifteen minutes after the dumpster she was crawling down a onelane track next to a creek she remembered the place from a country ramble earlier in the year she remembered the unfenced cornfield that bordered on the track the dawn was coming as she dragged the men through a patch of weeds ten rows back into the corn with any luck they wouldnt be found until october when the corn was picked before she left she took their wallets pocketed the money a little over a thousand total and their drivers licenses on the way back to town she fed the miscellaneous paper in the wallets out the window little anonymous scraps every couple hundred yards or so in town she stopped at trash can and dumped the two empty wallets themselves done back to the apartment up the stairs a little after six oclock in the morning a little less than three hours before the banks opened shed spend it she decided wiping the place again every coat hanger every coke can every can and bottle in the cupboards and refrigerator at the end she wrote two notes the first a note to the landlord sorry to do this to you larry to skip out on the lease but youve got the last months rent and im sure you can move the place in a hurry ive got bad personal problems with my ex if the asshole does find me hes gonna kill me and i gotta get out of here you can have the furniture and everything else in the place instead of the rent sorry again and have a good life clara the landlord was greedy enough that hed be moving the furniture out ten minutes after he got the note if he could move somebody else in in a hurry shed have that much less to worry about involving fingerprints the second note she put in an envelope which she sealed she scrawled the st louis guys name on it and under that wrote private the bank took five minutes in a private booth she spent most of the time wiping the box much of the rest of the time putting one hundred and eighty thousand dollars in a brown paper bag she also collected a brown cardboard folder that held her best bottomline lastchance id credit cards a missouri drivers license a passport and uptodate plates and registration for her car and a deed the deed sold the rink to james larimore wooden head for a fair price six years ago when shed bought the place and then two months later sold it to wooden head the sale had been a technical one though witnessed by all the proper authorities until wooden head had the deed in his hands rinker was the owner now he would get it and he was getting a deal wooden head was waiting at the bar in the back he had a head the size of a regulation nba basketball but squared a bit and small delicate features and tight dry eyes all squeezed into the middle of his face he brought a briefcase with him what weve got to do is this rinker told him you gotta take a walk so you dont see it then im gonna get a bottle of lysol and wipe everything in the office and up and down the stairs ill take everything out of the files that you need and well run it through the xerox machine probably no more than fifty or sixty pieces i dont want any prints left behind when do you want me back give me an hour itd be best if you just sat across the street in the doughnut place read the papers for while then i could find you if i need you okay you guys are getting a deal rinker said and here you can read this while youre eatin the doughnuts she handed him the deed this place is worth four if its worth a dime you might get fourandahalf were taking a risk he grunted covering for ya a lot less risk if you keep wiping the place

living ive got an idea then youll take me seriously when i tell you this if this moneys not clean ill come for you and she was gone wooden head walked out to the main bar and watched through the

dumped them wiped the van and left it at the airport the pilot looking a little sleepy was sitting in the charter lounge reading a old copy of fortune he spotted her helped her carry her three oversized suitcases to the plane and had rinker back in des moines by midafternoon can i give you a ride anywhere he asked when they were on the ground thanks thatd be nice im going to a holiday inn he made a mild pass at her on the way she was nice about saying no he left her at the motel where she checked out picked up her car and found a store that sold wigs my mama is getting chemotherapy and her hair is starting to fall out i need to get a wig for her she told the sole saleswoman the saleswoman looked sad im sorry about your mother she said in a kindly way patting rinkers arm it would be better if she were here though for a fitting well she really cant be rinker said shes almost exactly like me but her head is a little larger maybe we measured and its about a quarterinch bigger round and also shes still got a lot of hair though its starting to come out shed like to get something big enough to fit over what hair shes still got she hopes she wont lose it all does she have a color preference we talked about that and she wants her natural color which is grey rinker said it doesnt have to be a great wig just to get her back and forth from the house to the hospital and then if she loses all of it we can come back and get another one let me show you our autumn sparkle series rinker took an autumn sparkle thanked the kindly saleswoman moved on to a walkin hair salon and walked in an hour later with her hair in a skulltight punk cut and wearing plainglass tortoiseshell glasses she climbed back in her car and headed up i toward minneapolis mallard called lucas that afternoon and gave him the bad news the fingerprint search was coming up dry were gonna change some things around on the computer search but it doesnt look good mallard said tell you the truth id be willing to bet she was never printed damnit lucas said we never quite get her i swear to god we didnt miss her by more than a halfhour at the airport maybe fifteen minutes but were knocking on the door mallard said weve got more on her than we ever hoped for now its just a matter of time late that evening hale allen sat naked on the edge of the bed his damp hair still tousled from the lovemaking and the shower that came afterwards he was examining his toes in the light from the nightstand and clipping his toenails he hummed as he did it and every time the clippers snapped carmel flinched and allen would say something about the clipping aloud but mindlessly to himself got that one he said as a clipping fell on the magazine he was using to catch them theres a good one carmel tried putting her fingers in her ears but it was no use she was about to roll out of bed when the magic cell phone went off in her purse she crawled to the end of the bed reached over the endboard for her purse dug the phone out lay back and punched the talk button im back rinker said where at allen looked at her from his side of the bed and she mouthed sorrybusiness at him he grinned and rolled over toward her pushed her legs apart she let him do it hotel down by the airport dangerous carmel said allen put his head down and nibbled i look different a lot different rinker said not a problem but the question is do we do plan b ive been thinking about that carmel said she ran her hands through allens hair i guess it really wouldnt mean much to you but itd get me off the hook for good but thats good for me rinker said the question is how do i do this by myself i dont know the details of you dont do it by yourself carmel said she pulled gently on allens ear guiding him a little to the left ill help can you get out yeah but im in the middle of something right now i cant really get into the details call me tomorrow morning about ten oclock you with somebody yeah hale allen you got that right carmel said talk to you tomorrow rinker said carmel said to hale come up here you i like it down here it smells like bread she whacked him on the side of the head and he said ow what was that for not very romantic like a loaf of wonder bread or something i was just joking he held his hand to his ear she had hit him a little harder than shed intended she smiled and said okay im sorry come up here and ill make it better sherrill was sitting in her own car alone a block from allens house a radio beeped and she picked it up yeah another light just went on in the living room thank god there might be something left of allen after all the guy on the other end chuckled well take her back home if you want to join the parade ill be two blocks back she dropped the radio picked up her cell phone and dialed lucas number from memory he picked it up on the first ring you up reading she asked without identifying herself yeah i think were about to take carmel home sherrill said this is obscene not a flicker out of her huh not a move nothing damnit lucas we might have lost the chance i know but weve got to hang on for a while lucas said and im getting kind of lonely so am i lucas said but im not going to invite you over i wouldnt come anyway sherrill said good for both of us after a pause sherrill said yeah i guess see you tomorrow ten minutes later carmel came out of the house and walked briskly to her car a little too briskly on a nice night like this a little too headdown sherrill thought of course everything carmel did was slightly theatrical there was no way she could know she was in the net the next day was brutal lucas talked to mallard who had nothing new and checked on the carmel net a halfdozen times and got cranky with everyone carmel talked with rinker twice on the magic cell phone see you at ten fifteen she said carmel went home at six as she usually did called hale allen at sixthirty and told him that shed have to work on the albalah case that night ive got to go back to the office jenkins ruled that the cops can have the tire as evidence and im trying to put together an instant appeal well all right allen said she thought she might have detected just a hair of relief in his voice see you when thursday maybe we could catch lunch tomorrow and ill give you a call tonight talk to you he said carmel got out of her business dress put on a shortsleeved white shirt jeans and tennis shoes and a light red jacket she pushed a black sweatshirt into her briefcase this was july but it was also minnesota she didnt feel like eating but she did and carried the microwave chicken dinner to the window and looked out over the city if they were actually watching her from one of the nearby buildings they should see her when she finished she tossed the tray from the chicken dinner in the garbage went back to her home office disconnected the small digital answering machine from her private line and stuck it in her briefcase with the sweater a little after seven oclock she rode the elevator down and walked out of the front of the building looking at her watch carrying her briefcase she wasnt absolutely sure the cops were there but she thought they were not looking around trying to spot them nearly killed her she walked to her office building enjoying the night used her key to get in the front door signed in with the security guard and rode the elevators up to her office the entire suite was silent with only a few security lights to cut the gloom she turned the lights on in the library and in her office turned on the computer and went to work jenkins the judge in the case she was working had ruled the cops could have a spare tire owned by rashid albalah and unfortunately there was blood on the tire the only good aspect of it was that the cops had had the car and tire for almost a month before the blood was found that theyd often taken it out for test drives once to a strip joint and carmel argued the blood could have been anybodys given the general unreliability of dna tests or even if it did belong to trick bentoin bentoin could have cut himself before he disappeared and simply was not available to testify to the fact she got caught up in the argument moving back and forth from the library to her office and nearly jumped out of her skin when the security guard said hi miz loan oh jesus phil you almost gave me a heart attack she said just making the rounds you gonna be late tonight she could already smell the booze phil was an old geezer but he could drink with the youngest of them probably got a tough one tomorrow well good luck he said and shuffled away toward the entry she heard the door close and the latch snap and looked at her watch twenty minutes time to start moving she got the answering machine out of her briefcase carried it into the library and plugged it into the phone there back in her office she pulled the black sweater over her head she left the computer on and turned on the small optimus stereo system the system played three disks in rotation and would play them until she turned it off she left the red jacket draped over her chair ready the building had a fivestory parking garage carmel stepped out of the suite checked to make sure that the security guard had moved on and then trotted briskly down to the stairwell at the far end of the hall and down seven flights of steps the cops might be watching every entrance and exit to the parking garage but she thought they couldnt be watching all of it of course if they were she was screwed but it was a good bet she thought she poked her head through the door on the fourth floor saw nobody a single empty car a red pontiac sat halfway down the ramp but shed seen it before not a cop she glanced again at her watch one minute she waited it out hearing nothing at all along the concrete corridors of the building and then opened the door again here was the only spot that shed be in the open she walked quickly across the top of the floor and stepped into the corkscrew exitramp she heard a car moving up the entrance ramp had to be pam she thought she listened heard the car turn into the exit spiral and nodded the car started down made the turn toward her a greyhaired old lady was looking through the windshield carmel recoiled then saw the hand waving her forward get in thats you the car stopped just for a half second and carmel jerked open the back door and flopped on the seat pulling the door shut without slamming it get under the blanket rinker said carmel was already doing that rolling onto the floor her head on the drivers side she pulled the blanket over her legs and lower body and lay quietly beneath it the entrances and exits from the building were on opposites sides and even at this time of night there were always a few cars coming and going with any luck at all the cops on the entrance side if there were any wouldnt be calling out the cars coming and going so the cops on the exit side wouldnt notice the odd fact that a greyhaired old lady in a japanese car had gone in one side and come right back out the other she heard rinker lower the drivers side window heard the cashier mutter something and a minute later they were rolling out of the building you can get up on the seat rinker said a minute later but i wouldnt sit up yet let me take a few side streets see if theres anybody back there if there are theres nothing to do but run for it carmel said cheerfully yeah well just stay down for a few minutes anyway rinker didnt know anything about throwing off a following car but shed watched enough cop shows on television to know that they might be both in front of parallel to and behind her she took the car across the washington avenue bridge to eliminate the parallel cars a block the wrong way down an empty one way street to eliminate the forward cars and then quickly along a oneway frontage road in the warehouse district looking for followers she didnt see anybody and that was the best she could do best i can do she told carmel i cant think of anything else carmel said pull over let me get in the front max butry came from a short line of mean cops his father was one and so was max the meanness beaten into him from a tender age you dont stay alive long on the streets unless his father would say following with a lecture about a specific point of manhood in which max was faltering you dont stay alive long on the streets if you hide behind your hands what if some greasers got a shiv huh hell cut your hands right off you gotta come down on those boys and his father would come down on him show you how you beat a guy right into the ground by getting in close and on top of him and fuck all your cherry greaser knives butry carried the attitude onto the force and on this night carried it into the bus station a desk clerk had called to say that two guys were smoking dope in the john and the smog was getting so thick nobody could get in to take a leak by the time butry arrived though the smokers had gone and he turned around and banged back through the door outside three skaters were practicing slides off a planter onto a curb there was nothing illegal about this but butry considered skateboards one symptom of the decline of american civilization and himself by virtue of the badge in his pocket one of the pillars of that civilization they dont gotta respect the man hell they probably dont even know you but they goddamn well gotta respect the badge his father said if they dont respect the badge the country starts caving in look what they got with the niggers down in chicago there are places in chicago where you cant even show the badge or the niggersll carve you up like the christmas turkey and you know how that started it started when the first fuckin nigger saw the badge and didnt show respect and nobody called him on it and from there the word got around and the next thing you know the world caves in you got that huh niggers skateboarders transgender migrants yuppie scum all the same stuff people without respect butry swerved out of line to cross with the skaters one of them the toughestlooking kid maybe sixteen with the baggy pants and the chain billfold and a ballpoint pen tattoo on his forearm saw butry coming and there was no respect at all in the way he looked at him hey dickhead get them boards outa here this is a bus station not a playground butry said and the oldest kid said fuck you asshole butry pulled his badge with one hand and his gun with the other which would have gotten him fired if anybody else had been around to see how early it came out im a fuckin cop wiseass see the badge now sit on the fuckin ground and put your hands over your heads all three of you the smallest of the kids who looked like he might be fourteen and had the bony look of a boy who hadnt eaten right for a month or maybe a few months that lonely hollowcheeked glow of hunger like a personal portrait said fuck you fat boy he pulled up his tshirt to bare his belly and to show off a halfdozen steel rings that pierced the skin around his belly button here you want to shoot me here shoot me asshole butry was fast faster than the kid who may have been slowed by hunger butrys hand lashed out open but heavy as a ham a slap that knocked the boy off his feet on your goddamn knees he screamed on your goddamn at the very last second he began to realize that he was over his head but that very last second was too late the young kid had come back up on the toes of his ragged black tennies and in his hand that pointed toward butrys nose was a pieceofshit twobarrel crow derringer you couldnt as one of the gun magazines noted expect to hit your target at six feet but the gun was only nine inches from butrys face when the kid pulled the trigger and the slug went through the bridge of butrys nose and out the back of his skull his father had forgotten to tell butry that you dont fuck with people who have nothing to lose the three skaters froze in the impact of the blast in the sight of the falling cop then the oldest said run in the harsh semiwhisper of panic and the three scooped their boards and were running across the street through the moving cars like a pack of starving terriers sherrill and black were slumped in her car and sherrill was talking to lucas on her cell phone im starting to feel like a country song she said theres something wrong about not feeling right then their radio burped and and black picked it up and sherrill said to lucas just a minute and then a dispatcher was screaming something about a cop down shot at the bus station three men running away everybody available get to the bus station looking for three youths possibly carrying skateboards and last seen running toward loring park we got a call theres a cop down shot were going sherrill said and to black behind the wheel gogogo and black was already going carmel said listen pam its clara rinker said my name is really clara rinker clara carmel tasted the name for a second i like that clara better than pam anyway you were saying you are looking at this from die wrong point of view people have always been allowed to kill in selfdefense and my dear this is exactly what were doing were trying to defend ourselves davenport has put us in tiiis position and we really dont have much option so what im saying is this i dont understand how you could kill for money and not feel bad about it and now you can feel bad about killing in self defense i think its because i know these people or anyway i know about them rinker said theyre not dirtbags who deserve it theyre just people who are in the way no no no theyre not in the way theyre simply essential to us we could not kill them but that would leave us exposed ill tell you what if you want ill do all the shooting who actually does the shooting is hardly the point if we both cooperate in setting up the killing they werent exactly arguing they were exploring carmel thought rinker clara was feeling some qualms while carmel felt none at all they were working together through the grey ethical areas of murder this is the place the brick house with the white shutters carmel said pointing across the dashboard as diey rolled past the house weve gotta decide now i dont want you coming in unless you know at some level you believe that you know that what were doing is necessary were not doing it out of madness were doing it out of forced necessity im not objecting so much from any kind of definable rational viewpoint im saying that i feel a little different about this rinker said i even worry about the effect it will have on you dont worry about that carmel took the car to the curb killed the engine are you in or out im in rinker said lucas arrived at hennepin medical center to find sherrill standing with a group of cops on the sidewalk by the emergency entrance when she saw the porsche sherrill broke away from the group and walked into the headlights just as lucas shut them off hes dead she said as lucas got out of the car damnit i was afraid this would happen some day lucas said in a low voice butry was an asshole and not too bright its a bad combination yeah well he was a cop yeah they got a line on the shooters theyre gone desk clerk said there were three skateboarders kids outside the station who mightve seen something but they took off right after the shooting were looking but we aint finding what about carmel shes locked up in her building ill head back there as soon as im sure theres nothing i can do with this thing probably no point lucas said its so late now what about butry whos his next of kin havent found anybody yet sherrill said his folks are dead no brothers or sisters far as we know never married hell there might not be anybody must be somebody i hope so sherrill said if there turned out to be nobody thatd be the worst thing i ever heard of chapter twentytwo carmel and rinker stood on the porch steps each of them holding a phone book and leaned sideways to peer at the curtained windows the windows were dark and nothing was moving nobody home as stupid as it was it was something they hadnt counted on plan b was going down shes gotta be around carmel complained i called her office today and she picked up the phone shes probably off visiting her mother or something rinker said they were both a little deflated and wandered back down the dark sidewalk toward the car carrying the phone books visiting carmel stopped in her tracks yeah i bet shes visiting cmon where rinker was puzzled up to hales place but i thought we were going to take clark first if we dont take her theres no point in i think shes at hales place ill bet you a dollar hales yeah hales ѓe at hales carmel cruised past slowly the back window hales bedroom showed just the faintest glow on the window shade shes there hes got this votive candle what an asshole rinker said im mean youre talking about marrying him and hes still sleeping with his exgirlfriend sneaking carmel said cant say hes not sexually active carmel continued around the block and pulled to the curb fifty yards up the street from allens house where they could see the back window she punched up her car phone and on the second ring a light came on in the bedroom a moment later hale allen picked up i think i can get out of here darling carmel cooed ive got to stop at my apartment for a minute then ill be over maybe i should come to your place hale said no no im already in the car see you and she hung up five minutes later louise clark squirted out of the house like a wet watermelon seed she jogged down the sidewalk and climbed into a silver toyota corolla really makes me angry carmel said really really i cant believe it rinker said its like a complete emotional betrayal youre tough enough to take it but other women they could be totally emotionally crushed by something like this in another ten minutes they were back at clarks house walking up the sidewalk again carmel carrying the phone books clark had just gone inside and the lights were coming on rinker caught carmels arm and whispered let me go first if she sees you at the door carmel stepped to the side and rinker pulled open the storm door propped it back with her foot took a breath dropped her gun hand to her side and knocked urgently on the door with her other hand they heard clark walking toward the door and a voice through the wood panel who is it clara rinker from down the block rinker said i think youve got a little fire a fire a little fire by the corner of your house theres smoke the door opened tentatively no chain rinker stiffarmed it hard and it banged open past the startled mouthopen face of louise clark the gun was up and rinker was inside pushing her followed by carmel louise cried carmel what are you doing carmel carmel said youre fucking my boyfriend thats gotta stop she caught the sleeve of clarks blouse and pulled her toward the back of the house rinker kept the gun in her eyes carmel carmel youre fucking my boyfriend carmel said they could see the bathroom down a short hall a door open in the hall to one side carmel flipped a light the bedroom lay down on the bed and keep your mouth shut carmel said just keep your mouth shut youre going to kill me clark said sinking on the mattress you killed those other people dont be ridiculous were just gonna talk to you about hale carmel said were gonna get a few things straight they got her down on the bed faceup got her down on the pillow then carmel walked around the bed and said look at me and when clark looked at her rinker whod been kneeling on the floor with the gun reached forward put the barrel of the gun against clarks temple and pulled the trigger the bullet shattered clarks skull continuing through her head and into the wall on the other side a red cone of blood on the pillow pointed back to clarks head like a crimson arrow the expelled shell landed next to her ear the gun was a neat ladies with a neat ladies silencer as rinker had explained to carmel a didnt always kill with one shot even from two inches and a second shot would be awkward if the victim was supposed to be a suicide good carmel said looking down at the body you can see exactly how it happened the rest of it probably wont be necessary because they were back there fucking but lets do it anyway getting clark out of her clothing without smearing anything was the hard part shed soiled her underpants so they left them on found a pink negligee in her chest of drawers and pulled that over her head and let her drop back on the bed ah god we forgot the pubic hair carmel said yuck rinker lifted clarks negligee and carmel slid one hand into her pants gave a tug and came back with a halfdozen pubic hairs which she folded into a piece of notebook paper the coke rinker said and the gun yeah carmel had had a bit of coke on hand had rounded up a few more grams during the week she put it all into a amber medicine bottle and dropped it into the bedstand drawer rinker took one of the silenceds out of her carry girdle they hid it in a winter boot in the closet thats it rinker asked i think so carmel said except for the nitrites okay rinker said just set the phone books up over there she fit clarks hand to the gun aimed it at the phone books and pulled the trigger the slug hit the front phone book with a whackl and they fell over the slug hadnt made it through the first one get the phone books and lets go rinker said as she picked up the empty shell ten minutes later they were back at allens place we cant go back now rinker said if we go back now nothing will make any sense i dont have any intention of going back carmel said i sorta thought when we got right down to it you sorta thought right but youve got to have priorities carmel said thats one of the first things we were taught in law school prioritize besides he was getting on my nerves even before this louise clark thing you ever been with a man who lays in bed at night and picks the calluses on his feet no and tell you the truth that seems kind of minor not if youve got a ten oclock appearance the next day and theres all kinds of pressure and you need sleep more than anything and hes over there pick pick pick and he tries to sneak it in so i wont hear it so i wait god how do you want to do it ill just do it carmel said theres nothing else to do at this end no arrangements of anything ill go around the block rinker said hurry carmel got out walked down the block to allens he met her in a bathrobe at the door with a big grin god you got off he said thats great gotta make a call she said she called the office law library the answering machine dropped the receiver on the table said cmere and walked around him back to the bedroom what he looked at the phone puzzled then went after her he was six or seven steps behind her at the bedroom door she slowed let him catch up turned with the gun bringing it up his warm brown puppydog eyes had no chance to show fear or anything else she pulled the trigger and the gun went whack and hale allen as dead as his former wife started falling backward carmel fired three more times as he fell and afterward stepped up beside him pointed the gun down at his forehead and fired twice more whack whack and again into his heart whack goddamnit hale she said as she walked back into the bedroom you were my one true love her photo smiled at her from the bedstand as she opened the folded piece of notebook paper and let the odd strands of clarks pubic hair fall on the sheet on the way out she hung up the phone then looked back at hale allens motionless body you prick she snarled screw around on me she kicked him in the chest and then again in the face and then in the arm and breathing hard went to the door on the street rinker was coming around for the first time carmel stepped out and rinker pulled over that was quick rinker said as carmel got in the car no point in messing around carmel said lets move did you say goodbye i didnt say anything carmel said i did the phone thing got him walking and shot him in the head huh rinker continued on for a block then said you know something what were good at this if id met you ten years ago i bet we could have set things up so that all of my outside jobs pointed somewhere else not too late for that carmel said when you get to wherever youre going you get established set up a couple new ids cool off for a while and then come talk it doesnt bother you at all actually i kind of like it carmel said its something different you know you get out of the office you see lawyers on television running around the courthouse but ninety percent of my time is sitting in front of a computer this is a little exercise if nothing else back at clarks rinker carefully pulled the clip pressed an extra shell into the bottom of the clip using a piece of toilet paper to keep her prints off of it then reloaded the cartridges in the same order that theyd come out they left the gun next to clarks hand on the bed but pointed away i saw a suicide once one of my clients carmel said the gun was like that then thats good rinker said she took a last look around were done on the sidewalk outside carmel looked up at the sky and said im gonna miss you do you think you could get the new york times wherever youre going im sure i could okay then listen ill leave a message for pamela stone in the new york times personal column on halloween and the days around there itll just say something like pamela zihautanejo hilton november or wherever thats where ill be if you feel safe and still want to do mexico ill look for it rinker said listen are you gonna need the other gun no probably not ive got a couple more stashed could i have the one youve got sure but it could be dangerous if you were caught with it ill hide it out carmel said but if anything else comes up all right as they got back in the car rinker slipped the gun out of her girdle pulled the clip jacked the shell out of the chamber pushed it back into the clip and handed the pistol to carmel there you go be careful i will be are you gone then yeah i gotta move ill be out of the country in a week and ive got to make a few stops ive got money stashed all over the place back at the parking ramp rinker and carmel shook hands good friends whod been through a lot together if i dont see you again ill remember you carmel said see you in mexico halloween rinker said hey and dont forget to check that phone tape and erase it if theres anything on it top of my list carmel said she walked back through the building let herself into the office suite unplugged the answering machine and listened to her messages the call from hales house had something on it but she doubted that anyone could tell what it was she was taking no chances though she replaced the phone tape with a new one stripped the tape out of the cartridge and burned it the little fire left a nasty odor in the office and she opened an outside window to air it she could see three or four cars parked up and down the street at least a couple of them she thought were loaded with cops with the answered phone call and the watching cops she had the perfect alibi she should wait a few minutes cool out and get back home she thought and maybe have a good cry although she didnt feel much like crying she was more excited than saddened man that was something else he was right there and whack whack whack alive then dead something else chapter twentythree allens body was found by his secretary who first called carmel to find out if shed seen him well no i havent carmel said she felt a crawling sensation on the back of her neck this was it the beginning of the end game not since day before yesterday i had to work last night i did talk to him last night though sometime about oclock i think well i dont know what to do the secretary said he missed a closing this morning and people are upset he could miss another one if hes not here in die next twenty minutes thats not like him how about his cell phone thats permanently attached to him it rings but theres no answer huh well maybe we ought to check with a neighbor or something carmel said id go but i dont have a key and i do have a court date ive got a key the secretary said the concern right on the surface of her voice he keeps an emergency key in his desk drawer i can go over you dont think anythings happened do you carmel asked she put concern in her own voice i bet he just lost track of time somewhere he was talking about buying a new sport coat he was supposed to be here at nine oclockthats a lot of time the secretary said now youve got me worried carmel said keep me posted as the secretary whose name was alice miller hung up it occurred to her shed just had her most congenial conversation with carmel loan who tended to treat secretaries like unavoidable morons allen she thought was known for a certain mellowing effect he had on women when allen didnt show up for the next closing she apologized for him told the participants that she was very concerned that he hadnt been heard from that she was going to his house to check on him she felt increasing concern as she drove out to allens house and once there she called back to the firm to make sure he hadnt shown up in the meantime he hadnt miller got out of the car and looked up the driveway remembered what had happened to allens wife started up the drive the house felt occupied but quiet a bad vibration she stopped in the driveway and said oh god and crossed herself the front door was open an inch and she called hale its alice hale no answer she stepped inside and some atavistic cell deep in alice millers brain a cell that had never before been called upon triggered and alice miller smelled human blood knew what it was somehow deep in the brain clutched her purse to her breasts and took three more steps into the house leaned sideways looked into the hall at hale allens shattered skull she may have screamed there inside the house later she couldnt remember for sure she turned and ran toward the front door still clutching her purse turned just before she got to the door to look back to see that hale allens corpse wasnt following her and ran straight into the door jamb the blow nearly knocked her down she dropped the purse dazed struck out and pushed her hand through the glass window on the storm door now she did scream a low wavering cry and clutching her bleeding arm she managed to get outside where she ran down the driveway a man was walking his dog along the curb and she ran at him whimpering bleeding badly from the arm cuts help me she cried please please please the responding cops thought alice miller probably had something to do with the shooting as cut up as she was but the patrol sergeant who was second at the scene took a moment to walk through the house to note the drying blood on the floor and the fresh blood on the door he listened to alice as she sat on the grass next to the squad car and finally said call davenport and somebody ride this lady into the hospital sherrill and black got to hale allens house five minutes before lucas black looked at allens body and said totally awesome somebody shot the shit out of him poor guy sherrill said her lip trembled and black patted her on the back how long was carmel loose last night black asked you didnt go back did you no but john hosta did she came downstairs at one oclock and went right home this is a little different than the other ones black said looking closer at the gunshot pattern not a for one thing bigger caliber still not huge but bigger and whoever shot him really unloaded lovers quarrel sherrill said jesus if we hadnt been watching carmel she could be in trouble black said i dont know sherrill said to tell you the truth they were still running pretty hot i dont think they were at the shooting stage maybe he blew her off maybe a cop at the door called in to them davenports here all right sherrill said lets talk lucas was in a cold rage he should have thought of this he should have understood that hale allen might be in trouble had allen discovered something had carmel told him something in pillow talk something that led to accusations sherrill walked him through the house watching him take it easy she said once youre gonna have a goddamned heart attack im not gonna have a goddamned heart attack lucas grated your blood pressure is about two hundred over two hundred i know the signs remember off my case he said and tell me about carmel she was loose for a while last night sherrill said more than an hour itd take a hell of a coincidence lucas said itd take more than that sherrill said she would have had to leave the minute we did get over here work herself into a rage shoot him get away without any neighbors hearing the shots its bullshit maybe the other woman did it the shooter lucas said look at the wounds she said that looks like somebody who was pissed off not a coldblooded professional killer but look at the group in the forehead that looks like a pro yeah but this is ludicrous lucas said i dont even believe itwhat happened to the woman who found the body alice alice miller shes getting her arm sewn up she saw the body and took off and ran right through the door put her hand through the glass shes not no she came here looking for him because hed missed a couple of serious appointments and she couldnt get through to him sherrill said besides even if she was a putup deal did you ever hear of anybody slicing up their arm for verisimilitude veri what lucas eyes slipped over to her and she caught the unspoken amusement outofplace as it might be fuck you she said i know some multisyllabic words ive just never heard that spoken before lucas said his minuscule grin slipped back into the cold stare i need to talk to carmel a uniformed cop stuck his head in the door the miller woman is calling from the hospital she wants to talk to whoevers in charge probably you lucas said to sherrill sherrill nodded and went to take it and somebody laughed and yelled at somebody outside the door crimescene crew was coming in lucas met the crew chief at the door and said about a million people have already trampled through but nobodys been past his feet i need every goddamned thread and hair and print and stain you can find bad news this is very bad news lucas said the newspapers are gonna tear us a new asshole sherrill was back moving fast you remember allen had a girlfriend louise clark had an affair with her before his wife was killed before he started seeing carmel yeah miller was calling to tell us that louise clark also didnt make it into work today and as far as miller knows clark didnt call in to tell people she wouldnt make it miller isnt her supervisor or anything just heard she wasnt around and didnt really put it together with allen all right lucas said lets get her address and get over there goddamnit what is this what is this louise clark was a fine picture of a murdersuicide stretched across her bed in her pretty pink negligee the gun fallen away from her hand on the pillow the gun had a silencer screwed onto the snout lucas brought a kitchen chair into the bedroom and reversed it at the end of the bed and sat down his arms on the back of the chair his chin on his hands and stared at her another cop came in and looked at him and then at sherrill sherrill shrugged and the cop made a screwloose gesture at his temple and backed out of the room after two minutes of staring at the body lucas said its perfect perfect someplace in this house were gonna find either a gun or shells or something else thatll tie her to the earlier shootings the only thing we wont find is well do some swabs and there wont be any semen usually theres semen and there wont be any because they couldnt do that and well get the me to check allen and he wont have had sex in the last twentyfour hours because they couldnt do that either by they you mean carmel and the shooterchick sherrill looked at him for a moment wordlessly then turned and walked back out of the room only to return three seconds later lucas i could make a pretty good case that louise clark is the shooterchick she was sleeping with allen shes a lowlevel secretary and if she gets rid of the old lady and she marries allen she goes from being poor and single to rich and married shes got the motive shes got the gun whered a goddamn lowlevel secretary get a silencer like that lucas snarled you buy a silencer like that on the black market itd cost you a grand and who did the tooling on the muzzle did you find a machineshop in the basement no but lucas what if shes the shooter and she knows carmel that way what if carmels her lawyer and carmel starts screwing her boyfriend knowing that the woman shes kicking out of the saddle is a professional killer bullshit nope this is a setup thats why there wont be any semen and thats why were gonna find a gun lucas said when you said you could make a pretty good case that clark is a shooter youre exactly right you could and a pro defense attorney like carmel could make an even better one she could make a perfect case trying to get anyone else for these murders is pointless well never do it whatre we gonna do i dont know what youre gonna do lucas said standing up but im going up north you can handle this fuckin thing lucas arrived at his cabin a little after five oclock driving back roads most of the way to dodge the wisconsin state patrol the most rapacious gang of weasels in the north woods as he drove the image of the dead louise clark hung before his eyes then just before the turnoff for his cabin he saw a neighbor roland marks driving an orange kubota tractor along the side of the road the tractor had an oversized loader on one end and a backhoe on the other lucas pulled off and climbed out of the car and marks rode the throttle back to idle what the hell are you doing lucas asked walking around the tractor louise clark began to fade gonna clear me off some snowmobile trails on the back marks said marks had forty acres of brush gullies and swamp across the road he called it his huntin property you dont know how to drive a tractor lucas said youre a goddamn stockbroker yeah watch this marks drove the backhoe down a shallow slope into the roadside ditch did something with the controls set the brake turned his seat around backwards lowered hydraulic support pads on both sides of the tractor and raised the bucket with one slow chop he took a couple of cubic feet of dirt out of the bottom on the ditch how much did that thing cost lucas asked impressed despite himself about seventeen used marks said meaning seventeen thousand dollars got four hundred hours on her jesus youre starting to talk like a shitkicker whatre you doing this evening marks asked going out in the boat why dont you come over ill check you out on this thing he carefully dumped the dirt back in the hole where hed gotten it only half of it slopped over the edge yeah what time halfhour see you in a halfhour lucas turned the pump and the water heater on got a light spinning rod and carried it down the dock and flipped a moss boss out into a shallow area spotted with water lilies the moss boss slid and skated froglike through the lilies and reeds back up to the dock he threw it out again then again and on the third cast a bass hit he fought it in unhooked it dropped it back in the water a twelveincher and fun but he didnt eat bass he flipped the moss boss around the dock for twenty minutes taking three small bass tossing them all back feeling his shoulders loosen up louise clark was almost gone after the last cast he walked back up the sloping lawn to the cabin got four cold leinies out of the refrigerator put them in a grocery sack and had one foot out the door when the phone rang he stopped thought about it shook his head at his own foolishness and went back yeah sherrill im down at the mes theyre doing the autopsy on louise clark anything yet yeah shed had sex shortly before she was killed the semen hadnt been dissipated yet and they got a pretty good sample but to tell you the truth i figure theres only one place it could have come from man i dont believe that lucas said he was shocked what about allen they havent started on him but ill let you know if you want to know of course i want to know okay and theres more stuff we found the gun just like you said its a colt with a silencer stuffed inside a boot in the closet and we found a couple hundred bucks worth of cocaine in the bedside table theres the connection to rolo crime scene found some pubic hair in allens bed in fact theyve got three different samples most of it comes from allen but some of its blonde and thatd be carmel but theres a third sample thats this mousybrown color we dont have the lab work yet but i know it came from clark i know it all right call me back when they get to allen keep pushing the me dont let them put anything off until tomorrow we need it now you going fishing actually i was on my way out the door a neighbors gonna teach me to run a backhoe speaking of backhoes what you never told me that special agent malone of the fbi was a woman and a woman with a sexy voice who wants to dance with you didnt seem relevant lucas grunted our relationship is purely professional she wants you to call her in wichita ive got a number malone picked up the phone on the first ring hello lucas davenport she said im told youre off rusticating fishing lucas said i wanted you to know that im moving up to minneapolis with my group and mallard is coming in from washington were very interested in this louise clark very interested theres something wrong with the whole thing did sherrill tell you about the semen no nothing lucas summarized his conversation with sherrill and malone said if the semen checks out if the dna checks out thats it makes me feel weird lucas said its not right this clark isnt a pro killer not unless she was doing it for the fun of it because she didnt have any goddamn money could have had it hidden away bullshit lucas said she kills people but hides it all away the inside of her house looked like a cutrate motel she had a tv set that couldnt have been worth more than a couple hundred bucks new everything in the place said she was a secretary and struggling to keep her head above water all right well im coming in tomorrow maybe when you get back you can take me out for a nice little foxtrot somewhere some place where you wont spend all of your time dancing with the waitress lucas carried the sack of beer next door to the marks place lucy marks was snipping the heads off playedout coneflowers as her husband maneuvered the kubota in and out of a shed the shed showed splintered wood at the side of one of the doors evidence of a recent impact role tells me youre gonna learn how to run the tractor she said shaking her head im glad i bought the quartsize bottle of peroxide hey lucas you gotta encourage him to be careful im afraid hell roll it over on himself hes like a kid hell be all right lucas said that wouldnt be beer in that sack would it couple leinies he said guiltily yeah well ill take the leinies you go figure out the tractor when you get back well fry some crappies and we can have the beer then well she gave him a look and he handed her the bag the kubota was different running wasnt a problem but maneuvering the joystick for the backhoe took a little practice ill have you buttering your bread with this thing before were finished marks said enthusiastically i figure with a few hours practice i could do all the driveways for this whole area come winter jesus christ role you make what a halfmillion dollars a year selling stock and now youre gonna pick up an extra two hundred dollars a month doing driveways when lucas was checked out marks showed him where he was going to hide the key in his shed anytime im not up here youre welcome to use it maybe i could help you brush out a couple of those trails lucas said he liked the backhoe terrificthen as they walked back up toward the cabin you gettin any lucas could see lucy marks on the lake side of the house cleaning up the grill overtime i dont get overtime any more pussy marks said crumbcake you know it sorta looks like yeah yeah as a matter of fact i just took a call from a nicelooking forty ish fbi lady whos coming to minneapolis and wants me to take her out to foxtrot foxtrot foxtrot my ass if it was me id drop about nine inches of the old frenchcanadian bratwurst on her said marks who talked big but was the most faithful man on earth as they came around the corner of the house he hollered at his wife lucas is gonna jump an fbi agent a female i hope lucy marks said she was spraying something on the grill turning her face away from the coals she wants to foxtrot with him marks said she called him up sounds promising lucy marks said howd this happen i was down in wichita and we were in this bar and she didnt dance to rock music so i was dancing with the owner he trailed off and after a few seconds lucy marks said lucas you still in there excuse me lucas said but i gotta go im sorry he jogged away across the lawn toward his own place leaving the marks at the grill looking puzzled at the cabin he fumbled out the number sherrill had given him for malone and dialed it one of the fbi agents a man picked it up and said john shaw lucas said let me speak to malone she just left i could try to catch her catch her goddamnit the phone on the other end clattered on a desk and lucas hung onto the receiver eyes closed rubbing his forehead could this be right two minutes later malone picked up the phone and said malone this is lucas did you get the composite of the shooter yes pretty good close your eyes and think about the woman i danced with at that club in wichita whatever it was the rink my eyes are closed i hmm gotta be a coincidence hey im a greatlooking guy lucas said i know that but just between you and me malone not that many thirtyyearold women are coming onto me anymore and with this one i had the feeling she was more interested than she should have been and maybe not in sex i didnt know why or maybe you thought it was sex maybe i did whatever but i tell you from talking to the people up here who saw her and looking at that picture something kept knocking at the back of my head lucas said i finally figured it out if shes not the same chick shes her twin and if she was up here she could very well have seen me on television and if she did and i walked into her place in wichita and then just sat down for a cheeseburger and a beer all right malone said reluctantly sounds like a loser but give me a couple of hours ill check it out youll be up at your cabin i dont know lucas said out through the screen he could see the lake flat quiet a perfect north woods evening coming on and hed just gotten there i think im gonna head back to the cities im telling you i think shes the shooter he was out on driving way too fast and still a long way north of the cities when the cell phone burped he picked it up and heard the first two words then lost the signal he punched it off three minutes later it rang again and he answered it sherrill breaking up but audible your fbi friend called shes all cranked up that woman you danced with has disappeared cleaned out her apartment quit her job at the bar i thought she owned it so did everybody but she was really just the manager its really owned by a guy named james larimore who is also known as wooden head larimore who is really connected really connected in guesswhere st louis yup the cell connection was getting cleaner so your fbi friend freaked and got a crimescene crew into the apartment and guesswhat again itd been wiped top to bottom got her goddamnit lucas crowed we got her whats her name clara rinker rinker fuck those fbi pussies marcy we broke this fuckin thing right over their heads yeah well want to know where wooden head got the name wooden head sure the adrenalin was pumping hed listen to anything he was once in a bar when people started shooting and he caught a ricochet and the slug stuck in his skull bone in his forehead above his nose made a dent and stuck but didnt go through they say everybody was laughing so hard the gunfight stopped even wooden head was laughing so hes a tough guy very tough and they aint gonna get much out of him he says he dont know nothin about nothin chapter twentyfour m alone met him at the airport you look kinda green malone said tough flight down naw it was all right lucas mumbled he looked back through the terminal window at the plane and malone caught the look and said you cant be one of those youre not afraid to fly its not my preferred method of travel lucas said walking away she scrambled to catch up and he turned his head to ask whatd you get from the bar prints photos we need to get a photo out now airplanes are about fifty times safer than cars malone said i thought everybody knew that not only that most people are distracted when theyre driving because they fall into routines while pilots are trained yeah yeah enough lucas said i dont like to fly because ive got problems dealing with control issues because ive got an unconsciously macho selfimage okay that make you happy now what about rinker we cant find a photograph malone said and theres no reason for you to be defensive about a fear of flying theres gotta be a photograph she gave up there are no photographs in the apartment and none in the bar either she didnt have any or she took them with her we checked with people who were moreorless friends moreorless she didnt have many real friends malone said she was friendly without friends nobody who worked at the bar had ever seen the inside of her apartment a loner psychologically anyway drivers license we checked her drivers license and she was wearing a red wig and glasses the size of dinner plates and she had her head tilted down what im saying is that composite you had was better wichita state also had a copy of her student id and thats as bad or worse than the drivers license she was careful what we are doing though is were refining the composite itll be as good as a photograph by this evening they walked out of the terminal into the alreadywarm kansas air the sun had still been low on the horizon when they landed and lucas had expected a little more cool malone led him to an unmarked ford parked in a noparking zone with a local cop watching over it thanks ted malone said to the cop who nodded and gave her his best frontline bandofbrothers cop grin saved her parking place next week he might be saving her ass someplace in a savage firefight out on the burning plains of kansas then again maybe not and theres another thing malone said as they pulled away from the curb uhoh lucas said the crimescene guys found a couple of small smears of fresh blood on the floor of her apartment a man who lives down the street was getting up early to go fishing in kansas yeah i guess they do somewhere anyway he gets up and sees a couple of guys going into her apartment building they looked outofplace he thought they looked like football players big guys and they both wore suits but they had a key and he just thought they were a couple of apartment people coming home after a night out so he went fishing and didnt think about it until one of our guys went around knocking on doors two guys in suits middle of the night just about dawn and blood on the floor there is no apartment in the building with two guys in it and we cant find any two guys who were out late its not a big apartment eighteen units weve talked to everybody there was no disturbance no she had a motion detector in the hallway which would have been invisible if you didnt know what you were looking for if she was in there she should have known they were coming of course she might have expected them there was no sign of a struggle so she shot them thats a possibility other than the fact that therere no bodies in the place and shed have to carry two footballsized guys out the hall and down a flight of stairs to get rid of them on the other hand if they shot her a couple of big guys could handle a small woman fairly easily if you were big enough you could hold her under your coat and walk right out were they wearing coats the fisherguy says they werent but you get my point they could handle her a heck of a lot easier than she could have handled them they could have walked away together lucas said they could have been helpers she could have cut herself packing up her stuff which is sort of my theory right now malone said although the other theory has some attractions if we get this woman weve got a halfdozen states where theyve got the death penalty and where theyve got lots of evidence on one or another of her killings the only thing they dont have is the shooter if we wanted to release her to those states for trial sooner or later shed wind up in the electric chair or the gas chamber or strapped down to a gurney with that kind of leverage we could squeeze her pretty hard we could put some pretty big holes in the st louis mob with her information and thats what you want of course she said if we get the top guy the guy who probably ran her he knows everything if she was willing to pin the tail on him we could show him the same set of electric chairs and gas chambers if he talked two years from now st louis would be cleaner than i dont know seattle seattle has microsoft okay she showed the tiniest of smiles than minneapolis thanks anyway the mob guys in st louis know this as well as we do it wouldnt be too farfetched to think they might send a couple of shooters to fix the problem she might be too smart for that lucas said i got the impression of smartness from the lady so we know the mob could send a couple of guys and the mob knows it could send a couple of guys and she knows it and if everybody knows it do they send a couple of guys i dont know malone said i do know one thing thats pretty unique yeah youre the only guy i know whos literally danced with the devil lucas saw the big window the minute he walked in the apartment door he had an advantage over malone and the other fbi agents when theyd first arrived they were looking for rinker herself and didnt know about the blood on the floor one of the fbi crimescene techs pointed him around the apartment and finally he asked did you check the outside window ledge on that big window the agent looked at the window and thinking fast said not yet as if it were next on the list would it be all right to lift it up let me get one of the guys to do it the agent said whatre you thinking malone asked i think carrying any body out of this place would take a fruitcake lucas said but throwing them out the window if its night time he peered out theyd land right behind the garbage dumpsteryou could back a car right up to them one of the technicians came over looked skeptically at the window and said let me get this lucas stepped back and the tech unlocked the inner window and lifted it easily the outer window was a convertible aluminum glassandscreen affair the glass had been pushed up and the screen was in place screens a little loose the tech said he was working awkwardly through surgeons gloves let me he used a small pocket knife to slip the screen up an inch which allowed him to pull it out of the frame he leaned it against the wall and they all looked at the bottom end of the screen and the brick wall outside huhthe tech grunted and got down close to the brick leaning out through the window what asked malone glancing quickly at lucas you know any reason why a brick would wear tweed wooden head was being interrogated by a team of specialists from washington lucas and malone watched for a few minutes then left if the team missed anything lucas wasnt smart enough to figure out what it would be the team was taking wooden head apart inch by inch and they were good id suggest we get a bite at the rink but somebody would probably spit in the hamburger malone said so lets get something someplace elsethen maybe i can rent a car and get back home really youd drive back instead of fly really lucas said weve got a car going up later today a couple of guys from the crimescene crew to review the work at the last two killing scenes you could ride along i think theyre leaving around three and plan to drive straight through sign me up lucas said they stopped at a downtown diner got a tippy table and lucas looked at one of the legs and told malone sitting opposite see that lever on the end of the leg theres a lever sticking up yeah push the lever toward me with your foot whats that for it levels the table lucas said malone pushed the lever with her foot and the table stopped tipping whered you learn that she asked i used to be a waitress he said before the operation over coffee and grilledcheese sandwiches malone filled lucas in on everything the fbi had figured out about clara rinker they had her biography from childhood but still no good pictures she was in trouble a few times when she was a teenager but nothing serious never got mugshot or printed she was a runaway and she might have had reason to be we think she was probably raped a few times by her stepfather who disappeared by the way and maybe by one of her brothers did he disappear too no hes still around but he doesnt talk much about her he claimed he couldnt remember her thats helpful the picture sort of fills out though shes a sociopath i think but not a psychopath she never showed that much enthusiasm for her work she just did it very effectively she had to take sat tests to get into wichita state and she did okay quite well on verbal skills less good on math about which is pretty exceptional when you understand that she ran away from home in the ninth grade i knew she was smart lucas said she got out of here so cleanly that i expect shes got a hideyhole somewhere digging her out could be tough especially with those horseshit photos weve got so far say i think i know from somewhere that the sat people require photo ids for their tests i dont know malone said but well check if thats blood you found on the ground behind the dumpster and it comes from more than one person then shes still out there otherwise i dont know its hard to think that shes dead and gone outa reach worse things have happened malone said at least the killing would stop until they find somebody else but i know what you mean itd be good to have her she got any foreign languages lucas asked spanish malone confirmed shes in her fourth year of college spanish got as all the way through one of our guys talked to her spanish instructor who said that if she goes south across the border shell be speaking it like a native in six months said she was already pretty good and had a good ear for the accent i wouldnt be surprised if shes already down there lucas said goddamnit we were an inch short about five times in a row what about the woman in minneapolis garmel loan malone asked she ate her cheese sandwich in small tidy bites pausing every second or third bite to dab her mouth with a napkin she looked like a history professor lucas thought but an oddly sexy one maybe that somehow explained how shed been married four times but none of the marriages lasted maybe her husbandstobe expected a nice reserved history professor and got an animal instead or maybe it was the other way around i need to lay in my bed and think about carmel lucas said maybe i could z out in the back of the car this evening going back home but let me ask you this given what we have right now how convincing a case could you make against clara rinker malone rolled her eyes up and to one side thinking after a moment still silent she scratched the back of her neck and wiggled in her seat finally she said we could probably get her sooner or later give us enough trials we could get her but it sure isnt openandshut not quite malone said well probably get some prints sooner or later find something she forgot about but even if we put them with the prints you got off that bar of soap all wed do was prove that she was in minneapolis we have a mountain of evidence we just dont have any direct tie but i think the mountain would get her given the right jury so the same evidence could be applied to somebody else its not impossible that claras the wrong person lucas said well its pretty improbable but not impossible she agreed youve got a lawyer with your group dont you besides you couple of them malone said would it be possible to send one up to minneapolis the smartest one with the whole rinker file and get with one of our assistant country attorneys and make a case against louise clark that she was the shooter i mean we found the gun we found all kinds of evidence that she committed at least one murder id like to see what other evidence we could put together from other cases if there is any malone was puzzled but you said that was a putup job why would you want to make that case because just between you me and the doorpost i know damn well that carmel loan helped set up these killings i dont know exactly why although sex might have had something to do with it or it might not have maybe it was money or just for fun but shes in it up to her neck and i can tie carmel to clark if i can make a case that clark is the shooter and i can tie carmel to her maybe i could talk a jury into sending carmel away oh man i dont know that doesnt sound overly ethical i aint a fuckin lawyer im just a humble cop lucas said so i dont know about ethics but could you send a lawyer up we can work out the details the ethics later she was peering at him over the diner table and said im not sure i want to know the details but youll send somebody up i guess she had one small crumb of toast sitting on the left corner of her mouth and lucas picked up her napkin and dabbed it off for her you had a crumb he said she shrugged and met his eyes the story of my life chapter twentyfive sherrill agreed with malone that is the goofiest thing ive ever heard black disagreed how about the tracy triplets and the thing with the gourd you said that was the goofiest thing youd ever heard that youd never see that peak again sherrills eyes stayed with lucas but she spoke to black okay this is the second goofiest thing ive ever heard the tracy triplets are still first but only because of the midget if it wasnt for the midget this would be goofier lucas wasnt smiling this is not goofy youre starting to piss me off sherrill was waving her arms lucas hown the hell can you convict an innocent dead woman of something she didnt do shouldnt be too tough lucas said we do it a few times a year with innocent live people how hard could it be to do it with a dead one she certainly wont care and we will get carmel jesus man i dont know black said this aint a game i know but maybe well break something loose so what i want is i want everybody out working on connections between louise clark and carmel they were about the same age did they ever go to the same school did they ever hang out at the same place they mustve known each other so lets make them into friends lets put together some ideas thatll tighten up the story on clark something we could take her to court on if she were alive black said yeah if she was alive this wont work if carmel doesnt hear about it we want her to react lucas said a halfdozen detectives were crowded into lucas office sherrill black sloan a guy from drugs two from sex lucas wanted people hed worked with and could trust we know shes got at least a couple of sources inside the department so we want you to blab gossip homicide is tying carmel loan to louise clark and through her to the killings why dont you call some of your pals at tv black asked id rather have them ask me about it lucas said i dont want it to be an obvious plant rumors are better than actual stories in fact if the newsies hear about it ill probably deny it refuse to comment sherrill said that always makes their little weenies hard carmel heard about it almost immediately theyre what theyre tying you to louise clark if they can tie you to her you could be in trouble but i didnt do anything she said with asperity yeah well whatever listen things are getting a little warm around here im getting out of the information business for a while okay you mean dont call carmel said im not trying to be an asshole but theyre pulling out all the stops theyve got a halfdozen guys working on it davenport told somebody that theyll have you inside by the end of the week thats absurd i thought youd want to know so im signing off okay this last ones a freebie fuck your freebie carmel snarled black found an invitation to a lawyers halloween ball organized by members of several downtown firms a photo of four of the women who organized the ball including carmel was on the back of the program and louise clarks name was in the list of people whod volunteered to help out what you should do lucas told black after hed seen the photo is get in touch with these other women and ask them about the relationship between carmel and clark how closely did they work together that kind of thing i think clark was probably a flunky xeroxed the invitations or something thats fine but ask anyway lucas said one of the people you ask will call carmel and tell her youre asking then sherrill came up with a strong tie one that surprised everybody louise clarks phone records showed two calls to carmel loans unlisted home phone in the week before clark was killed both calls were late at night i cant think why they would be talking why clark would be calling her but its an amazing tie sherrill said its almost enough by itself lucas said you know what i want you to go over and brace carmel about this facetoface tell her its part of the clark investigation and we just want the question answered no big deal carmels face was the color of her fabulous bloodyred silk scarf she never called carmel shouted she never called ms loan somebody called from her house to yours this isnt bullshit this is the list straight from the phone company i brought a xerox copy for you sherrill was sitting in front of carmels desk and she unfolded the xerox and pushed across the leather desk pad and you can call the phone company yourself if you dont think this is accurate carmel snatched the xerox copy from the desk looked at the two underlined phone calls she shook her head angrily said no this is but then she trailed off and her head swung sideways and down a pensive look crossing her face you know what this is she asked finally looking up at sherrill that sonofabitch was calling me from her house he was sleeping with me three nights a week and when we werent together he was sneaking over to her place sherrill looked doubtful well she stood up if you say so thats what it is carmel shouted shaking the xerox copy in sherrills face lucas was not amused by the story he shook his head fiddled with a sportcoat button im starting to feel sorry for her he said almost my question is where are you going with this i mean exactly where sherrill asked they were alone in lucas office streetlights coming on outside the single window a soft glow lingered in the sky a perfect summer night a night for walking around the lakes sherrill thought lucas said youre the only one who knows about the shell i found in her bedroom closet unless you told somebody else sherrill said no its just you and me lucas said he pulled out the typewriter tray on the top corner of his desk leaned back in his chair and put his feet up but something happened to get that shell in there somebody dropped a box of shells somebody ejected a shell and didnt pick it up or somebody was punching a bunch of shells into a clip and fumbled them if carmel sees me find a shell there and if i find it in just the right circumstances i think shed come after it either her or the shooter you mean like any shell sure any shell any whatever happened to get that shell in the closet carmel will know about if i find a shell in the closet shell know shes fucked especially if she hears about the scratches on the back of rolos hand and our other corroborating evidence whatever it might be whatll she do suppose i find the shell on a friday night suppose everybody has left her apartment except me and i find the shell while im taking a last look around i know where i found the original so ill find this one in exactly the same place i show it to her and she claims i planted it or whatever and i say the only shells i have to plant are already fired if we get a metallurgical match on these slugs and some of the killer slugs carmel youre all done and then i tell her i know shes involved from the phone messages or something and and i say well let you know first thing monday morning then i put the shell in a baggie and i leave i go home drive slow give her a chance to catch me and we put a net around the house and i hang around sherrill frowned you think shed come after it if she knows that itll match and she probably knows that if we give her the whole weekend to stew about it boy the whole thing smells a little like entrapment look you and i know shes involved lucas said if she comes after me then weve got her if you try to entrap somebody and their response is to shoot you i mean you cant defend yourself against entrapment with attempted murder and in fact we can outline some of this to the other guys tell them that were trying to lure the killer in that wed never use the fake shell that way we avoid the entrapment charge but we wont tell them that there once was a real shell no its getting trickier by the minute mmmm be nice if we could find a few more things to tie clark to carmel well hell were inventing the shell and the whole relationship we could invent a few ties too sherrill said like suppose we find out where she took a vacation and we leak the word that clark took a vacation there at the same time theres no way for carmel to know that she didnt i hope this is getting through to her lucas said i hope her leak in the departments still good we need to write a script sherrill suggested when we get the warrant for her apartment we could drop all of these little nuggets you could say something i could drop something sloan lucas nodded looked at his watch good idea think of some stuff and ill think of some but right now ive got to go to the reality commission were talking about noncertifiable minorities tonight he thumped the report which sat on one side of his desk he was on page four hundred and thirty noncertifiable what is that well you know minorities that dont fit into racial handicapped sexual determinant agedeterminant religious ethnic or nationalorigin groups jeez i would have thought that covered everything oh no there was a case in wisconsin of a white episcopalian male in his early thirties nonhandicapped heterosexual english heritage a perfect wasp wouldnt even pee in the shower lucas said anyway he was a member of one of the animalprotection groups and his coworkers tormented him by displaying photographs of pork chops and link sausages in the workplace and theyd talk about going to mcdonalds for cheeseburgers he got from the city of madison for emotional imperialism well madison that explains a lot of it of course lucas said nodding but apparently we need a policy you know covering nonreligious ethical minorities then he closed his eyes rubbed them with a thumb and forefinger jesus christ whatd i just say carmel could feel the rage building she knew what the cops were doing they were building a just in case case hoping to build a good enough story that a jury would put her away just in case she was the killer somehow she thought davenport had fastened on her as the killer and she had to admit it had never occurred to her that in eliminating any possibility that she could be tied to rinker shed thoughtlessly incriminated somebody to whom she could be tied and there was no way for her to explain that clark wasnt the killer how could she know carmel had tried fortyfour murder cases in her career winning twentyone of them that was considered an excellent average since most involved a man found standing over his dead wife with a handgun and when asked why he did it had told the cops she was gettin on my ass you know three of the cases shed lost still haunted her because she shouldnt in her opinion have lost them shed broken the states case shed thought and afterverdict interviews with the jurors had suggested that shed lost only because the jurors wanted to believe the cops they hadnt had the evidence but theyd convicted because the cops suggested they should that could happen to her fuckin davenport worse the word was getting out she might be going psycho she thought going paranoid but she thought she could see it in the eyes of her colleagues the questions did you do it did you help did you drill those little holes in rolando daquilas kneecaps an interview with one of carmels friends produced the casual information that shed been in zihuatanejo the november before last save that lucas told sherrill when we shake her apartment down well drop the information that clark was there at the same time well jump her about it all right what else you got not much its really thin clark took a course in legal writing at the u at the same time carmel was at the law school so they were at law school together not exactly close enough for government work lucas said get more john mccallum managing partner of the firm stopped at carmefs office and asked what the hell is going on carmel we hear the police are looking at you in connection with all these murders he was using the same whiny voice that had caused him to lose half of the consumer liability cases hed once tried carmel thought its all crap john carmel said but she could feel the blood rising in her face and the impulse to rip mccallums larynx out of his throat the cops are trying to put pressure on me i dont know why yeah well make them stop mccallum said im working on it you know the firm will stand behind you bullshit youd drop me like a hot potato if you could carmel said of course i can beat any charge diey bring against me and then id make a hobby out of suing you for damaging my career you might get out of it with your oldest car and a pair of shoes that sounded almost like a threat mccallum said excuse me if i wasnt direct enough carmel said that was a threat if the firm doesnt back me up on this ill personally take you to court and pull your testicles off i dont have to listen to this he said his eyes flinched away from her wolverines gaze and he turned to go you dont have to listen carmel said her voice as deadly as a razor but you better think about it cause im serious john youve seen me at work you dont want to piss me off sherrill typed all the ties into a memo and dropped it on lucas desk enough for a warrant lucas looked down the list and nodded well need a photo of the cuts on the back of rolos hand and the phone records both office and apartment both but well do the office firt seal her apartment so that she cant get in to destroy anything then brace her at the law firm well need a dozen guys a crowd to make it really inconvenient look through all her paper files and well need a computer guy to copy her computer records well need to subpoena the firms phone records too might be some court problems with that yeah but we can nail them down anyway let the countys attorneys guys argue about what we should get when write up the warrant now well walk it over to the county let them know whats coming lucas said what if theyre shaky fuck em besides they dont mind seeing us fall on our asses from time to time and thisll all be on our heads so we go in tomorrow friday sherrill looked down at her memo this is gonna be somethin chapter twentysix all the paperwork was done by noon friday lucas took sherrill sloan and franklin to lunch after leaving word for the rest of the search team to meet at his office at three oclock sherrill sloan and franklin knew about the warrant as did black whod gone to st paul to get photos of rolando daquilas selfinflicted scratches why dont we just go sherrill asked as they settled into a booth at the grey kitten a waitress hustled over dropped four menus on the redcheckered vinyl tablecloth and moved on because i want it later in the day lucas said when the waitress was gone i want people starting to go home i want the process harder for her to stop and maybe shell be a little more tired this way she went to work when seven this morning another cop drifted by a uniform guy on his day off he was wearing grass stained shorts and a tshirt with a moose on the front he smiled at sherrill hey marcy heytobe marcy said you look a little scuffed up he looked down at his shorts nodded and said softball good good she said and her eyes drifted back to franklin after a moment tobe said well see ya and drifted away lucas glanced at sherrill who smiled wellpleased she got there at seven oclock said franklin whod been working with the surveillance crew first light in her apartment was fivefortyfive so we go into the office at three oclock and put a man on her apartment door at the same time lucas said we stay at her office until about five and then we move the act over to the apartment i want both the office and the apartment taken apart everything in the computers all records showing phone calls money spent safedeposit numbers everything well need a new warrant to get into the safedeposit boxes sloan said by that time monday well either be done with her or completely fucked lucas said although we ought to get the warrant anyway if theres something in one of those boxes itll put a little more pressure on her you really think shell come after you franklin asked he didnt know about the cartridge that lucas had found he knew only that lucas would drop one and pretend to find it lucas shrugged i think shell do something if we do this right she oughta feel pretty cornered by the time were done and the only way out of the corner will be to get that shell back the waitress came back and they ordered and when the waitress was gone franklin asked has anybody here ever been on one of these things when everything went just like you thought it would they all thought about it for a few seconds then lucas shook his head and sherrill said never happen at three the surveillance team put carmel at her office lucas sent two men to camp out at her apartment door nobody goes in without my sayso and if theres anybody inside when you get there they dont leave until i see them and led the rest of the group in a ragged line three blocks across downtown to carmels office another two drove over in a van to carry any items seized as part of the search carmel was in the office of another partner when lucas presented the search warrant to the secretary and started feeding men into carmels office lawyers started coming out of adjoining offices and one of them yelled hey what are you assholes doing a search sherrill said facing off you got a warrant weve served it sherrill said youre assholes the lawyer shouted and then another one started to boo and five seconds later the office was a raucous cacophony of boos catcalls and hisses a few seconds later carmel pushed her way through the crowd and faced off with sherrill out of the fuckin way she said ill let you in but you are not to touch anything or interfere in any way sherrill said if you do ill throw you out yeah carmel pushed closer to her they were chesttochest not quite touching yeah sherrill said she didnt budge and if you touch me ill knock you on your ass and haul you downtown on an assault charge carmel almost faltered never stick she said tell that to your teeth when youre digging them out of the back of your throat sherrill said she waited another beat then stepped aside dont touch dont interfere carmel stepped past her and a few of the lawyers in the hall started cheering go carmel inside her office carmel spotted lucas who was standing hands in pocket watching a computer technician slip copy software into the floppy slot on carmels computer what is this she hissed were searching your office looking for any information or physical articles concerning your involvement in the murders of hale allen and others when things are under control here were moving over to your apartment my apartment her hand went to her throat your apartment right now its sealed you can be present when we enter it if you wish after a long moment of astonished silence carmel said youre nuts no but im afraid you are lucas said weve got quite a bit of the picture with you and louise clark i have nothing to do with louise clark nothing you can ask you just went to zihuatanejo at the same time by accident what carmel sputtered i never saw her in zihuatanejo id never go there with a a secretary i went there by myself lucas now took a long moment to look her over then halfturning away he said sure one of the vice guys found louise clarks name in carmels rolodex lifted it out put it in an evidence bag another found a long paper record of the daquila drug trial and bagged that too the lawyers in the hallway began chanting fuck you fuck you fuck you and one of the senior partners came down and tried to quiet them they didnt quiet the chanting got louder and the partner grinned slightly shrugged and went upstairs the approval as explicit as theyd ever get from that particular partner two minutes later another group of lawyers arrived from another firm in the building and joined the chanting carmel was shouting over tibe noise you think i killed hale we were gonna get married i was here the night he was killed look in our phone records asshole youll find that he called me we talked for ten minutes hey asshole im talking to you and outside the lawyers began chanting asshole asshole asshole sherrill was getting angry but lucas touched her shoulder and grinned havent had this much fun since we beat up that shitkicker in oxford and carmel screamed what are you laughing about asshole and lucas let it out a long rolling laugh outside the lawyers were chanting scratching at the glass windows to carmels outer office watching him laugh and laugh at five oclock leaving three detectives at the office to look through the last of the records lucas moved the act to carmels apartment carmel followed in her bloodyred jag which had been searched while it was parked in the office ramp lucas and four others were in the elevator when it arrived at the fifth floor where carmels parking space was carmel got on with a man who shed introduced at the office as dane carlton her personal attorney lucas knew him to nod to a tall slender greyhaired man with a cool demeanor and icy blue eyes behind plain goldrimmed glasses he was wearing a blue suit with a white shirt and winecolored tie to lucas carmel said fuck you lucas sighed looked at carlton you should tell your client to watch her mouth im her attorney not her guardian carlton said bluntly and hes gonna rip you a new asshole when were done with this carmel said lucas looked at carlton that right carlton with the tiniest movement of his head said yes when carlton and carmel got out at carmels floor sherrill looking after him put her mouth close to lucas ear and whispered i get the feeling he could do it lucas said i know him he could the search team was methodical and undiscriminating they were looking for guns cartridges records notes letters anything that would tie carmel to any of the people who were murdered they found a halfdozen notes and emails written to hale allen most of them simply setting up dates franklin wearing white plastic gloves gave one of them to lucas fuck around on me and ill kill you lucas read aloud carlton glanced at carmel who rolled her eyes but she was angry and getting angrier lucas thought he dropped the daquila scratches on her the first time he got an opening which came when carmel started screaming again youre messing up my goddamn clothes those clothes are worth more fucking money than the city can pay dane we gotta recover for this theyre wrecking that suit carlton said we will carmel he turned to lucas chief davenport why dont we end this charade theres no evidence that carmel had anything to do with any of these killings youre simply fishing and we will eventually find out why it appears to be a personal crusade against one of the most highly regarded criminal attorneys in the state have you lost a case to carmel what is there in your past i dont have anything against carmel lucas said injecting a little steel into his voice i always kind of admired her shes a tough attorney i stopped admiring her when rolando daquila used his fingernails to carve carmels name into the back of his hand while he was being tortured and then executed carlton showed a thin smile that is one of the more amazing things ive ever heard youll be even more amazed when you see the scratches or gouges doing it had to be almost as painful as getting the holes drilled in his knees and he didnt just carve her initials he carved her name c loan quarterinch grooves in the back of his hand carlton glanced at carmel whod frozen in place when she heard daquilas name i just dont believe it carlton said finally well weve got daquilas body on ice in st paul along with the blood that dried on his hands and arms while he was carving her name out so you all can go over and look at it im sure youll find your own pathologist to examine the body carmel started to interject something but carlton waved her down and turned to lucas with a slightly warmer tone of voice lucas knew what he was doing he was looking for information anything that might someday help a defense we will challenge it of course because whatever might be carved on mr daquilas hand it isnt carmels name you can say that without seeing it lucas eyebrows went up of course because it cant be carmels name okay lucas said mildly if thats your story it is and were sticking to it carlton said the search continued sloan one of the more mildmannered of the homicide cops mentioned to carmel in passing that they knew about her connection with clark at law school lucas outside the bedroom when sloan and carmel were talking heard carmel spluttering she was a secretary for christs sake and sloan answered cmon carmel we know she took that legal writing course the same time you did if she did i didnt know about it ah cmon sloan said you guys go way back you even did that halloween ball together its right on the program jesus you guys but she was scared now more angry than scared but scared nevertheless at six oclock with carlton glancing at his watch every two minutes the search team began breaking up a crimescene crew had been brought in to take samples from carmels bed the guestroom bed and to dust the guestroom for fingerprints they began packing their gear and sloan told lucas he was heading home then two more detectives checked out and carlton asked lucas i assume youre not planning anything else dramatic no new papers to serve lucas shook his head no were about done im gonna take one last cruise through the place carlton went to carmel and said im chairing a bar meeting at seven oclock will you be all right here sure its all over and sherrill her voice low asked lucas got the shell yeah take off as soon as carltons out of here ill be across the street with sloan franklin and del are headed for your house carlton left sherrill looked at her watch you want me to stay she asked lucas im kind of in a rush take off lucas said ill say goodbye to carmel make sure nobody left anything behind carmel shouted at sherrill as she left good riddance to all of ya fuck ya fuck ya sherrill flashed her the finger over her shoulder and carmels eyes widened and she took a step after sherrill and lucas stepped between them and said hey hey then to sherrill knock it off okay at the same time he winked at her yeah yeah and she was gone too and lucas and carmel were left alone in the fabulous apartment chapter twentyseven carmel asked are you wearing a wire they were still standing in the living room by the open door to the hallway no should i be lucas stepped over to the door and pushed it shut when i think about it i dont really care carmel said im gonna get you for this davenport i swear to god im gonna dedicate my life to it gonna take a lot of dedication if youre out at the womens prison for thirty years lucas said she flushed and he could see her eyeteeth bared as she spoke theres not gonna be any prison not for me could be for you when were done with you youve got nothing lucas shook his head and said theyre arguing about that over at the courthouse some of the guys think weve got enough some of them dont gonna be close he drifted across the living room as he talked poked his head into the guestroom then continued to her bedroom carmel following him down the hall what do you want in here she demanded im just closing the place down making sure nobody left anything behind he said the shell was between two shoes in the open part of the closet ill tell you something carmel just between you and me and i dont care if youre wearing a wire i know you were involved in these killings i know it i know you were involved in the first one barbara allen and i think you did it because you wanted hale you were screwing him before the body was in the ground you dont know that i do know that hale told me that hale her hand went to her throat yeah we had a long talk about you i know all about you about your sexual preferences about what you like to talk about in bed and you know what you scared the shit out of hale he didnt have the courage to stop you but he did have the courage to come in and talk to me and i taped it hale telling me about how you hated barbara about how she was holding him back about how he was lucky to be rid of her lucas was adding that last bit on but he bet it was true that sonofabitch she said naw he was just a dummy worked hard liked women not too much upstairs not a lot of guts either but he was just trying to get through life he felt guilty about louise clark but a lot of guys who love their wives have affairs and louise was something else in bed he couldnt stop talking about her he said she could suck the chrome off a trailer hitch thats the way he put it he said that compared to clark you were like the roman army just grinding him down he never said that carmel shouted but there were tears streaking her face now and she hated it and screamed louder hale never said that yeah he did and i think you know it because it rings right lucas said he felt odd standing in the cool professionallyfeminine bedroom alone with this tearstreaked woman hands in his pants pocket almost abashed he felt cruel he pushed on he said you were like some kind of machine marching all over him but he was afraid to dump you because he was afraid because he thought you may have killed his wife louise clark killed her and him oh please lucas said sounding in his own ears like a character in a new york tv comedy louise clark had him he was going to marry her as soon as he could get rid of you and louise clark to tell you the truth was a good match for him smart enough but not exactly the wizard of the western world but a nice woman and good in bed and as far as we can tell from talking to all of her friends louise clark had never fired a gun in her life right up to the day when we found her in the middle of that phony suicide tableau in her bedroom fuck you davenport carmel said crossing her arms over her chest get out of my house lucas said yeah im going ill scout the it seemed a little faked he didnt do it quite right the frown the near doubletake but carmel was tired stretched out of shape what is that what carmel was confused here lucas said he brushed past her pushed the sliding door back so he could get a better look at the shoe goddamnit he stood up took carmel by the arm and said come out here tugging her toward the living room let go of me she tried to pull away i just want you out in the living room with me and in the living room he shouted hello hey anybody here goddamnit carmel took a step back toward the bedroom and lucas said no and he said it with bite and she stopped he looked around stepped into the kitchen got a roll of saranwrap from the kitchen counter and carried it back toward the bedroom she followed behind him and he knelt by the closet door and pushed the shoe away and wrapping his thumb and forefinger with saran wrap picked up the cartridge a he said he looked at her a fuckin you put that there she said bullshit you know i didnt put it there and ill tell you what i bet its got your fingerprints on it i bet itll check out when they do the metallurgy wont it whatd you do drop a box ofs in the closet shuck out a clip or something howd the cartridge get into your closet carmel davenport seemed to recede from her he loomed over her in real space but the pressure on her was so great that he seemed to squeeze down until he looked like a little man seen through the glass peephole on an apartment door carmels brain stopped she couldnt bear this she said something to him but she didnt know what and walked stifflegged out of the bedroom he was talking to her at her reached out to her but she batted his arm away she was screaming back at him but a broken isolated part of her brain seemed to be in control now she walked straight across the living room picked up a fistful of car keys from the entry table and went out the door leaving the door open davenport staring after her saying something incomprehensible at her back out the door down the hall into the elevator pushing blindly at the buttons out the door at five into the parking ramp down the ramp to the blue volvo into the trunk into the gym bag out with the gun because this is where shed put the gun she got from rinker the car with her mothers registration under her mothers new married name nobody to know nobody even to look at such an outofcharacter noncarmellike motor vehicle she marched back through the door propelled by the rage got the elevator where it waited the gun solid in her hand lucas watched her go out the bedroom door thought whoa he followed after her holding the shell he had to tell her that he was taking the shell with him she had to see the shell go in his pocket but something about the way she was walking robotlike across the front room and suddenly he feared shed had some kind of a stroke and he said carmel carmel are you all right then she was gone down the hall he stood uncertainly in the bedroom door for a moment expecting her to come back then flipped out his cell phone punched a speed dial button and said when sherrill answered this is me i think somethings happened to carmel she just went out of here acting weird want us to come back up no ill well maybe yeah come on back think of some reason to come back im gonna check on her lucas walked across the living room out into the hall and she was gone either through the door into the stairway or the elevators lucas walked down to the elevators and pushed the button he bounced on his toes for a moment thought about going down to look at the stairway door then thought about the apartment door and hurried back checked that it wasnt locked and started to pull it shut at that precise moment an elevator dinged and lucas stepped toward it carmel she stepped out of the elevator lucas didnt see it as it was coming up didnt instantly recognize it in the context but then carmel fired at him as the sights crossed the line of his face and saw the surprise and the gun jumped and davenport was moving sideways and down and she felt the rush of a kill and tracked him with the barrel and fired again and again and then lucas felt the first shot sting his neck and then he was moving diving back into the apartment felt another shot across his shoulders and then back in the living room he was rolling across the fabulous carpet as a hornets nest of bullet fragments ricocheted off the door a few feet away as he fought to get upright and oriented his cheek stung then something hit him in the thigh and his own gun was coming out and carmel was in the doorway lucas fired one shot and carmel felt as though shed been hit by a baseball bat the took away a fistsized chunk of skin just below her rib cage and she staggered back hurt bad hurt hospital she still had the keys to the cars in her left hand and she turned and lurched down toward the elevators the doors were just closing and she slapped at the button and they started to open and she looked back and saw lucas peek from behind her doors and she fired again and let herself fall into the elevator lucas fired twice more but had a bad angle at the closing doors one slug hit the doors the other might have slipped inside he crawled toward them and pushed the down button fuckin gun sherrill said to sloan in the lobby their guns coming out that was a fuckin gun a big fuckin gun wait for the elevator its coming down sloan said im taking the stairs too far too far sherrill said but sloan was moving gotta block them gotta block the parking ramp careful she shouted after him call in he shouted back and sherrill got her cell phone out and pushed the speeddial for dispatch and began shouting into it as the numbers came down to five then it stopped and sherrill ran to the stairway and yelled up elevator stopped at five watch the ramp got it sloan called the other elevator was going up again and sherrill without thinking punched the up button trying to get up the first one the elevator that stopped at five started down but the other rose inexorably to twentyseven before it stopped she ran back to the stairway access and shouted after sloan the elevators on twentyseven at that moment the second elevator dinged in the lobby she shouted at the frightened security guard turn off that elevator stop it can you stop it on this floor stop it he ran to the elevator as the door opened but then almost slumped stopping outside of it my god theres blood sherrill pushed him aside saw a puddle of blood in the middle of the carpet how do you stop it she asked pull the red emergencystop button she saw it a red knob the size of her thumb and pulled it out thatll do it yeah that the security guard looked up at the numbers above the elevator doors the other ones coming down oh fuck get out of the way she stood back from the elevator doors her pistol level at gut level remember the chant two in the belly and one in the head knocks a man down and kills him dead then the elevator doors opened and she saw lucas on the floor with his gun pointing at her chest and blood streaming into his eyes and sherrill screamed lucas lucas jesus the elevator seemed to move at a deliberate and insolent crawl carmel pushed herself up realized that her arm was burning looked and saw more blood her body was on fire she staggered into the hallway at five out to the parking ramp the stairwell came up just inside the parking ramp door and somebody was on the stairs coming up fuck you carmel screamed down at the man she could see his arm still three flights down he stopped and looked up at her and she fired the gun once twice sloan braced himself he was only on threeand ahalf confused carmel two shots sailed past and he aimed blindly up and fired once carmel fearless now the pain tightening her fired another shot then another and then got a click shed used up the clip fuck you she screamed again and lurched out into the ramp a dozen steps and she was at the bloodymurder red jag which was right there fumbling with her keys on fire she was on fire she backed out aimed the jag down the ramp and stepped on it sloan heard the parkingramp door bang shut he took another quick peek then another then ran up to the next landing he heard the jag start screech away he was on fourandahalf now he ran back down through the fourthfloor door heard her coming all the way lifted the and as she turned the corner fired a shot at the windshield no effect and the cars back end twitched out as carmel gunned it again and he fired another shot at the drivers side window as she passed him but he was slow and the shot smashed through the back window and then she was down the ramp and around the corner sloan ran back through the door and down to three but at three carmel was already going by and he ran down to two and she was coming and he knew he was too late so he kept going and at one he burst into the lobby and screamed at sherrill shes coming down the ramp as he ran toward the front door he registered lucas on his knees the blood sherrill with the gun and then the red jag blasting through the wooden guard arms at the exit and out into the street wheels screaming car sliding going away from him and sloan ran out into a street full of people and couldnt fire his gun lucas had done an inventory and was shouting not bad not bad and was trying to get up while sherrill screamed lay down youre hurt lay down and lucas finally pushed her roughly out of the way and hobbled toward the front of the building and saw sloan running away down the street and carmels jag just turning the corner at the far end didnt think of this he said trying to grin at sherrill blood trickled down at the corner of his mouth that shed do this she cracked lucas ya gotta sit down the ambulance fuck a bunch of ambulances and they saw people at the other end of the block turning to stare and sherrill shouted shes coming back she went around the block lucas started to run halfhobbled toward the end of the block sherrill finally leaving him to run on ahead her pistol out shouting at people police get away police lucas saw her stop at the curb then raise her gun and the jag came from behind the building and sherrill pointed her pistol at the sky as the jag hurtled by and lucas came up and said jesus christ shes doing a hundred and twenty carmel wasnt feeling much a kind of mute stubbornness a will to do what she pleased she turned the last corner realized that she was going the wrong way on a oneway street and the wrong way in any case the hospital was behind her instead of trying to turn she focused her eyes on the target center the auditorium where the minnesota timberwolves played basketball focused on the building and pressed the gas pedal to the floor she was going seventy at the end of the first block a hundred when davenport saw her at the end of the second the car topped out at the end of the fifth block at about a hundred and thirty she drove straight down the white line between two lanes cars dodging away from her white faces going by like faces on postage stamps halfseen halfrealized frozen in expression she hit a stout black man carrying a grocery sack in which he had milk and cookies and a dozen oranges he never saw her as he crossed at a crosswalk looking into the grocery bag thinking about opening the cookies he was too heavy he shouldnt have bought them his wife would kill him he never saw carmel coming and she hit him with the very center of the jag and he flew over the car as though lifted by angels at a hundred and thirty miles an hour carmel hit the curb outside the target center and the jag went airborne turning tumbling lucas and sherrill watched appalled as the car hit first the black man and then the concrete wall the black man was dead in a tenth of a second hed felt nothing but a sudden apprehension as for carmel the transition from life to death was so sudden that she never felt it in the silence following the shattering impact an even dozen oranges bounced and rolled in the dirt along the street bright and promising like the best parts of a broken life chapter twentyeight charlie ross and his yuppie flipfone pals at the merchants bank in portland oregon had invented a new classification system for women one that went down not up one duckling was a woman who bordered on the acceptable ten ducklings was a truly ugly duckling ross was hacking his way through the billing entries for that months box rentals and incidentally keeping his eye on the safetydeposit counter while the regular clerk was at lunch when a sixduckling came to the counter she was bad news if you were even tempted to throw her a mercy fuck youd want to put a rug over her head first all of that went through rosss bottlecapsized brain as he pushed himself up from the desk and dragged his lardass over to the counter the woman was small darkhaired olivecomplected she had a mole by the corner of her mouth a notable mole nearly black and another one beside her nose and she wore oversized glasses the kind that are supposed to turn dark in sunlight but always made your eyes look yellow when you were indoors she handed him a key and he took it ran it through the file machine found her card and brought it to the counter for her to sign but she was no longer looking at him she was looking at the television that the bank had screwed to the ceiling of the lounge area where visitors waited while their spouses or friends went into the vault the tv was permanently tuned to cnn headline news which at that moment was showing the wreck of a bloodyred jaguar that had plowed halfway through a cementblock wall maam ross said maam can i help you the woman apparently didnt hear him as she drifted closer to the tv listening looking up at it her mouth halfopen happened last night ross said helpfully hed already seen the loop a dozen timesthe ugly duckling watched until another story started this one involving a dog getting oxygen from a fireman then turned back to the counter he dropped her from six ducklings to four she had a really nice ass like a gymnasts she seemed dazed hope it wasnt somebody you knew ross said no no i just wish they wouldnt show so much violence on tv rinker said she signed the card and pushed it across the desk at him he noticed that her hand was trembling and he hoped it wasnt some weird foreign disease lucas had been patched up in the emergency room and sent home the patching had been messy a slug had burned through the skin on the side of his neck leaving a groove which was sewn closed a fragment of lead hed been hit by a storm of ricochet fragments had pierced the skin on his skull behind his right ear but hadnt reached the bone the fragment was removed with tweezers and two stitches used to close the wound just like that wooden head guy sherrill said happily shed cheered up a lot when the doctors said that he wasnt badly injured another fragment had struck his hip which also made sherrill happy hit in the butt she said hip looks like a big butt to me she said your hip is over here on the side more fragments were taken from his side and legs to get at one just over his kidney the doc had to make an additional small cut the wounds in his legs were all superficial but nasty three got stitches when it was done they gave him a sample pack of ibuprofen and told him not to play basketball that weekend thats it he grumped dont play basketball well we also extend our deepest sympathy the doctor said lucas got down from the examining table put on his pants tottered to the door you know what hurts the most he asked sherrill i really dove into her apartment she was blasting away and i really racked up my elbow and ribs im gonna be sore for a week better than the alternative she said he was sore for a week and hobbled by the feeling that all the stitches were about to unravel but the stitches came out on thursday and by friday when malone came to town with her fbi team he was beginning to loosen up no sign of rinker malone said she was sitting in his visitors chair wearing a somber blue suit with a red necktie but well get her i dont know lucas said shes smart and she had nine or ten years to figure out how to hide she could be here in the us up in canada australia india the caribbean and with her spanish anywhere in south america god only knows how much money she had by the end we put her out of business anyway i just wish id been here for the shootout with carmel really why i mean if i coulda gotten wounded like you did you know not too bad but go to the hospital excuse me but i think you left your brain out in the hall lucas said youre just an ignorant local cop malone said you know what its worth to be an fbi agent wounded in the line of duty and if youre a woman my god id be up there like an underassistant deputy director or something at least she said so howre you feeling not bad i could probably manage a foxtrot if somebody pressed me on it consider yourself pressed she said on monday sherrill went to the fbi office to make a statement when she came back she dropped into lucas visitors chair and said i just talked to malone yeah he was peering into the thick black volume of the equality report he was on page fivetwentynine less than a hundred to go pushing a boulder up a hill would have been a snap compared to the report does she still think shes gonna catch rinker i dont know exactly what she thinks sherrill said when i talked to her friday afternoon she was like really quick incisive executive maybe thats the word i was looking for really tightly wound you know lucas turned the page kept reading but this morning i mean she was a lot looser hair was a little messed up you know she actually giggled once lipstick wasnt quite straight now lucas looked up what giggled like girlygiggled in fact she looked like somebody whod had her brains foxtrotted loose detective sherrill arent you in the middle of a case i mean ive got to read this report thats what i thought sherrill said the commission had nine members the chairman a desperately fading politician named bob once known in the state house for his fine ethics and viciously ridiculed in the same institution after he lost his seat to a twentysixyear old spitballer seven members of affected constituencies and lucas after the routine roberts rules of order opening the meeting devolved into a nasty fight about whether adding to the list of minority or disability statuses would dilute the authority of prior assertions of those statuses or thats what lucas thought somebody said he wasnt sure passing through a bookstore earlier in the day hed discovered that donald westlake had revived the richard stark parker novels and lucas had backflash buried in the pages of the report by the end of the meeting he was more than halfway through just finishing a chapter that ended with the word asshole he agreed the night was straight out of a countryandwestern song one of those smooth warm evenings made for rolling around in a hay mow with a farm girl even the traffic seemed subdued as though people had abandoned their cars to walk lucas neighborhood was quiet with only occasional cars rolling along the boulevard between his house and the bluff that dropped to the mississippi as he pulled into the driveway he realized that he needed milk and cereal if he wanted to eat at home the next morning and hed noticed a slight puffiness around the waist that needed to be trimmed away and eating in a diner wouldnt help that he thought about it and decided to leave the car in the driveway he popped the door swivelled reached back to pick up the copy of the report and the novel started to climb out of the car and saw her coming she was coming fast from the corner of the garage and though it was dark and late he knew exactly who she was he could just make out her height and the smooth way she moved a small woman like a dancer she was handicapped by the car she had to clear around it she had expected him to drive inside and then she would have had him trapped between the porsche and the big chevy tahoe parked on the other side of the garage but she was ready and he could see her hand up with her gun and he reached desperately for his and at the same time threw up the report in front of his face and the explosions started the night flashes he was going down as the report came up and the report flew out of his hand of its own will and he concentrated on clearing his holster which wasnt made for fast draws concentrated on jacking the slide and he triggered the first shot blindly the shot went into the car at an upward angle and punched through the windshield he hit the ground and rolled fired again still halfblindly just trying to slow her down to shake her saw another flash felt a slug pluck at his suit fired at the flash rolled back toward the car and fired under it at where he thought she was sensed that she was moving fired again she was running he could feel it maybe hear it later doubted that he could hear it the gun blasts which he hadnt heard at the time must have been deafening and he fired in the general direction she was running the slug going through the front of the house then he was after her running through the wonderful warm night she was dressed all in black but he could see her in the lights of the house windows and the porches running crazily across his back yard crashing through bushes over a chainlink fence he was running as hard as he could handicapped by his loafers one of them came off as he cleared the fence she swivelled as she ran and fired two more quick shots at him wildly but he ducked away purely by instinct lifted the pistol but saw window lights behind it and held off still running she crossed another fence a higher one and now he was only a hundred feet back and then she ran up a ladder that was leaning against the back of a low rambler kicked the ladder sideways and ran up the roof he risked the shot this time it should hit the mississippi or the far river bank but it was a bad shot and then she was over the ridge of the roof and out of sight he tried to run around the side of the house but hit a garbage pail and went down got up ran another few feet and hit a lawn mower and went down again got up and ran out onto the lawn she was gone the homeowner was at the door yelling and lucas screamed call the cops theres been a shooting call he had to pick a direction and he picked north since that had been her tendency he ran hard for a hundred feet kicked off the second shoe stopped at the street corner looked wildly up and down started to run west turned back nobody there she was gone the st paul cops arrived three minutes later malone looking businesslike again in a light tweed jacket and carefully ironed pleatedfront blouse said valuable information we know shes still in the states which suggests to me that she wasnt planning to leave well get her maybe lucas said he was fiddling with a yellow no pencil since the crime lab had taken the report away he didnt have anything to fiddle with have some faith malone said after all youre the only guy who ever survived her ah it was a complete fuckup lucas said i fired five shots and never hit her she fired more than that and never hit me we mustve been five feet apart for a couple of seconds youre complaining about her bad shooting well she would have put a couple right through your brain if you hadnt had that report and hadnt managed to throw it up in time fuckin report lucas grumbled now i miss the goddamn thing took two in the heart for me malone pushed up out of her chair listen im heading back to dc really i thought you were gonna be here for a while too much going on back home malone said im flying out tomorrow morning well jeez lucas said uh you think youd have time tonight you know we could go foxtrotting again winding down kissing malone goodbye at the airport careful at nights carmel then clara rinker out of his life he hoped a week after the visit from clara lucas sat in his office rereading a note from del a woman had been referred to him through hippie friends she claimed that her abusive husband was actually a russian spy a mole when del checked the guy had no past that went back before he was carrying the name of a montana boy whod died in what should he do shit lucas didnt know call the state department the phone rang and he picked it up took me a little while to get switched to you rinker said he picked up the accent instantly could almost smell the french fries and beer at the rink bureaucracy lucas said are you all right yeah but you scared the hell out of me i took a little glass in my shoulder from when that slug went through the car window what can i tell you no way to trace this no way to call anybody no way to let anyone know he was talking to the new number one on the fbis mostwanted list i never touched you did i she asked no but you screwed up a perfectly good ermenegildo zegna sport coat lucas said i gotta find a place to have it rewoven and i had these nice slacks italian slacks theyre ruined aw too bad ill tell you what the thing that got me was the flash from that weapon of yours what was that a yeah exactly i couldnt see anything i was hiding by that evergreen of yours the one by the garage juniper yeah my eyes were so adjusted to the dark that when you flashed me there was nothing i could do but keep pulling the trigger i couldnt see anything never thought of that but heck it was my first time for a gunfight you got lucky you didnt put that ladder up there did you as a way out nope just luck damnit i almost killed myself trying to run around that house i hit a lawn mower scraped a piece of skin the size of a dollar bill off my shins cmon lucas all youve done is whine what im saying is if youd gone that way you wouldve hit them i wouldve been all over you and now youd be dead instead of sitting in an office maybe not lucas said a little steel in his voice after a moment of silence rinker asked that fbi chick that came into my bar with you i saw her on tv yeah yeah she said im a monster what youre insulted he laughed yeah yeah you ever nail her lucas sighed and said jesus and then yeah i guess i did congratulations she looked like she needed it thats kinda catty lucas said shes a really nice woman we were just talking about you in fact where in the hell are you youd tell rinker said no i wouldnt of course he would philadelphia i just cleaned out a safedeposit box my last stop and i thought id give you a call as long as this pay phone was right here he could hear the cars in the background i wanted you to know i was really pissed about carmel she could have been a good friend i dont have any of those i dont think so lucas said for carmel friends were expendable look at hale allen i mean christ she thought she was in love with him and bang she kills him or was that you that was her he was screwing around on her aw come on clara what she was doing to him was the next thing to date rapethe guy had no ability to resist she killed him in one minute and shed have done the same to you sooner or later all right rinker said then you still after me if you come back here ill kill you lucas said maybe and what if i dont come back i wont be after you but theres still the feebs who the fbi theyre putting the screws on wooden head i hope they send him away for a hundred fuckin years rinker said he tried to get me killed i was a little worried about that lucas said when we hit your apartment we found blood on the floor we thought maybe your mafia pals had decided you were too much of a risk they did but i talked them out of it we ever gonna find them who the two guys in tweed lucas said im gonna ignore that question okay well i didnt really think you were dead i just didnt think youd come back after me i thought that was sort of unprofessional really my counselor at wichita said i was too goaloriented i decided this one time id forget the goal which was to hide and just let it all out express myself for a friend in her memory that was thoughtful of you lucas said ill tell you what and he laughed again what we had fifteen people looking for you at her funeral really i was a thousand miles away but she was pleased we didnt want to take the chance it was like a chinese fire drill out there cops scrambling all over the place trying to stay out of sight tv guys taking pictures of them big scopes hiding in poison ivy i wore a kevlar outfit that was so goddamn hot i almost died of heat stroke thats flattering anyway she sighed and said well i gotta go ive got so much to do heading out to where costa rica mexico chile those are the top three guesses lucas said not bad but they should have included the coast of venezuela lot of americanos down there everythings cheap life is easy ill tell them do that gotta run she said and just before she hung up im faster than you no way sweetheart she laughed a light southernbelle sound her laughter was cut by the click of the phone going down somewhere in philadelphia lucas thought right at this minute getting into an unremarkable car headed for an obscure destination number one on the most wanted list number one with a bullet
