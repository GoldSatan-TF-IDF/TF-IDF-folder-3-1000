prologue salem village massachusetts june in the dark green shadows of the deep woods an hour before moonrise they met in secret soon the longest day would become the shortest night of the solstice there would be no celebration no rite of thanksgiving for the light the warmth on this sabbat of litha this midsummer was a time of ignorance and of death the three who met met in fear have we all we need the one known here as air pulled her hood closer so that not a single pale lock of hair could be seen in the light of the dying day what we have shall do earth laid her parcel on the ground the part of her that wanted to weep and to rage over what had been done over what was to come was buried deep with her head bent her thick brown hair fell forward free is there no other way for us air touched a hand to earths shoulder and both looked at the third she stood slim and straight there was sorrow in her eyes but behind it lived a firm purpose she who was fire threw back her hood in a gesture of defiance curling waves of red spilled out it is because of our way there is no other they will hunt us down like thieves and brigands murder us as they have already murdered a poor innocent bridget bishop was not a witch earth spoke bitterly as she rose to her feet no and so she told the court of oyer and terminer so she swore yet they hanged her murdered over the lies of a few young girls and the ravings of the fanatics who smell brimstone in every breath of air but there have been petitions air linked her fingers together like a woman preparing to pray or plead not everyone supports the court or this terrible persecution too little earth murmured and far too late it will not end with one death i have seen it fire closed her eyes saw again the horrors to come our protection cannot outlast the hunt they will find us and they will destroy us we have done nothing air dropped her hands to her sides no harm what harm did bridget bishop do fire countered what harm have any of the others accused and waiting trial done to the people of salem town sarah osborne died in a boston prison for what crime temper lanced through her hot and keen and was ruthlessly rejected even now she refused to let power be stained by anger and hate the blood is up in these puritans she continued these pioneers fanatics they are and they will bring a wave of death before sanity returns if we could help we cannot stop it sister no fire nodded at earth all we can do is survive so we leave this place the home we made here the lives we might have led here and make another gently she cupped airs face in her hands grieve not for what can never be but celebrate what can we are the three and we will not be vanquished in this place we will be lonely we will be together and in that last flicker of the day they cast the circle one by two by three fire ringed around the earth and the wind lifted the flames high inside the magic circle they formed another joining hands accepting now air lifted her face to the sky as night takes the day we offer this light we are true to the way and stand for the right truth here is done a circle of one earth defiant raised her voice this hour is our last upon this ground present future past we will not be found strength not rue a circle of two we offered our craft with harm to none but the hunt for our blood has already begun we will make our place away from here fire lifted joined hands high away from death away from fear power lives free a circle of three the wind kicked the earth trembled and the magic fire speared through the night three voices rose in unison away from hate let this land be torn lift it from fear from death and scorn carve rock carve tree carve hill and stream carry us with it on midsummer moonbeam out past the cliff and out past the shore to be severed from this land forever more we take our island out to the sea as we will so mote it be and a great roar sounded in the forest a swirling torrent of wind a wild leap of fire while those who hunted what they never understood slept in their righteous beds an island rose up toward sky circled madly toward sea settled safe and serene on quiet waves and took its first breath of life on that shortest night chapter one contents prev next three sisters island june she kept staring straight ahead as the knuckle of land bumpy and green with distance began revealing its secrets the lighthouse of course what was an offshore new england island without its stalwart spear this one pure and dazzling white rose on a craggy cliff just as it should nell thought there was a stone house near it foggray in the sharp summer sunlight with peaked roofs and gables and what she hoped was a widows walk circling the top story shed seen paintings of the light of the sisters and the house that stood so strong and firm beside it it was the one shed seen in the little shop on the mainland the one that had sent her impulsively to the car ferry shed been following impulse and instinct for six months just two months after her meticulous and hardworked plan had freed her every moment of those first two months had been terror then gradually terror had eased to anxiety and a different kind of fear almost like a hunger that she would lose what she had found again she had died so she could live now she was tired of running of hiding of losing herself in crowded cities she wanted a home wasnt that what shed always wanted a home roots family friends the familiar that never judged too harshly maybe she would find some part of that here on this spit of land cradled by the sea surely she could get no farther away from los angeles than this pretty little island not unless she left the country altogether if she couldnt find work on the island she could still take a few days there a kind of vacation from flight she decided she would enjoy the rocky beaches the little village she would climb the cliffs and roam the thick wedge of forest shed learned how to celebrate and cherish every moment of being it was something she would never ever forget again delighted with the scatter of clapboard cottages tucked back from the dock she leaned on the rail of the ferry let the wind blow through her hair it was back to its natural sundrenched blond when shed run shed hacked it short as a boys gleefully snipping off the long tumbling curls then dying it deep brown over the past months shed changed the color periodically bright red coal black a soft sable brown she still kept it fairly short and very straight it said something didnt it that shed finally been able to let it be something about reclaiming herself she thought evan had liked it long with a riot of curls at times he had dragged her by it across the floor down the stairs using it like chains no she would never wear it long again a shudder ran through her and she glanced quickly over her shoulder scanning the cars the people her mouth went dry her throat hot as she searched for a tall slim man with gilded hair and eyes as pale and hard as glass he wasnt there of course he was three thousand miles away she was dead to him hadnt he told her a hundred times that the only way she would be free of him was in death helen remington had died so nell channing could live furious with herself for going back even for a moment in her mind nell tried to calm herself she breathed in slowly salt air water freedom as her shoulders relaxed again a tentative smile played around her mouth she stayed at the rail a small woman with short sunny hair that danced cheerfully around a delicate face her mouth unpainted and soft curved up and teased out the hint of dimples in her cheeks pleasure brought a rosy glow to her skin she wore no makeup another deliberate act there was a part of her that was still hiding still hunted and she did whatever she could to pass unnoticed once she had been considered a beauty and had groomed herself accordingly shed dressed as shed been told to dress wearing sleek sexy sophisticated clothes selected by a man who claimed to love her above all things shed known the feel of silk against her skin what it was to casually clasp diamonds around her throat helen remington had known all the privileges of great wealth and for three years had lived in fear and misery nell wore a simple cotton shirt over faded jeans her feet were comfortable in cheap white sneakers her only jewelry was an antique locket that had been her mothers some things were too precious to leave behind as the ferry slowed to dock she walked back to her car she would arrive on three sisters with one small bag of belongings a rusted secondhand buick and to her name she couldnt have been happier nothing she thought as she parked the car near the docks and began to wander on foot could have been farther from the pleasure palaces and glitz of beverly hills and nothing she realized had ever called more truly to her soul than this little postcard village houses and shops were both tidy and prim with their colors faded by sea salt and sun cobblestone streets were curvy and whistleclean as they climbed the hilly terrain or arrowed back to the docks gardens were lovingly tended as if weeds were illegal dogs barked behind picket fences and children rode bikes of cherry red and electric blue the docks themselves were a study in industry boats and nets and ruddycheeked men in tall rubber boots she could smell fish and sweat she hiked up the hill from the docks and turned to look back from there she could see the tour boats plugging along in the bay and the little sickle slash of sand beach where people spread out on towels or bobbed in the energetic surf a little red tram with white letters that read three sisters tours was rapidly filling up with daytrippers and their cameras fishing and tourism she supposed were what kept the island afloat but that was economics it stood against sea storms and time surviving and flourishing at its own pace that she thought was courage it had taken her too long to find her own high street speared across the hill shops and restaurants and what she supposed were island businesses lined it one of the restaurants should be her first stop she thought it was possible she could hook a job as a waitress or shortorder cook at least for the summer season if she could find work she could hunt up a room she could stay in a few months people would know her theyd wave as she walked by or call out her name she was so tired of being a stranger of having no one to talk to no one who cared she stopped to study the hotel unlike the other buildings it was stone instead of wood its three stories with elaborate gingerbread iron balconies and peaked roofs were undeniably romantic the name suited it she decided the magick inn it was a good bet that shed find work there waitressing in the dining room or as part of the housekeeping staff a job was the first order of business but she couldnt make herself go inside deal with it she wanted time first a little time before she settled down to the practical flighty evan would have said youre much too flighty and foolish for your own good helen thank god you have me to take care of you because his voice played all too clearly in her ears because the words nipped at the confidence shed slowly rebuilt she turned deliberately away and walked in the opposite direction she would get a damn job when she was ready to but for now she was going to wander to play tourist to explore when she was finished roaming high street shed go back to her car and drive all over the island she wouldnt even stop at the island tourist board to get a map following her nose she hitched up her backpack and crossed the street she passed craft shops gift shops loitered at the windows she enjoyed pretty things that sat on shelves without purpose one day when she settled again shed make a home just as she pleased full of clutter and fun and color an ice cream shop made her smile there were round glass tables and white iron chairs a family of four sat at one laughing as they spooned up whipped cream and confetticolored sprinkles a boy wearing a white cap and apron stood behind the counter and a girl in snug cutoff jeans flirted with him as she considered her choices nell sketched the picture in her mind and walked on the bookstore stopped her made her sigh her home would be full of books too but not rare first editions never meant to be opened and read shed have old scarred books shiny new paperbacks all in a jumble of stories in fact that was one thing she could start now a paperback novel wouldnt add much weight to her pack if she had to move on she looked up from the display in the window to the gothic lettering spilling across the glass café book well that was perfect she would hunt through the stacks find something fun to read and look through it over a cup of coffee she stepped inside to air that was fragrant with flowers and spice and heard music played on pipes and harps not only the hotel was magic nell thought the minute she crossed the threshold books in a banquet of colors and shapes lined deep blue shelves overhead tiny pricks of light showered down from the ceiling like stars the checkout counter was an old oak cabinet deeply carved with winged faeries and crescent moons a woman with dark choppy hair sat on a high stool behind it idly paging through a book she glanced up and adjusted silverframed reading glasses morning can i help you im just going to look around if thats all right enjoy let me know if i can help you find anything as the clerk went back to her book nell roamed across the room two generous chairs faced a stone hearth on the table between stood a lamp fashioned from a figurine of a robed woman with her arms lifted high other shelves held trinkets statues of colored stone crystal eggs dragons she wandered through passing books on one side rows of candles on the other at the rear stairs curved to the second floor she climbed and found more books more trinkets and the café half a dozen tables of glossy wood were arranged near the front window along the side was a glass display and counter boasting an impressive array of pastries sandwiches and a kettle of that days soup the prices were on the high side but not unreasonable nell thought she might have some soup to go with her coffee moving closer she heard the voices from the open door behind the counter jane this is ridiculous and totally irresponsible it is not its tims big chance and its a way off this damn island were taking it the possibility of an audition for a play that may or may not be produced off broadway is not a big chance neither one of you will have a job you wont were going mia i told you id work till noon today and i worked till noon you told me that less than twentyfour hours ago there was impatience in the voice a low lovely voice unable to help herself nell edged closer how the hell am i going to keep the café up without anyone to cook its all about you isnt it you cant even wish us luck jane ill wish you a miracle because thats what its going to take no wait dont go off in a huff nell caught movement in the doorway and stepped to the side but she didnt move out of earshot be careful be happy oh damn it blessed be jane okay there was a loud sniffle im sorry really im sorry for leaving you in the lurch this way but tim needs to do this and i need to be with tim so ill miss you mia ill write nell managed to duck behind shelves just as a weeping woman raced out of the back and ran down the stairs well isnt this just fine nell peeked out blinked in automatic admiration the woman who stood in the doorway was a vision nell couldnt think of another word for her she had a mass of hair the color of autumn leaves reds and golds spilled over the shoulders of a long blue dress that left her arms bare to the silver bracelets that winked bright on each wrist her eyes sparking with temper were gray as smoke and dominated a flawless face slashing cheekbones a full wide mouth painted siren red skin like nell had heard skin compared to alabaster but this was the first time shed seen it she was tall willowslim and perfect nell glanced toward the café tables to see if any of the customers who loitered there were as awestruck as she herself but no one seemed to notice the woman or the temper swirling around her like water on the boil she inched out to get a better look and those gray eyes shifted pinned her hello can i help you i was i thought id like a cup of cappuccino and a bowl of soup please annoyance flashed in mias eyes and nearly sent nell back behind the shelves i can handle the soup we have lobster bisque today im afraid the espresso machine is beyond my current capabilities nell looked at the beautiful copperandbrass machine felt a little tingle i could make it myself you know how to work this thing yes actually i do considering mia gestured and nell scurried behind the counter i could make you one while im at it why not brave little rabbit mia mused as she watched nell take over the machine just what sent you to my door backpacking no oh nell flushed remembering her pack no just exploring a little im looking for a job and a room ah excuse me i know it was rude but i overheard your conversation if i understand it correctly youre in a bit of a jam i can cook mia watched the steam rise listened to the hiss can you im a very good cook nell offered mia the frothing coffee ive done catering ive worked in a bakery and ive waitressed i know how to prepare food and how to serve it how old are you twentyeight do you have a criminal record a giggle nearly burst out of nells throat for a moment it danced lively in her eyes no im tediously honest a dependable worker and a creative cook dont babble dont babble she ordered herself but she couldnt seem to stop i need the job because id like to live on the island id like a job here because i enjoy books and i liked the well the feel of your shop as soon as i walked in intrigued mia angled her head and what did you feel possibilities excellent answer mia mused do you believe in possibilities nell considered yes ive had to excuse me a couple stepped up to the counter wed like to have two iced mochas and two of those éclairs of course just a moment mia turned back to nell youre hired aprons in the back well work out the details later today she sipped her cappuccino well done she added and stepped out of the way oh whats your name im nell nell channing welcome to three sisters nell channing mia devlin ran café book the way she ran her life with a style born out of instinct and largely for her personal amusement she was a crafty businesswoman who enjoyed making a profit but always on her own terms what bored her she ignored what intrigued her she pursued at the moment nell channing intrigued her if nell had been exaggerating her skills mia would have fired her as quickly as shed hired her and with no regret she may have if the spirit moved her helped nell secure a job elsewhere but that wouldnt have taken much time or interfered with her business shed have taken that step only because something about nell had tugged at her the instant those big blue eyes met hers injured innocence that had been mias first impression and she trusted her first impressions implicitly competence as well mia thought though the confidence was a little shaky still once nell had suited up and started work at the café shed steadied in that area too mia observed her through the afternoon noted that she handled the food orders the customers the cash register and the baffling mystery of the espresso machine smoothly theyd need to spruce her up a bit mia decided they were casual on the island but the ancient jeans were a bit too laidback for mias personal taste satisfied for the moment mia walked back into the café kitchen it impressed her that the counters and appliances were clean jane had never managed to be a tidy cook even though most of the baked goods had been prepared by her offsite nell taken by surprise nell jolted and spun around from the stove where shed been scrubbing burners her cheeks flushed as she looked at mia and the young woman beside her didnt mean to startle you this is peg she works the counter from two to seven oh hello hi jeez i cant believe jane and tim are just leaving new york city peg sounded a bit envious she was little and perky with a mop of curly hair bleached nearly white jane made awesome blueberry muffins yes well jane and her muffins arent here anymore i need to talk to nell now so youre in charge of the café no problem catch you later nell why dont we use my office well get to those details were open from ten to seven summer hours in the winter we cut back and close at five peg prefers the afternoon shift she likes to party and isnt a morning person in any case since we start serving at ten ill need you here in the morning thats okay with me she followed mia up another flight of steps she hadnt paid attention nell realized she hadnt known the shop had three floors a few months before she would never have missed that detail shed have checked out the space the exits relaxing didnt mean getting sloppy she reminded herself she had to be ready at any time to run again they passed a large storeroom lined with bookshelves and stacked with boxes then went through a doorway into mias office the antique cherry desk suited her nell thought she imagined mia surrounded by the rich and the beautiful there were flowers here and thriving plants little bits of crystal and polished rocks in bowls along with the stylish furnishings were a topoftheline computer a fax filing cabinets and shelves for publishers catalogs mia gestured to a chair and took the one behind the desk for herself you had a few hours in the café so youve seen the type of fare we offer theres a specialty sandwich each day the days soup a small selection of alternate sandwiches two or three varieties of cold salads pastries cookies muffins biscotti in the past i left the menu choices up to the cook are you comfortable with that yes maam please im barely a year older than you its mia until were sure this is going to work id prefer you make up the next days menu for my approval she took a legal pad out of the drawer passed it across the desk why dont you write down what you have in mind for tomorrow panic wanted to crawl through her tremble in her fingers nell took a deep breath waited until her mind was blank and clear then began to write this time of year i think we should keep the soups light herbed consommé tortellini salad a white bean and a shrimp id do a spicedchicken pita for the sandwich and a vegetarian selection but id have to see whats in season i can make you tarts again depending on what looks good fruitwise the éclairs are popular i can duplicate those a sixlayer chocolateandcream torte awesome blueberry muffins as well as walnut youre low on hazelnut biscotti cookies chocolate chip is never wrong macadamia instead of a third cookie id offer brownies i make an irresistible triplefudge brownie how much can you prepare onsite all of it i guess but if youre going to serve the pastries and muffins starting at ten ill need to start about six if you had your own kitchen oh well what a lovely fantasy that was id prep some of the menu the night before bake fresh in the morning umhmm how much money do you have nell channing enough dont be prickly mia advised breezily i can advance you a hundred dollars going against a salary to start of seven an hour youll log your shopping cooking hours daily youll charge what you need foodwise to the stores account ill want the receipts again daily when nell opened her mouth to speak mia simply lifted one slim coraltipped finger wait youll be expected to serve and to clear tables when theres a rush and to assist customers in the book section on your level during lulls you get two halfhour breaks sundays off and a fifteen percent employee discount on purchases not including food or drink which unless you turn out to be a glutton will be part of your perks with me so far yes but i good im here every day if you have a question or problem you cant handle get me if im not available go to lulu shes usually at the counter on the main floor and she knows everything you look quick enough to catch on if you dont know an answer dont be afraid to ask now youre looking for a place to stay yes it was like being swept away by a fast unexpected wind i hope to come with me mia pulled a set of keys out of a drawer pushed away from the desk and clipped out she wore gorgeous needlethin heels nell noted once they were on the main level she walked straight toward a rear door lulu she called out back in ten feeling clumsy and foolish nell followed her through the back exit and into a small garden paved with steppingstones a huge black cat sunned itself on one of them and blinked open one luminous gold eye as mia stepped nimbly over thats isis she wont trouble you shes beautiful is the garden your work yes no place is a home without flowers oh i didnt ask do you have transportation yes i have a car it can loosely be called transportation thats handy you wont have far to go but itd be troublesome to cart your goods on foot every day at the edge of the lot she turned left kept up her brisk pace passed the backs of shops across from neatly kept houses ms im sorry i dont know your last name its devlin but i told you to call me mia mia im grateful for the job for the chance and i can promise you you wont be sorry but can i ask where were going you need a place she turned a corner stopped and gestured that should do it across the narrow side street sat a little yellow house like a cheerful sunbeam at the edge of a tiny grove of stunted trees the shutters were white as was the narrow strip of porch there were flowers there too in a happy dance of bright summer colors it sat back from the road on a neat square of lawn with trees tucking it into shade and dappled sunlight is this your house nell asked yes for the moment jingling the keys mia walked up the flagstone path i bought it last spring had been compelled to mia remembered an investment shed told herself though she a businesswoman down to the bone had done nothing so far about renting it out shed waited just as she understood the house had waited she unlocked the front door stepped back its been blessed excuse me mia only nodded welcome the furnishings were sparse a simple sofa that desperately needed recovering a deepcushioned chair a scatter of tables bedrooms on either side though the one to the left is more suited to an office or study the bathrooms minute but charming and the kitchens been modernized and should do very well its straight back ive worked on the gardens but they need more care theres no ac but the furnace works still youll be glad the fireplace works as well come january its wonderful unable to resist nell wandered poking her head in the main bedroom where a pretty bed with a white iron headboard stood like a fairy cottage you must love living here i dont live here you do nell turned back slowly there was mia in the center of the little room her hands cupped together with the keys in her palm light beamed through the two front windows and seemed to set her hair to flame i dont understand you need a place i have a place i live on the cliffs i prefer it there this is your place for now dont you feel it she only knew she felt happy and full of nerves at the same time and that the moment shed stepped into the house shed wanted to stretch and settle very much like the cat in the sunshine i can stay here lifes been hard hasnt it mia murmured that youd tremble at good fortune youll pay rent for nothing that comes free holds its value well work the terms out of your salary settle in youll have to come back and sign forms and so on but that can wait for the morning island market is your best source for the ingredients youll need for tomorrows menu ill let them know youre coming so you can charge to the store account any pots pans whatever are your expense but ill float that until the end of the month i expect to see you and your creations by ninethirty sharp she stepped over and dropped the keys into nells limp hand any questions too many to know where to begin i dont know how to thank you dont waste your tears little sister mia replied theyre too precious youll work hard for what you make here i cant wait to get started nell held out her hand thank you mia their hands touched clasped a spark snapped out blue as flame and quickly gone with a half laugh nell jerked back must be a lot of static or something in the air or something well welcome home nell turning mia started for the door mia emotion gathered in her throat ached there i said this was like a fairy cottage you must be my fairy godmother mias smile was dazzling and her laughter low and rich as warmed cream youll find out soon enough im far from it im just a practical witch dont forget to bring me the receipts she added and quietly closed the door behind her chapter two contents prev next the village nell decided was a bit like brigadoon as seen by nathaniel hawthorne shed taken some time to explore before shed gone to the market for months shed told herself she was safe she was free but for the first time wandering the pretty streets with their quaint houses breathing in the sea air listening to the sharp new england voices she felt safe and free no one knew her but they would they would know nell channing the clever cook who lived in the little cottage in the wood she would make friends here and a life a future nothing from the past would touch her here one day she would be as much a part of the island as the narrow post office with its faded gray wood or the tourist center cobbled together by old clinker bricks and the long sturdy dock where fishermen brought their daily catch to celebrate she bought a wind chime fashioned of stars that she saw in a shop window it was her first purchase for pleasure in nearly a year she spent her first night on the island in the lovely bed hugging her happiness to her as she listened to the stars ring and the sea breathe she was up before sunrise eager to begin while the days soup simmered she rolled out pastry dough shed spent every penny she had including most of the advance and a good portion of her next months salary on kitchen tools it didnt matter she would have the best and produce the best mia devlin her benefactor would never have cause to regret taking her on everything in the kitchen was precisely as she wanted it not as shed been told it must be when she had time she would make a run to the islands garden center for herbs some she would plant outside the windowsill all cluttered together the way she liked things to be nothing absolutely nothing in her home would be uniform and precise and stylishly sleek she wouldnt have acres of marble or seas of glass or towering urns of terrifyingly exotic flowers without warmth or scent there wouldnt be she stopped herself it was time to stop reminding herself of what wouldnt be and plan what would be yesterday would hound her until she firmly closed the door on it and shot the bolt while the sun came up turning the eastfacing windows to flame she slid the first batch of tarts into the oven she remembered the rosycheeked woman who had helped her at the market dorcas burmingham such a fine yankee name nell thought and full of welcome and curiosity the curiosity would have shut nell down once turned her inward but shed been able to chat to answer some questions breezily and avoid others tarts cooled on the rack and muffins went into the oven as the kitchen filled with light nell sang to welcome the day lulu folded her arms over her skinny chest it was mia knew her way of trying to look intimidating as lulu barely inched up to five feet weighed ninety pounds soaking wet and had the face of a woeful pixie it took work for her to look intimidating you dont know anything about her i know shes alone looking for work and in the right place at the right time shes a stranger you dont just hire a stranger and lend her money give her a house without at least doing a background check not one reference mia not one for all you know shes a psychopath running from the law youve been reading true crime books again havent you lulu scowled an expression that on her harmless face approximated a pained smile there are bad people in the world yes there are mia printed out the mailorder requests that had come through her computer without them wed have no balance no challenge shes running from something lu but not the law and fate pointed her here it brought her to me and sometimes fates a backstabber im well aware of that with the printouts in hand mia walked out of the office lulu on her heels only the fact that lulu cabot had essentially raised her prevented mia from telling her to mind her own business and you should know i can protect myself you take in strays your guard goes down shes not a stray shes a seeker theres a difference i felt something from her mia added as she started downstairs to fill the orders when shes more comfortable ill look closer at least get a reference mia lifted a brow as she heard the back door open i just got one shes prompt dont poke at her lulu mia ordered as she handed the printouts over shes also tender yet well good morning nell good morning arms full of covered trays nell breezed in i pulled my car around back thats all right isnt it thats just fine need a hand oh no thanks i have everything stacked in the car lulu this is nell you can get acquainted later nice to meet you lulu ill just start setting things up you go right ahead mia waited until nell climbed the stairs looks dangerous doesnt she lulu set her jaw looks can be deceiving moments later nell jogged downstairs again she wore a plain white tshirt tucked into her jeans the little gold locket lay against it like a charm i started a first pot of coffee ill bring some down next trip but i dont know how you like it black for me sweet and light for lu thanks um would you mind not going up to the café until ive finished id really like you to see the whole presentation so just she backed toward the door face flushed as she spoke wait okay eager to please mia commented as she and lulu filled the orders eager to work yes definite psychopathic tendencies call the cops shut up twenty minutes later breathless jangled with pleasure and nerves nell came downstairs again can you come up now i still have time to change things around if it doesnt suit you oh could you come too lulu mia said you know everything about the shop so youd know if it doesnt look the way it should hmph grudgingly lulu stopped ringing up the mail orders cafés not my department but with a shrug she followed mia and nell upstairs the display case was brimming with glossy pastries widetopped muffins and scones popping with golden currants a tall torte gleamed under a sleek chocolate frosting and laces of whipped cream cookies as big as a mans palm covered two delicate white sheets of bakers paper wafting out of the kitchen was the scent of soup simmering on the chalkboard written in a fine and careful hand were the days specials the glass had been polished to a gleam the coffee was irresistibly fragrant and a pale blue canning jar filled with cinnamon sticks stood on the counter mia walked up and down the display like a general inspecting troops while nell stood struggling not to wring her hands i didnt put the salads and the soup out yet i thought if i waited till around eleven for that people would be more apt to go for the pastries therere more tarts in the back and the brownies i didnt put them out because well i think people want them more if it doesnt look as if youre oversupplied and the brownies are more lunch and afternoon items i put the torte out now hoping customers might think about it and end up coming back into the shop again later for a slice but i can rearrange things if youd rather she broke off when mia lifted a finger lets sample one of those tarts oh sure just let me get one from the back she darted into the kitchen then back out again with a tart in a little paper doily saying nothing mia broke it in two handed half to lulu as she took the first bite her lips curved hows that for a reference she murmured then turned back to nell if you keep looking so nervous customers are going to think somethings wrong with the food then they wont order it and theyll miss something very special you have a gift nell you like it nell let out a relieved sigh i sampled one of everything this morning im half sick she said as she pressed a hand to her stomach i wanted everything to be just right and so it is now relax because once word gets out weve got a genius in the kitchen youre going to be very busy nell didnt know if word got out but she was soon too busy for nerves by tenthirty she was brewing another pot of coffee and resupplying trays every time her cash register rang it was a separate little thrill and when she bagged up a half a dozen muffins for a customer who claimed shed never tasted better nell had to order herself not to spring into a dance thanks come back soon beaming she turned to the next customer that was zacks first impression of her a pretty blonde wearing a white apron and a milewide smile with winking dimples it gave him a quick and pleasant little jolt and his own grin flashed in response i heard about the muffins but i didnt hear about the smile smiles free the muffinsll cost you ill take one blueberry and a large black coffee to go im zack zack todd nell she scooped up one of the togo cups she didnt have to shoot him a sidelong glance experience had taught her to read a face fast and remember it his was still in her mind as she filled the cup tanned with faint lines fanning out from sharp green eyes a firm jaw with an intriguing diagonal scar scoring it brown hair a little long with a bit of curl that was already sunstreaked in june a narrow face with a long straight nose a mouth that smiled easily and showed a slightly crooked incisor it struck her as an honest face easygoing friendly she set the coffee on the counter casting him another glance as she plucked a muffin from the tray he had broad shoulders and good arms his shirt was rolled up at the sleeves and faded from sun and water the hand that curled around the coffee cup was big and wide she tended to trust big hands on a man it was the slender manicured ones that could strike so lethally just one she said as she bagged his muffin onell do me for now word is you just got to the island yesterday good timing for me she rang up his order pleased when he opened the bag and sniffed good timing all around if this tastes as good as it smells whered you come in from boston he cocked his head doesnt sound like boston your accent he explained when she simply stared at him oh she took his money with a steady hand made change not originally a little town in the midwest outside of columbus i moved around a lot though her smile stayed in place as she handed him his change and receipt i guess thats why i dont sound like im from anywhere in particular guess so hey sheriff zack glanced over his shoulder nodded morning miz macey you get round to talking to pete stahr about that dog of his heading that way now dog as soon roll in dead fish as he would in roses then whats he do but run right through my hanging wash had to do the lot of it again i like dogs same as the next yes maam but petes got to keep that hound on a leash ill have a word with him this morning you ought to

raw and hot she feared her voice sounded the same im nell can i get you anything maybe ill just have a sitdown with a cup of tea and one of those tarts ive got a weak spot for a good fruit tart none of those fancy teas mind give me good orange pekoe you tell that pete to keep his dog out of my wash she added to zack else hell be doing my laundry yes maam he smiled at nell again kept his eyes on her face deliberately as hed noted how quickly it had paled when gladys macey had called him sheriff nice meeting you nell she gave him a little nod kept her hands busy he noticed but not quite steady just what he wondered would a pretty young woman like that have to fear from the law then again he thought as he walked downstairs some people were just naturally skittish when it came to cops he scanned the main level spotted mia stocking shelves in the mystery section either way zack decided it wouldnt hurt to ask a few casual questions busy in here today mmm she slid paperbacks into slots without looking around i expect it to get busier seasons just underway and i have my new secret weapon in the café just met her youre renting her the yellow cottage thats right you check her employment record references now zack mia did turn now in her heels she was nearly eye to eye with him and she gave his cheek a sassy pat weve been friends a long time long enough for me to tell you to mind your own business i dont want you going up to my café and interrogating my staff okay ill just haul her down to the station house and get out my rubber hose she chuckled then leaned over and gave him a peck on the cheek you brute dont worry about nell she isnt looking for trouble got twitchy when she found out i was sheriff honey youre so handsome you make all the girls twitchy never worked on you he countered a lot you know now go away let me run my business im going have to do my sworn duty and scold pete stahr over his smelly dog sheriff todd youre so brave she batted her lashes what would we islanders do without you and your stalwart sister protecting us ha ha ripleys due in on the noon ferry any sooner id stick her with dog detail is a week up already mia grimaced and went back to shelving oh well nothing good lasts forever im not getting in the middle of you two again id sooner deal with petes dog she laughed at him but once hed gone she looked toward the steps thought of nell and wondered she made it a point to go upstairs late in the morning nell had already put out the salads and the soup subtly shifting the mode toward the lunch crowd the salads mia noted looked fresh and appealing and the scent of the soup was going to tempt anyone who walked into the store hows it going fine weve finally hit a little lull nell wiped her hands on her apron brisk business this morning the muffins won the race but the tarts came in a close second youre officially on break mia told her ill take care of anyone who comes in unless they want something that requires the use of that monster machine in the kitchen mia slid onto a stool crossed her legs stop by my office after your shift well get the employment forms signed okay ive been thinking about tomorrows menu well discuss that then too why dont you get yourself a cup of coffee and relax im already hyped enough but nell did open the fridge removed a small bottle of water ill stick with this youve settled into the house all right it was easy i cant remember ever sleeping better or waking better with the windows open i can just hear the surf its like a lullaby and did you see the sunrise this morning spectacular ill take your word for it i tend to avoid sunrise it insists on coming so early in the day she held out her hand and surprised nell into passing the bottle of water to her for a sip i heard you met zack todd did i nell immediately picked up a cloth began buffing the stove oh sheriff todd yes he had coffee black and a blueberry muffin to go theres been a todd on the island for centuries and zachariahs one of the best of the lot kind mia said deliberately caring and decent without being a pain in the ass about it is he your the word boyfriend just didnt seem to apply with a woman like mia are you and he involved romantically no mia held the bottle back out to nell hes entirely too good for me though i did have a mild crush on him when i was fifteen or sixteen after all hes a prime specimen you must have noticed im not interested in men i see is that what youre running from a man when nell didnt respond mia slid to her feet well if and when youre inclined to talk about it im an excellent listener with a sympathetic ear i appreciate all youve done for me mia i just want to do my job fair enough the bell dinged signaling someone had come to the counter no youre on break mia reminded her before nell could hurry out of the kitchen ill take the counter for a while and dont look so sad little sister youve no one to answer to now but yourself oddly soothed nell stayed where she was she could hear the low ripple of mias voice as she spoke to the customers the store music was flutes now and something fluid she could close her eyes and imagine herself here just here the next day the next year comfortable and comforted productive and happy there was no reason to be sad or afraid no cause to be concerned about the sheriff hed have no purpose in paying attention to her looking into her background and if he did what would he find shed been careful shed been thorough no she was no longer running away shed run to and she was staying she finished off her water started out of the kitchen just as mia turned around the clock in the square began to bong the noon hour in slow ponderous tones the floor beneath her feet seemed to tremble and the light went brilliant and bright music swelled inside her head like a thousand harp strings plucked in unison the wind she could have sworn she felt a hot wind flow over her face and lift her hair she smelled candle wax and fresh earth the world shuddered and spun then righted itself in a blink of time as if it had never moved she shook her head to clear it and found herself staring into mias deep gray eyes what was that an earthquake even as she said it nell saw that no one else in the store looked concerned people milled sat chatted sipped i thought i felt yes i know though mias voice was quiet there was an edge to it nell hadnt heard before well that explains it explains what shaken nell gripped mias wrist and felt something like power rocket up her arm well talk about it later now the noon ferrys in and ripley was back she thought they the three were all onisland now well be busy serve your soup nell she said gently and walked away mia wasnt often taken by surprise and she didnt care for it the strength of what shed felt and experienced along with nell had been more intense more intimate than shed expected and that annoyed her she should have been prepared she of all people knew believed and understood what twist fate had taken so many years before and what twist it could take now still believing in fate didnt mean a woman simply stood there and let it run her down actions could and would be taken but she had to think to sort things out what in the goddesss name was she supposed to do to make things right when she would be bound to a stubborn twit of a woman who consistently denied her power and a scared rabbit on the run who didnt know she had any she closed herself in her office paced she rarely turned to magic here it was her place of business and she deliberately kept it separate and earthbound but there were exceptions she told herself to every rule so thinking she took her crystal globe from the shelf set it on her desk it amused her to see it there along with her twoline phone and computer still magic respected progress even if progress didnt always respect magic laying her hands on either side of the globe she cleared her mind show me what i have to see this island holds the sisters three and we will shape our destiny visions in glass come clear to me as i will so mote it be the globe shimmered and swirled and cleared in its depths like figures in water she saw herself nell and ripley a circle formed in the shadows of the woods and a fire burning the trees were aflame as well but with color struck by autumn light poured out from a full moon like water shimmering a new shadow formed in the trees and became a man beautiful and golden with eyes that burned the circle broke even as nell ran the man struck out she shattered like glass a thousand pieces scattering and the skies opened to lightning blasted with thunder and all mia could see in the glass was a torrent of water as the woods and the island they lived on tumbled into the sea mia stepped back planted her hands on her hips isnt that always the way she said in disgust a man ruins everything well well see about that she put the globe back on the shelf well just see about that by the time nell knocked on her door mia was just finishing up some paperwork right on time she said as she logged off the computer thats a pretty habit of yours i need you to fill out these forms she gestured to the neat stack on the desk ive dated them yesterday hows the lunch crowd moving smoothly enough nell sat her palms no longer sweated when she filled out forms name date of birth social security number those basic facts and figures were hers shed seen to it personally peg dives right in i made up tomorrows menu mmm mia took the folded paper nell pulled out of her pocket read it over while nell filled in the form it looks good more adventurous than janes tended to be too adventurous no just more so what will you do with the rest of your day mia briefly looked at the first completed form nell no middle initial channing take a walk on the beach do some gardening maybe explore the woods around the cottage theres a small stream where columbine grows wild this time of year and in the deeper shade jackinthepulpits and ferns the kind that make you think the faeries hide in them you dont strike me as the kind of person who looks for shy faeries mias lips curved we dont know each other well yet three sisters is alive with legend and lore and the woods have all manner of secrets do you know the story of the three sisters no ill tell you one day when theres time for tales and stories but for now you should be out in the light and air mia what happened before at noon you tell me what do you think happened it felt like an earth tremor but not the light changed and so did the air like a blast of energy it sounded foolish when she said it but she pushed on you felt it too but no one else did no one else felt anything out of the ordinary most people expect the ordinary and thats what they get if thats a riddle i dont know how to solve it impatient nell shoved to her feet you werent surprised by it a little irritated but not surprised mia sat back intrigued and lifted a brow true enough you read people very well survival skill and sharply honed mia added what happened i suppose you could call it a connection what happens when three positive charges occupy the same space at the same time nell shook her head i have no idea neither do i but itll be interesting to find out like recognizes like dont you think i recognized you nells blood went cold and burned under her skin i dont know what you mean not who you are or were mia said gently but what you can trust me to respect that and your privacy i wont pry into your yesterdays nell im more interested in the tomorrows nell opened her mouth she nearly very nearly let it pour out everything shed escaped from everything that haunted her but to do so put her fate in the hands of another that was something she would never do again tomorrow ill serve a summer vegetable soup and a chicken zucchini and ricotta sandwich thats as complicated as its going to get thats as good a start as any enjoy your afternoon mia waited until nell reached the door nell as long as youre still afraid he wins i dont give a damn about winning nell replied then she stepped out quickly and closed the door behind her chapter three contents prev next nell found the stream and the wild columbine like little drops of sun in the green shade sitting on the soft floor of the forest listening to the stream gurgle and the birds chirp she found her peace again this was her place she was as sure of that as shed been of any single thing in all her life she belonged here as shed belonged nowhere else even as a child shed felt displaced not by her parents she thought running her fingers over her locket never by them but home had been wherever her father was stationed and until his orders changed thered been no single place for childhood no pretty spot for memories to take root and bloom her mother had had the gift of making a home wherever they were and for however long but it wasnt the same as knowing you would wake up to the same view out of your bedroom window day after day and that was a yearning nell had carried with her always her mistake had been in believing she could soothe that yearning with evan when she should have known it was something she had to find for herself perhaps she had now here in this place thats what mia had meant like recognizing like they both belonged on the island maybe in some lovely way they belonged to it it was as simple as that still mia was an intuitive woman and an oddly powerful one she sensed secrets nell could only hope she was as good as her word and wouldnt pry if anyone started digging through the layers she would have to leave no matter how much she belonged she couldnt stay it wasnt going to happen nell got to her feet stretching up her arms to the thin sunbeams and turned slow circles she wouldnt let it happen she was going to trust mia she was going to work for her and live in the little yellow cottage and wake each morning with a giddy glorious sense of freedom in time she thought as she began to walk back toward her house she and mia might become real friends it would be fascinating to have a friend that vivid that clever what was it like to be a woman like mia devlin she wondered to be someone so utterly beautiful so sublimely confident a woman like that would never have to question herself to remake herself to worry that whatever she did or could do would never be good enough what a marvelous thing still while a woman might be born beautiful confidence could be learned it could be won and wasnt there amazing satisfaction from winning those small battles every time you did you went back to war better armed enough dawdling enough introspection she thought and quickened her pace she was going to blow the last of her advance at the garden center if that wasnt confidence she decided what was they let her open an account another debt to mia nell thought as she drove back across the island she worked for mia devlin so she was looked upon kindly she was trusted she was allowed to take away merchandise on the strength of her signature on a tally a kind of magic she supposed that existed only in small towns shed struggled not to take advantage and had still ended up with half a dozen flats and pots and soil and a silly stone gargoyle who would guard what she planted eager to begin she parked in front of the cottage and hopped out the minute she opened the back door of the car she was immersed in her small fragrant jungle were going to have such fun and im going to take wonderful care of all of you feet planted firmly she stretched inside to lift the first tray hell of a view zack thought as he stopped across the street a small shapely female bottom in snug faded jeans if a man didnt spend a minute appreciating that he was a sorry individual he got out of his cruiser leaned against the door and watched her take out a flat of pink and white petunias pretty picture she jerked nearly bobbled the tray he noted that just as he noted the alarm shoot into her eyes but he straightened lazily strolled across the street let me give you a hand thats all right ive got it and a lot more gonna be busy he reached past her took out two more flats wherere you going with them just around the back for now i havent decided where im putting everything yet but really you dont have to smells good whatve you got here herbs rosemary basil tarragon and so on the quickest way to be rid of him she decided was to let him cart the trays around so she started across the yard im going to put in an herb bed outside the kitchen maybe add a few vegetables when i have time planting flowers is planting roots my mother always says i intend to do both just on the stoopll be fine thank you sheriff youve got a couple more in the front seat i can ill fetch them did you think to get any soil yes in the trunk he smiled easily held out his hand i need the keys oh well trapped she dug in her pocket thanks when he strolled off she clasped her hands together it was all right he was just being helpful not every man not every cop was a danger she knew better than that he came back loaded and the sight of him a huge bag of soil slung over one shoulder and a flat of pink geraniums and white impatiens in his big hands made her laugh i got too much she took the flowers from him i only meant to get herbs and before i knew it i couldnt seem to stop thats what they all say ill get your pots and tools sheriff it had once been natural to her to repay kindness with kindness she wanted it to be natural again i made some lemonade this morning would you like a glass id appreciate it all she had to do was remind herself to relax to be herself she filled two glasses with ice and poured in the tart lemonade he was already back when she came out something about the way he looked big and male standing in the middle of pink and white flowers gave her a quick little jolt attraction even as she recognized the sensation she reminded herself it wasnt anything she could or wanted to feel again i appreciate the pack mule services welcome he took the glass draining half of it while that little jolt became a twitchy dance in her belly he lowered the glass this is the real thing cant think the last time i had fresh lemonade youre a real find arent you i just like to fuss in the kitchen she bent picked up her new garden spade you didnt buy any gloves no i didnt think of it she wanted him to drink his lemonade and scat zack thought but was too polite to say so because he knew that he sat on the little stoop outside the kitchen door made himself comfortable mind if i sit a minute its been a long day dont let me stop you from getting started though its pleasant to watch a woman in the garden shed wanted to sit on the stoop she thought to sit there in the sunshine and imagine what she would do with the flowers and herbs now all she could do was begin she started with the pots reminding herself if she didnt like the results she could always redo them did you um talk to the man with the dog pete zack asked sipped at his lemonade i think we came to an understanding and peace settles over our little island once more there was humor in the way he said it and a lazy satisfaction as well it was hard not to appreciate both it must be interesting being the sheriff here knowing everyone it has its moments she had small hands he noticed as he watched her work quick clever fingers she kept her head bent her eyes averted shyness he decided coupled with what seemed to him to be a rusty sense of socializing a lot of its refereeing or dealing with summer people whore vacationing too hard mostly its running herd on about three thousand people between me and ripley its simple enough ripley my sister shes the other island cop todds have been island cops for five generations thats looking real nice he said gesturing toward her workinprogress with his glass do you think she sat back on her heels shed mixed some of everything into the pot stuck in some of the vinca it didnt look haphazard as shed feared it might it looked cheerful and so did her face when she lifted it its my first id say youve got a knack ought to wear a hat though fair skin like yours is going to burn if you stay out long oh she rubbed the back of her hand over her nose probably guess you didnt have a garden in boston no she filled the second pot with soil i wasnt there very long it wasnt my place i know what you mean ive spent some time on the mainland never felt home your folks still in the midwest my parents are dead im sorry so am i she tucked a geranium into the new pot is this conversation sheriff or an inquiry conversation he picked up a plant that was just out of her reach and held it a cautious woman he decided in his experience cautious people usually had a reason any point in me inquiring im not wanted for anything never been arrested and im not looking for trouble that about covers it he handed her the plant its a small island miz channing mostly friendly curiosity comes along with it though i suppose she couldnt afford to alienate him she reminded herself she couldnt afford to alienate anyone look ive been traveling for a while now and im tired of it i came here looking for work and a quiet place to live looks like you found both he got to his feet i appreciate the lemonade youre welcome thats a pretty job youre doing youve got a knack for it all right afternoon miz channing afternoon sheriff as he walked back to his car he tallied up what hed learned about her she was alone in the world wary of cops prickly about questions she was a woman of simple tastes and skittish nerves and for reasons he couldnt quite fathom she just didnt quite add up for him he glanced at her car as he crossed to his own scanned the license plate the massachusetts tag looked brand spanking new wouldnt hurt to run it he thought just to settle his mind his gut told him nell channing might not have been looking for trouble but she wasnt a stranger to it nell served apple turnovers and lattes to the young couple by the window and then cleared an adjoining table a trio of women were browsing the stacks and she suspected theyd be lured into the café section before long with her hands full of mugs she loitered by the window the ferry was arriving from the mainland chased by gulls that circled and dived buoys bobbed in a sea that was soft and green today a white pleasure boat sails fat with wind skimmed along the surface once shed sailed on another sea in another life it was one of the few pleasures she took from that time the feel of flying over the water rising on waves odd wasnt it that the sea had always called to her it had changed her life and had taken it now this new sea had given her another life smiling at the thought she turned and bumped solidly into zack even as he took her arm to steady her she was jerking back im sorry did i spill anything on you im clumsy i wasnt watching where no harm done he hooked the fingers of one hand through two mug handles and careful not to touch her again took them from her i was in your way nice boat yes she sidestepped hurried back to the counter behind it she hated having anyone come up behind her but im not getting paid to watch boats can i get you anything take a breath nell what take a breath he said it gently as he set the mugs on the counter get yourself steady again im fine resentment pricked through her she clanged mugs together as she scooped them off the counter i didnt expect to have anyone hulking around behind me his lips twitched thats better ill take one of those turnovers and a large coffee to go did you finish your planting nearly she didnt want to talk to him so she busied herself with the coffee she didnt want to have the island cop making friendly conversation and watching her out of those sharp green eyes maybe you can make use of this when youre finishing up and tending to your flowers he laid a bag on the counter what is it garden tool he counted out his money set that on the counter as well she wiped her hands on her apron scowled but curiosity pushed her into opening the bag baffled humor lit her eyes as she studied the perfectly ridiculous rolledbrim straw hat foolish fake flowers danced around the crown this is the silliest hat ive ever seen oh there were sillier he assured her but itll keep the sun from burning your nose its very considerate of you but you shouldnt around here its called being neighborly the beeper on his belt signaled well back to work she managed to wait until he was halfway down the steps before she snatched the hat and dashed into the kitchen to try it on in the reflection of the stove hood ripley todd poured herself another cup of coffee and sipped it while looking out the front window of the station house it had been a quiet morning and that was just the way she liked it but there was something in the air she was doing her best to ignore it but something was in the air it was easier to tell herself it was overstimulation from the week shed spent in boston not that she hadnt enjoyed herself she had the law enforcement workshops and seminars had interested her given her food for thought she liked police work the routine and detail of it but the demands and chaos of the city wore on her even in that short a time zack wouldve said it was simply that she didnt like people overmuch ripley wouldve been the last one to argue with him about that she caught sight of him now heading down the street it would she estimated take him a good ten minutes to make the half block people stopped him always had a word to say more she thought people just liked being around him he had a kind of she didnt want to use the word aura it was too mialike air she decided zack just had the kind of air about him that made people feel better about things they knew if they took their troubles to him hed have the answer or take the time to find it zack was a sociable creature ripley mused affable and patient and consistently fair no one would accuse her of being any of those things maybe that was why they made a good team since he was heading in she opened the front door to the summer air and street sounds the way he liked it best she brewed a fresh pot of coffee and was just pouring him a cup when he finally arrived frank and alice purdue had a baby girl eight pounds five ounces at nine this morning calling her belinda the younger boy robbie fell out of a tree broke his arm missy hachins cousin in bangor bought a brandnew chevrolet sedan as he spoke zack took the offered coffee sat at his desk propped up his feet and grinned the ceiling fan was squeaking again hed really meant to see to that so whats new with you speeder on the north coast road ripley told him dont know where they thought they were going in such a hurry i explained that the cliffs and the light and so on had been in place for a few centuries and werent likely to move away in an afternoon she plucked a fax out of his in box and this came in for you nell channing thats the new cook at mias place right ummhmm he scanned the motor vehicle report no traffic violations she still carried an ohio drivers license due for renewal in just over two years the car was registered in her name hed been right about the new tags shed had them less than a week before that the car had carried texas tags interesting ripley scooted onto the corner of the desk they shared and sampled his coffee since he wasnt drinking it whyd you run her curious shes a curious woman curious how he started to answer then shook his head why dont you drop into the café for lunch check her out yourself id be interested in your impression maybe i will frowning ripley glanced at the open door i think a storms coming in its clear as glass out there honey somethings coming she said half to herself then grabbed her baseball cap ill take a walk around maybe stop in the café and take a look at our newest resident take your time ill do the afternoon beach patrol youre welcome to it ripley slid on her sunglasses and strode out she liked her village the order of it as far as ripley was concerned everything had a place and thats just where it should stay she didnt mind the vagaries of sea and weather that was just another natural order of things june meant a fresh influx of tourists and summer people temperatures moving from warm to hot beach bonfires and smoking grills it also meant excess partying the routine drunk and disorderly the occasional lost child and the inevitable lovers spats but the tourists who celebrated drank wandered and squabbled brought summer dollars to the island that kept it afloat during the frigid gales of winter she would cheerfully well perhaps not too cheerfully suffer the problems of strangers for a few months in order to preserve three sisters this nine square miles of rock and sand and soil was all the world she needed overbaked people were staggering up from the beach toward the village for lunch she could never figure out what possessed a human being to flop itself down and broil like a trout in the sun besides the discomfort the sheer boredom of it would have driven her wild inside an hour ripley wasnt one to lie down if she could stand not that she didnt enjoy the beach she jogged along the surf every morning summer and winter when weather permitted she finished off her run with a swim when it didnt she often ducked into the hotel and took advantage of its indoor pool but she preferred the sea as a result she had a tight athletic body that was most often clad in khakis and tshirts her skin was tanned like her brothers her eyes the same vivid green she wore her straight brown hair long and most often pulled through the back of her baseball cap her features were an odd mix a wide slightly topheavy mouth a small nose and dark arching brows her looks had made her feel awkward as a child but ripley liked to think shed grown into them and grown out of worrying about them she strolled into café book waved at lulu and headed for the stairs with luck she could get a look at this nell channing and avoid mia altogether she was still three steps from the café level when she saw her luck wasnt going to hold mia was behind the counter looking slick as always in some floaty floral dress her hair was tied back and still managed to explode around her face the woman working beside her looked tidy nearly prim in comparison ripley immediately preferred nell she jammed her thumbs into her back pockets and swaggered toward the counter deputy todd mia angled her head looked down her nose what could possibly bring you here ignoring mia ripley studied nell ill have todays special soup and sandwich nell this is ripley zacks unfortunate sister as shes come in for lunch we can safely assume hell has frozen over kiss ass mia nice to meet you nell ill have a lemonade to go with that yes all right nell shifted her gaze from face to face right away she murmured and ducked into the kitchen to put the sandwich together heard you scooped her up right off the ferry ripley continued more or less mia ladled the soup dont poke at her ripley why would i because youre you mia set the soup on the counter notice anything odd when you stepped off the ferry yesterday no ripley replied too quickly liar mia said quietly as nell came back with the sandwich can i take this to a table for you deputy todd yeah thanks ripley tugged money out of her pocket why dont you ring me up mia ripley timed it sliding into a chair just as nell set the food down looks great i hope you enjoy it im sure i will whered you learn to cook here and there can i get you anything else ripley held up a finger spooned up soup and sampled nope this is great really hey did you make all those pastries yourself yes a lot of work its what im paid for right dont let mia work you too hard shes pushy on the contrary nell said in a voice that chilled shes incredibly generous incredibly kind enjoy your lunch loyal ripley decided as she continued to eat she couldnt fault nell for that polite too even if she was a bit stiff about it as if ripley thought she wasnt quite used to dealing with people nervous shed visibly cringed at the relatively mild byplay between ripley and mia well ripley decided with a shrug some people couldnt handle conflict even when it had nothing to do with them all in all she thought nell channing was harmless and a hell of a good cook the meal put her in such a good mood that she took the time to go by the counter on her way out it was easier to decide to do so since mia was occupied elsewhere well now youve done it nell froze she deliberately kept her face blank her hands loose i beg your pardon now im going to have to start coming in here regularly something ive managed to avoid for years lunch was great oh good you may have noticed mia and i arent exactly chummy its none of my business you live on the island everybodys business is your business but dont worry we manage to stay out of each others way for the most part you wont get squeezed in the middle im going to take a couple of those chocolate chip cookies for later you save if you buy three twist my arm three then ill give one to zack and be a hero relaxed now nell bagged the cookies rang up the bill but when she took the money from ripley and their hands touched the bright shock had her gasping ripley glared one long frustrated stare snagging her cookies she strode toward the stairs deputy clenching her hand tight nell called after her you forgot your change keep it she bit the words off as she stomped down the stairs there was mia at the bottom hands folded brow lifted ripley simply snarled and kept going a storm was coming though the sky stayed clear and the sea calm a storm was coming its violence roared through nells dreams and tossed her helplessly into the past the huge white house sat on a verdant carpet of lawn inside its edges were sharp its surfaces hard colors were pale sands and taupes and grays but for the roses he bought her always bought her that were the color of blood the house was empty but it seemed to be waiting in sleep she turned her head away resisted she didnt want to go into that place not ever again but the door opened the tall white door that opened into the long wide foyer white marble white wood and the cold cold sparkle of crystal and chrome she watched herself walk in long pale hair sweeping past the shoulders of a sleek white dress that sent off an icy glitter her lips were red like the roses he came in with her close behind always so close behind his hand was there lightly on the small of her back she could still feel it there if she let herself he was tall slim like a prince in his evening black with his hair a gold helmet she had fallen in love with the fairytale look of him and she had believed his promises of happyeverafter and hadnt he taken her to this palace this white palace in this fantasy land and given her everything a woman could want how many times had he reminded her of that she knew what happened next she remembered the glittery white dress remembered how tired and relieved she was that the evening was over and that it had gone well shed done nothing to upset him to embarrass him to annoy him or so shed thought until shed turned to say something about how nice an evening it had been and had seen his expression hed waited until they were home until they were alone to make the transformation it was one of his best skills and she remembered the fear that had clutched her belly even as she scrambled to think of what shed done did you enjoy yourself helen yes it was a lovely party but a long one would you like me to fix you a brandy before we go to bed you enjoyed the music very much music had she said something inappropriate about the music she could be so stupid about such things barely she repressed a shudder as he reached out to toy with her hair it was wonderful to be able to dance outside near the gardens she stepped back hoping to turn toward the stairs but his hand fisted in her hair held her in place yes i noticed how much you enjoyed dancing especially with mitchell rowlings flirting with him flaunting yourself humiliating me in front of my friends my clients evan i wasnt flirting i was only the backhanded slap sent her sprawling the bright shock of pain blinding her when she would have rolled into a protective ball he dragged her across the marble floor by the hair how many times has he had his hands on you she denied she wept he accused until he grew weary of it and left her to crawl away and sob in a corner but this time in this dream she crawled off into the shadows of the forest where the air was soft and the ground warm and there where the stream gurgled over its smooth rocks she slept then awoke to the cannonblast of thunder and the jagged rip of lightning awoke to terror she was running through the woods now her white dress a sparkling beacon her blood pumped the blood of the hunted trees crashed behind her and the ground heaved under her feet and boiled with mist still she ran her breath tearing out of her throat and ending in whimpers there were screams in the wind and not all of them hers fear ruled until there was nothing else inside her no reason no sense no answer the wind slapped at her with sharp and gleeful hands and clawing fingers of brush tore her dress to shreds she was climbing scrabbling like a lizard along the rock through the dark the beam from the lighthouse slashed like a silver blade and below the wild violence of the sea churned she kicked and cried and climbed but she didnt look back couldnt force herself to look around and face what pursued her instead choosing flight over fight she leaped from the rocks spun and spun in the wind on her plunge toward the water and the cliffs the light the trees all tumbled in after her chapter four contents prev next on her first day off nell rearranged the furniture what there was of it she watered her flowers and herbs did the wash and baked a loaf of brown bread it was still shy of nine oclock when she cut the first slice for her breakfast evan had hated her earlyrising habit and had complained that that was the reason she was dull at parties now in her little cottage near the sea there was no one to criticize no need to creep about she had her windows open wide and the whole day belonged just to her still munching on bread and with a heel of the loaf in the pocket of her shorts she took herself off for a long walk on the beach the boats were out bobbing and gliding over the water the sea was a soft dreamy blue with frisky waves that rolled up lacy on the sand gulls winged over it whitebreasted in their graceful dance on the air the music of them the long shrill cries pierced the low endless rumble of the surf she turned in a little dance of her own then she tugged the bread from her pocket and tore it into small pieces tossing it high to watch the gulls circle and dive alone she thought lifting her face to the sky but not lonely she doubted she would ever be lonely again at the sound of church bells she turned to look back at the village at the pretty white steeple she glanced down at her shorts with the frayed hem her sandy sneakers hardly dressed for services she decided but she could worship in her own way and offer a prayer of thanksgiving while the bells rang and echoed she sat near the edge of the water here was peace she thought and joy she would never never take either for granted she would remember to give something back every day even if it was just a heel of bread for the gulls she would tend what she planted she would remember to be kind and never forget to offer a helping hand she would keep her promises and expect nothing more than the chance to lead a good life that hurt no one she would earn what shed been given and treasure it she would take pleasure in the simple things she decided starting right now rising she began to collect shells tucking them in her pockets at first when the pockets were full she tugged off her shoes and used them she reached the far end of the beach where rocks jutted out of the sand and began to tumble toward the sea here there were palmsize stones worn cobble smooth she picked one then another wondering if she could fashion an edging for her little herb bed a movement to her left had her wrapping her fingers tight around the stone and turning quickly her heart continued to beat in hard jerks as she watched zack coming down a zigzag of wooden steps morning good morning in automatic defense she glanced back uneasy to realize how far from the village proper shed wandered the beach was no longer empty but the scattered people were some distance away nice day for a long walk on the beach he commented leaning against the handrail to study her youve sure had one hed watched her from her dance with the gulls it was a shame he thought how quickly her face could go from radiant to guarded i didnt realize how far id come nothings really that far on an island this size its going to be a hot one he said easily beachll be crowded before noon its nice to get a little time on it before its full of towels and bodies yes well come on up what come on up to the house ill give you a bag for those shells and stones oh thats all right i dont really need nell is it cops in general men in general or me in particular that worry you im not worried prove it he stayed where he was but held out a hand she kept her eyes on his he had good eyes smart ones but patient too slowly she stepped forward and lifted her hand to his what do you plan to do with your shells nothing her pulse was galloping but she made herself climb the sandy steps with him well nothing brilliant just scatter them around i suppose his hand held hers loosely but even so she could tell it was hard and rough he wore no rings no watch on his wrist no pampering she thought no adornments like her he was barefoot and his jeans were ripped at the knee frayed at the hem with his sunstreaked hair and tawny skin he looked more beach bum than sheriff it tamped down some of her anxiety at the landing they turned walked along a gentle slope below on the far side of the rocks was a sunny inlet where a small red boat bobbed lazily at a rickety pier everythings a picture she said quietly have you done any sailing yes a little she said quickly is that your boat shes mine there was a sudden wild splashing of water and a sleek dark head appeared cruising around the rocks as nell stared a huge black dog leaped onto the shore and shook herself madly her too zack stated mine that is are you all right with dogs tell me now i can hold her off and give you a fair head start no i like dogs then she blinked looked back at him what do you mean head start he didnt bother to answer just grinned as the dog leaped up the slope in powerful bounds she jumped on zack tail wagging and spewing water and licked his face on two short deep barks she bunched her muscles and would have given nell the same treatment if zack hadnt blocked her this is lucy shes friendly but mannerless down lucy lucy got down her entire body wagging now then obviously unable to control her joy and affection she leaped on zack again shes two he explained firmly pushing her down and shoving her butt to the ground with his hand black lab im told they mellow out some when theyre older shes beautiful nell stroked lucys head and at the first touch the dog collapsed on the ground and rolled over belly up no pride either zack began then looked surprised when nell just hunkered down and sent lucy into ecstasy by rubbing her belly with both hands you dont need pride when youre beautiful do you lucy oh theres nothing like a big beautiful dog is there i always oh in a delirium of pleasure lucy rolled scrambled and knocked nell flat on her back zack was fast but not quite fast enough to keep her from being leaped on and licked jesus lucy no hey im sorry zack shoved at the dog and lifted nell to her feet onehanded you okay did she hurt you no im fine shed had the wind knocked out of her but that was only part of the reason for breathlessness he was brushing at her while the dog sat head down tail cautiously thumping he was nell noted frustrated and concerned but not angry you didnt hit your head did you damn dog weighs almost as much as you do banged your elbow a little he added then realized she was actually giggling whats so funny nothing really its just sweet the way shes pretending to look ashamed shes obviously terrified of you yeah i take a bat to her twice a week whether she needs it or not he ran his hands lightly up and down nells arms sure youre okay yes it struck her then that they were now standing very close almost embracing and that his hands were on her and her skin was much too warm from them yes she said again and took a deliberate step in retreat no harm done youre sturdier than you look there were long lean muscles in those arms he noted hed already admired the ones in her legs come on inside he said not you he added pointing at the dog youre banished he scooped nells shoes up from the ground and walked toward a wide porch curious and unable to think of an excuse not to follow nell went through the screened door he opened and into a big bright messy kitchen its the maids decade off comfortable in his own clutter he set her shoes on the floor and went to the refrigerator cant offer you homemade lemonade but weve got some iced tea thats fine thanks its a wonderful kitchen we use it mostly for heating up takeout thats a shame there were acres of granitetoned counters and wonderful roughhewn cabinets with leadedglass fronts a generous double sink with a window over it offered a view of the inlet and the sea plenty of storage and work space she mused with a little organization and a bit of imagination it would be a marvelous we hed said we she realized was he married shed never thought of that never considered the possibility not that it mattered of course but hed flirted with her she may have been out of practice and short on experience but she knew when a man was flirting youve got a lot of thoughts going on inside that head at one time zack held out a glass want to share any of them no that is i was just thinking what a nice room this is it was a lot more presentable when my mother was in charge of it now that its just ripley and me the kitchen doesnt get a lot of attention ripley oh i see you were wondering if i was married or maybe living here with someone who wasnt my sister thats nice its none of my business i didnt say it was just said it was nice id take you through the house but its probably in worse shape than the kitchen and youve got a tidy soul well go this way he took her hand again pulled her back outside where i really should be getting back its sunday and weve hit our day off together ive got something youll like he continued and tugged her across the porch it wrapped around the house edged the side where there was a scrubby garden and a couple of gnarled trees weatherworn steps led up to a secondstory porch that faced the sea he kept his hand over hers and led her up them air and sun washed over her made her think how easy it would be to stretch out in the wooden chaise and let the day rock away a telescope stood by the rail along with a stone troth that had yet to be planted youre right she stepped to the rail leaned out and breathed i do like it you look west you can see the mainland when its clear enough you dont have your telescope pointed west at the moment all his attention was on her very pretty set of legs i guess i dont what do you look at whatever strikes my fancy at the time she glanced over as she moved away he was staring at her now long speculative looks and they both knew it itd be tempting to stay out here all day she said as she turned the corner and looked out on the village watch the comings and the goings i watched you this morning feeding the gulls he leaned on the rail a man at home and drank his tea i woke up thinking you know im going to find a reason to drop by the yellow cottage today get another look at nell channing then i came out here with my morning coffee and there you were so i didnt have to make up a reason to get another look at you sheriff its my day off he reminded her he started to lift his hand to touch her hair but when she edged back he simply slid it into his pocket since it is why dont we spend a couple hours of it on the water we can go for a sail i cant i have to you dont have to hunt up excuses some other time yes the knot that had formed in her belly loosened some other time i really should go thanks for the drink and the view nell he took her hand again kept his fingers light when hers jerked theres a line between making a woman a little nervous and scaring her thats a line i wouldnt want to cross when you get to know me a little better youll believe that he added right now im working on getting to know myself a little better fair enough ill get you a bag for your shells and stones he made a point of going into the café every morning a cup of coffee a muffin a few words to zacks way of thinking shed get used to seeing him talking to him and the next time he worked it around so they were alone together she wouldnt feel compelled to check for running room he was perfectly aware that nell wasnt the only one who noticed his new morning habit zack didnt mind the teasing comments the sly winks and chuckles island life had a rhythm and whenever anything new added a beat everyone felt it he sipped nells truly excellent coffee while he stood on the dock listening to carl macey bitch about lobster poachers three blessed days this week traps been empty and they aint troubling to close it after them neither ive got the suspicion its them college boys renting the boeing place ayah he spat thats whos doing it i catch em at it im gonna give them rich college brats something to remember well carl the fact is it sounds like summer people and sounds like kids on top of it why dont you let me have a talk with them got no call interfering with a mans livelihood that way no but they wouldnt be thinking of it like that theyd better start thinking the weathered face went grim i went up to see mia devlin asked her to put a spell on my traps zack winced now carl better than me peppering their skinny white asses with buckshot now aint it i swear thats next in line let me handle this im telling you aint i scowling carl bobbed his head no harm in covering all my bases besides i got a look at the new mainlander while i was up to the bookstore carls pughomely wrinkled face folded into a snicker see why youre such a regular customer there these days ayah big blue eyes like that sure start a mans day off on the right foot they cant hurt you keep your shotgun in your gun cabinet carl ill take care of things he headed back to the station house first for his list of summer people the boeing place was an easy enough walk but he decided to take the cruiser to make it more official the summer rental was a block back from the beach with a generous screened porch on the side beach towels and swim trunks hung drooping from a nylon line strung inside the screen the picnic table on the porch was heaped with beer cans and the remnants of last nights meal they hadnt had the sense zack thought with a shake of his head to ditch the evidence scrapedout lobster shells lay upended on the table like giant insects zack dug his badge out of his pocket and pinned it on might as well get in their faces with it he knocked and kept right on knocking until the door opened the boy who opened the door was about twenty squinting against the sun his hair a wild disarray he wore brightly striped boxer shorts and a golden summer tan he said ugh sheriff todd island police mind if i come inside whafor timzit hungover bigtime zack decided and translated to talk to you its about tenthirty your friends around somewhere problem christ the boy swallowed winced then stumbled through the living room past the breakfast counter and to the sink where he turned the water on full and stuck his head under the faucet some party huh zack said when he surfaced dripping guess he snagged paper towels rubbed his face dry we get too loud no complaints whats your name son josh josh tanner well josh why dont you rouse your pals i dont want to take up a lot of your time yeah well okay he waited listened there was some cursing a few thuds water running a toilet flushed the three young men who trooped back in with josh looked plenty the worse for wear they stood in various states of undress until one flopped down on a chair and smirked whats the deal all attitude zack calculated and youd be steve hickman boston accent zack concluded upperclass one almost kennedyesque okay steve heres the deal lobster poaching carries a thousanddollar fine reason for that is that while its a kick to sneak out and empty the traps boil up a couple some people depend on the catch for their living an evenings entertainment to you is money out of their pocket as he lectured zack saw the boys shift uncomfortably the one whod answered the door was flushing guiltily and keeping his eyes averted what you had out there on the porch last night wouldve run you about forty down at the market so you look up a man by the name of carl macey at the docks give him forty and thatll be the end of it i dont know what youre talking about does this macey put a brand on his lobsters steve smirked again scratched his belly you cant prove we poached anything true enough zack glanced around the room skimmed faces nerves a little shame this place rents for what about twelve hundred a week in full season and the boat youve rented puts another twofifty onto that add entertainment food beer you guysre shelling out round about a grand apiece for a week here and pumping it into the island economy steve said with a thin smile pretty stupid to hassle us over a couple of allegedly poached lobsters maybe even more stupid not to come up with ten bucks each to smooth things over you think about that its a small island zack said as he started for the door word gets around is that a threat threatening civilians could result in a litigious action zack glanced back shook his head i bet youre prelaw arent you he strolled out back to his cruiser it wouldnt take him long to hit the right spots in the village and make his point ripley walked down high street and met zack in front of the magick inn lobster boys credit card got hung up at the pizza place she began seems the circuits were down or whatever and he had to dig for cash to pay for lunch that so yeah and you know every video they wanted to rent was already out hell of a thing and i hear all the jet skis were already reserved or out of order today thats a shame and continuing in a series of bizarre coincidences the ac in their rental just up and died and its a hot one today too supposed to be muggy tonight bound to be uncomfortable sleeping youre a mean son of a bitch zachariah ripley rose on her toes and gave him a quick smacking kiss on the mouth thats why i love you im going to have to get meaner that hickman boys a tough nut the other threell fold fast enough but hell take some more persuading zack swung an arm around ripleys shoulder so are you going into the café for some lunch i might be why i thought you could do me a little favor since you love me and everything the long whip of her ponytail bobbed as she turned her head to look up at him if you want me to talk nell into dating you just forget it i can get my own dates thanks batting zero so far im still on deck he countered what i was hoping is that youd tell mia were handling the lobster boys and not to do anything what do you meando anything what does she have to do with it ripley stopped her temper flaring damn it dont get riled its just that carl said hed talked to her id just as soon it not get around that our resident witch is cooking up a spell or whatever to keep ripley in check zack tightened his grip on her shoulders id go in myself and have a word with her but the lobster boys should be coming along in a few minutes i want to be standing here looking smug and authoritative ill talk to her you play nice rip and remember it was carl who went to her yeah yeah yeah she shook off his arm and marched across the street witches and spells it was all a bunch of nonsense idiotic hooey she thought as she breezed down the sidewalk a man like carl macey ought to know better stirring up a bunch of silliness it was all right for the tourists to buy all the three sisters lore it was one of the things that brought them over from the mainland but it burned her butt when it was one of her own and mia encouraged it too just by being mia ripley swung into café book and scowled over at lulu who was ringing up a customer where is she upstairs pretty busy today yeah shes a busy little bee ripley muttered and headed up she spotted mia with a customer in the cookbook section ripley bared her teeth mia fluttered her lashes simmering with impatience ripley strode into the café waited her turn then snapped out an order for coffee no lunch today flushed with the bustle of the noon crowd nell poured out from a fresh pot lost my appetite thats too bad mia cooed from behind ripley the lobster salads particularly good today ripley merely jerked a thumb then marched behind the counter and into the kitchen she jammed her hands on her hips when mia strolled in after her zack and i are handling the problem i want you to stay out of it a bowl of top cream was less smooth than mias voice i wouldnt dream of interfering with the law of the land excuse me nell hesitated cleared her throat sandwiches i need to make them up go right ahead mia gestured i imagine deputy fife and i are nearly done just save the smartass comments i do i store them up just for you i dont want you doing anything and i want you to tell carl you didnt do anything too late enjoying herself mia smiled brilliantly its already done a very simple spell even someone with your fumbling abilities could have managed it cancel it no why does it concern you you claim not to believe in the craft i dont but i know how rumors work around here if anything happens to those boys dont insult me all humor fled from mias voice you know very well id do nothing to harm them or anyone you know thats the heart of it thats what youre afraid of afraid that if you opened yourself to whats inside you again you wouldnt be able to control it im not afraid of anything and youre not pulling me in that way she pointed at nell who was struggling to keep very busy with sandwiches youve got no right pulling her in either i dont make the pattern ripley i just recognize it and so do you its a waste of time talking to you ripley stormed out of the kitchen mia let out a little sigh her only sign of distress conversations with ripley never seem particularly productive you mustnt let it worry you nell it has nothing to do with me i can feel your anxiety all the way over here people argue often bitterly they dont all solve the conflict with fists here now she moved behind nell and rubbed her shoulders let the worry go tensions bad for the digestion at the touch nell felt a trickle of warmth melt away the ice that had balled in her belly i guess i like both of you i hate to see you dislike each other i dont dislike ripley she annoys me frustrates me but i dont dislike her you wonder what we were talking about but you wont ask will you little sister no i dont like questions im fascinated by them we need to talk you and i mia stepped back waited for nell to pick up the completed order and turn i have things to do this evening tomorrow then ill buy you a drink lets make it early five at the magick inn the lounge its called the coven you can leave your questions at home if you like mia said as she started out ill bring the answers anyway chapter five contents prev next it went pretty much as zack had expected the hickman kid had to flex his muscles the other three had folded and zack expected carl to get his money from them the next morning but hickman had to prove he was smarter braver and far superior to some dinky island sheriff from his place on the dock zack watched the rented boat putt along toward the lobster traps he was already on the wrong side of the law zack mused nibbling on sunflower seeds boating after dark without running lights that would cost him but it was nothing to the grand that the little defiance was going to cost the college boys father he expected the kid was going to give him some trouble when he hauled him in which meant theyd both be spending a few hours in the station house that night one of them behind bars well lessons learned zack decided lowering his binoculars and reaching down for his flashlight as the boy began to haul up a pot the scream was high and girlish and gave zack a hell of a jolt he switched on his light shot the bright beam of it across the water a light fog crept over the surface so that the boat seemed to bob in smoke the boy stood the trap gripped in both hands the look on his face as he stared into it one of sheer horror before zack could call out the boy flung the trap high and wide even as it splashed into the water he was tumbling in oh well hell zack muttered peeved at the prospect of ending his workday soaking wet he stepped to the end of the dock scooped up a life preserver the kid was doing more screaming than swimming but he was making some progress toward shore here you go steve zack tossed the preserver in head this way i dont want to have to come in after you help me the boy flailed swallowed water choked but he managed to grab the flotation theyre eating my face almost there zack knelt down held out a hand come on up youre still in one piece my head my head steve slipped and slithered onto the dock then lay there on his belly shuddering i saw my head in the trap they were eating my face your heads still on your shoulders son zack hunkered down catch your breath had yourself a hallucination thats all been drinking a bit havent you that and some guilt got to you i saw i saw he sat up laid shaking hands on his face to make certain all his parts were there then began to shake in stupendous relief fog dark water its a tricky kind of situation especially on a couple bottles of beer youre going to feel a lot better when you give carl that forty dollars in fact why dont we go get you cleaned up get your wallet and go by his place now youll sleep better for it yeah sure right okay thats fine zack helped him to his feet ill take care of getting the boat back dont you worry that mia zack thought as he led the unprotesting boy away from the water you had to give her credit for creativity it took a while to calm the boy down then to calm four boys down once hed taken steve back to the rental then there was carl to deal with and the boat which was probably why zack ended up nodding off at the station house just before three am he woke two hours later stiff as a board and annoyed with himself ripley he decided as he stumbled out to his cruiser was taking the first shift he meant to drive straight home but hed gotten into the habit of swinging past the yellow cottage at the end of his shift just to make sure everything was as it should be he made the turn before he realized it and saw the lights in her windows concern as much as curiosity made him pull over and get out of the car because the kitchen light was on he went to the back door he was lifting his hand to knock when he saw her standing on the other side of the screen a long smoothbladed knife gripped in both hands if i tell you i was just in the neighborhood you wont gut me with that will you her hands began to tremble and her breath exploded out of her as she dropped the knife on the table with a clatter im sorry i scared you i saw your light as i was hey hey when she swayed he bolted through the door gripping both her arms and lowering her into a chair sit breathe head down jesus nell im sorry he stroked her hair patted her back and wondered whether she would just keel over on the floor if he jumped up to get her a glass of water its all right im all right i heard the footsteps in the dark its so quiet here you can hear everything and i heard you coming toward the house shed wanted to run like a rabbit in the other direction and keep going she didnt remember picking up the knife hadnt known she could im going to get you some water no im all right mortified now she realized but all right i just wasnt expecting anyone to come to the door guess not its still shy of fivethirty he sat back on his heels when she lifted her head again color was coming back he noted with relief whatre you doing up im usually up by she jumped like a spring as the oven timer buzzed god god with a half laugh she pounded a fist on her heart im going to be lucky to survive till sunrise at this rate my muffins she said and got up quickly to take them out of the oven slide the next batch in i didnt realize you started so early he could see now that he looked around that shed been at it a while there was something simmering on the stove and smelling like glory a huge bowl of batter sat on the counter another bowl covered with a cloth was beside the stove still one more was on the table where shed obviously been mixing something before hed scared ten years off her life ingredients were lined up as organized as a marching band i didnt realize you worked so late she calmed herself by cutting shortening into the flour for her pastry dough i dont usually i had a little project to finish up last night and when it was all said and done dropped off in my office chair nell if you dont give me a cup of that coffee im going to start crying itll embarrass us both oh sorry um you just keep on with what youre doing there cups cabinet to the right of the sink want me to top yours off i suppose he poured a cup filled hers as it sat by the sink you know i dont think these muffins look quite right with the bowl tucked in the crook of her arm she turned her face was a study of alarm and insult what do you mean just dont look quite the thing why dont you let me test one for you he gave her a quick boyish grin that had her lips twitching oh for heavens sake why dont you just ask for one more fun this way no dont bother i can get it myself he plucked one out of the pan burned the tips of his fingers as he tossed the muffin from hand to hand to cool it the scent told him it was going to be worth it ive sure got a soft spot for your blueberry muffins nell mr bigelow lancefort bigelow prefers my cream puffs he said if id make them for him every day hed marry me and wed move to bimini still grinning zack broke the muffin in half treated himself to the fragrant steam thats pretty stiff competition bigelow a confirmed bachelor was ninety he watched her stir the dough form it into a ball then she emptied the muffin pan set them to cool on a rack while she refilled the cups when the timer buzzed again she shifted trays went back to roll out her pastry dough youve got yourself a real system he commented whered you learn to bake my mother she broke off realigned her thoughts it was too easy in the quiet kitchen with all these homey smells to get overly comfortable and reveal too much my mother liked to bake she said and i picked up recipes and techniques here and there he didnt want her to stiffen up so he let it pass do you ever make those cinnamon rolls you know the ones with that sticky white icing mmm i make them sometimes really she began to cut the dough for tarts and glanced back at him he looked so male she thought leaning back on the counter with his ankles crossed and a mug of coffee in his hand i didnt know you cooked sure now and then you buy these tubes down at the market then you take them home rap them against the counter and peel the bun things out cook them and squirt icing on the top nothing to it it made her laugh ill have to try that sometime she went to the refrigerator took out her bowl of filling ill give you some pointers on it he drained his cup set it in the sink i guess id better get home and get out of your way thanks for the coffee youre welcome and the muffin it was just fine thats a relief she stood at the table methodically spooning filling into the center of her rounds of dough when he stepped toward her she tensed a little but continued to work nell she looked up and filling slopped out of her spoon when he put his hand on her cheek i sure hope this doesnt put you off he said and leaning down he laid his lips on hers she didnt move a muscle couldnt her eyes stayed open locked on his watching as a deer might watch when pinned in the crosshairs his lips were warm she registered that and softer than they looked he didnt touch her she imagined shed have leaped out of her skin if hed laid his hands on her now but it was only his mouth light and easy on hers hed prepared himself for her to be annoyed or disinterested he hadnt expected her to be scared that was what he felt from her a rigid anxiety that could easily bloom into fear so he didnt touch her as he wanted to not even a gentle brush of fingers down her arms if shed stepped back hed have done nothing to stop her but her absolute stillness was its own defense it was he who stepped back and kept it light despite a gnawing in the gut that was more than a stir of desire for her it was a cold fury for whoever had hurt her seems i have a soft spot for more than your muffins he tucked his thumbs in his front pockets see you later he strolled out hoping the kiss and the ease of his leaving would give her something to think about he wasnt going to get any sleep resigned to it he thrilled lucy by taking her for an earlymorning swim in the inlet the romp and her sheer foolishness worked off a good portion of his stiffness and his frustration he watched ripley finish her run on the beach and dive into the surf dependable as sunrise he thought as she cut through the waves maybe he didnt always know what went on in her head or how it got there but he rarely had to worry about ripley todd she could handle herself lucy ran out to meet her as she started back and the two wet females had a wrestle and a race they both joined him on the upper porch lucy to flop down in delighted exhaustion and ripley sucking on a bottle of water mom called last night ripley flopped down herself on one of the deck chairs they made it to the grand canyon theyre sending us six million pictures that dad took with his digital im afraid to start the download sorry i missed the call i told them you were on a stakeout she said with her tongue in her cheek they got a kick out of the lobster caper any updates oh yeah he sat on the arm of the adirondack chair and filled her in she turned her face up to the sky and hooted i knew i shouldve gone with you idiot drunk putz lobster boy not you i figured he wasnt that drunk rip she lifted a hand waved it at him dont start that im in too good a mood for you to spoil it by mentioning mia and her double double toil and trouble routine suit yourself i usually do im going to get a shower ill take the first shift you must be wiped im okay listen but he trailed off trying to think how to put what he wanted to say listening i went by the yellow cottage on the way home nells lights were on so i stopped in aha ripley teased gutterface i had a cup of coffee and a muffin gee zack im sorry to hear that normally hed have laughed instead he rose paced to the rail you stop in and see her most every day youre friendly right i guess were friendly enough its hard not to like her women tend to confide stuff to their female friends dont they probably you want me to ask her if she likes you enough to go to the school dance with you she started to snicker but stopped when he turned around and saw his face hey sorry i didnt know it was serious whats up i think shes been abused man ripley stared down at her water bottle thats tough some son of a bitch messed with her im sure of it whether or not shes had counseling or gotten help it seems to me she could use a you know a girlfriend somebody she could talk to about it zack you know im no good at that kind of thing you are ive got the wrong equipment to be nells girlfriend rip just just see if you can spend some time with her go out on the boat or go shopping or he gestured vaguely paint each others toenails excuse me give me a break i dont know what you people do in your mysterious caves when men arent around we have pillow fights in our underwear he brightened because she wanted him to really i was afraid that was a myth so be a friend okay are you starting to get a thing for her yeah so so i guess ill be a friend nell walked into the coven at precisely five it was not as shed feared a dark eerie place but rather cozy the light was faintly blue and added a soft tint to the white flowers in the center of each table the tables themselves were round with deep chairs and small sofas circling them at the glossy bar the glasses sparkled nell had no more than chosen a table when a young waitress in trim unrelieved black set a silver bowl of mixed snacks in front of her can i get you a drink im waiting for someone maybe just a mineral water for now thanks the only other patrons were a couple poring over an island tours brochure while they sipped white wines and nibbled from a cheese plate the music was low and very like what mia tended to play in the bookstore nell tried to relax in her chair wishing shed brought a book ten minutes later mia breezed in the long skirt swirling around her long legs she carried a book and lifted her free hand in a wave toward the bar a glass of cabernet betsy first glass is on carl macey betsy shot mia a wink he gave me orders tell him i enjoyed it she sat down across from nell did you drive over no i walked do you drink alcoholic beverages now and then have one now whats your pleasure the cabernetll be fine thanks two betsy damn i love these things she began to pick through the snack bowl especially the little cheese ones that look like chinese symbols so i brought you a book a gift mia nudged the book toward nell i thought youd like to read about where youve chosen to live yes ive been meaning to the three sisters legends and lore she said reading the cover thank you youre settling in now getting your feet under you i should tell you first that i couldnt be happier with your work im glad to hear it i love working at the café the store i couldnt have tailormade a job id like more oh youre nell catching the comment as she served the wine betsy beamed youre always gone when i get to the caf i try to zip in before i open the bar great cookies thanks you hear from jane mia just today tim got his audition and theyre hopeful theyre paying the rent by working at a bakery in chelsea i hope theyre happy so do i ill leave you two alone let me know if you need anything so mia lifted her glass tapped it to nells slainte im sorry a gaelic toast cheers mia brought the glass to her lips watching nell over the rim what do you know about witches which sort like elizabeth montgomery on bewitched or the ones who wear crystals and burn candles and sell little bottles of love potion mia laughed crossed her legs actually i wasnt thinking of hollywood or pseudowiccans i didnt mean to be insulting i know there are people who take the matter very seriously a kind of religion that should be respected even if they are kooks mia said with a hint of a smile no youre not a kook i understand well you mentioned it that first day then your conversation with ripley yesterday good then weve established that im a witch mia sipped again youre a sweet one nell there you are trying very hard to discuss this intelligently soberly when youre thinking im lets say eccentric well table that for the moment and go back in history so i can lay some groundwork for you you know of the witch trials in salem sure a few hysterical young girls fanatical puritans mob mentality burn the witch hang mia corrected nineteen people all innocents were hanged in one was pressed to death when he refused to declare himself innocent or guilty others died in prison there have been witchhunts throughout time here in europe in every corner of the world even when most stopped believing or admitting to a belief in witchcraft there were hunts nazism mccarthyism the kkk and so on nothing more than fanatics with power pushing their own agendas and finding enough weak minds to do the dirty work and dont mia thought taking a breath get me started but today were concerned with one microcosm of history she leaned back tapped a finger lightly on the book the puritans came here searching they said for religious freedom of course many of them were only looking for a place to force their beliefs and their fears on others and in salem they persecuted and murdered blindly so blindly that not one of the nineteen souls they took was the soul of a witch prejudice and fear are never clearsighted well said there were three among them women whod chosen this place to live their lives and live their craft powerful women who had helped the sick and the sorry they knew these three that they could no longer stay where they would sooner or later be accused and condemned so the isle of three sisters was created created its said that they met in secret and cast a spell and part of the land was torn away from the mainland were living on what they took from that time and that place a sanctuary a haven isnt that what you came for nell i came for work and found it they were known as air and earth and fire for some years they lived quietly and at peace and alone it was loneliness that weakened them the one known as air wished for love we all do nell said quietly perhaps she dreamed of a prince golden and handsome who would sweep her away to some lovely place where they would live happily and have children to comfort her she was careless with her wish as women can be when they yearn he came for her and she saw only that he was golden and handsome she went away with him left her haven she tried to be a good and dutiful wife and bore her children loved them but it wasnt enough for him under the gold he was dark she grew to fear him and he fed on her fear one night mad with that hunger he killed her for being what she was thats a sad story nells throat was dry but she didnt lift her glass theres more but thats enough for now each had a sad story and a tragic end and each left a legacy a child who would bear a child who would bear a child and so on there would come a time it was said when a descendant from each of the sisters would be on the island at the same time each would have to find a way to redeem and break the pattern set three hundred years ago if not the island would topple into the sea lost as atlantis islands dont topple into the sea islands arent created by three women usually mia countered if you believe the first the second isnt much of a stretch you believe it nell nodded and that youre one of the descendants yes as you are im no one thats him talking not you im sorry instantly contrite mia reached out and gripped nells hand before she could rise i said i wouldnt pry and i wont but it annoys me to hear you say youre no one to hear you mean it forget all the rest for now if you must but dont forget who and what you are youre an intelligent woman with spine enough to make a life for herself with a gift magic in the kitchen i admire you im sorry struggling to settle again nell reached for her wine im speechless you had the courage to strike out on your own to come to a strange place and make yourself part of it courage had nothing to do with it youre wrong he didnt break you he did despite herself nells eyes filled i just took the pieces and ran away took the pieces escaped and rebuilt cant you be proud of that i cant explain what it was like you dont have to but you will eventually have to recognize your own power youll never feel complete until you do im only looking for a normal life you cant forget the possibilities mia held out a hand palm up waited unable to resist nell reached out laid her palm against mias and felt the heat a painless burn of power its in you ill help you find it ill teach you mia stated as nell stared dumbfounded at the shimmer of light between their palms when youre ready ripley scanned the beach scene and saw nothing out of the ordinary someones toddler was having a tantrum and the highpitched cranky sound of no no no blasted the air somebody missed his nap she thought people were scattered over the sand staking out their territory with towels blankets umbrellas totes coolers portable stereos nobody just went to the beach anymore she mused they packed for a day on the sand the way they packed to go to europe it never failed to amuse her every day couples and groups would haul their possessions out of their rentals and hotel rooms and set up their temporary nests on the shore and every day they would pack everything up again and haul it along with a good bit of sand back again holiday nomads the bedouins of summer leaving them to it she headed up to the village she carried nothing but her police issue a swiss army knife and a few dollars life was simpler that way she turned on high street intending to spend those few dollars on a quick meal she was off duty as much as either she or zack was ever off duty and was looking forward to a cold beer and a hot pizza when she spotted nell standing in front of the hotel looking dazed she hesitated it was as good a time as any she supposed to make that friendly overture hey nell what oh hello ripley you look a little lost no she knew just where she was nell thought at the moment it was the only thing she was absolutely sure of just a little distracted long day huh listen im about to grab some dinner a little early but im starved why dont we split a pizza my treat oh she continued to blink like someone coming out of a dream the surfside makes the best pizza on the island well its the only pizza place on the island but still howre things going at the café good there was really nothing to do but fall into step she couldnt think clearly and would have sworn that her fingers still tingled i love working there youve classed up the place ripley commented and angled her head to get a look at the book nell carried reading up on island voodoo voodoo oh with a nervous laugh nell tucked the book under her arm i guess if im living here i ought to know things sure ripley pulled open the door of the pizzeria the tourists love all that island mystique crap when we hit the solstice well be flooded with new agers hey bart ripley gave the man behind the counter a salute and grabbed an empty booth it may have been early but the place was jammed the jukebox was blaring and the two video games tucked back in a small alcove shot out noise and light bart and his wife terry run the place ripley shifted stretched her legs out on the bench theyve got your calzones your pasta and yadda yadda she said tossing nell a laminated menu but its really all about the pizza you up for that sure great anything you dont like on it nell scanned the menu why couldnt she think no even better well get a large loaded what we dont eat ill take home to zack hell pick off the mushrooms and onions and be grateful she slid out of the booth again want a beer no no thanks just water coming up seeing no point in waiting for table service ripley walked up to the counter placed the order nell watched the way she joked with the long thin man behind the counter the way she hooked her sunglasses in the collar of her shirt the way she stretched gorgeously toned and tanned arms out for the drinks the way her dark hair bobbed as she turned to walk back to the booth the noise receded like echoes in a dream until it was a wash of white sound under a rising roar like waves cresting as ripley sat across from her again nell saw her mouth moving but heard nothing nothing at all then like a door flung open it all swarmed back right up through labor day ripley finished and reached for her beer youre the third nell gripped her tingling hands together on the table huh the third youre the third sister ripley opened her mouth then closed it again in a long thin line mia she ground the two syllables together then gulped down half her beer dont start with me i dont understand theres nothing to understand just drop it she slapped the glass back on the table leaned forward heres the deal mia can think believe whatever she wants she can behave however she wants as long as she doesnt break the law i dont have to buy into it if you want to thats your business but im here for pizza and a beer i dont know what i buy into it makes you angry it just confuses me look you strike me as a sensible woman sensible women dont go around claiming to be witches descended from a trio of witches who carved an island out of a chunk of massachusetts yes but no buts theres reality and theres fantasy lets stick with reality because anything else is going to put me off my pizza so are you going to go out with my brother go confused nell pushed a hand through her hair could you rewind that question zacks working up to asking you out you interested before you answer let me say hes had all his shots practices good personal hygiene and though he has some annoying habits hes reasonably well adjusted so think about that ill get the pizza nell blew out a breath sat back she had she decided entirely too much to think about in one short evening chapter six contents prev next ripley was right about the solstice café book was so busy mia had taken on two parttime clerks for the shop and added another behind the café counter the run on the vegetarian dishes over a twoday period kept nell in a constant state of panic were running low on eggplant and alfalfa she said as peg came on shift i thought id calculated hell she yanked off her apron im going to run down to the market get what i can i may have to substitute change the menu for the rest of the day hey whatever dont sweat it easy for you to say nell thought as she rushed downstairs shed run out of hazelnut muffins by noon and there was no way the chocolate chunk cookies were going to last the day at the rate they were disappearing it was her responsibility to make certain everything in the café ran as mia expected it to run if she made a mistake in her rush to the back door she all but ran over lulu im sorry im sorry im such an idiot are you all right ill live lulu brushed fussily at her shirt the girl had put in a good three weeks work but that didnt mean lulu was ready to trust her slow down just because youre off shift doesnt mean you have to run out of the place like its on fire no im sorry is mia would you tell mia im sorry and that ill be right back she bolted out the door and didnt stop running until she was in the produce section of island market panic and dread churned in her stomach how could she have been so stupid buying supplies was an essential part of her job hadnt she been told to expect larger crowds over the solstice weekend a moron could have done a better job planning for it the pressure in her chest was making her head light but she forced herself to think to study her choices to select she filled her basket quickly waiting in agony in the checkout line as the minutes ticked away dorcas chatted at her and nell managed to make some responses while all the while her brain was screaming hurry she gathered the three heavy bags and cursing herself for not thinking to bring her car began to carry them as quickly as she could manage back to the shop nell nell wait a minute shaking his head when she didnt respond zack jogged across the street let me give you a hand with those it amazed her she didnt jump straight out of her sneakers as he reached out took two of the bags i can get them i can do it im in a hurry youll move faster if youre not weighed down supplies for the café yes yes she was nearly running again she could get another salad put together ten minutes fifteen tops and prep the ingredients for sandwiches then she could deal with the sweets if she could get started right away there might not be any gap i guess youre pretty busy he didnt like the look on her face it was so grim so set like someone about to go to war i shouldve anticipated theres no excuse for it she shoved through the back door of the shop bolted up the stairs by the time he got to the kitchen she was already unbagging thank you i can take care of it now i know what to do she moved like a dervish zack thought her eyes glassy and face pale i thought you got off at two nell two she didnt bother to look up but continued to chop grate mix no i made a mistake i have to fix it everythings going to be all right its going to be fine no ones going to be upset or inconvenienced i should have planned better i will next time i promise need two sandwich specials and a veggie pita jeez nell peg murmured as she stepped to the doorway zack put a hand on her arm get mia he said quietly two specials and a veggie okay okay nell set the beanandcucumber salad aside hauled out the sandwich ingredients i bought some more eggplant so well be fine just fine no ones upset nell you dont need to worry why dont you sit down a minute i only need a half hour twenty minutes none of the guests will be disturbed she picked up the orders spun around then jerked to a halt as mia came in its all right really its all right well have plenty of everything ill take those peg eased by slipped the orders out of nells hand they look great im just putting together a new salad there were bands around her chest around her head tightening tightening it wont take any time at all then ill take care of the rest ill take care of it dont be angry no ones angry nell i think you should take a break now i dont need one ill just finish in desperation she grabbed a bag of nuts i know i shouldve planned better and im terribly sorry but ill make sure everythings perfect he couldnt stand it couldnt stand to see her standing there trembling now her face white hell with this zack spat and stepped toward her dont she stumbled back dropping the bag flinging her arms up as if to guard her face from a blow the moment she did shame smothered panic oh baby zacks voice was ripe with sympathy she could do nothing but turn away from it i want you to come with me now mia moved to her took her hand all right come with me now miserably embarrassed helplessly shaken nell let herself be led away zack jammed his hands in his pockets and felt useless i dont know what got into me the fact was the last hour was largely a blur id say you had a big whopping panic attack now sit down mia walked across her office opened what nell had taken to be a file drawer instead she saw a minifridge stocked with small bottles of water and juice you dont have to talk to me mia said as she stepped over gave nell an opened bottle of water but you should think about talking to someone i know rather than drinking nell rubbed the chilled bottle over her face it was beyond ridiculous she thought now falling to pieces over eggplant i thought i was over it that hasnt happened in a really long time months we were so busy and supplies were running low it got bigger and bigger in my mind until i thought if i didnt get some more eggplant the world was going to end she drank now deeply stupid not stupid if you were used to being punished for something just that petty in the past nell lowered the bottle hes not here he cant hurt me cant he little sister hes never stopped hurting you if thats true its my problem im not a dishrag anymore im not a punching bag or a doormat good to hear she pressed her fingers to her temple she had to let something out she realized lift something off or shed break again we had a party once and ran out of martini olives it was the first time he hit me mias face registered no shock no judgment how long did you stay with him there was no censure in the question no slick surface of pity or underlying smugness because the question was asked in a brisk and practical tone nell responded in kind three years if he finds me hell kill me i knew that when i left hes an important man wealthy connected hes looking for you no he thinks im dead nearly nine months now id rather be dead than live the way i was living that sounds melodramatic but no it doesnt the employment forms you filled out for me are they safe yes my grandmothers maiden name i broke some laws computer hacking false statement forged documents to get new identification a drivers license social security number computer hacking lifting a brow mia smiled nell you surprise me im good with computers i used to you dont have to tell me its all right i helped run a business a catering business with my mother a long time ago i used a computer for records invoices what have you since i was going to keep the books the records i took some courses when i started planning to run i did a lot of research i knew id only get one chance god ive never been able to talk to anyone about it i never thought i could do you want to tell me the rest im not sure it gets stuck somewhere right about here she said tapping a fist on her chest if you decide you want to come up to the house tonight ill show you my gardens my cliffs meanwhile take a breather take a walk take a nap mia id like to finish in the café not because im upset or worried id just like to finish all right the drive up the coast was breathtaking the curving road with its sudden unexpected twists the steady roar of the water the rush of wind the memories it brought back should have disturbed her left her shaken instead as nell pushed her poor rustbucket of a car for speed she felt exhilarated as if she were leaving all her excess weight on the twisted road behind her maybe it was the sight of that tall white tower against the summer sky and the broody stone house beside it they looked like something out of a storybook old and sturdy and wonderfully secret the painting shed seen on the mainland hadnt done them justice oil and canvas hadnt been able to translate the sweep of the wind the texture of the rocks the gnarled humps of trees and she thought as she rounded the last turn the painting hadnt had mia standing between two vivid flows of flowers in a blue dress with her miles of red hair rioting in the wind nell parked her sad car behind mias shiny silver convertible i hope you dont take this the wrong way nell called out i always take things the right way i was just thinking if i were a man id promise you anything when mia only laughed nell tipped back her head and tried to take in all the house at once the dour stone the fanciful gables the romance of the widows walk its wonderful it suits you it certainly does but so far from everything everyone youre not lonely here i enjoy my own company are you afraid of heights no nell answered no im not have a look at the headland its spectacular nell walked with her between the house and the tower out to the rugged jag of cliffs that jutted over the ocean even here there were flowers tough little blooms that fought their way through cracks or blossomed along the scruffy tufts of wild grass below the waves thrashed and fumed hurling themselves against the base of the cliffs rearing back to slap again beyond the water turned a deep deep blue and stretched forever when i was a girl i would sit here and wonder at all this sometimes i still do nell turned her head studied mias profile did you grow up here yes in this house its always been mine my parents were for the sea and now they sail it theyre currently in the south pacific i think we were always more a couple and a child than a family they never quite adjusted to me nor i to them for that matter though we got along well enough with a little shrug she turned away the lights been here nearly three hundred years sending out its beam to guide ships and seamen still thereve been wrecks and its said as one would expect it to be said of such places that on some nights when the wind is right one can hear the desperate calls of the drowned not a comforting bedtime story no the sea isnt always kind still she was drawn to it compelled to stand and watch its whims its charm and its violence fire drawn to water the house came before she added it was the first house built on the island conjured by magic in the moonlight nell added i read the book well magic or mortar it stands the gardens are my joy and ive indulged myself there she gestured nell looked back toward the house blinked the rear was a fantasy of blooms shapes arbors paths the juxtaposition between raw cliffs and lush fairyland almost made her dizzy my god mia its amazing spectacular like a painting do you do all the work yourself mmm now and then ill dragoon a strong back but for the most part i can handle it it relaxes me she said as they walked toward the first tangle of hedges and gratifies me there seemed to be dozens of secret places unexpected turns an iron trellis buried under wisteria a sudden stream of pure white blossoms curling through like a satin ribbon a tiny pool where water lilies drifted and reeds speared up around a statue of a goddess there were stone fairies and fragrant lavender marble dragons and trailing nasturtium cheerfully blooming herbs tumbled through a rock garden and spilled toward a cushion of moss covered with starry flowers no wonder youre not lonely here exactly mia led the way down a crooked path to a small stone island the table there was stone as well and stood on the base of a laughing winged gargoyle were having champagne to celebrate the solstice ive never met anyone like you mia lifted the bottle out of a gleaming copper pail i should hope not i insist on being unique she poured two glasses sat then stretched out her legs and wiggled the painted toes of her bare feet tell me how you died nell i drove off a cliff she took her glass drank deep we lived in california beverly hills and monterey it seemed at first like being a princess in a castle he swept me off my feet she couldnt sit so she wandered the little island and drew in the scent of the flowers she heard the tinkle of bells and saw that mia had the same starry wind chime shed bought for herself on her first day my father was in the military we moved around a lot and that was hard but he was wonderful so handsome and brave and strong i suppose he was strict but he was never unkind i loved being with him he couldnt always be with us and we missed him i loved seeing him come back in his uniform and the way his face would light up when my mother and i went to meet him he was killed in the gulf war i still miss him she drew a deep breath it wasnt easy for my mother but she got through it thats when she started the catering business she called it a moveable feast hemingway clever mia acknowledged classy she was both shes always been a terrific cook and loved to entertain she taught me it was something we liked doing together a bond between you mia commented a lovely and strong one yes we moved to chicago and she built up an impressive reputation while i went to college took care of the books and pitched in whenever i could manage it around classes when i was twentyone i started working with her fulltime we expanded and developed an elite list of clients thats how i met evan at a party in chicago we were catering a very important party for very important people i was twentyfour he was ten years older and everything i wasnt sophisticated brilliant cultured mia held up a finger why do you say that youre a traveled educated woman with an enviable skill i didnt feel like any of those things when i was with him nell sighed in any case i didnt move in the same circles i cooked for the rich the highpowered the glamorous i didnt share the table with them he made me feel grateful that he would pay attention to me as if it were some fabulous compliment i just realized that she shook her head he flirted with me and it was exciting he sent me two dozen roses the next day it was always red roses he asked me out and took me to the theater to parties to fabulous restaurants he stayed in chicago for two weeks made it clear he was staying reorganizing his schedule putting off his clients his work his life for me i was meant for him nell whispered rubbing arms that were suddenly chilled we were meant for each other then when he told me that it was thrilling later not so very much later it was terrifying he said things to me that seemed romantic then wed always be together wed never be apart he would never let me go he dazzled me and when he asked me to marry him i didnt think twice my mother had reservations asked me to give it some time but i wouldnt listen we eloped and i went back to california with him the press called it the romance of the decade ah yes mia nodded as nell turned back it clicks you looked different then more like a pampered kitten i looked the way he told me to look and behaved the way he told me to behave at first that seemed fine he was older wiser and i was new in his world he made it seem reasonable just as he made it seem instructional when he would tell me i was slow or dull he knew best so if he ordered me to change my dress for another before i was permitted to go out he was only looking out for my interests and our image it was very subtle at first those digs those demands and whenever i pleased him i was given a little treat like a puppy being trained here you performed very well for company last night have a diamond bracelet god it disgusts me how easily i was manipulated you were in love i did love him the man i thought he was and he was so clever so relentless the first time he hit me it was a horrible shock but it never occurred to me that i didnt deserve it id been so well trained it got worse after that but slowly bit by bit my mother was killed hardly a year after i left drunk driver nell said her voice thickening and you were alone then im so sorry he was so kind so supportive he made all the arrangements canceled his appointments for a week to take me to chicago he did everything a loving husband could do and the day we got home he went wild he waited until we were home back in that house and hed sent all the servants away then he knocked me down he raved and slapped he never used his fists on me always an open hand i think it was somehow more degrading he accused me of having an affair with one of the mourners a man whod been a good friend of my parents a kind and decent man whom i thought of as an uncle well surprised that her glass was empty she walked back to the table poured another there were birds singing a pretty chippering among the flowers we dont need a blowbyblow account he abused me i took it she lifted her glass drank steadied herself again i went to the police once he had a lot of friends on the force a lot of influence they didnt take me seriously oh i had some bruises but nothing life threatening he found out and he explained to me in ways id understand that if i ever humiliated him like that again hed kill me i got away once but he found me he told me i belonged to him and that he would never let me go he told me that when his hands were around my throat that if i ever tried to leave him hed find me and hed kill me no one would ever know and i believed him but you did leave him i planned it for six months step by step always careful not to upset him not to give him cause to suspect we entertained we traveled we slept together we were the picture of the perfect affluent couple he still hit me there was always something i didnt do quite right but i would always apologize i pilfered cash whenever i could and hid it in a box of tampons pretty safe bet he wouldnt look there i got a fake drivers license and i hid that too and then i was ready he had a sister in big sur she was having a lavish tea party very female i was expected to go that morning i complained of a headache which of course annoyed him i was just making excuses he said a number of his clients would be there and i just wanted to embarrass him by not showing up so i said id go naturally id go i would just take some aspirin and be fine but i knew my reluctance would ensure him letting me out of the house shed gotten clever too nell thought now at deceit at pretense i wasnt even frightened then he went off to play golf and i put what i needed in the trunk of the car i stopped on the way and put on a black wig i picked up the secondhand bike id bought the week before and put it in the trunk i stopped again before i got to the party hid the bike at a spot id picked out i drove down highway and i went to tea nell sat down spoke calmly while mia sat in silence i made sure that a number of people noted i wasnt feeling very well barbara his sister even suggested i lie down for a bit i waited until most of the guests had left then i thanked her for a lovely time she was worried about me i looked pale i brushed her off and i got back in the car her voice was calm almost flat she was just a woman telling a mildly distasteful story one that had happened to someone else thats what she told herself it was dark now i needed it to be i called evan on my cell phone to tell him i was on my way he always insisted on that i got to the stretch of the road where id hidden the bike and there were no other cars i knew it could be done had to be i took off my seat belt i didnt think id practiced it in my head a thousand times so i didnt let myself think i opened the door still driving swerving going faster i aimed for the edge if i didnt make it well i was no worse off i jumped it was like flying the car soared over the edge just soared like a bird then it crashed on the rocks horrible sound and it tumbled and rolled and fell into the water i ran back to where i had the bike and the bag i pulled off my beautiful suit and put on old jeans and a sweatshirt the wig i still wasnt afraid no she hadnt been afraid not then but now as she relived it her voice began to hitch it hadnt happened to someone else after all i rode down the hills and up and down when i got to carmel i went into the bus station and i paid cash for a oneway ticket to las vegas when i was on the bus and it started to move out of the station i was afraid afraid he would come and stop the bus and i would lose but he didnt in vegas i got on a bus for albuquerque and in albuquerque i bought a paper and read about the tragic death of helen remington nell mia reached out closed a hand over nells she doubted that nell was aware shed been crying for the last ten minutes ive never met anyone like you either nell lifted her glass and as tears spilled down her cheeks toasted thanks at mias insistence she spent the night it seemed sensible after several glasses of champagne and an emotional purge to let herself be led to a big fourposter without protest she slipped on a borrowed silk nightshirt climbed between soft linen sheets and fell instantly asleep and woke in the moonlit dark it took her a moment to orient herself to remember where she was and what had awakened her mias guest room she thought groggily and people were singing no not singing chanting it was a lovely melodious sound just on the edges of her hearing drawn to it she rose and still logy with sleep moved directly to the terrace doors she pushed them open to a warm whipping wind and stepped out into the pearlwhite light of a threequarter moon the scent of flowers seemed to rise up and surround her until her head spun with it as it had with wind the heartbeat of the sea was fast almost a rage and her own raced to keep pace then she saw mia dressed in a robe that gleamed silver in the moonlight step out of the woods where trees swayed like dancers she walked to the cliffs the silver of her gown the flame of her hair whirling there high on the rocks she faced the sea and lifted her arms to star and moon the air filled with voices and the voices seemed filled with joy with her eyes dazzled with wonder stinging with tears she didnt understand nell watched as light shimmering beams of it slid down from the sky to brush the tips of mias fingers the ends of her flying hair for a moment it seemed she was like a candle straight slim incandescent lighting the edge of the world then there was only the sound of the surf the pearlwhite light of the waning moon and a woman standing alone on a cliff mia turned walked back toward the house her head lifted and her eyes met nells held held she smiled quietly moved into the shadow of the house and was gone chapter seven contents prev next it was still dark when nell tiptoed down to mias kitchen the house was huge and took some maneuvering though she wasnt sure what time mia rose for the day she brewed a pot of coffee for her hostess and wrote a note of thanks before she left they would have to talk nell thought as she drove home in the softening light of predawn about a number of things and they would she decided as soon as she could figure out where to begin she could almost convince herself that what shed seen in the moonlight had been nothing more than a champagneinduced dream almost but it was too clear in her mind to be a dream light spilling out of stars like liquid silver a rising wind full of song a woman glowing like a torch such things should be fantasy but they werent if they were real and she had a part in them she needed to know what it all meant for the first time in nearly four years she felt absolutely steady absolutely calm for now that was enough by noon she was too busy to think about more than the job at hand there was a paycheck in her pocket and a day off around the corner iced hazelnut cappuccino large the man who ordered leaned on the counter as nell began to work she judged him as midthirties healthclub fit and a mainlander it pleased her that she could already with very decent accuracy spot a mainlander and feel the slightly smug reaction of an islander so how much aphrodisiac do you put in those cookies he asked her she glanced at him im sorry ever since i tasted your oatmeal raisin i havent been able to get you out of my mind really i couldve sworn i put all the aphrodisiac in the macadamia nut in that case ill take three he said im jim and youve seduced me with your baked goods then youd better stay away from my threebean salad itll ruin you for all other women if i buy all the threebean salad will you marry me and have my children well i would jim but ive taken a sacred oath to stay free to bake for all the world she capped his coffee bagged it do you really want those cookies you bet how about a clambake some friends and i are sharing a house were going to do in some clams tonight tonight a clambake tomorrow a house in the suburbs and a cocker spaniel she rang him up took his money with a smile better safe than sorry but thanks youre breaking my heart he said and sighing heavily he walked away oh man he is so cute peg craned her neck to keep him in sight until hed gone downstairs youre really not interested no nell took off her apron rolled her shoulders then you wouldnt mind if i gave him a shot be my guest theres plenty of bean salad in the fridge oh and peg thanks for being understanding about yesterday hey everybody gets weird now and then see you monday see you monday nell thought it was just that simple she was a member of the team she had friends she had deflected an overture from an attractive man without getting the jitters in fact she enjoyed it the way she used to enjoy such things the day might come when she didnt feel compelled to deflect one day she might go to a clambake with a man and some of his friends talk laugh enjoy the companionship light casual friendships she could do that there couldnt be any serious relationships in her future even if she could learn to handle one emotionally she was after all still legally married but now just now that fact was more of a safety net than the nightmare it had been she was free to be whoever she wanted to be but not free enough to be bound again not to any man she decided to treat herself to an ice cream cone and a detour to the beach people called her by name as she passed and that was a quiet thrill as she crossed the sand she spotted pete stahr and his infamous dog both looked sheepish as zack stood beside them hands on hips he never wore a hat as hed advised her to do when gardening as a result his hair was lighter at the tips and almost always disordered from the ocean breeze he rarely wore his badge either she noted but the gun rode in the holster at his hip almost casually it occurred to her that if he had stopped by the café and asked her to go to a clambake she might not have brushed him off when the dog lifted his paw hopefully zack shook his head pointed to the leash that pete held once the leash was secured man and dog walked off heads hung low zack turned the sun bouncing off his dark glasses and she knew instinctively that he was looking at her nell braced herself and went to him sheriff nell pete let his dog off the leash again mutt smells like a fish house ice creams dripping its hot nell licked at the cone and decided to get it over with about yesterday feeling better yes good gonna share any of that what oh sure she held out the cone felt a little tingle in the blood when he licked just above her fingertips funny she thought she hadnt gotten any tingles from the cute guy with the clambake youre not going to ask not as long as youd rather i didnt yes hed looked at her and had seen the deliberate squaring of her shoulders before she started toward him why dont you walk with me a while theres a nice breeze off the water i was wondering what does lucy do all day when youre out upholding the law this and that dog chores that tickled a laugh out of her dog chores sure some days a dogs got to hang around the house roll in the grass and think long thoughts other times she comes on in to the office with me when shes in the mood swims chews up my shoes im thinking about buying her a brother or sister i was thinking about getting a cat im not sure id be able to train a puppy a cat would be easier i saw a notice on the board in the market for free kittens the stubens girls cat theyve still got one or two left last i heard their place is over on bay white saltbox blue shutters she nodded stopped impulse she reminded herself had served her well so far why stop following it zack im going to try out a new recipe tonight tuna and linguini with sundried tomatoes and feta i could use a guinea pig he lifted her hand took another taste of her dripping ice cream well it happens i dont have any pressing plans for tonight and as sheriff i do what i can to serve the needs of the community what time is seven all right with you works for me fine ill see you then bring an appetite she said as she hurried away count on it he said and tipped down his dark glasses to watch her dash back toward the village at seven the appetizers were ready and the wine was chilling nell had bought a secondhand table and planned to spend part of her day off scraping and painting it but for now she covered the scarred wood and peeling green paint with a sheet it stood on her back lawn along with the two old chairs shed picked up for a song they werent particularly pretty at the moment but they had potential and they were hers shed set the table with two plates two bowls and wineglasses all purchases from the island thrift shop nothing matched but she thought the result was cheerful and charming and as far from the formal china and heavy silver of her past as possible her garden was coming along well and the tomato and pepper plants the squash and zucchini would all be put in the following morning she was very close to broke again and completely content well now doesnt that look sweet nell turned to see gladys macey standing on the edge of her lawn gripping an enormous white purse just as pretty as a picture mrs macey hello hope you dont mind me dropping by this way idve called but you havent got a phone no of course not um can i get you something to drink no no dont you fuss ive come by on business business yes indeed her tidy helmet of black hair barely moved as she gave a sharp nod carl and i got our thirtieth anniversary coming up last part of july congratulations you can say that again two people stick it out for three decades its saying something since it is i want a party and i just finished telling carl hes not getting out of putting on a suit for it either i was wondering if youd take care of putting the refreshments together for me oh well i want a catered affair gladys said definitely and i want it spiffy when my girl got married two years ago last april we hired a caterer from the mainland too snippy for my taste and too dear for carls but we didnt have much to choose from i dont figure youre going to get snippy with me or charge me a kings ransom for a bowl of cold shrimp mrs macey i appreciate you thinking of me but im not set up to cater well you got time dont you ive got a list here of how many people and the kind of business im thinking of she pulled a file folder out of the enormous purse pushed it into nells hand i want to have it right at my house and ive got my mothers good china and so forth you just look over what ive put together there and well talk about it tomorrow you come on by the house tomorrow afternoon id certainly like to help you maybe i can she looked down at the folder saw that gladys had marked it thirtieth anniversary and had added a heart with her initials and carls in the center touched she tucked the folder under her arm ill see what i can do youre a nice girl nell gladys glanced over her shoulder at the sound of a car lifted her eyebrows as she recognized zacks cruiser and youve got good taste you come on by tomorrow and well talk this out have a nice dinner now she strolled toward her car stopping to say a few words to zack she gave him a pat on the cheek noted the flowers in his hand by the time she was behind the wheel she was planning who shed call first to spread the news that zachariah todd was sparking the little channing girl im a little late sorry we had a fender bender in the village put me behind its all right i thought you might like these for your garden she smiled at the pot of shasta daisies theyre perfect thanks she took them set them beside her kitchen stoop ill get the wine and the appetizers he walked into the kitchen behind her something smells great once i got started i tried out a couple of different recipes youve got your work cut out for you im up for it now whats this he crouched down stroked a finger over the smokegray kitten circled on a pillow in the corner thats diego were living together the kitten mewed stretched then began to bat at zacks shoelaces youve been busy cooking buying furniture getting a roommate scooping up diego he turned toward her nobodys going to find any moss on you nell he stood there big and handsome with a gray kitten nuzzling at his shoulder hed brought her white daisies in a plastic pot oh damn she set her tray of appetizers down again took a breath i might as well get this over with i dont want you to get the wrong impression about dinner and things im very attracted to you but im not in a place where i can act on my feelings its only fair to tell you that up front there are good reasons for it but im not willing to get into them so if youd rather just go no hard feelings he listened soberly rubbing a finger between the kittens silky ears i appreciate you spelling that out for me seems a shame to waste all this food though he plucked a stuffed olive from the tray popped it into his mouth ill just hang around if its all the same to you why dont i take the wine outside he picked up the bottle and still carrying diego bumped the screened door with his hip oh and in the interest of fair play ill tell you ill be nudging you out of that place youre in with that said he held the door open you want to bring those on out im not as easy a nudge as you might think honey theres nothing easy about you she picked up the tray sailed by him i take that as a compliment it was meant as one now why dont we have some wine relax and you can tell me what gladys macey was after when they were seated she poured the wine and he settled the kitten in his lap i thought being sheriff youd know all there is to know about whats going on well he leaned over the tray selected a gnocchi i can deduce seeing as im a trained observer theres a file on your counter marked with gladyss handwriting which leads me to believe shes planning on an anniversary party and as im sitting here heading straight toward heaven with whatever the hell it is i just put in my mouth and knowing gladys is a shrewd lady id suppose shes wanting you to cater it howd i do dead on are you going to do it im going to think about it youd do a great job he plucked another selection from the tray examined it suspiciously any mushrooms in this thing i hate mushrooms no were fungifree tonight why would i do a good job i said great job he popped it in his mouth some creamy cheese and herbs in a thin and flaky pastry because you cook like a magician you look like an angel and youre as organized as a computer you get things done and youve got style how come youre not eating any of this i want to see if you live first when he only grinned and kept eating she sat back and sipped her wine im a good cook put me in a kitchen and i rule the world im presentable but i dont look like an angel im the one looking at you im organized she continued because i keep my life simple which is another way of saying youre not going to complicate it with me there you go dead on again im going to get the salad zack waited until her back was turned before he let his amusement show easy enough to ruffle her feathers he said to diego when you know where to scratch let me tell you something ive learned over the years about women keep changing the rhythm and theyll never know what to expect next when nell came back out zack launched into the story of the pediatrician from washington and the stockbroker from new york whod bumped fenders outside the pharmacy on high street he made her laugh put her gently at ease again before she knew it she was telling him about various kitchen feuds in restaurants where shed worked temperaments and sharp implements she said a dangerous combination i once had a line chef threaten me with an electric whisk because dusk was falling he lit the squat red candle shed set on the table i had no idea there was so much danger and intrigue behind those swinging doors and sexual tension she added twirling linguini onto her fork smoldering looks over simmering pots of stock broken hearts shattering in the whipping cream its a hotbed foods got all that sensuality flavor texture scent this tunas getting me pretty worked up so the dish passes the audition its great candlelight suited her he thought it put little gold lights in those deep blue pools do you make this stuff up or collect recipes what both i like to experiment when my mother she trailed off but zack merely picked up the wine bottle topped off their glasses she liked to cook nell said simply and entertain my mother well well just say the kitchen wasnt her best room i was twenty before i realized a pork chop wasnt supposed to bounce if you dropped it she lived on an island most of her life but as far as she was concerned tuna came out of a can shes hell with numbers though numbers certified public accountant retired now she and my dad bought themselves one of those big tin cans on wheels and hit the great american highway about a year ago theyre having a terrific time thats nice and so was the unmistakable affection in his voice do you miss them i do im not going to say i miss my mothers cooking but i miss their company my father used to sit out on the back porch and play the banjo i miss that the banjo it sounded so charming do you play no i never could get my fingers to cooperate my father played the piano he used to she stopped herself again realigning her thoughts as she rose i could never get my fingers to cooperate either strawberry shortcake for dessert can you manage it i can probably choke some down just to be polite let me give you a hand no she waved him down before he could rise ive got it itll just take me she glanced down as she cleared his plate saw diego sprawled bellyup in apparent ecstasy in his lap have you been sneaking that cat food from the table me all innocence zack picked up his wineglass i dont know what makes you think that youll spoil him and make him sick she started to reach down scoop up the kitten then realized that considering diegos location the move was just a tad too personal put him down a while so he can run around and work off that tuna before i take him inside yes maam she had the coffee on and was about to slice the cake when he came through the door with the serving bowl thanks but guests dont clear they did in my house he looked at the cake all fluffy white and succulent red and back at her honey ive got to tell you thats a work of art presentations half the battle she said pleased she went still when he laid his hand over the back of hers nearly relaxed again when he simply moved hers to widen the size of the slice im a big patron of the arts at this rate diegos not the only one whos going to be sick but she cut him a piece twice the size of her own ill bring the coffee i should tell you something else he began as he picked up the plates then held the door for her again i plan on touching you a lot maybe you could work on getting used to it i dont like being handled i didnt plan to start out that way he walked to the table set down the cake plates and sat though handling on both sides can have some satisfying results i dont put marks on women nell i dont use my hands that way im not going to talk about that she answered curtly im not asking you to im talking about me and you and the way things are now things arent any way now like that theyre going to be he scooped up some cake sampled it god woman you sell this on the open market youd be a millionaire inside of six months i dont need to be rich got your back up again he observed and kept right on eating i dont mind that some men look for a woman wholl buckle under tow the line whatever he shrugged speared a fat strawberry now me i wonder why it seems that would get boring fast for both parties involved no spark there if you know what i mean i dont need sparks either everybody does people who set them off each other every time they turn around though well that would just wear you out something told her he didnt wear out or wear down easily but if you dont light a spark now and again he went on you miss the sizzle that comes with it if you cooked without spice or seasoning youd come up with something you could eat but it wouldnt satisfy thats very clever but there are some of us who stay healthier on a bland diet my greatuncle frank zack gestured with his fork before he dived into the cake again ulcers some said it came from pure meanness and its hard to argue he was a hardheaded miserly yankee never married he preferred curling up in bed with his ledgers rather than a woman lived to be ninetyeight and the moral of the story oh i wasnt thinking of morals just greatuncle frank wed go to dinner at my grandmothers the third sunday of every month when i was a boy she made the best damn pot roast you know the kind circled around with the little potatoes and carrots my mother didnt inherit grans talent with a pot roast but anyway greatuncle frank would come and eat rice pudding while the rest of us gorged the man scared the hell out of me i cant look at a bowl of rice pudding to this day without getting the shakes it must be some kind of magic she decided that made it so impossible not to relax around him i think youre making half that up not a single word you can look him up in the registry at the island methodist church francis morris bigelow gran she married a ripley but was a bigelow by birth and older sister to frank she lived to just past her hundredth birthday herself we tend to be longlived in my family which is why most of us dont settle down to marriage and family until into our thirties i see since hed polished off his cake nell nudged hers toward him and wasnt the least bit surprised when he took a forkful id always thought new england yankees were a taciturn breed you know ayah nope maybe we like to talk in my family ripley can be shortwinded but then she isnt overly fond of people as a species this is the best meal ive had since sunday dinner at my grans that is the ultimate compliment wed finish it off exactly right if we were to take a walk on the beach she couldnt chink of a reason to say no maybe she didnt want to the light was fading going deep at the edges a needlethin and needlebright swath of light swept over the horizon and a blush of pink gleamed in the west the tide had gone out leaving a wide avenue of dark damp sand that was cool underfoot the surf teased it foaming out in ribbons while narrowbodied birds with legs like stilts pecked for their supper others strolled the beach almost all couples now nell noted handinhand or arminarm as a precaution shed tucked her own hands in her pockets after shed pried off her shoes and rolled up her jeans here and there were stockpiles of driftwood that would be bonfires when full dark fell she wondered what it would be like to sit by the flames with a group of friends to laugh and talk of nothing important havent seen you go in yet in the water zack explained she didnt own a bathing suit but saw no reason to say so ive waded in a couple of times dont swim of course i can swim lets go he scooped her up so fast her heart stuck between her chest and her throat she could barely manage to breathe much less scream before full panic had a chance to bloom she was in the water zack was laughing spinning her away from an oncoming wave to take the brunt of it himself she was sliding rolling fighting to gain her feet when he simply nipped her at the waist and righted her cant live on three sisters without being baptized tossing his wet hair back he pulled her farther out its freezing balmy he corrected your bloods just thin yet here comes a goodsize one youd better hold on to me i dont want to whatever she did or didnt want the sea had its own ideas the wave hit knocked her off her feet and had her legs tangling with his you idiot but she was laughing as she surfaced when the air hit her skin she quickly dunked neckdeep again the sheriffs supposed to have more sense than to jump in the ocean fully dressed idve stripped down but we havent known each other long enough he rolled over on his back floating lazily the first stars are coming out theres nothing like it nothing in the world like it come on the sea rocked her made her feel weightless as she watched the color of the sky change as the tone deepened bit by bit stars winked to life youre right theres nothing like it but its still freezing you just need a winter on the island to thicken your blood up he took her hand a quiet connection as they drifted an armspan apart ive never spent more than three months at a time offisland and that was for college had three years of that and couldnt take it anymore i knew what i wanted anyway and thats what ive got the rhythm of the waves the sweep of the sky the quiet flow of his voice coming out of the dark its a kind of magic isnt it she sighed as the cool moist breeze whispered over her face to know what you want to just know and to get it magic doesnt hurt work helps so does patience and all kinds of things i know what i want now and im getting it thats magic to me the islands never been short on that commodity comes from being founded by witches i suppose surprise tinged her voice do you believe in that sort of thing why wouldnt i things are whether people believe in them or not there were lights in the sky last night that werent stars a person could look the other way but theyd still have been there he planted his feet again lifting her until she stood facing him with the water fuming at waist level night had drifted in and the lights of the stars sprinkled over the surface of the water you can turn away from something like this he skimmed her wet hair away from her face left his hands resting there but its still going to be there she pressed a hand against his shoulder as his mouth lowered to hers she meant to turn away told herself to turn away to where everything was safe and ordered and simple but the spark hed spoken of snapped inside her warm and bright she curled her fingers into his wet shirt and let herself feel alive cold where the air whisked over her skin hot in the belly where desire began to build testing herself she leaned into him parted her lips under his he took his time as much for himself as for her sampling savoring she tasted of the sea smelled of it for a moment in the stardrenched surf he let himself drown he eased back let his hands run over her shoulders down her arms before he linked his fingers with hers not so complicated he kissed her again lightly though the lightness cost him ill walk you home chapter eight contents prev next mia can i talk to you with ten minutes until opening nell hurried down from the café lulu was already ringing up mail orders and shot her a typically suspicious look while mia continued to put the finishing touches on a new display of course whats on your mind well i the store was small enough and empty enough that lulu would hear every word i thought we could go up to your office for a minute heres fine dont let lulus sour face put you off mia built a small tower out of new summer releases shes worried youre going to ask me for a loan and naturally im such a soft touch along with my soft head ill let you rob me blind so ill die penniless and alone in some filthy gutter isnt that right lu lulu merely sniffed and jabbed keys on the cash register oh no its not about money id never ask for after youve been so damn it nell fisted her hands in her hair tugged until the pain stiffened her spine deliberately now she turned to face lulu i understand youre protective of mia and you have no reason to trust me i came out of nowhere with nothing and havent been here a month but im not a thief and im not a user ive carried my weight here and im going to keep carrying it and if mia asked me to try serving sandwiches while standing on one foot and singing yankee doodle dandy id give it my best shot because i came out of nowhere with nothing and she gave me a chance lulu sniffed again wouldnt mind seeing that myself likely bring in fresh trade too never said you didnt carry your weight she added but that doesnt mean i wont keep a watch on you fine with me i understand all this sentimental bonding mia dabbed at her lashes its ruining my mascara she stepped back from her display nodded in approval now what do you need to talk to me about nell mrs macey is having an anniversary party next month shed like to have a fancy catered affair yes i know mia turned to straighten stock on the shelves shell drive you a bit crazy with changes and suggestions and questions but you can handle it i didnt agree to we just discussed it yesterday i didnt realize youd heard she asked already i wanted to talk to you first its a small island word gets around you dont need to talk to me about an outside catering job nell she made a mental note to order more ritual candies thered been a run on them during the solstice and they were running unacceptably low on passion and on prosperity which just showed she supposed where many peoples priorities lay your free time is your time she added i just wanted to tell you that if i did the job for her it wouldnt interfere with my work here i should hope not particularly since im giving you a raise she glanced at her watch time to open lu youre giving me a raise youve earned it i hired you at a probationary salary youre officially off probation she unlocked the door walked over to turn on the music system how was your dinner with zack the other night mia asked with amusement a small island as i said it was fine it was just a friendly dinner goodlooking boy lulu said quality too im not trying to lure him into temptation something wrong with you then lulu tipped down her silver frames and peered over them it was a look she was particularly proud of if i were a few years younger id be setting out lures got a great pair of hands on him bet he knows how to use them no doubt mia said mildly but youre embarrassing our nell now where was i gladyss anniversary check raise check dinner with zack check she paused tapped a fingertip against her lips ah yes nell i wanted to ask do you have a religious or political objection to cosmetics or jewelry she could find nothing more constructive to do than huff out her breath no thats a relief here she took off the silver dangles on her ears handed them to nell wear these if anyone asks where you got them they come from all that glitters two doors down we like to promote other merchants ill want them back at the end of your shift tomorrow you might try a little blush maybe some lipstick eyeliner i dont have any im sorry mia held up a hand laid the other on her heart and staggered to the counter for support i feel a little faint did you say you dont own any lipstick the corner of nells mouth turned up and brought out a hint of dimples im afraid not lulu we have to help this woman its our duty emergency supplies hurry lips quivering with what might have been a smile lulu hauled a large cosmetic bag out from under the counter shes got good skin a blank canvas lu a blank canvas come with me she ordered nell the café the regulars will be coming in any second im fast and im good lets move she grabbed nells hand hauled her upstairs and into the rest room ten minutes later nell was serving her first customers and wearing silver earrings peachtoned lipstick and expertly smudged slate eyeliner there was something she decided very comforting about feeling female again she took the catering job and crossed her fingers when zack asked if shed like to go for an evening sail she said yes and felt powerful when a customer asked if she could bake a cake in the shape of a ballerina for a birthday party she said absolutely and spent her fee on a pair of earrings as word spread she found herself agreeing to provide picnicstyle food for a party of twenty for july fourth and ten box lunches for a private day sailor at her kitchen table nell spread out notes files menus somehow she was becoming her own cottage industry which she thought looking around seemed perfectly apt she glanced up at the brisk knock on the door and happily welcomed ripley in got a minute sure sit down do you want anything im fine ripley sat then picked up diego when he sniffed at her shoes meal planning ive got to organize these catering jobs if i had a computer well eventually id sell my soul for a professional blender and both feet for a commercialgrade food processor but for now we make do why dont you use the computer at the bookstore mias already doing enough whatever listen ive got this date for the fourth a date with potential she added casual because zack and i are more or less on duty right through the night fireworks and beer sometimes make people a little too festive for their own good i cant wait to see the fireworks everyone says theyre spectacular yeah we do a hell of a job on them the thing is this guy hes a security consultant on the mainland hes been hitting on me and i decided to let him land one ripley thats so romantic i can barely catch my breath hes really built too ripley continued as she scratched diegos ears so the afterfireworks fireworks potential is fairly high if you get me ive been in a downswing sexwise anyway we talked about having this night picnic deal and somehow i got stuck with doing the food since i think id like to jump this guys bones i dont want to poison him first a romantic picnic for two nell made notes vegetarian or carnivore carnivore not too fancy okay ripley plucked a grape from the bowl of fruit on the table popped it in her mouth i dont want him more interested in the food than me check pickup or delivery this is so cool cheerful she popped another grape i can pick it up can we keep it under fifty under fifty tell him to pick up a nice crisp white wine now if you had a picnic hamper weve got one somewhere perfect bring that by and well pack it up youll be set foodwise the bonejumping portion of the evening is up to you i can handle that you know if you want i can ask around see if anybodys got a secondhand computer they want to sell that would be great im glad you came by she rose got out two glasses i was afraid you were annoyed with me no not with you that particular subject annoys me its a bunch of bullshit just like she scowled through the screened door well speak of the devil i try not to why borrow trouble mia sailed in laid a note on the counter phone message for you nell gladys and her newest party brainstorm im sorry you dont have time to run over here this way ill speak to her again and i promise ill see about getting a phone dont worry about it i wanted a walk or id have left it for tomorrow and ill have a glass of that lemonade she needs a computer ripley said flatly she wont use the one at the store because she doesnt want to hassle you ripley mia im perfectly fine working this way she can certainly use the computer at the store when its free mia said to ripley and she doesnt need you running interference between her and me she wouldnt if you werent trying to push your psychic hooey on her psychic hooey sounds like the name of a secondrate rock band and has nothing to do with what i am but even thats better than blind stubborn denial knowledge is always better than ignorance you want ignorance ripley said getting to her feet stop stop it jittering inside nell put herself between them this is ridiculous do you two always go at each other this way yes mia picked up a glass sipped delicately we enjoy it dont we deputy id enjoy popping you one more but then id have to arrest myself try it mia angled her chin i promise not to press charges nobody hits anybody not in my house instantly contrite mia set down her glass rubbed a hand down nells arm it was rigid as steel im sorry little sister ripley and i irritate each other a longstanding habit but we shouldnt put you in the middle we shouldnt put her in the middle mia said to ripley it isnt fair something we agree on how about this if we run into each other here its a neutral zone you know like romulan space no warfare romulan neutral zone ive always admired your grip on popular culture agreed she even picked up the second glass passed it to ripley there you see nell youre a good influence on us already she handed the third glass to nell to positive influences ripley hesitated cleared her throat okay okay what the hell positive influences and standing in a loose circle they tapped glasses they rang like a bell one bright peal as a shower of light fountained up from that connection of secondhand kitchenware mia smiled slowly as nell let out a laughing gasp damn it ripley muttered and gulped down lemonade i hate that celebrants streamed to the island for the fourth red white and blue flags snapped from the rails of the ferries as they chugged to the mainland and back banners and bunting swagged the eaves of the storefronts on high street waving cheerfully as tourists and islanders alike jammed the streets and beaches for nell it was anything but a holiday but that didnt prevent her celebrational mood as she delivered orders she not only had a job she loved she had a business she could be proud of independence day she thought she was going to make it hers for the first time in nine months she began to plan for a future that included bank accounts mail delivery and personal possessions that couldnt be stuffed into a duffel or backpack at a moments notice a normal functioning life she thought as she paused by the display window of beach where the mannequin was wearing breezy summer slacks with bold blue and white stripes and a gauzy white top that scooped low at the breasts strappy white sandals as fun as they were impractical adorned its feet nell bit her lip her pay was burning a hole in the pocket of her ancient jeans that had always been her problem she reminded herself if she had ten dollars she could find a way to spend nine of it shed learned how to save and scrimp and resist how to make five dollars stretch like elastic but she hadnt had anything new anything pretty in so long and mia had been hinting not quite so gently of late that she should spruce up a bit on the job plus she had to make some sort of a showing of herself for the catering sideline if she was going to be a businesswoman she should dress the part on the island that meant casual still casual could mean attractive on the other hand it would be more practical more sensible to save the money and invest it in kitchen tools she needed a food processor more than she needed sandals are you going to listen to the good angel or the bad angel mia vaguely embarrassed at being caught daydreaming over a pair of shoes nell laughed you startled me great sandals on sale too they are mia tapped the glass just below the sale sign my favorite fourletter word i smell possibilities nell lets shop oh but i really shouldnt i dont need anything you really do need work mia tossed back her hair took nells elbow in a firm grip much like a mother with a stubborn child shopping for shoes has nothing to do with need and everything to do with lust do you know how many pair of shoes i own no neither do i she said as she strongarmed nell into the shop isnt that wonderful they have those slacks in a candycane pink theyd look fabulous on you size six yes but i really need to save for a good food processor despite herself she reached out to finger the material of the slacks that mia pulled off the rack theyre so soft try them with this a brief hunt turned up what mia considered the perfect top a clingy white halter dont forget to lose the bra youve got little feet six there too yes actually nell took a discreet peek at the price tags even with the sale it was more than shed spent on herself in months she was stuttering protests as mia shoved her behind a dressing room curtain trying doesnt mean buying she whispered to herself over and over as she stripped down to her practical cotton panties mia was right about the pink she thought as she slipped into the slacks the bright color was an instant mood lifter but the halter well that was another matter it felt decadent to wear something so closefitting without a bra and the back she turned to look over her shoulder there basically wasnt a back evan would never have allowed her to wear something so revealing and casually suggestive even as the thought popped into her mind nell cursed herself okay back up and erase she ordered herself how you doing in there fine mia its an adorable outfit but i dont think before she could finish mia whisked open the curtain and stood the sandals in one hand while she tapped her lip with the finger of her free hand perfect girlnextdoor sexy casual chic add the shoes i saw this little bag just the thing be right back it was like being marched through a campaign by a veteran general nell thought and she a mere foot soldier couldnt seem to do anything but follow orders twenty minutes later her habitual jeans tshirt and sneakers were tucked into a shopping bag what was left of her cash was stuffed into a palmsize purse that she wore crossbody and at the hip of her new slacks which flapped softly around her legs in the frisky breeze how do you feel guilty great unable to resist nell wiggled her toes in her new sandals thatll do now lets buy some earrings to go with it nell abandoned all resistance independence day she reminded herself she fell for the rose quartz drops the minute she saw them what is it about earrings that makes you feel so confident body adornments show that were aware of our bodies and expect others to be aware as well now lets take a walk on the beach and get some reaction nell fingered the pale pink stones swinging from her ears can i ask you a question go ahead ive been here a month now and in all that time i havent seen you with anyone a date i mean a male companion im not interested in anyone at the moment mia held the flat of her hand above her brow to skim the beach yes there was someone once but that was another phase of my life did you love him yes i did very much im sorry i shouldnt pry its no secret mia said lightly and the wounds long healed i like being on my own in control of my destiny and all the little daytoday decisions and choices coupling requires a certain amount of unselfishness im a selfish creature by nature thats not true generosity has levels mia began to walk lifting her face to the breeze and its not synonymous with altruism i do what suits me which stems from selfinterest i dont find that something to apologize for ive had personal acquaintance with the selfish you may do what suits you mia but youd never deliberately hurt anyone ive watched you with people they trust you because they know they can not causing harm is a responsibility that comes from what ive been given youre the same i dont see how that can be ive been powerless and because of it you have empathy for those in pain and those who despair nothing happens to us without purpose little sister what we do because of it what we do about it is the key to who and what we are nell looked out to sea to the boats gliding the jet skiers racing the swimmers gleefully riding the waves she could turn away she thought from what she was being told and what would be asked of her she could have a calm and normal life here or she could have more the night i stayed at your house the night of the solstice when i saw you on the cliffs i told myself i was dreaming mia didnt turn just continued to look calmly out over the ocean is that what you want to believe im not entirely sure i dreamed of this place even when i was a child i had dreams for a long time i ignored them or blocked them out when i saw the painting the cliffs the lighthouse your house i had to come here it was like finally being allowed to come home she looked back at mia i used to believe in fairy tales then i learned better the hard way and so mia thought had she no man had ever lifted his hand to her but there were other ways to bruise and scar life isnt a fairy tale and the gift carries a price a shudder raced up nells spine easier she thought to turn away safer to run away a boat out to sea let off a sky rocket the gleeful shriek of sound ended on a burst of light that showered little specks of gold as it shattered a delighted roar went up from the beach she heard a child call out in wonder you said you would teach me mia let out a breath she hadnt been aware she was holding so much rested on this and so i will they turned together to watch the next rocket soar are you going to stay to watch the fireworks nell asked her no i can see them from my cliffs and its less frantic besides i hate being a fifth wheel fifth wheel ladies zack strolled up it was one of the rare times he had his badge pinned to his shirt im going to have to ask you to move along two beautiful women standing on the beach creates a safety hazard isnt he cute mia reached up to cup his face and give him a noisy kiss when i was in third grade i planned to marry him and live in a sand castle you mightve clued me in on it you were sweet on hester burmingham no i just had lustful feelings for her shiny red schwinn the christmas i turned twelve i got one of my own from santa and hester ceased to exist in my little world men are bastards maybe but ive still got the bike and hesters got twin girls and a minivan happy ending all around hester still checks out your butt when youre walking away mia told him delighted when his mouth dropped open and on that note i take my leave enjoy the fireworks that woman always manages to get the last word zack muttered by the time a man untangles his tongue shes gone and speaking of getting a mans tongue tangled you look great thanks she held her arms out to the side i splurged in all the right places let me cart that for you he slipped the shopping bag out of her hand i need to take it home and see to some things i can walk in that direction for a bit i was hoping to see you around today i heard youve been busy delivering potato salad all over the island i mustve made twenty gallons of it and enough fried chicken to deplete the poultry population for the next three months dont suppose youve got any left her dimples winked i might its been hard to find time to eat traffic control beach patrol i had to sit on a couple of kids who thought itd be fun to toss firecrackers in trash cans and watch them blow up ive confiscated enough firecrackers roman candles and bottle rockets to start my own insurrection and all that on two hot dogs that doesnt seem fair no it doesnt i spotted a couple of your box lunches looked to me like there was apple pie in there you have good vision i could probably hunt up a few drumsticks scrape together a pint of potato salad i might even be able to manage a slab of apple pie and donate it to a hardworking public servant might even be tax deductible ive got to supervise the fireworks display he stopped at the end of the street we usually get it started right around nine he set her shopping bag down to run his hands up her bare arms things start thinning out around ninethirty ninefortyfive i lost the toss with ripley so ive got to take the last patrol cruise around the island to make sure nobodys set their house on fire maybe youd like to take a drive i might his fingers danced up and down her back do me a favor put your hands on my shoulders id like you to have a grip on me when i kiss you this time zack she took two careful breaths id like you to have a grip on me this time too he wrapped his arms around her she circled his neck for a moment they stood lips a breath apart while her system shivered with anticipation mouths brushed retreated brushed again it was she who moaned she who crushed her lips to his on a hot spurt of hunger she hadnt let herself want even when hed stirred those dormant needs to life shed been careful not to want until now she wanted the strength of him the press of that hard male body she wanted the ripe flavor of him and the heat the silky dance of tongues the teasing nip of teeth the edgy thrill of feeling a heart pound against her own she let out a little gasp of pleasure when he changed the angle of the kiss and dived in again she set off aches in him that throbbed like pulse beats quiet sounds of need hummed in her throat and burned in his blood her skin was like hot satin and the feel of it under his hands sent erotic images through his brain desires demands that belonged to the dark dimly he heard another rocket burst and the shouts of approval from the beach behind them he could have her inside her cottage in two minutes naked and under him in three nell breathless churning toward desperate he broke the kiss and she smiled at him her eyes were dark filled with trust and pleasure nell he said again and lowered his forehead to hers there were times when you took he knew and times when you waited ive got to make my rounds all right he picked up her bag handed it to her youll come back yes ill come back she was floating on air as she spun around and headed for her cottage chapter nine contents prev next power mia told nell carries with it responsibility a respect for tradition it must be tempered with compassion hopefully intelligence and an understanding of human flaws it is never to be used carelessly though there is room for humor above all it must never be used to harm how did you know you were how did you know what you were a witch mia sat back on her heels she was weeding her garden she was wearing a shapeless dress of grass green with deep pockets in the skirt thin floral gardening gloves and a widebrimmed straw hat at the moment she couldnt have looked less like the witch she professed to be you can say the word its not illegal were not the pointedhatwearing broomstickriding cacklers that much of fiction drew us to be were people housewives plumbers businesswomen how we live is a personal choice covens another personal choice ive never been much of a joiner myself and most who form groups or study the craft are just looking for a pastime or an answer theres nothing wrong with that calling yourself a witch and holding rituals is one thing being one is another how do you know the difference how do i answer you nell she leaned forward again neatly snipping off deadheads theres something inside you burning a song in your head a whisper in your ear you know these things as well as i do you just didnt recognize them the deadhead went along with her weeds into a basket when you peel an apple havent you ever thought if you could finish it without breaking the chain youd have a wish granted or gather good luck snapped a wishbone crossed your fingers little charms mia said sitting back again old traditions it cant be as simple as that as simple as a wish as complex as love as dangerous potentially as a lightning bolt power is risk its also joy she picked up one of the deadheads cupped it gently in her hands opening them again she offered nell a sunny yellow blossom delighted fascinated nell twirled it in her fingers if you can do this why do you let any of them die theres a cycle a natural order its to be respected change is necessary she rose picked up her basket of weeds and dead flowers and carried it to a composter without it thered be no progress no rebirth no anticipation one flower blooms off to make room for another a lot of the craft is philosophy would you like to try something more practical me yes a simple spell a stir of the air i think considering besides its a warm day and a breeze would be welcome you want me to nell made a circling motion with her finger stir the air its a matter of technique you need to focus feel the air moving over your face your body see it in your mind rippling turning you can hear it the music of it mia no put doubts aside and think of those possibilities focus its a simple goal its all around you you only have to stir it take it in your hands she said lifting her own and say the words air is breath and breath is air stir it round from here to there spin a breeze and spin it lightly as you will nell so mote it be say the words one times three mesmerized nell repeated them felt the faintest flutter across her cheek said them again and saw mias hair lift on the third count mias voice joined hers the wind spun around them a private carousel of air cool and fragrant with a happy little hum the same hum sounded inside her as nell turned circling round and round her short cap of hair dancing it feels wonderful you did it i gave it the last nudge mia laughed as her dress billowed out but you got it started very well done for your first time now quiet it again use your mind visualize it going still thats it good you picture things well ive always liked to draw moments in my head nell said breathless now you know images that appeal or that i want to remember its sort of like that wow im dizzy she sat straight down on the ground i felt a tingling inside not unpleasant almost like you do when youre thinking really thinking about sex magic is sexy mia dropped down beside her especially when you hold the power have you been doing a lot of thinking about sex i didnt give it a thought for eight months steadier now nell shook back her hair i wasnt sure id ever want to be with a man again since the fourth ive been doing a lot of thinking about sex the kind of thinking that makes you very itchy well ive been there why dont you do something about it scratch the itch i thought id assumed that after the fireworks last week zack and i would end up in bed but after we drove around and he finished his patrol he took me home kissed me good night at the door the kind of kiss that lifts the top of your head off and spins it around then he went home i dont suppose it occurred to you to drag him inside toss him on the floor and rip his clothes off the idea made nell chuckle i cant do things like that a minute ago you didnt think you could conjure a breeze either you have the power little sister zachariah todd is the kind of man whos willing to put that power in your hands to give you the choice of time and place if there was a man like that i was attracted to and who was attracted to me id do something about that power she felt the tingle again the stir inside her this time i wouldnt know how to begin visualize little sister mia said wickedly visualize zack couldnt think of a better way to spend a sunday morning than skinnydipping with the girl he loved the water was cool the sun warm and the inlet private enough to allow for such activities they discussed taking a sail later and the adoration in her beautiful brown eyes told him shed follow him anywhere he stroked her sent her into a wiggle of delight before they swam companionably through the crisp and quiet water when a man had a female so uncomplicatedly devoted zack figured he had it all then she gave a yip of excitement splashed a stream of water in his face and headed to shore zack watched his boon companion desert him for the woman standing on the rough bank lucy bounded onto the bank and straight into nell knocking her back two full steps and drenching her with seawater and doggie kisses zack listened to nells laughter watched her scrub her hands enthusiastically over lucys wet fur maybe a man who had a pretty dog didnt have quite everything he decided hey hows it going its going good shoulders she thought the man had amazing shoulders hows the water close to perfect come on in see for yourself thanks but i dont have a suit with me me either he flashed a grin which is why i didnt follow lucys example oh her gaze shot down then immediately back up to hover six inches over his head well ha visualize mia had told her but this didnt seem quite the appropriate time i promise not to look youre already wet all the same i think ill stay out here lucy dived back in retrieved a mangled rubber ball after scrabbling back to shore again she deposited it neatly at nells feet wants to play zack told her and so did he obliging nell picked up the ball and tossed it before it hit the surface lucy was leaping in pursuit pretty good arm weve got a softball game coming up in a couple of weeks if youre interested he drifted closer to the bank as he spoke nell scooped up the ball lucy retrieved heaved it again maybe i was thinking about trying out another recipe is that so the caterings turning into an actual enterprise if i want to expand on it i need to be able to offer a variety of dishes im a strong believer in capitalism so anything i can do to help she looked down he had such a nice face she thought she would just concentrate on that and wouldnt think about the rest of him right now i appreciate that sheriff ive been playing it by ear so far but i think its time to put together an actual list with pricing and services if i do all that formalize it i have to apply for a business license that wouldnt be a problem she assured herself she was clear its going to keep you busy i like being busy theres nothing worse than not being able to do anything with your time or your interests she shook her head and dont i sound dull and boring no but she had sounded grim how do you feel about recreation i approve of recreation her eyebrows lifted as he hooked a hand lightly around her ankle and just what is that i call it the long arm of the law youre too nice to pull me in after ive come over here to offer to feed you no im not he gave her foot a playful little tug but im willing to give you a chance to strip first thats considerate of you my mother raised me right come on in and play nell he glanced back at lucy who was busy paddling around with the ball in her mouth weve got a chaperone why not she thought she wanted to be with him even more she wanted to be the kind of woman who could be with him a woman confident and open enough to do something fun and foolish like tossing off her clothes and diving in the grin she sent him was quick and careless as she toed off her shoes he treaded water i changed my mind im going to watch he warned her id tell you i wouldnt peek but id be lying do you lie not if i can help it his gaze lowered as she gripped the hem of her tshirt so im not going to tell you ill keep my hands off you once you get in here i want you wet and naked nell i just plain want you if i wanted you to keep your hands off me i wouldnt be here she took a deep breath started to peel off her shirt sheriff todd sheriff todd there is no god zack grumbled as the lovely glimpse of creamy flesh vanished under nells hastily tuggeddown shirt out here he called is that you ricky to nell he said itll only take me two three minutes to drown him just stand by yes sir sheriff a towheaded boy of about ten scrambled across the rocky slope his freckled face pink with excitement he gave nell a hasty nod maam sheriff my mom said i was to come right over and tell you the tenants in the abbott rental are having a big fight theres screaming and crashing and cursing and everything is that dale abbotts or busters place busters sheriff the one right across from ours mom says it sounds like the man in theres beating the woman something fierce im on my way go on back go straight home and in the house yes sir nell stayed where she was she saw a blur of tanned muscled body as zack levered himself out of the water sorry nell no you need to go you need to help her it felt as though there were a thin glaze over her brain as she watched him hitch on jeans hurry ill be back as soon as i can he left her there hated leaving her there with her hands gripping each other tightly and bolted up the steps to get a shirt he was at the abbott rental in under four minutes a handful of people edged the street while the sounds of shouting and breaking glasses poured out of the house a man zack didnt recognize jogged up to him as he approached the deck stairs youre the sheriff im bob delano renting the place next door i tried seeing what i could do but the doorsre locked i thought about breaking one in but they said you were on the way ill take care of it mr delano maybe you could keep those people back sure ive seen that guy sheriff big sonofabitch you want to watch yourself i appreciate it get on back now zack pounded a fist on the door though hed have preferred to have ripley with him he hadnt risked waiting for her to answer his beeper call this is sheriff todd i want you to open the door and open it now something shattered inside and a woman began to wail if this door isnt open in five seconds im kicking it in the man came to the door delano was right he was one big sonofabitch sixfour maybe and a good two seventyfive he looked hungover and mad as piss what the hell do you want i want you to step back sir and keep your hands where i can see them you got no right coming in here im renting this place paid in full your rental agreement doesnt give you leave to destroy property now back up youre not coming in here without a warrant bet zack said softly his hand shot out lightningquick gripped the mans wrist and twisted now you want to take a swing at me he continued in the same mild tone well add resisting arrest and assaulting an officer to the mix more paperwork but i get paid for it by the time my lawyers done im going to own this fucking island youre welcome to call him from down at the station house zack cuffed him and looked around with relief as he heard ripley pounding up the stairs sorry i was all the way over on broken shell whats this domestic dispute and then some this is my deputy zack informed his prisoner take my word she can clean your clock put him in the back of the cruiser ripley get his particulars read him his rights whats your name sir fuck you okay mr fuck you youre under arrest for she glanced back at zack who was already moving through the broken glass and crockery to the woman sitting on the floor holding her face in her hands and sobbing destruction of private property disturbing the peace assault you got that now unless you want me to kick your ass in front of all these nice people well just walk to the cruiser and take a little drive you have the right to remain silent she continued giving him a helpful shove to get him going maam she was late thirties zack estimated probably pretty when her lip wasnt split and her brown eyes werent blackened i need you to come with me ill take you to a doctor i dont need a doctor she curled into herself zack noted shallow cuts on her arms gifts from flying glass whats going to happen to joe well talk about that can you tell me your name diane diane mccoy let me help you up ms mccoy diane mccoy sat hunched in a chair with an ice bag held to her left eye she continued to refuse medical assistance after offering her a cup of coffee zack pulled his own chair from behind his desk hoping the move would put her more at ease ms mccoy i want to help you im okay well pay for the damages you just have the rental agency make up a list and well pay for it thats something well need to see to i want you to tell me what happened we just had a fight thats all people do you didnt need to lock joe up if theres a fine well pay it ms mccoy youre sitting there with your lip bleeding your eye black and cuts and bruises all over your arms your husband assaulted you it wasnt like that what was it like i asked for it even as ripley let out a vicious stream of air across the room zack leveled a warning glance you asked him to hit you ms mccoy to knock you down to bloody your lip i aggravated him hes under a lot of pressure the words tumbled out slurred a bit from her swollen lip this is supposed to be a vacation and i shouldntve nagged at him that way she must have sensed ripleys furious disapproval as she turned her head stared defiantly joe works hard fifty weeks a year the least i can do is leave him alone on his vacation it seems to me ripley countered the least he could do is keep from punching you in the face on your vacation ripley get ms mccoy a glass of water and shut up he didnt have to say the last with his mouth when his expression said it so clearly what started the trouble ms mccoy i guess i got up on the wrong side of the bed joe was up late drinking a mans entitled to sit in front of the tv with a few beers on his vacation he left the place a mess beer cans spilled chips all over the rug it irritated me and i started on him the minute he was awake if id shut up when he told me to none of this wouldve happened and not shutting up when you were told gave him the right to use his fists on you ms mccoy she powered up what happens between a husband and wife is nobodys business but theirs we shouldnt have broken things and well pay for them ill clean the place up myself ms mccoy they have counseling programs back in newark zack began and shelters for women who need them i can make some calls get you some information her eyes might have been swollen but they could still flash fury i dont need any information you cant keep joe locked up if i dont press charges and i wont youre wrong there i can keep him locked up for disturbing the peace and the property owners can press charges youll just make it worse tears began to fall she took the paper cup ripley offered her and gulped at the water dont you see youll just make it worse hes a good man joes a good man hes just got a short fuse is all i said wed pay ill write you a check we dont want any trouble im the one who made him mad i threw things at him too youre going to have to lock me up along with him whats the point what was the point zack thought later he hadnt been able to reach her and he wasnt egotistical enough to think he was the first to try he couldnt help when help was rejected the mccoys were caught in a cycle that was bound to end badly and all he could do was remove the cycle from his island it took half the day to straighten out the mess a check for two thousand satisfied the rental company a cleaning crew was already in place by the time the mccoys had packed up zack waited saying nothing as joe mccoy loaded suitcases and coolers into the back of a latemodel grand cherokee the couple got in from opposite sides diane wore big sunglasses to hide the damage they both ignored zack as he got into the cruiser and followed them to the ferry he stayed there watching until the jeep and the people inside it were no more than a dot on their way to the mainland he hadnt expected that nell would have waited for him and decided it was just as well he was too depressed and far too angry to talk to her instead he sat in the kitchen with lucy nursed a beer he was considering indulging in a second when ripley came in i dont get it i just dont get women like that the guys got a hundred fifty pounds on her but its her fault he bashed her face and she believed it she got out a beer for herself jerking the bottle at him as she twisted off the cap maybe she needs to oh like hell zack like hell still simmering she dropped into the chair across from him shes healthy shes got a brain what does she gain hooking herself to a guy who uses her for a punching bag when the mood strikes him if shed pressed charges we couldve held him long enough for her to pack her bags and get gone we shouldve held him anyway she wouldnt have left it wouldnt have made one damn bit of difference okay youre right i know it it just burns me thats all she sipped her beer watching him youre thinking about nell you figure it was like that for her i dont know what it was like for her she doesnt talk about it have you asked if she wanted to tell me she would well dont snap my head off ripley propped her feet on the chair beside her im asking you because i know you big brother if youve got a thing for her and the thing turns into a big thing youre never going to be square with it unless you have the story without the story you cant help and when you cant help it drives you nuts youre brooding right now because you couldnt help to your satisfaction a woman youd never seen before and wont see again its that good samaritan gene of yours isnt there someone else on the island you can go annoy no because i love you best now instead of having another beer why dont you take luce and go for a sail still plenty of daylight yet and itll clear your head and improve your disposition youre just no fun to be around when youre broody maybe i will good go odds of a second crisis in one day are slim to none but ill take a cruise around just in case okay he got up and after a moments hesitation leaned down and kissed the top of her head i love you best too dont i know it she waited until he got to the door you know zack whatever nells story is theres one key difference between her and diane mccoy nell got gone chapter ten contents prev next on monday the incident at the abbott rental was the talk of the village everyone had had time to form an opinion particularly those who hadnt witnessed the event buster said theyd busted up every blessed knickknack in the place ill have some of that lobster salad nell honey dorcas burmingham said then went straight back to gossiping with her companion she and biddy devlin mias third cousin once removed and the proprietor of surfside treasures had a standing lunch date at the café every monday at twelvethirty i heard sheriff todd had to forcibly remove the man from the premises biddy expounded at gunpoint oh biddy no such thing i talked to gladys macey who had it straight from anne potter who sent for the sheriff in the first place that zack had his gun holstered right along can i have an iced mocha with that salad nell domestic disputes are one of the most dangerous calls for a policeman biddy informed her i read that somewhere my that soup smells divine nell i dont believe ive ever had gazpacho before but im going to have to try a cup and one of your brownies ill bring your lunch out to you nell offered if youd like to get a table oh thats all right well wait for it dorcas waved the offer away youve got enough to do anyway i heard that even though that brute bloodied that poor womans lip and blackened her eye she stuck by him wouldnt press charges its a crying shame is what it is odds are her father beat on her mother so she grew up seeing such things and thinking thats just what happens its a cycle thats what the statistics say abuse spawns abuse ill wager you if that woman had grown up in a loving home she wouldnt be living with a man who treated her that way ladies thatll be thirteen eightyfive nells head throbbed like a bad tooth and her nerve endings stretched thin as hair strands while the two women went through their weekly routine of whose turn it was to pay it was always playful and usually it amused nell but now she wanted them gone she wanted to hear no more about diane mccoy what did they know about it she thought bitterly these two comfortable women with their comfortable lives what did they know about fear and helplessness it wasnt always a cycle she wanted to scream it it wasnt always a pattern shed had a loving home with parents whod been devoted to each other and to her there had been arguments irritation annoyances while voices may have been raised fists never had she had never been struck in her life before evan remington she wasnt a goddamn statistic by the time the women headed off to a table thin sharpedged bands of steel had locked themselves around nells temples she turned blindly to the next customer and found ripley studying her you look a little shaky nell just a headache what can i get you today why dont you get yourself an aspirin ill wait no its fine the fruitandcabbage salads good its a scandinavian recipe ive had positive feedback on it okay im game ill take an iced tea with it those two she added nodding toward biddy and dorcas they chatter like a couple of parrots itd give anybody a headache i guess everybodys been yakking about the trouble yesterday well she wanted a dark room an hours quiet big news zack did everything he could to help that woman she didnt want to be helped not everyone does not everyone knows what to do with an offer of help or who they can trust to give it zack can be trusted ripley laid her money on the counter maybe he plays it low key thats his way but when push comes to shove he stands up you ought to do something for that headache nell she added and took her lunch to a table she didnt have time to do more about it than swallow a couple of aspirin peg was late rushing in full of apologies and with a sparkle in her eye that told nell a man had been responsible for her tardiness as nell had an appointment with gladys macey to please god finalize the menu for the anniversary party she had to rush home gather her notes and files the headache had escalated to nightmare territory by the time she knocked on gladyss door nell ive told you you dont have to knock you just call out and walk in gladys said and pulled her inside im just so excited about this i watched this program on the home and garden channel just the other day got me all sorts of ideas to talk over with you i think we ought to string those little white lights through my trees and put those luminaries with little hearts on the bags along the walk and the patio what do you think mrs macey i think you should have whatever you want im really just the caterer now honey i think of you as my party coordinator lets sit down in the living room the room was spotlessly clean as if dust was a sin against nature every stick of furniture matched with the pattern in the sofa picked up in the valance of the window treatments and the narrow border of wallpaper that ran just under the ceiling there were two identical lamps two identical chairs two identical end tables the rug matched the curtains the curtains matched the throw pillows all the wood was honey maple including the cabinet of the bigscreen tv which was currently running a hollywood gossip program ive got a weakness for that kind of show all those famous people i love seeing what clothes theyre wearing you just sit down gladys ordered make yourself comfortable im going to get us a nice cold coke then well roll up our sleeves and dive right in as she had the first time shed toured gladyss house for preparty plans nell found herself bemused every room was tidy as a church pew and as rigidly organized as a furniture showroom floor magazines were fanned precisely on the coffee table and offset by an arrangement of silk flowers in the exact tones of mauve and blues as the upholstery the fact that the house managed to be friendly said more to nells mind about the occupants than the decor nell sat opened her files she knew gladys would bring the tea in pale green glasses that matched her everyday dishes and would set them on blue coasters there was she thought a comfort in knowing that she began to read over her notes then felt her stomach hitch at the chirpy voice of the program host last nights gala brought out the glitter and the glamour evan remington power broker extraordinaire and attorney to the stars looked as sensational as one of his own clients in hugo boss though remington denies rumors of a romance between him and his companion for the evening the delectable natalie winston who simmered in a beaded sheath by valentino sources in the know say differently remington was widowed only last september when his wife helen apparently lost control of her car while driving back to their home in monterey her mercedes sedan crashed over the cliffs on highway her body sadly was never recovered hollywood beat is happy to see evan remington back in stride after this tragic event nell was on her feet her breath short and shallow evans face seemed to fill the wide screen every handsome line every strand of golden hair she could hear his voice clear and terrifyingly calm do you think i cant see you helen do you think ill let you go i didnt mean to take so long but i thought you might appreciate someone elses baking for a change i just made this pound cake yesterday carl packed away nearly half of it i cant think where that man puts it why if i ate a fraction of what he tray in hand gladys stopped her happy chatter shifting instantly to surprised concern when she saw nells face honey youre so pale whats wrong im sorry im sorry im not feeling well panic was an icy poker jabbing through her belly headache i dont think i can do this now of course not poor thing dont you worry im going to drive you home and tuck you right into bed no no id rather walk fresh air im so sorry mrs macey nell fumbled with her files almost sobbing when they slipped through her trembling fingers ill call you reschedule i dont want you to think a thing of it nell sweetheart youre shaking i just need to go home with a last terrified glance at the television screen she bolted for the door she forced herself not to run when you ran people noticed you and they wondered they asked questions fitting in that was essential blending doing nothing to draw attention but even as she ordered herself to breathe slow and steady the air wheezed in her lungs clogged there until she was gulping for it do you think ill let you go sweat ran cold and clammy on her skin and she smelled her own fear the edges of her vision blurred as she shot a single wild look over her shoulder the minute she was through the door of her cottage the nausea hit a bright bite of pain she stumbled to the bathroom was hideously ill when she was empty she lay on the narrow floor and waited for the shaking to pass when she could stand again she peeled off her clothes leaving them in a heap as she stepped into the shower she ran the hot water as hot as she could bear imagining the spray penetrating her skin until it warmed her icy bones wrapped in a towel she crawled into bed pulled the covers over her head and let herself slide into oblivion diego climbed agilely up the bedskirt stretched out alongside her and lay still and silent as a sentry she wasnt sure how long she slept but she woke as if from a long illness that had left her body heavy and tender and her stomach raw she was tempted simply to roll back into sleep and stay there but that would solve nothing it was doing that got her through and always had she sat on the edge of the bed like an old woman testing bone and balance the image of evans face could float back into her mind if she let it so she closed her eyes let it form that too was a kind of test she could look at him would look at him remember what had been and what had changed to deal she reminded herself with what had happened for comfort she gathered the kitten into her lap and rocked she had run again after almost a year the sight of him on a television screen had terrorized her to the point of blind flight had made her ill and stripped away every bit of the hardwon armor shed built until shed been a quivering quaking mass of panic because she had allowed it she let him have that hold on her no one could change that but herself shed found the courage to run nell told herself now she had to find the courage to stand until she could think of him until she could say his name without fear she wasnt free she held the picture of him in her mind imagined it breaking apart her will a hammer against glass evan remington she whispered you cant touch me now you cant hurt me youre over and im just beginning the effort exhausted her but she set diego on the floor then pushed herself to her feet dragged on a sweatshirt and shorts she would go back to work design and evaluate her menu it was time to figure out how to set up an office of sorts in the little bedroom if gladys macey wanted a party coordinator thats just what she was going to get she had dropped the file when she bolted into the cottage and now she gathered up all the scattered notes magazine clippings and carefully written menu selections and carried them into the kitchen she was mildly surprised to see that the sun still shone it felt as if shed slept for hours the clock on the stove told her it was barely six time enough to reevaluate the macey job proposal to create a comprehensive list of menu and service selections for what she was going to call sisters catering she would take mia up on the offer of the store computer and design a look for her handouts her business cards she had to calculate a budget set up books no one was going to take her seriously unless she took herself seriously first but when she put her files down and looked around she wondered why the prospect of putting on water for coffee seemed so far out of her scope the knock on the front door had her spinning around her first thought when she saw zack through the screen was not now not yet she hadnt had time to gather herself back to what she needed to be but he was already opening the door already studying her across the short distance from the front of the cottage to the back are you all right nell yes you dont look all right she could imagine how she looked i wasnt feeling well earlier selfconscious she scooped a hand through her hair i had a headache and so i took a nap im fine now holloweyed and pale and far from fine was zacks judgment he couldnt back off and leave her alone any more than he could have left a stray pup on the side of the road diego gave him an opening pouncing out of a corner to attack his shoes zack picked up the kitten ruffling his fur as he walked to nell you take anything yes eat anything no i dont need a nurse zack it was just a headache just a headache didnt send a woman bolting out of someones house as if the devil were on her heels which was exactly how gladys had described it you look pretty rough honey so im going to fix you the traditional todd family restorer i appreciate it but i was going to work for a while go ahead he handed her the kitten moved past her to the refrigerator im not much in the kitchen but i can manage this just like my mother did when one of us wasnt feeling right got any jelly it was right in front of his face she thought crossly what was it about men that struck them blind the minute they opened a refrigerator door second shelf i dont oh yeah we always used grape but strawberry should work go ahead and work dont mind me nell set diego by his dish of food what are you fixing scrambled eggs and rolledover jelly sandwiches rolledover jelly sandwiches too tired to argue she sat sounds perfect mrs macey called you didnt she no i did run into her though she mentioned you were upset about something i wasnt upset i had a headache the skillets in the bottom cabinet left ill find what i need place isnt big enough to hide much do you make scrambled eggs and rolledover jelly sandwiches for everyone on the island when they have a headache that would depend im making it for you because you tug at me nell have since i first met you and when i walk in here and see you looking like something thats been flattened by a passing steamroller it troubles me she said nothing when he cracked eggs dumped in milk and too much salt he was a good man she believed a kind and decent one and she had no right tugging at him zack im not going to be able to give you what you want what youre looking for i know yesterday i indicated i could that i would i shouldnt have how do you know what im looking for what i want he stirred the eggs in the bowl and whatever it is its my problem isnt it it isnt fair for me to give you the impression there can be anything between us im a big boy he put enough butter in the skillet to make her wince i dont expect everything to be fair and the fact is theres already something between us you pretending otherwise doesnt change it he turned around as the butter melted the fact that we havent slept together doesnt change it either we would have yesterday if i hadnt gotten that call it wouldve been a mistake if life wasnt full of mistakes itd be a mighty tedious process if all i wanted was a roll in the sheets idve gotten you there youre probably right thats my point right about the mistakes or the sex he asked and began slathering jelly on bread she decided that even if she had the answer it wouldnt matter kind decent he was and also stubborn as a mule ill make coffee dont do coffee with this calls for tea and ill make it he filled the kettle set it on the stove poured the eggs into the heated skillet in a sizzling rush now youre angry i walked in half angry and one look at you took care of part two funny thing though i can be pissed off at a woman and hold myself back from knocking her around thats the kind of amazing selfcontrol i have nell drew a calming breath folded her hands on the table im well aware that not every man deals with temper with physical violence thats the kind of amazing intelligence i have good for us he rooted around until he found teabags an herbal blend he felt more suited to fancy china cups than the solid stoneware mugs she had available he scooped eggs onto plates found forks and tore off paper towels in lieu of napkins hed said he wasnt much in the kitchen nell thought as he set a plate in front of her and went back to dunk the teabags in the mugs but even here he had an appeal he never wasted a move she noted and wondered if it came from grace or practicality either way it worked he sat across from her let diego climb adventurously up the leg of his jeans and knead his thigh eat she forked up a bite sampled theyre better than they should be considering you used a pound of salt per egg i like salt dont feed the cat at the table she sighed ate it was so blessedly normal sitting like this eating oversalted eggs and strawberry jelly squished in a piece of folded bread im not the mess i used to be she said but i still have moments until i dont im not prepared to complicate my life or anyone elses thats sensible im going to concentrate on my work a persons got to have priorities there are things i want to do things i need to learn for myself uhhuh he polished off his eggs sat back with his tea ripley said youre scouting for a computer the rental agencys looking to upgrade a couple of theirs you could probably get a fair deal you might want to stop by ask for marge she manages the place thanks ill check it out tomorrow why arent you mad anymore who said im not i know how to read mad he studied her face she had some color back now but she looked exhausted i bet you do not much point in it he took his plate to the sink rinsed it off i might brood some later ive got a real knack for that according to my sister i used to be a champion sulker satisfied that they were back on an even keel she picked up her plate i might see if i can get back into that you were right about the traditional todd meal it did the trick never misses still grape jellys better for it ill stock some just in case good im going to let you get back to work in a minute he yanked her against him jerked her up to her toes covered her mouth with his in a hot possessive kiss the blood seemed to rush to her head then poured out of it again leaving her dizzy weak and achy one strangled moan escaped before she was back on the flat of her feet and gripping the edge of the counter for balance nothing sensible about that zack said but its real youre going to have to shuffle it into your list of priorities dont work too late he strolled out letting the screened door slap comfortably shut behind him in her dream that night there was a circle a thin line upon the earth as silver as starlight within that sphere there were three women robed in white their voices flowed like music though the words were strange to her as they sang spears of light sprang up from the circle shimmering bars of silver against the black curtain of night she saw a cup a knife with a carved handle and sprigs of herbs as green as summer from the cup they drank one by one and she tasted wine sweet and light on her tongue the darkhaired one drew symbols on the ground with the blade of the knife and she smelled earth fresh and dark as they circled chanted a pure gold flame spurted in the center the heat of it warmed her skin then they rose up above the gold of the fire above the cool silver of the spears of light as if they danced on the air and she knew the freedom and the joy as the wind kissed her cheeks chapter eleven contents prev next closed in mias office nell sweated over facts figures reality and possibilities she liked the possibilities best as they included a secondhand computer with all the capabilities she required an attractive sales kit professional business cards a cozy yet functional home office and a commercialgrade food processor the fact was she needed all of these things and several more in order to create a viable reasonably profitable business her figures proved she could make this her reality if she settled for a reality without any frills which included food drink and clothing for approximately twelve months as she saw it her choices were to live like a mole for about a year or to do without the professional tools that would help her build her business living like a mole wasnt so bad she mused shed done essentially that for months before shed come to the island if she hadnt weakened and frittered away money on wind chimes and sandals and earrings she wouldnt have remembered how much fun it was to fritter away money in the first place now it had to stop by her calculations she could provided marge at island realty was patient enough scrape up the money for the computer within three weeks she would need several hundred more of course for the printer the phone line the business license the office supplies once she was set up she could design and generate the sales kits and menus right on the desktop with a sigh she sat back combed her hands through her hair shed left out the uniform she could hardly cater the macey affair in jeans and a tshirt or a sexy little halter she needed good black slacks a crisp white shirt sensible but classy black shoes she looked up when mia walked in hi ill get out of your way no need mia waved her back i just need to check something in the september catalog she plucked it off a shelf flipped through while watching nell over the pages financial worries why do you ask vibes theyre not worries so much as obstacles of varying heights i hate admitting im taking on too much too fast and why is that not hating it but why do you say youre taking on too much mia asked as she sat stretched out like a cat on a hearth rug a few side jobs some boxed lunches one major party and here i am designing logos and business cards trying to squeeze out money for a computer when i can easily keep things organized in a spiral notebook i need to rein myself in theres little thats more boring than reining in mia stated when i started this place most people didnt think i could make it fly a small community a seasonal tourist trade bookstores and fancy coffee were for cities and snazzy suburbs they were wrong i knew what i wanted and what i was capable of achieving so do you in another six months or a year nell agreed but im getting ahead of myself why wait you need capital but you cant risk going to the bank for a business loan so many pesky questions about credit history employment history and so on mia inclined her head when nell sighed she enjoyed hitting the center of the target with the first arrow as careful as youve been you may have left a hole mia continued and youre too smart to take chances there i thought about it nell admitted if i opened myself up that way id never relax nell channing doesnt have a credit history and itll take me time to establish one which is one of the obstacles to that capital there are spells of course but i dislike doing spells for financial gain it seems so crass it doesnt seem so crass when im trying to stretch my budget to buy basic office equipment pursing her lips mia tapped the tips of her fingers together i had an acquaintance who was in a bit of a financial squeeze she worked a spell asking that her current money worries be cleared and won fifty thousand in the lottery the next week really really she was able to pay her debts and treat herself to a week at the doral spa in miami fabulous place by the way when she returned her car broke down her roof sprang a leak her basement flooded and she received an audit notice from the irs in the end shed done nothing more than trade one set of worries for another though she did get that week at the spa which cant be discounted nell acknowledged the humor in mias words with a small grin i hear you magic isnt a crutch to be used for convenience youre a quick study little sister so lets talk business mia toed off her pretty heels curled up her legs im in the market for an investment mia i cant tell you how much i appreciate that but you want to do it yourself and blah blah blah with a flick of the wrist mia swatted nells protest aside please lets behave like grownups are you trying to irritate or intimidate me into accepting a loan i dont generally try to irritate or intimidate though ive been told im good at both and i didnt say anything about a loan were discussing an investment she uncurled lazily and got a bottle of water for each of them out of her minifridge i would consider a loan i suppose for your startup costs say ten thousand payable over a period of sixty months at twelve percent interest i dont need ten thousand nell said giving the bottle cap an annoyed twist and twelve percent is ridiculous a bank would charge less but im not a bank and i wouldnt ask those pesky questions mias lips curved red and shapely over the mouth of the bottle but i prefer an investment im a businesswoman who likes profit you have a skill a marketable one which has already proven itself of interest on the island with working capital you can establish a viable business which i feel will enhance rather than compete with my own ive some ideas on that actually but we can get into that later i make a ten k investment become your silent partner for a reasonable compensation of say eight percent of gross profits i dont need ten it had been a very long time nell thought as she tapped her fingers on the desk since shed negotiated fees contracts amazing how quickly it came back ten thousand would be welcome and would eliminate the sweat and worry but if you avoided the sweat and worry she thought you eliminated the glow of satisfaction that came when you succeeded five will do she decided for six percent of net five then for seven net done excellent ill have my lawyer draw up a contract ill open an account for the business at the bank would it be less sticky if i took care of that and the license application ill do it i have to take a stand sometime little sister you took one months ago but i leave it to you nell she said as she opened the door were going to kick ass she worked like a demon preparing planning implementing her kitchen was a hotbed of experimentation rejections and successes her little office was the scene of hours of lateevening sessions where on her secondhand computer and printer she became her own desktop publisher producing menus flyers business cards invoices and stationery all with the inscription sisters catering and the logo shed designed of three women standing in a circle hands clasped and every one listed nell channing as proprietor and carried her new phone number when she finished putting her first sales kit together she took it along with the best bottle of champagne she could afford and drove to mias to leave them on her doorstep they were in business on the day of the macey party nell stood in gladyss kitchen and surveyed the scene shed been working onsite since four and had thirty minutes before the guests were due to arrive for the first time since nell had begun the setup for the party she finally had a moments peace and quiet if gladys made it through the evening without fainting from excitement and anxiety it would be a miracle every inch of the kitchen was organized to nells specifications in precisely ten minutes she would begin setting out the appetizers as the guest list had expanded to more than a hundred she had used all her powers of persuasion to convince gladys to forgo the formal sitdown meal in favor of fun interesting food stations set up at strategic points throughout the house and on the patio shed seen to the floral arrangements herself and had personally helped carl deal with the fairy lights and luminaries there were candles in rented silver holders and paper napkins that at nells suggestion carried a heart with the happy couples initials inside it still touched her the way gladyss eyes had filled when shed seen them satisfied the kitchen was ready for the battle to come she went out to check on the rest of the field and her troops shed hired peg to help serve and betsy from the magick inn to tend the bar she herself would fill in in both areas whenever she could leave the kitchen unattended it looks great she announced and moved to the patio doors the evening promised to be clear both she and gladys had suffered untold agonies over the possibility of rain nell tugged down the black vest shed added to her uniform selection one more time peg you circulate trying to make a complete circuit every fifteen minutes when your trays empty or nearly so you head back to the kitchen if im not there to refill youll arrange the next selection the way i showed you i practiced it a zillion times i know nell gave her an encouraging pat on the arm betsy ill try to keep up with the empties and discards if i run behind or youre running low on anything just give me a sign check and everything looks great so far so good and she was determined it would only get better carl juniors in charge of the music so im not going to worry about it lets get this show on the road peg vegetable crudites station one it was more than just a party to nell it was a new beginning as she lit the last of the candles she thought of her mother and the first official catering job theyd worked together ive made a circle mom she murmured and im going to make it shine touching the flame to wick with her mother in her mind nell made that vow she glanced over and beamed as gladys macey came out of the master bedroom you look beautiful nervous as a bride she fluffed at her hair i went into boston for this getup not too fussy is it the cocktail suit was a pale mint green with a sparkle of beads glittering on the lapels and cuffs its gorgeous and so are you and theres nothing for you to be nervous about all you have to do is enjoy yourself are you sure theres going to be enough cocktail shrimp im sure i just dont know what people are going to think of that chicken in peanut sauce theyll love it what about gladys stop haranguing the girl scowling dragging at the knot of his tie carl stepped out let her do her job mr macey you make a picture unable to resist nell reached over and straightened his tie herself made me buy a new suit and you look very handsome in it nell assured him done nothing but complain about it since he got home from work well used to their squabbling by now nell smiled personally i like a man whos not too comfortable in suits and ties its very sexy at nells statement carls face went bright pink dont know why we couldnt have had a barbecue and a couple of kegs before gladys could snap back at him nell lifted a tray of appetizers i think youre going to have a wonderful time starting right now manners forced carl to take one of the fancy salmon bites the minute it hit his tongue he pursed his lips got a nice flavor to it he admitted guess itd go down nice with a beer you step right into the living room and betsy will fix you up i think i hear the first guests arriving oh my oh my goodness patting her hair again gladys shot quick looks everywhere i meant to see if everything was as it should be before everythings exactly as it should be you greet your guests leave the rest to me it took less than fifteen minutes for the initial party stiffness to unbend music began to pump conversation began to roll and as nell made her circuit with the chicken kabobs she saw that shed been right people loved them it was fun to see the familiar island residents in their festive best knotted into conversational groups or wandering out to the patio she kept her ears open for comments about the food and the atmosphere and felt a quick tingle with each positive remark but best of all was seeing her client glow like a candle within an hour the house was jammed and she was working at top speed theyre going through these trays like starving hordes peg told her as she scrambled into the kitchen youd think every one of them fasted a week before tonight itll slow down after the dancing starts moving quickly nell refilled the tray station hell i can never remember the numbers the meatballs are about half gone you said i should tell you ill take care of it is anything not going over not that ive seen peg hefted the tray the way its moving id say this crowd would eat the paper napkins if you put sauce on them amused nell took out the miniature egg rolls she had warming in the oven as she arranged them on a tray ripley strolled in some party its great isnt it yeah swank you look pretty swank yourself nell commented ripley looked down at her basic black dress it was short satisfactorily clingy and had the advantage of being able to go to a party or with a blazer double as meeting attire i got this number in black and in white figure that covers the bases as far as dresses go she glanced around saw absolute order heard the hum of the dishwasher smelled the scent of spice how do you keep everything organized in here im brilliant seems like ripley plucked up one of the egg rolls popped it into her mouth foods fabulous she said with her mouth full i never told you but that picnic deal you fixed for me was really great oh yeah how did that work out just dandy thanks ripley replied her smug smile transformed into a scowl when mia stepped in i wanted to extend my compliments she spotted the egg rolls ah a new offering she took one bit in lovely hello ripley i barely recognized you in your girl attire how did you decide whether to wear the black or the white this evening up yours dont start i havent time to referee dont worry ripley snagged one more egg roll i cant waste the energy on hecate here gladyss nephew from cambridge just arrived and is looking just fine im going to go hit on him its so comforting to know some things never change dont touch anything nell ordered then hurried out with the tray so because she preferred being away from the crowd of people but still wanted to eat ripley eased up the lid on a covered tray nell seems okay why wouldnt she dont play dumb mia it doesnt suit that cat face of yours ripley helped herself to a couple of frosted heartshaped cookies i dont need a scrying mirror to see shes had a rough time a woman like her doesnt pop up on the island with nothing to her name but a backpack and a secondhand buick unless shes on the run zack figures some guy knocked her around when mia said nothing ripley leaned back on the counter nibbled look i like her and my brothers gone over her im not looking to hassle her but maybe to help if she needs it with or without your badge either or both it seems to me shes putting down stakes here not just working for you but starting this catering deal shes starting a life on three sisters that makes her one of mine give me one of those mia held out her hand waited until ripley gave her a cookie what are you asking me ripley if zacks right and if he is if someones going to come after her whatever nells told me in confidence has to be respected loyalty ripley was forced to admit was never a question with mia it was more a religion im not asking you to break a confidence mia nipped into the cookie you just cant say it can you oh kiss ass ripley slapped the lid back on the tray started to storm out but there was something about the way nell had been flushed and happy as she worked in the miraculously ordered kitchen that pulled at her she spun back tell me what youve seen i want to help her yes i know mia finished the cookie dusted the crumbs from her fingers theres a man he hunts and he haunts her hes the physical reality of her every fear doubt worry if he comes here if he finds her shell need both of us and shell need the courage to take her own power and use it whats his name i cant tell you that it wasnt shown to me but you know it what she gave to me i cant pass on to you i cant break her trust the worry in mias eyes crawled into ripleys belly if i could and did his name would make no difference this is her path ripley we can guide and support instruct and assist but in the end itll be her choice you know the legend as well as i im not getting into that ripley pushed the subject away with a sharp gesture im talking about someones safety a friends safety so am i but im also talking about a friends destiny if you really want to help her you could start by taking responsibility for your own with that mia walked out responsibility my butt ripley was annoyed enough to pry up the lid for one more cookie she knew what her responsibilities were she was obliged to see to the safety of the residents and visitors of three sisters island to keep order and uphold the law beyond that her responsibilities were nobodys business but hers and it wasnt responsible to go around practicing mumbo jumbo and clinging to some stupid legend that was as much nonsense now as it had been three centuries before she was the island deputy not part of some mystic trio of saviors and she wasnt destined to mete out some nebulous psychic justice now shed lost her appetite and her desire to hit on gladys maceys nephew served her right for wasting time with mia devlin disgusted she stalked out of the kitchen the first thing she saw as she moved back toward the party was zack he was in the middle of things where he always seemed to be when it came to people they were drawn to him but even as he stood in the middle of a group who chattered at him she could see that his gaze and his mind were aimed elsewhere it was all for nell now ripley watched her brother as he watched nell circulate with her fancy little egg rolls there was no doubt about it the man was completely over the moon while she could resist and ignore mias talk of destinies and responsibilities when it came to herself when it came to a newly formed and still evolving friendship it was an entirely different matter especially if it involved her brother there was nothing she wouldnt have done for zack even if it meant linking hands with mia she was going to have to pay close attention to the situation reevaluate periodically do some hard uncomfortable thinking hes on the edge mia whispered in her ear the shimmering edge just before the breathless tumble ive got eyes dont i do you know what happens when he falls ripley took the wineglass out of mias hand drank half of it why dont you tell me hell lay down his life for her without an instants hesitation hes the most admirable man i know she took the glass back sipped that at least is a point of absolute agreement between us because she knew it ripley weakened i want a protective spell i want you to take care of that ive already done what i can in the end it has to be a circle of three i cant think about this now im not going to talk about it now all right why dont we just stand here and watch a strong and admirable man fall in love moments this pure shouldnt be wasted mia laid a hand on ripleys shoulder a casual link she doesnt see it even as it passes over her like a breath of warm air she isnt whole enough to know it with a sigh that may have held the barest whiff of envy mia looked down into her wine come on ill buy you a drink zack bided his time he talked with the other guests danced with the ladies shared a celebratory beer with carl he listened with apparent interest to village complaints and scrutinized the alcohol intake of anyone who held car keys he watched nell serve food chat with the guests replenish pots staying warm over little cans of sterno what he observed he thought was a blooming he started to ask if he could lend her a hand then realized it was laughable not only did he have no clue what needed to be done but she so obviously needed no ones help as the crowd thinned out he drove a few celebrants home himself to be on the safe side it was nearly midnight before he felt his own duties were dispatched and he could hunt nell up in the kitchen empty trays were stacked neatly on gladyss marbled white counter serving bowls were nested the sink was filled with soapy water that sent up little fingers of steam and nell was systematically loading the dishwasher whens the last time you were off your feet i lost track she slid plates into slots but the fact that theyre killing me makes me incredibly happy here he held out a glass of champagne i thought you deserved this i certainly do she took a quick sip before she set it aside all these weeks of planning and its done and i have five count them five appointments for jobs next week did you know mary harrisons daughter is getting married next spring i heard that to john bigelow cousin of mine i have a shot at catering it i vote you put those meatballs of yours on the menu they were really tasty ill make a note of it it felt so good to be able to plan ahead not just a day or a week but months ahead did you see the way gladys and carl danced together she straightened pressing hard on the aching small of her back thirty years and they were dancing on the patio looking at each other like it was the first time it was the best moment of the night for me do you know why why she turned to him because them dancing together them looking at each other the way they were was what this was all about not decorations or pretty lights or cocktail shrimp it was about people making a connection and believing in it in each other what would have happened if either one of them all those years ago had stepped back or turned away theyd have missed dancing on the patio and everything in between i never got to dance with you he reached out skimmed his fingers over her cheek nell there you are eyes damp and brilliant gladys rushed in i was afraid youd slipped out no indeed i need to finish up here then do a runthrough of the house to make sure i have everything back in order you certainly do not youve done enough more than i expected i never had such a party not in my whole life why people will be talking about it for years she took nells shoulders kissed both her cheeks i was a pest and i know it then she hugged nell breathless oh this was such a treat and im not waiting three decades to do it again now i want you to go home and get off your feet she pressed a crisp hundreddollar bill into nells hand this is for you mrs macey youre not supposed to tip me peg and ive taken care of them youre going to hurt my feelings if you dont take this and go buy yourself something pretty now i want you to scat anything else needs to be done itll wait until tomorrow sheriff you help our nell out to her car with her trays ill do that this was better than my wedding gladys said as she started to the door she turned back briefly winked now lets see if we can improve on my wedding night looks like carls in for a surprise zack hefted a stack of trays wed better move along give the young couple some privacy im right behind you it took three trips between them with carl pushing a bottle of champagne into nells hands as he nudged them along heres your hat whats your hurry zack chuckled as he loaded nells trunk wheres your car hmm oh ripley used it to take the last couple of semiimpaired guests home most people walked which helped out nell let herself look at him he was wearing a suit but had already rid himself of the tie she could see the faint bulge where hed stuffed it in his pocket hed opened his collar so she could see the clean tanned line of his throat there was a faint smile on his lips as he watched the lights in the macey house wink out one at a time his profile wasnt perfect his hair hadnt been styled and the way he stood his thumbs tucked in the front pockets of his suit pants was relaxed rather than posed when the shimmer of desire came she didnt try to close it off instead she took a step forward ive only had half a glass of champagne im unimpaired thinking clearly and my reflexes are perfect he turned his head toward her as sheriff im glad to know it still watching him she drew her keys out of her pocket held them dangling come home with me you drive the twinkle in his eyes turned to razorsharp intensity im not going to ask if youre sure he took the keys im just going to tell you to get in the car her knees felt a bit wobbly but she walked to the door slid in while he got behind the wheel when he yanked her across the seat ravished her mouth she forgot all about wobbly knees and did her best to crawl into his lap hold on just hold on christ jesus he stabbed the keys into the ignition the engine whimpered to life and he swung the protesting car into a tight uturn it shimmied in protest making nell giggle nervously if this heap falls apart before we get there well have to run for it zack she flipped off the seat belt shed automatically snapped on and slithered over to bite his ear i feel like im going to explode did i ever mention im particularly partial to women wearing little black vests no really i just found out tonight reaching out he snagged the vest by the center vee tugged her back against him understandably distracted he took the turn too sharp and bumped the wheels over the curb one more minute he panted just one more minute with a squeal of brakes and a violent jerk he stopped in front of nells cottage he managed barely to turn off the ignition before he reached for her dragging her across his lap he found her mouth with his again and let his hands do as they pleased need spurted through her hot and welcome riding on it she tugged at his jacket arched against his hands and thrilled at the first scrape of callus over her flesh inside he felt as randy and impatient as a teenager and as fumbling as he fought to open the car door we have to get inside he whipped her out his breathing already ragged as they continued to fight with each others clothes they stumbled and buttons popped off his shirt as he half carried her toward the cottage her delighted laughter rang in his head oh i love your hands i want them all over me ill take care of that goddamn it whats wrong with this door even as he vented his frustration by rapping his hip hard against it it flew open they ended up in a heap on the floor half in half out right here right here she chanted it while her fingers worked busily at his belt wait just a let me close the he managed to roll scoot and kick the door shut the room was all moonlight and shadows the floor was as hard as brick neither of them noticed as they tore at clothes rolled and tugged he caught glimpses beautiful erotic images of pale skin soft curves delicate lines he wanted to look he wanted to wallow he had to take when her shirt caught at her wrists by the cuffs he gave up gave in and lowered his mouth to her breast she vibrated beneath him a volcano on the brink of erupting flashes of whitehot heat curls of keenedged longing raced through her system until she was raw and ready she arched under him more demand than offer her nails biting restlessly into his back the world was spinning faster and faster as if shed leaped upon some mad carousel and all that kept her earthbound was the glorious weight of his body on hers right now she gripped his hips opened for him right now he plunged letting his body take over letting his mind go there was nothing but the relentless fury to mate she closed around him a hot wet fist and he felt her tighten stretching like a bow beneath him before she let out a cry that rang with triumph her climax ripped through him like madness pleasure geysered through her flooding senses swamping reason flying free she wrapped herself around him clinging tight to take him with her and with her sheer joy drove him over the edge chapter twelve contents prev next his ears were ringing or maybe it was just the sound of his heart banging against his ribs like a fist on piano keys either way he couldnt get his mind clear or his body to move hed have worried about temporary paralysis if he couldve worked up the energy to worry about anything okay he managed and breathed in all right and out again i guess i tripped me too she was flattened under him in the perfect position to nuzzle at his throat did you get banged up anywhere no you broke my fall she gave the strong line of that throat a little scrape with her teeth such a hero yeah you bet i rushed you i hope you dont mind its a little hard to complain just at the moment he found the energy to roll over dragging her with him so she was cushioned against him but im hoping youll give me a chance to show off my style and finesse she lifted her head shook her hair back and just grinned down at him what i was just thinking how much i like your style every time i caught a glimpse of you tonight during the party i just wanted to lick my lips big handsome sheriff todd standing around in a suit he wished he didnt have to wear nursing one lonely beer all evening so he could drive people home safe and watching me with those patient green eyes until i was so turned on id have to go back to the kitchen just to calm down again is that right he ran his hands down her arms amused when he hit the cuffs of her shirt carefully he began to unbutton them do you know what i was thinking when i was watching you not exactly i was thinking how you looked like a dancer all grace and competence and i tried not to think what you might have on under that starched white shirt and sexy little vest once hed freed her wrists he ran his hands back up her arms youve got such a fine streamlined shape to you nell its been driving me crazy for weeks i dont know how to explain how it makes me feel to know that to feel steady enough to want that she threw her head back her arms up oh god i feel so alive i dont want it ever to stop she leaned down again kissed him hard then scrambled to her feet i want that champagne i want to get drunk and make love with you all night i can get behind that idea he sat up then his eyes widened as she pulled open the door what re you doing getting the champagne out of the car let me get my pants on and ill get it nell stupefied he sprang to his feet as she raced outside naked as a jaybird well for gods sake he grabbed his pants carrying them with him to the doorway get back in here before i have to haul you in for indecent exposure theres nobody to see it felt fabulous and exactly right to stand naked in the cool night air to feel it caress the skin so recently heated by passion with the grass tickling her feet she threw her arms out to the side and turned in circles come on out its a beautiful night moon and stars and the sound of the sea she looked impossibly alluring the gold of her hair silvered by starlight her milky skin shimmering with it and her face lifted to the sky then her gaze met his across the little patch of lawn with a power so intense it stole his breath for a moment he would have sworn the whole of her sparkled theres something in the air here she said turning her hands up palms cupped as if she could catch the breath of the night i feel it inside me beating like a pulse and when i feel that it seems i could do anything with her palm still cupped she held out her hand to him will you come kiss me in the moonlight he couldnt resist and didnt try but walked to her took her outstretched hand with the sky sprinkling light over them he lowered his mouth to hers in a kiss that warmed rather than burned the tenderness of it crept into her heart when he lifted her into his arms she cradled her head on his shoulder knowing she was safe and welcome there he carried her inside through the little cottage and to the old bed that shifted quietly under their weight later he told himself as he lost himself in her he would think about how he felt to find himself falling in love with a witch she awoke before dawn from one of the snatches of sleep theyd allowed each other she felt his warmth and his weight the ease of it the sheer and steady normality of him was both comfort and arousal she drew his face for herself in her mind feature by feature when she had it complete she held it there as she slipped out of bed to start her day she showered dressed in shorts and a sleeveless shirt quietly she picked up the clothes theyd scattered in the living room and all but floated into the kitchen shed never experienced desire like that before not the kind that sprang like an animal inside you and swallowed you whole she hoped to have the experience again and the tenderness that had come later the insatiable thirst for more the dark breathless groping all of it nell channing had a lover and he was sleeping in her bed he wanted her and that was a thrill he wanted her for who she was and not who he could mold her to be and that was a balm blissful she brewed coffee and while its scent perfumed the air she worked up a dough for cinnamon buns another for bread while she worked she sang to herself and watched the new day put roses in the sky once her garden was watered and shed sipped at her first cup of coffee she slid a batch of buns into the oven with her mug in one hand a pencil in the other she began to toy with her menu for the coming week whatre you doing she jumped like a rabbit at the sleeproughened sound of his voice and the coffee slopped over onto the paper did i wake you im sorry i tried to be quiet he held up a hand nell dont do that it pisses me off his voice was thick with sleep and despite herself dread curled in her stomach as he stepped toward her theres one thing im going to ask you he picked up her mug drank to clear his mind and voice dont ever mix me up with him if youd waked me up and it annoyed me i would say so but the fact is i woke up because you werent there and i missed you some habits are hard to break no matter how much you try well keep trying he said it lightly moved over to the stove to pour a full mug for himself you got something baking already he sniffed the air mother of god he breathed it reverently cinnamon buns her dimples flickered and if they are ill be your slave youre so easy sheriff she got a hot mitt out of the drawer why dont you sit down ill give you breakfast and we can discuss what i expect from my slave on monday morning nell breezed into café book loaded with boxes of baked goods called out a cheery hello and swung upstairs at the front counter lulu stopped ringing up weekend mail orders her lips twitching as mia turned from stocking shelves somebody mia said got lucky this weekend you going up to squeeze her for details please mia tucked in another book brushed lint from her skirt do dryads dance in the woods amused lulu cackled well dont forget to fill me in mia walked into the café and through the homey irresistible scent of cinnamon buns busy weekend she commented scanning the mornings offerings you bet and a terrific party saturday night hell of a job little sister thanks nell lined up her muffins before pouring the first of the morning coffee for mia ive got several meetings this week with potential clients that came out of it congratulations but mia drew in the scent of her coffee i dont think future catering jobs are what has you glowing today let me try one of those buns there casually she walked around to the rear of the counter while nell selected the bun you definitely have the look of a woman who spent her weekend doing more than baking i did some gardening my tomato plants are coming right along mmmhmm she brought the fragrant bun to her lips took a neat bite im imagining sheriff todd was just as tasty as this give we open in ten i shouldnt talk about it its rude isnt it absolutely not its required and expected have a little sympathy will you i havent engaged in sexual activities for a considerable time so im entitled to a few vicarious thrills you look so damn happy i am it was wonderful nell did a quick little dance then grabbed a bun for herself outrageous he has such stamina oh mmm mia ran her tongue over her lips dont stop now i think we broke several standing records now youre bragging but thats all right youre among friends you know the best part im hoping youll tell me and all the other parts as well he didnt doesnt treat me like im fragile or needy or i dont know wounded so i dont feel fragile or needy or wounded when im with him the first time we barely made it into the house and ended up on the floor tearing at each others clothes it was so normal we could all use a bit of that kind of normal now and then hes a great kisser isnt he oh boy and when he trailing off nell paled i was fifteen mia explained as she bit into the cinnamon bun again he gave me a ride home from a party and we satisfied our mutual curiosity with a couple of very long very intense liplocks while i wont insult your intelligence and claim it was like kissing my brother i will say we didnt suit and have chosen to be friends but they were really fine kisses she licked icing off her finger so i have some small idea just how delightful your weekend was im glad i didnt know that before i might have been intimidated arent you sweet so what are you going to do about zachariah todd enjoy him perfect answer for the moment he has really good hands too doesnt he mia commented as she strolled away now youre going to have to shut up laughing mia started down the steps im opening the doors and so she thought little sister are you it wouldnt have surprised mia to know that zack was undergoing personal interrogation over coffee and buns as well didnt see you around much this weekend had stuff to do and didnt i bring you a present ripley worked her way enthusiastically through the first bun um good she managed to slur guess the stuff had to do with the islands best cook which i cleverly deduced since youve got a bag holding half a dozen buns down to four now he enjoyed one of his own while he slogged through paperwork at his desk john macey still hasnt paid these parking tickets he needs a goose ill goose him so you and nell got down to the mattress rhumba zack gave her a single withering look youve got such a mushy romantic heart rip i dont know how you get through life with it weighing you down avoiding the questions usually answering the question in the affirmative cop howd it go do i ask you about your sex life she waved a finger signaling a pause in the conversation while she swallowed yes only because im older and wiser yeah right she snagged a second bun not only because they were incredible but because she knew it would annoy him if we let you slide on the older and wiser bull then well agree im younger and more cynical are you going to do a deeper run on her background no deliberately he opened a drawer dropped the bag of buns inside shut it if youre serious about her and knowing you you are you need a handle on it zack she didnt drop out of the sky onto three sisters she took the ferry he said coolly whats your problem with her i thought you liked her i do a lot as it happens she eased a hip onto the corner of his desk but for reasons that often escape me i like you a lot too youve got a soft spot for the troubled and wounded zack and sometimes through no fault of their own the troubled and wounded can bite right through the soft parts have you ever known me not to be able to take care of myself youre in love with her when he blinked stared she pushed off the desk paced restlessly around the office area what am i blind and stupid ive known you all my life and i know every move every tone every expression on that dopey face of yours youre in love with her and you dont even know who she is shes exactly who and what ive wanted my whole life ripley stopped in the act of kicking the desk and her eyes went soft and helpless aw damn it zack whyd you have to go and say something like that because its true its the way it is for us todds isnt it we go along go alone then pow it hits and its all over ive been hit and i like it okay lets just back up a little determined to stand up for him whether he wanted it or not she slapped her palms on the desk leaned over shes got trouble shes managed to break free of it at least temporarily but its there he may come after her zack if i hadnt been worried about you id never have asked mia about it rather saw my tongue in half with a rusty kitchen knife but i did ask her and shes not clear on it honey what you said before about knowing me thats true now what do you think my reaction is to what you just said she hissed out a breath if he comes after her hell have to get through you close enough shouldnt you be out on patrol or would you rather take the paperwork portion of our day id rather eat lice she put on her cap yanked the tail of her hair through the back look im glad you found someone who suits you im even more glad i like her but theres more to nell channing than a nice woman with a murky past who can bake like a team of angels you mean shes a witch he said easily yeah i figured that out ive got no particular problem with it so saying he went back to the keyboard chuckling to himself when ripley slammed the door behind her the goddess doesnt require sacrifice mia said shes a mother like a mother she requires respect love discipline and wants happiness for her children the evening was cool mia could already scent the end of summer soon her woods would change from green and lush to wild color shed already seen the woolly caterpillars watched the busy squirrel hoarding nuts signals she thought of a long cold winter but for now her roses bloomed and the most tender of her herbs trailed fragrantly among her garden stones magic springs from the elements and from the heart but its rituals are best served with tools even visual aids if you will any craft depends on certain routines and implements she walked through her garden to her kitchen door opened it for nell i have some for you the room was as fragrant as the garden hanks of herbs dried on hooks pots of flowers that mia had chosen for indoor company stood on the long line of smooth counter what could only be described as a cauldron sat on the stove simmering away with the strong sweetness of heliotrope what are you cooking oh just a little charm for someone who has a job interview later in the week shes nervous mia passed a hand through the steam heliotrope for success sunflower for career a bit of hazel to assist in communication and this and that ill empower some suitable crystals for her that she can carry in a pouch in her purse will she get the job thats up to her the craft doesnt promise us everything we desire nor is it a crutch for weak spines to lean on now your tools she continued gesturing to the table shed selected them carefully with an image of nell in her mind you should once youre home cleanse them no one should touch them without your permission they require your energy the wand is made from a birch branch pruned from a living tree on the winter solstice the crystal on its tip is clear quartz it was a gift to me from the one who trained me it was lovely slim and smooth and felt almost silky when nell trailed a finger over it you cant give me something that was a gift it was meant to be passed on youll want to have others too copper is good this is your broom she continued lifting a brow as nell stifled a laugh sorry i just never thought a broom you wont be riding on it hang it at the door of your home for protection use it to sweep out negative energy a cup again one day youll want to select your own but for now this will serve i bought it at island market glassware section sometimes the simple works best the pentacle is from a maple bur it must always stand upright the athame isnt used for physical cutting but for directing energy she didnt touch it but told nell to do so some prefer swords but i dont think you will she added as nell explored the carved handle with a fingertip the blades dull and meant to be the bolline on the other hand is meant to cut in the physical the handles curved which will give you a good grip for harvesting your herbs and plants carving wands inscribing candles and so on there are those kitchen witches who use it to cut food the choice is yours of course of course nell agreed i assume you can handle the purchase and selection of your own cauldron cast irons best you can find an incense burner that appeals to you at one of the gift shops and the incense as well cones and sticks are more accessible locally when youve time you can make your own incense powder youll need some straw baskets some swatches of silk do you want to write this down nell blew out a breath maybe id better candles mia continued after handing nell a pad and pencil ill explain the purpose of colors and symbols i have some crystals for you but youll want more of your own selection a couple dozen canning jars with lids a mortar and pestle sea salt i have a tarot deck you can borrow and some wooden boxes though ill want them back as well this will get you started its more involved than i thought before the day in the garden all i did was stand there there are things youll be able to do with your mind and heart and others that require things as an extension of power and as a respect for tradition now that you have a computer youll want to keep a record of spells a record of spells on my computer why not be practical and efficient nell have you spoken to zack about any of this no are you worried about his reaction she touched the wand again and wondered thats part of it but before we even get there i dont know how id begin to tell him i havent resolved it completely for myself fair enough what you share or dont is your choice just as what you give or what you take with ripley feeling the way she does i thought he might feel the same guess i dont want to hit any hitches so soon who could blame you lets take a walk i really should be getting back its nearly dark hell wait mia opened a carved box took out her wand the tip was a round of quartz as smoky as her eyes take yours its time you learned how to cast a circle well keep it simple she promised nudging nell through the door and after what i have in mind i can almost guarantee the sex will be sensational its not all sex nell began but thats a definite plus as they walked toward the woods a light mist swirled to hug the ground long shadows spilled out of the trees black lines over pale gray the weathers changing mia said the last weeks of summer always make me melancholy its odd because i love the autumn the smells and the colors of it that slice in the air when you step out first thing in the morning youre lonely nell nearly said it before she checked her tongue how could such a statement help but sound smug and selfsatisfied coming from a woman whod just taken a lover maybe a holdover from childhood she suggested end of summer means back to school she followed mia down a wellbeaten path through mist and shadow i always hated those first couple of weeks of school not so much if my father had a second year on the same base but at those times when i was the new kid and everyone else was already picked off in groups how did you handle it i learned how to talk to people to make friends even though they were transient lived in my own head a lot i guess some of that made me a perfect target for evan he promised to love honor and cherish forever i really wanted forever with someone and now now i just want to carve out my own space and stick something else we have in common this is one of my spaces they stepped into a clearing where the mist was white from the quiet light of the rising moon the full ball of it shimmered between the trees teased the dark summer leaves spilled through at the edges of a stand of three stones from the branches that ringed the clearing hung hanks of herbs the glitter of strung crystals rang gently together in the light wind and the sound of the wind the stones the nearby sea was music there was a primitive essential feel to the place its beautiful here nell began and i want to say eerie but not in a frightening way you almost expect to see ghosts or headless horsemen and if you did it would seem absolutely natural not frightening at all she turned her steps shredding the mist like gray silk and caught the scents of verbena rosemary and sage carried on the breeze from the tree branches caught something else as well a quiet hum that was almost like music this is where you were the night of the solstice before you came out to stand on the cliffs this ground is hallowed mia told her its said the sisters stood here three hundred years and more past and worked their spell to create their haven whether they did or not ive always been drawn here well cast the circle together its a basic ritual mia drew her ritual knife from her pocket and began fascinated nell repeated the words the gestures and found herself unsurprised when a thin ring of light glowed through the smoke of the mist we call on air on earth on water and fire to guard our circle and grant our desire here protect and witness this rite open our minds to the magic of night mia laid down her knife her wand nodded to nell after her chant was repeated you can cast your own circle in your own way with your own words when youre ready i hope you dont mind but i prefer working skyclad when weather permits with this mia slipped off her dress and folded it neatly while nell gaped oh well i dont really its not required at ease with her nakedness mia picked up her wand again i generally prefer it particularly for this ritual there was a tattoo a birthmark nell wondered a small pentagram shape against the milkwhite skin of her thigh what ritual well draw down the moon some most usually do this when theres serious work to be done but i sometimes need or like the extra burst of energy to begin open yourself mind breath heart loin trust yourself every woman is ruled by the moon just as the sea is hold your wand in your right hand mirroring mias gestures nell lifted her arms slowly raising them high then clasping her wand with both hands on this night in this hour we call upon lunas power merge with us light into light slowly the wands were turned aimed at hearts woman and goddess glowing bright power and joy pour down from thee as we will so mote it be she felt it cool and fluid and strong a flood of energy and light inside her pulsing as that white ball of moon seemed to pulse as it rose gracefully above the trees she could all but see it blueedged silver spurts of light that spun down and into her with the power came a rush of joy it came out of nell in a laughing gasp as mia lowered her wand sometimes its just lovely being a girl isnt it well close the circle now i believe little sister youll find an appropriate outlet for all that fresh energy when she was alone mia put her own energy to use working a protective spell nell had a great deal of natural power largely untapped she could and would help her explore it control it and refine it but there was something more immediate preying on her mind now within the circle within the woods shed seen something nell had not shed watched the single dark cloud slide over the heart of the moon chapter thirteen contents prev next the last weeks of summer passed in a blur days were filled with work with plans for the jobs shed won and proposals for more once the weather turned she would lose the summerpeople aspect of her business so she would be the clever ant nell decided who carefully prepared for winter shed solicit jobs for holiday parties for super bowl sunday for cabin fever victims the islanders were growing so accustomed to calling her for their events small and large it would become strange to do otherwise nights were nearly always spent with zack taking advantage of the final burst of warmth with candlelight dinners alfresco evening sails made brisk from the chill rising from the water long luxurious lovemaking in the cozy nest of her bed once she lit red candles for passion they seemed to work exceptionally well at least two evenings a week she worked with mia on what she thought of as her ritual lessons and at dawn she was baking in her kitchen the life shed always looked for was all around her and more she had a power inside her that ran like silver and love that glowed warm gold there were times she caught him watching her quietly patiently the waiting look each time she did there was a tug of guilt a ripple of unease and each time that she took the cowards way and ignored it she disappointed both of them she could rationalize it she was happy and entitled to a time of peace and pleasure only a year before shed risked her life and would have forfeited it rather than live trapped and afraid for so many months following shed been alone constantly on the move wary of every sound she awakened night after night in cold sweats from dreams she couldnt face even in the dark if shed locked that time in a box and buried the key who had a better right it was the now that mattered and she was giving zack all she could of the now as summer slipped into fall she was convinced of it and of the solidity of her haven on three sisters with her latest kitchen catalogs and her new subscription to saveur under her arm nell walked out of the post office and headed down high street toward the market the summer people had been replaced by tourists eager to view new england foliage at its peak she couldnt blame them wedges of the island were covered with a brilliant patchwork of flaming color every morning she studied the changes from her own kitchen window dreaming into her own woods as the leaves took on fire there were times she walked the beach in the evening just to see the slow roll of fog tumble in swallow water cloak the buoys and muffle the long monotonous bongs mornings a fine glassy frost might glitter on the ground only to melt under the strengthening sun until it beaded on the grass like tears on lashes rains swept in pounded the beaches the cliffs then swept out again until it seemed to her that the whole of the world sparkled like something under a glass dome she was under that dome nell thought safe and secure and away from the world that raged beyond sea and inlet with the brisk wind sneaking up her sweater she waved at familiar faces paused briefly at the crosswalk to check traffic then jogged carelessly into the market for the pork chops she intended to make for dinner pamela stevens on an impromptu visit to the island with her husband donald gave a little cry of surprise and rolled down the window of their rented bmw sedan im not stopping at any of these shops pamela no matter how quaint they are until i find the right place to park ive just seen a ghost pamela dropped back on the seat laid a hand over her heart its witches around here pamela not ghosts no no donald helen remington evan remingtons wife id swear ive just seen her ghost dont know why in gods name she would come all the way out here to haunt anybody cant even find a damn parking lot im not joking the woman couldve been her double except for the hair and the clothes helen wouldnt have been caught dead in that frightful sweater she craned her neck to try to keep the market in sight pull over donald ive just got to go back and get a closer look as soon as i find a parking place it looked just like her pamela repeated so odd and it gave me such a jolt poor helen i was one of the last people who spoke to her before that terrible accident and so you said a hundred times for six months after she drove off the cliff something like that stays with you bristling pamela straightened in her seat sent her nose in the air i was very fond of her she and evan were a beautiful couple she was so young and pretty with everything to live for when something tragic like that happens it reminds you that lives can change with the snap of a finger by the time pamela managed to drag her husband back to the market nell was unpacking her single bag of groceries and trying to decide between couscous and a spicy new sauce she wanted to try out on red potato wedges she decided to decide later and flipping on the portable stereo zack had left at her cottage she settled down with alanis morissette and her issue of saveur while she crunched on an apple from the basket on her table she pulled over her notepad and began to scribble ideas sparked from an article on artichokes she moved from there to a feature on australian wines and noted the writers opinion of the best values the sound of footsteps didnt jolt her now but gave her a warm feeling as she glanced over to watch zack come in a little early for the upholder of law and order to call it a day isnt it i swapped some time with ripley whats in the box a present for me shoving her notebook aside she got up stepped hurriedly to the counter her mouth fell open love and lust tangled and burned inside her a food processor commercial grade top of the line with reverent hands she stroked the box the way some women might stroke mink oh my god according to my mother if a man gives a woman anything that plugs into an electric socket for a gift hed better be fully paid up on his life insurance but i didnt think that rule applied here its the best on the market ive wanted it forever ive seen you ogling it in the catalog a few times he caught her when she launched herself into his arms to cover his face with kisses i guess im not going to need that life insurance i love it i love it i love it she finished with a hard smacking kiss then leaped down to attack the box but its outrageously expensive i shouldnt let you give me an outrageously expensive present right out of the blue but im going to because i cant stand the idea of not having it its rude to turn down a gift and anyway its not out of the blue a day early but i didnt think that mattered happy birthday my birthdays in april but im not arguing because she caught herself the pulse began to throb in her temples hot and hard helen remingtons birthday was in april nell channings was listed clearly on all identification as september nineteenth i dont know what i was thinking slipped my mind because her palms sprang with damp she wiped them hastily on her jeans ive been so busy i forgot about my birthday all of his pleasure of giving her the gift curdled left a sour ball in his belly dont do that keeping things to yourself is one thing lying to my face is another im sorry she bit down hard on her lip tasted shame so am i because he wanted her to look at him he cupped her chin lifted it i keep waiting for you to take the step nell but you dont you sleep with me and you dont hold anything back there you talk to me about what you hope to do tomorrow and you listen when i talk to you but therere no yesterdays hed tried not to dwell on that tried to tell himself as hed told ripley that it wasnt important but now slapped in the face with it he couldnt pretend you let me into your life from the day you stepped onto the island it was true perfectly true what point would there be in denying it for me my life started from there nothing before then matters anymore if it didnt you wouldnt have to lie to me panic wanted to climb into her throat she countered it with a snap of temper what difference does it make if my birthdays tomorrow or a month from now or six months ago why does it have to matter what matters is you dont trust me thats hard on me nell because im in love with you oh zack you cant im in love with you he repeated taking her arms to hold her still and you know it and of course that was perfectly true as well but i dont know what to do about it i dont know what to do with what i feel for you trusting that trusting you its not that simple not for me you want me to accept that but you dont want to tell me why its not that simple play fair nell i cant a tear spilled over shimmered down her cheek im sorry if thats the way it is were both fooling ourselves he let her go and walked away knocking on zacks front door was one of the hardest things nell had ever done shed spent so much time stepping back from anger now she would have to face it head on and with little defense this was a turmoil shed caused and only she could resolve it she walked to the front of the house because it seemed more formal than strolling across the beach and up the stairs to the back before she knocked she rubbed her fingers over the turquoise stone shed slipped into her pocket to aid her verbal communication though she wasnt convinced such things worked she didnt see how it could make her situation any worse she lifted her hand cursed herself as she lowered it again there was an old rocker on the front porch and a pot of geraniums that were frostburned and pathetic she wished shed seen them before the weather had turned so she could have urged zack to carry them inside and she was stalling she squared her shoulders knocked was torn between relief and despair when no one answered just as shed given up and turned away the door swung open ripley stood in leggings cropped just below the knee and a tshirt marked with a vee of sweat between her breasts she gave nell one long cool stare then leaned on the doorjamb wasnt sure i heard anyone knock i was lifting and had the music up i was hoping to talk to zack yeah i figured you pissed him off good it takes work to do that me ive had years of practice but you must have an innate talent for it nell slipped her hand in her pocket fingered the stone she would have to get through the shield to get to the target i know hes angry with me and he has a right to be dont i have a right to apologize sure but if you do it with choking little sobs and flutters youre going to piss me off im a lot meaner than zack i dont intend to cry and flutter nells own temper bubbled up as she stepped forward and i dont think zack would appreciate you getting in the middle of this i know i dont good for you satisfied ripley shifted to let nell in hes up on the back deck brooding through his telescope and drinking a beer but before you go up and say whatever you have to say to him im going to tell you something he couldve looked into your background picked the pieces apart i would have but hes got standards personal standards so he didnt the guilt that had settled on her since hed walked out her door took on more weight he wouldve considered that rude right i dont mind being rude so you square this with him or deal with me understood i like you and i respect someone who takes care of business but when you mess with a todd you dont get off free fair warning ripley turned toward the stairs leading to the second floor help yourself to a beer on the way through the kitchen ive got to finish my reps nell skipped the beer though shed have relished a tall glass of ice water to ease the burn in her throat she walked through the comfortably untidy living room through the equally untidy kitchen and took the outside steps up to the deck he sat in a big chair faded to gray by the weather a bottle of sam adams nestled between his thighs and his scope tilted starward he knew she was there but didnt acknowledge her the scent of her was peaches and nerves youre angry with me and i deserve it but youre too fair not to listen i might work my way up to fair by tomorrow youd be smarter to wait ill risk it she wondered if he knew how much it meant how much he meant that she would risk it i lied ive lied often and ive lied well and id do it again the choice was between honesty and survival for me it still is so im not going to tell you everything you need to know everything you deserve to know im sorry if two people dont trust each other theyve got no business being together thats easy for you to say zack when he shifted his gaze from the stars to hers and the heat of it scorched her she stepped closer her heart throbbed she didnt fear that he would strike her but she did fear that hed never want to touch her again no damn it it is easy for you youve got your place here youve always had it and you dont have to question it or fight for it if ive got a place he said in careful measured tones ive had to earn it the same as anyone thats different because you started on a foundation a solid one and built from there these past few months ive been working to earn a place here i have earned it but its different okay maybe it is but you and i started on the same ground nell when it comes to what we were making together were making she thought not are making if this was his line she could stand where she was keep on her side of it or take the first step over it wasnt any harder she decided than driving off a cliff i was with a man for three years i was with a man who hurt me not just the slaps and the shoves those kinds of bruises dont last but others do she had to let out a little breath to ease the pressure in her chest he systematically chipped away at my confidence my selfesteem my courage and my choices and he did it so skillfully they were gone before i realized what was happening its not easy to rebuild those things and im still working on it coming here just walking over here tonight took everything ive managed to store up i shouldnt have gotten involved with you and i didnt intend to but something about being here and about being with you made me feel normal again thats the start of a fine speech why dont you sit down and just talk to me i did what i had to do to get away from him im not going to apologize for it im not asking you to im not going into the details she turned away leaned on the rail and stared out at the nightdark sea ill tell you it was like living in a pit that got deeper and deeper and colder and colder whenever i tried to crawl out he was right there but you found a way i wont go back whatever i have to do wherever i have to run i wont go back so ive lied and deceived ive broken the law and ive hurt you she turned back the only thing im sorry for is the last she said it defiantly almost furiously as she stood with her back to the rail and her hands in whiteknuckled fists terror and courage he thought dragging at each other inside her did you think i wouldnt understand zack she lifted her hands dropped them i still dont understand i wasnt a doormat when i met him i wasnt a victim waiting to be exploited i came from a solid steady family as functional as any family manages to be i was educated independent helping to run a business thered been men in my life before nothing really serious but normal healthy relationships then there i was manipulated and abused and trapped oh baby he thought as he had when shed fallen to pieces in the café kitchen why are you still blaming yourself for it the question broke her rhythm for a moment she could only stare at him baffled i dont know she walked over to sit in the chair beside him itd be a good next step to stop doing that he said it easily taking a sip of his beer there was still temper inside him dregs of it for nell but a new and ripe well of it for the man the faceless nameless entity whod scarred her he thought he might work that off later by pounding the hell out of ripleys punching bag why dont you tell me about your family he suggested and offered her the beer you know my mother cant cook worth a damn and my father likes to take snapshots with his new toy you know they grew up here on the island got married and had a couple of kids and youve had personal acquaintance with my sister my father was in the army he was a lieutenant colonel an army brat since she shook her head at the beer he took another pull himself saw some of the world didnt you yeah we moved around a lot he always liked getting new orders something new to handle i suppose he was a good man very steady with a wonderful warm laugh he liked old marx brothers movies and reeses peanut butter cups oh god grief caught her by the throat choked off her voice dug raw wounds in her stomach hes been gone so long i dont know how it could seem like yesterday when you love somebody its always there i still think about my grandmother now and again he took nells hand held it loosely when i do i can smell her lavender water and peppermint she died when i was fourteen how was it he could understand and so exactly that she thought was the magic of him my father was killed in the gulf war i thought he was invincible hed always seemed to be everyone said he was a good soldier but i remember he was a good father he would always listen if i needed to tell him something he was honest and fair and had this code of honor a personal one that meant more than all the rules and regulations he god she turned her head to study zacks face it just hit me how much youre like him he would have approved of you sheriff todd im sorry i never got the chance to meet him he turned the scope toward her why dont you take a look see what you can find up there she lowered her head toward the viewer scanned the stars youve forgiven me lets say weve made some progress good thing for me otherwise ripley was going to kick my ass and shes a hell of an asskicker too she loves you i always wanted a brother or a sister my mother and i were tight and i guess we got tighter after we lost my father but i always wanted a sister youdve liked my mother she was tough and smart and full of fun started her own business from the ground up after she was widowed and she made it work sounds like someone else i know her lips curved my father always said i took after her zack who i am now is who i was before the three years between they were the aberration you wouldnt recognize the person i became during that lost time i barely do maybe you had to go through it to get where you are now maybe the light through the scope haloed as her eyes misted i feel like i was always headed here all those moves when i was growing up id look around and think no this isnt it not yet the day i crossed over on the ferry and i saw the island floating on the water i knew this is my place he lifted their joined hands kissed the back of hers the day i saw you behind the counter in the café i knew the thrill rocketed up her arm and straight into her heart ive got baggage zack ive got complications more than i can tell you you matter to me more than i thought anyone ever could i dont want to mess up your life with my problems from where im sitting nell its too late to worry about that im in love with you another long thrill rippled through her theres so much you dont know and any one piece of it could change your mind you dont think much of my wherewithal oh yes i do okay she pulled her hand away rose she faced crises better on her feet theres something else i can tell you and i dont expect you to understand or accept it youre a kleptomaniac no an agent for a clandestine splinter group she managed to laugh no zack wait i get one more youre one of those star trek addicts who can recite all the dialogue in every episode no only in the first season of the original well thats all right then okay i give up im a witch oh well i know that im not using that as a euphemism for temperament she said impatiently i mean it literally spells and charms and that sort of thing a witch yeah i got that the night you were dancing naked on your front lawn and glowing like a candle nell ive lived on three sisters all my life do you expect me to be stupefied or to do that crossedfingers thing to ward off evil unsure if she was relieved or disappointed by his reaction she frowned at him i guess i expected you to be something it gave me a moment he admitted but then living with rip sort of tones down the jolt of course she hasnt had anything to do with that kind of thing for years now if you were to tell me youd put some sort of love spell on me i might be a little irked of course i didnt i wouldnt even know how im just learning an apprentice witch then amused at both of them he got to his feet i imagine miall whip you into shape before long did nothing surprise the man a couple of nights ago i drew down the moon what the hell does that mean no never mind i dont have much of a head for the metaphysical im a simple man nell he ran his hands up and down her arms in the way he had that managed to arouse and soothe at the same time no youre not simple enough to know im standing here with a pretty woman and wasting the moonlight he lowered his mouth to hers drew her up and into a sumptuous kiss when her head fell back in surrender and her arms wound around his neck he circled her toward the glass door i want to take you to bed my bed i want to love you the army brat who takes after her mother he slid the door open drew her inside i do love you here she thought as they lowered to the bed was truth and here was compassion he would give these to her as much as desire as much as need when he touched her those thrills those soft and fluid aches were welcome the yearning shed felt for home was satisfied slow and sweet she moved with him freely she opened for him baring her heart as well as her body her skin hummed under the brush of his fingers the long liquid pull inside her made her sigh when her mouth met his again she poured all she had into the kiss what she couldnt give him in words she could give him here with her heart with her body he skimmed his lips over her shoulder tracing the shape of it marveling at the firmness of muscle the delicacy of bone the taste of her intoxicated him a flavor hed come to crave as much as the next breath of air he found her breast pleasured them both with lips and teeth and tongue until her heart began to beat under his mouth like the endless pulse of the sea and as that beat quickened she rose beneath him with a single breathless gasp without hurry he moved down her a skim of fingers a brush of lips felt her begin to tremble while his own blood pounded in sharp anvil strikes of need her hands groped then fisted desperately in the sheets when he lifted her hips and used his mouth on her with a kind of ruthless patience he shot her screaming to peak her breath was sobbing now her skin slick and damp as she rolled with him over the tangled sheets heat spiked seemed to throb in the air under her skin until her body felt like a furnace stoked too high zack not yet not yet he was wild for her for the taste of flesh the urgency of her hands in the pale splash of moonlight through the glass her body seemed unearthly white marble erotically hot to the touch and glimmering with the healthy sweat of lust when he fixed his teeth on her neck it felt like feeding her mouth was wild her body plunging then she cried out again shocked pleasure when his fingers drove her relentlessly over the edge beyond control beyond reason she moved like lightning she would have sworn the bed spun in fast dizzy circles as she straddled him panting she took him rode him drove him as he had driven her curved down to him she ravished his mouth then flung herself back arms bowed behind her head and flew as power whipped through her he reached for her his fingers sliding helplessly down her busy hips his blood was a rage his mind a torrent for a moment all he could see was her eyes flameblue and vivid as jewels he reared up pressed his lips to her heart and shattered chapter fourteen contents prev next ripley stopped her cruiser and watched nell unpack her car the sun had gone down and with the cold snap that had slapped the island with a wicked northeast punch any tourists were snuggled into the hotel sipping hot drinks most of the natives would be sensibly settled in front of the television or finishing up dinner she was looking forward to engaging in both those activities herself but she hadnt managed a oneonone with nell since the evening shed come to the door youre either getting a very late start or a really early one ripley called out nell hefted the box and hunched inside the fleecelined jacket shed mailordered from the mainland a second start the book club that mia runs is back from its summer break first meetings tonight oh yeah ripley got out of the car she was wearing an ancient and wellloved bomber jacket and hiking boots her summerweight ball cap had been replaced by one of plain black wool need a hand i wouldnt turn one down happy that she sensed no lingering animosity nell gestured with her elbow to the second box refreshments for the meeting are you going not a chance dont like to read no i like to read i just dont like groups groups are made up of members she explained and members are almost always people so there you go people you know nell pointed out which gives my stand a firmer base this groups a bunch of hens wholl spend as much time pecking at the latest gossip as they will discussing whatever book they used as an excuse to get out of the house for the evening how do you know that if you dont belong to the club lets just say i have a sixth sense about these things all right nell adjusted the balance of her box as they walked toward the rear entrance despite the weather mias salvia hung on as red and sassy as july is that why you dont accept the craft because its like joining a group that would be reason enough added to that i dont like being told i have to fall in line with something that started three hundred years before i was born a blast of wind blew her ponytail into a thick dark whip she ignored it and the cold fingers that tried to sneak under her jacket i figure whatever needs to be dealt with can and should be dealt with without cackling over a cauldron and i dont like having people wondering if im going to come flying by on my broom wearing a pointy black hat i cant argue with the first two reasons nell opened the door stepped into the welcome warmth but the second two dont hold ive never once heard mia cackle over a cauldron or otherwise and ive never seen anyone look at her as if they expected her to jump on a broom wouldnt surprise me if she did ripley strode into the main store nodded at lulu lu rip lulu continued setting up the folding chairs joining us tonight are they holding the ice capades in hell not that ive heard she sniffed the air do i smell gingerbread got it in one nell told her is there any special way you want the refreshments set up youre the expert there mias upstairs yet if she doesnt like the way youve done it shell tell you nell carried the box to the table that was already waiting shed made some pricks in lulus shell but had yet to crack all the way through it was she admitted becoming a personal challenge do you think i can stay for some of the discussion lulu peered narrowly over the tops of her glasses you read the book damn nell took out the plate of gingerbread first hoping the scent would sweeten her chances well no i didnt know about the club until last week and a persons got an hour a day that can be put to reading i dont care how busy they are oh stop being such a bitch lulu nells jaw dropped at ripleys command but the sidelong look she risked showed her lulus reaction was a happy grin i cant it goes down to the bone you can stay if this one stays she jerked a thumb at ripley im not interested in hanging out with a bunch of females chattering about a book and whos sleeping with who who shouldnt be besides i havent had my dinner cafés open another ten minutes lulu told her split pea and ham soup was good today and itll do you good to spend some time with females explore your inner woman ripley snorted but the idea of the soup in fact any food that she wasnt obliged to fix herself held tremendous appeal my inner woman doesnt need any exploration shes lean and mean but ill check out the soup she sauntered toward the steps i might stay for the first twenty minutes she called back but if i do i want first crack at that gingerbread lulu nell arranged starshaped cookies on a glass plate what ill call you a bitch if itll help bring us closer as people willing to explore our inner woman lulu gave a snort of her own youve got a quick mouth on you when you want to you carry your weight and you keep your word that goes a way with me i also make superior gingerbread lulu walked over picked up a slice ill be the judge of that see that you read octobers book before the next discussion nells dimples flickered i will upstairs ripley annoyed peg by demanding a bowl of soup minutes before closing ive got a date so if you dont finish this before my times up youll just have to wash the bowl yourself i can dump it in the sink the same as you would for nell to deal with in the morning give me a hot chocolate to go with it are you still stepping out with mick burmingham thats right were snugging in and having a video festival were watching scream one two and three very sexy if you want to take off i wont snitch to mia peg didnt hesitate thanks she whipped off her apron im gone appreciating the fact that the café was empty ripley settled down to enjoy her soup in blissful solitude nothing could have spoiled her pleasure more quickly than hearing the click of mias heels on the floor barely one minute later wheres peg i cut her loose hot date i dont appreciate you giving my employees permission to leave early the café doesnt close for another four minutes and its part of her job description to clean the case counters and kitchen after that time well i booted her along so you can kick my ass instead of hers intrigued ripley continued to spoon up soup as she studied mia it was a rare event to see the cool ms devlin heated up and jittery she was twisting the chain of the amulet she wore around her neck continued to worry it as she strode over to the display counter and hissed there are health regulations about cleanliness in food services since you were so generous to peg you can damn well scrub this up yourself in a pigs eye ripley muttered but felt a tug of guilt that threatened to spoil her appetite what bug crawled up your butt i have a business to run here and it takes more than stalking around the village looking cocky which is your specialty oh get fucked mia itll improve your humor mia rounded back unlike you fucking isnt my answer to every whim and itch you want to play the ice maiden because sam logan dumped you thats your ripley trailed off despising herself even as the hot color in mias face drained sorry out of line way out of line forget it when i sucker punch somebody i apologize even if you did come in here looking for a fight in fact ill not only apologize ill ask you whats wrong what the hell do you care normally i dont but normally i dont see you spooked whats the deal theyd been friends once and good ones as close as any sisters because of that it was harder for mia to sit to open up than it would have been if ripley had been a stranger but the matter was more important than feuds or grudges she sat across from ripley leveled her gaze theres blood on the moon oh for before ripley could finish mias hand shot out gripped her wrist trouble bad trouble is coming a dark force you know me well enough to be sure i wouldnt say it wouldnt tell you of all people unless i was sure and you know me well enough to know what i think of portents and omens but there was a cold chill working up her spine its coming after the leaves finish dying before the first snow im sure of that too but i cant see what it is or where it comes from somethings blocking it it disturbed ripley when mias eyes went that deep that dark it seemed you could see a thousand years in them any trouble comes to the island zack and i will handle it itll take more ripley zack loves nell and you love him theyre at the center of this i feel it if you dont flex something will break something none of us can put right again i cant do whatever needs to be done alone and nell isnt ready yet i cant help you that way wont cant or wont comes out to the same thing yes it does mia said as she got to her feet there wasnt temper sparking her eyes that would have been easy to fight there was weariness deny what you are lose what you are i sincerely hope you dont regret it mia went downstairs to greet her book club and deal with the business at hand alone ripley rested her chin on her fist it was a guilt trip that was all when mia wasnt shooting out spiteful little darts she heaped on layers of sticky guilt ripley wasnt falling for it if there was a red haze over the moon it was due to some atmospheric quirk and had nothing to do with her she would leave the omens and portents to mia since she enjoyed them so much she shouldnt have dropped in tonight shouldnt have put herself in a position where mia could try to pin her all they did was annoy each other it had been that way for more than a decade but not always theyd been friends next to inseparable friends until theyd teetered on the cusp of adulthood ripley remembered her mother had called them twins of the heart theyd shared everything and maybe that was the problem it was natural for interests to diverge when people grew up natural for childhood friends to drift apart not that she and mia had drifted she admitted it had been more like a sword slash down the center of their friendship abrupt and violent but shed had the right to go her own way shed been right to go her own way and she wasnt going back now just because mia was jittery over some atmospheric hitch even if mia was right and trouble was coming it would be dealt with through the rules and obligations of the law and not with spellbinding she had put away her childish things the toys and the tools she had no further interest in that had been sensible mature when people looked at her now they saw ripley todd deputy a dependable responsible woman who did her job they didnt see some flaky island priestess who would brew them a potion to beef up their sex lives irritated because even her thoughts sounded defensive and nasty she gathered up her dishes and took them into the kitchen there was just enough guilt still pricking at her to oblige her to rinse the dishes load them in the dishwasher scrub out the sink that she decided paid her debt she could hear the voices all female flowing back from the front of the store where the book club gathered she could smell the incense mia lit a scent for protection ripley snuck out the back a fleet of steamrollers couldnt have pushed her forward and into that noisy clutch of women now just outside the back door she saw the fat black candle burning a charm to repel evil she would have sneered at it but her gaze was drawn up the waning globe of the moon was shrouded in a thin and bloody mist unable to work up that sneer she jammed her hands in her jacket pockets and stared down at her own boots as she walked to her car when the last of the book club members were out the door mia flipped the locks nell was already clearing plates and napkins while lulu closed the register that was fun stoneware rang gaily as nell stacked coffee cups and so interesting ive never discussed a book that way whenever i read one i just think well i liked it or i didnt but i never talked about why and i promise to read next months selection so ill have something to contribute ill see to the dishes nell you must be tired im not nell lifted a loaded tray there was so much energy in here tonight i feel like i just lapped it up isnt zack waiting for you oh not tonight i told him i was going to crash the party lulu waited until nell was upstairs whats wrong she asked mia im not entirely sure to keep her hands busy mia began folding the chairs thats what concerns me most somethings coming and i cant pin it down its all right for tonight she glanced up the stairs as she carted chairs to the storeroom shes all right for tonight shes the center lulu stored her own haul of chairs i guess i felt that all along and didnt cut her much of a break but the fact is thats a sweet girl who works hard does somebody want to hurt her someone already has and i dont intend to let him do it again ill try a foretelling but i need to prepare for it i need to clear my mind theres time i cant tell how much but itll have to be enough will you tell her not just yet shell have her own preparations her own cleansing to do shes in love and that makes her strong shell need to be what makes you strong mia purpose love never worked for me i heard hes in new york mia shrugged a deliberate gesture she knew who lulu meant and it irritated her to have sam logan tossed at her twice in one night its a big city she said flatly hell have plenty of company i want to finish and go home i need sleep idiot man lulu muttered under her breath there were too many idiot men in the world to her way of thinking and most of them ended up bumping up against stubborn women spells were nell decided really just a kind of recipe and there she was on solid ground a recipe required time care and quality ingredients in proper proportions for success add a bit of imagination and it became a personal dish she set aside time between jobs and book work to study the spell book mia had lent her she imagined mia would be amused by the idea of viewing it as a kind of metaphysical cookbook but she didnt think she would be offended time also had to be carved out for meditation visualization for gathering and creating her own tools so that shed have what she liked to consider a wellsupplied witchs pantry but now she intended to reward herself with her first solo practice session love spells banishing spells protection spells she chanted as she flipped through binding spells money spells healing spells something for everybody she thought and remembered mias warning about being careful what she wished for a careless or selfish wish could boomerang in unpleasant or certainly unexpected ways she would keep it simple choosing something that involved no one and couldnt inadvertently cause harm or trouble she used her broom first sweeping the negative energy away then she set it by the kitchen door to prevent any reentry with diego ribboning between her legs she chose her candles inscribed them with the appropriate symbols deciding that she could use all the help she could get she selected crystals to bolster the energy she arranged them and the pot of frostburned geraniums shed taken from zacks front porch expelled a breath drew in fresh she referred back to the healing spell mia had written out on parchment in india ink and closing her eyes adjusted the words in her mind to suit her purpose here goes she whispered this damaged bloom i seek to heal from its withered petals fresh beauty reveal um its blooming time was too soon done its color brings pleasure to all and harm to no one set the flower within it free as i will so mote it be she bit her lip waited the geranium sat stubbornly wilted in its pot nell bent over looking close for some little sign of green she straightened again shoot i guess im not ready to solo but maybe she should try again she needed to visualize to see the plant lush and full and blooming she needed to smell leaves and petals channel her energy or was it the plants energy in any case giving up after one try made her a pretty wimpy witch she closed her eyes again started to process then yelped at the brisk knock on her back door she spun around so quickly she booted diego halfway across the little room which caused him to plop down and begin to wash himself as if that was what hed intended all along chuckling nell opened the door to ripley i was cruising by saw the candlelight are you having power trouble even as she asked she looked past nell and saw the ritual candles on the table oh practicing and from the results i need a lot more come on in i dont want to interrupt since the night of the book club meeting shed made a point to stop by or at least cruise by every evening isnt that the dead plant from our front porch its not dead yet but its close i asked zack if i could try to bring it back working spells on dead geraniums man you slay me i figured if i made any mistakes it couldnt hurt anything do you want some tea i brewed some just a while ago well maybe zack said to let you know hed be by when he finished up we had a d and d drunk and disorderly she explained underage minor hes just about sicked up all of the sixpack he swiped from his parents refrigerator zacks walking him home anyone i know the stubens boy the oldest his girlfriend dumped him yesterday so he decided to cry in his daddys beer since the result was him getting sick as three dogs i think hell look for another way to ease his broken heart next time out whats that smell ive got a pork loin roasting youre welcome to stay for dinner id just as soon not sit here and watch you two make googly eyes at each other but i wouldnt mind you sending a doggie bag home with zack happy to she handed ripley a cup of tea but we dont make googly eyes at each other do so nell got a plate of tiny appetizers out of the fridge man do you guys eat like this every night ripley asked i practice on zack lucky bastard ripley helped herself to a little wedge of bruschetta anything he doesnt go for you can send on to me ill let you know if its any good thats generous of you try a stuffed mushroom zack wont touch them doesnt know what hes missing ripley announced after one bite the catering deals moving along pretty well huh it is but nell dreamed of a convection oven and a subzero refrigerator impossible and impractical in her cozy cottage kitchen she reminded herself and for the moment out of sisters caterings financial grasp im doing sandwiches and cake for a christening on saturday the new burmingham baby right and lulus sister and family from baltimore are coming in next week lulu wants to wow them theres some sibling rivalry there nell jerked a thumb toward the oven im making this pork loin so i wanted to try it out first thats going some for lu she squeezes a penny until lincoln weeps we worked out a deal a barter shes knitting me a couple of sweaters i can use them with winter coming weve got a warm spell coming well snag a bit of indian summer before it hits i hope youre right so ripley bent down picked up diego hows mia doing shes fine she seems a little distracted lately nell lifted her eyebrows why do you ask no reason i guess shes busy making plans for halloween she really gets into it were going to decorate the store the week of the first im warned that every kid on the island hits café book for trick or treat who can resist candy from the witch id better go she gave diego a quick scratch as she set him down zackll be along any minute i can take that pot out of your way if you she trailed off as she glanced over a glory of crimson petals covered healthy green stalks well well son of a bitch i did it it worked oh oh in one leap nell was at the table her nose buried in blooms i cant believe it i mean i wanted to believe it but i didnt really think i could manage it not by myself isnt it lovely yeah its okay she knew what it was like the rush of power that bright thrill the pleasures both small and huge ripley felt an echo of it now as nell lifted the pot high and circled its not all flowers and moonbeams nell what happened nell lowered the pot cradled it like a baby what happened to make you resent what you have i dont resent it i just dont want it ive been powerless this is better whats better isnt being able to make flowers bloom its being able to take care of yourself you didnt need a spell book to figure out how to do that one doesnt have to be exclusive of the other maybe not but lifes a hell of a lot easier when they are she walked to the door opened it dont leave your candles unattended by the time zack arrived nell had the table cleared and set the kitchen was fragrant with her roast and the aftermath of her candles she liked hearing him come to the kitchen door those long strides the way he stopped and wiped his feet on the mat the rush of brisk air he let in when he opened the door and the easy smile he gave her as he kept on walking until his mouth covered hers later than i expected its all right ripley stopped by and told me you would be then i guess i dont need these he took the bouquet of carnations from behind his back no but i do she gathered them up thanks i thought wed try this australian wine i read about if you want to open it fine he turned to shrug out of his jacket and hang it on the kitchen peg his gaze hit the pot of geraniums shed set on the side counter it gave him a little jolt but after the briefest hesitation he went on and pegged his jacket i dont guess you did that with fertilizer no she linked her fingers together around the carnation stems i didnt does it bother you not bother but talking about it even knowing about its different than seeing it at home in her kitchen he pulled open a drawer for a corkscrew in any case you dont have to smooth out every ripple with me i love you zack he stood the corkscrew in one hand the bottle of wine in the other and suddenly couldnt move emotions overwhelmed him its been hard waiting for you to say that to me i couldnt say it before why now because you brought me carnations because i dont have to smooth out every ripple with you because when i hear you coming up to my door everything inside me lifts and sighs and because love is the most vital magic i want to give mine to you he set the wine and corkscrew aside carefully stepped over to her gently he stroked his hands across her cheeks into her hair ive waited my whole life for you tenderly he kissed her forehead her cheeks i want to spend the rest of it with you she ignored the clutch in her belly and concentrated on the joy lets give each other the now every minutes precious she laid her head on his shoulder every minute counts chapter fifteen contents prev next evan remington wandered the palatial rooms of his monterey home bored restless he studied his possessions each one had been selected with care either by him personally or by a decorator following explicit instructions he had always known precisely what he preferred and precisely what he wanted hed always made certain to obtain it whatever the cost whatever the effort everything that surrounded him reflected his taste a taste admired by associates peers and those whose goal it was to fall into either category and everything dissatisfied him he considered an auction he could find some currently trendy charity and generate some nice press while he disposed of items he no longer wanted he could let it leak that he was disposing of those items because they held too many painful memories of his dead wife the lovely lost helen he even considered selling the house the fact was it did remind him of her it wasnt a problem in los angeles she hadnt died in los angeles since her accident he had seldom come to monterey it was rare for him to stay more than a few days and he always came alone he didnt consider the servants they fell along the same lines as the furnishings to him necessary and efficient the first time hed come back hed been raw with grief hed wept like a madman while lying across the bed hed last shared with her clinging to the nightgown shed worn breathing in the scent of her his love was consuming and his pain threatened to eat him alive she had belonged to him when the torrent had passed hed wandered the house like a ghost touching what she had touched hearing her voice echo in his ears catching a whiff of her scent everywhere as if it was inside him hed spent an hour in her closet caressing her clothes and forgetting the night he had locked her in there when shed been late coming home he wallowed in her and when he could stand the confinement of the house no longer hed driven to the site of her death and had stood a solitary figure weeping on the cliffs his doctor prescribed medication and rest his friends encircled him with sympathy he began to enjoy it within a month hed forgotten he had insisted that helen make the trip to big sur that day in his mind in the cradle of his memory he saw himself entreating her not to attend to stay home and rest until she was well again of course she hadnt listened she had never listened grief turned to fury a raging flood of anger that he drowned with liquor and solitude shed betrayed him going out against his wishes insisting on attending some frivolous party rather than respecting her husbands request she had left him unforgivably alone but even rage passes the hole it left in him he filled with a fantasy of her of their marriage even of himself he heard people speak of them as a perfect couple cruelly parted by tragedy he read it thought it believed it he wore one of her earrings on a chain next to his heart and let the affectation leak to a suitable media source it was said gable did the same when hed lost lombard he kept her clothes in her closets her books on the shelves her perfumes in their bottles he had an angel of white marble erected for her in the cemetery where no body lay every week a dozen red roses were placed at its feet to keep himself sane he threw himself into his work he began to sleep again without so many dreams in which helen came to him gradually at the urging of friends he began to go out again socially but the women eager to comfort the widower didnt interest him he dated only because it kept him in the press he bedded a few of the women only because there would be talk otherwise of an unflattering sort sex had never driven him control had he had no wish ever to marry again there would never be another helen they had been destined for each other shed been meant for him meant to be molded and formed by him if hed had to punish her occasionally well discipline was part of the formation hed had to teach her finally in their last few weeks together he had believed she had learned it had been a rare thing for her to make a mistake in public or private shed deferred to him as a wife was meant to defer to a husband and had made certain that he was pleased with her he remembered or convinced himself that he remembered that hed been about to reward her with a trip to antigua she had been fascinated by the ocean his helen and had told him during those first heady weeks of love and discovery how she sometimes dreamed of living on an island in the end the sea had taken her because he could feel the depression rolling into him like a fog he poured a glass of mineral water and took one of his pills no he wouldnt sell the house he decided in one of his lightning mood changes he would open it he would give one of the lavish alist parties the kind he and helen had hosted so often and so successfully it would feel as if she were there beside him as she was meant to be when the phone rang he ignored it and continued to stand gently rubbing an etched gold hoop earring through the fine linen of his shirt sir ms reece is on the phone shed like to speak with you if youre available saying nothing evan held out a hand for the portable phone he never glanced at the uniformed maid who gave it to him but slid open the terrace door and stepped outside in the balm of breeze to speak to his sister yes barbara evan im glad you were in deke and i were hoping youd join us at the club this afternoon we can have a set of tennis lunch by the pool i hardly see my baby brother these days he started to refuse his sisters country club circle held little interest for him but he reconsidered quickly knowing how well barbara planned entertainment and how much of the annoyance of the details she would willingly take from his hands id like that i want to speak to you anyway he glanced at his rolex why dont i meet you there eleventhirty absolutely perfect prepare yourself ive been working on my backhand his tennis game was off barbara had broken his serve yet again and was prancing around like a fool in her designer tennis skirt of course she had time to fritter around any fucking day of the week making time with some slickfingered tennis pro while her asshole husband practiced his putting he on the other hand was a busy man with a demanding business and highpowered clients who whined like babies if he didnt give them his full attention he didnt have time for goddamn games he bulleted one over the net gritted his teeth audibly when barbara hustled and returned it sweat dampened his face ran down his back and his mouth peeled back in a snarl as he raced over the court it was a look nell would have recognized one she would have feared barbara recognized it as well and instinctively bungled a return youre killing me she called out and shook her head as she took her time going back to position evan had always been temperamental she thought it was hard for him not to win not to get his way it always had been as a child his retribution had come in one of two forms icy silence that could bore holes in steel or quick hot violence youre older her mother had said always be a good girl be a good sister let the baby win it was such an old and ingrained habit she barely registered her decision to blow the next return as well and after all the afternoon would be so much more pleasant if he won the match why cause contention over a tennis game so burying her own competitive spirit she took a dive surrendering the game his expression changed almost instantly good game evan i never could keep up with you she sent him an indulgent smile as they positioned themselves for the next boys hate to lose to girls she thought it was another of her mothers homilies and what were men but big boys by the time it was over and hed won the match he was in a fine mood he felt loose and limber and affectionate he swung an arm over barbaras shoulders bussed her cheek your backhand still needs some work there was a little bubble of annoyance in her throat automatically swallowed yours is lethal she picked up her bag and since you humiliated me you get to buy lunch ill meet you on the lounge terrace thirty minutes she kept him waiting always a minor irritation but it pleased him to see how attractive she was how well presented he detested sloppy attire or unkempt hair on a woman and barbara never disappointed him she was four years his senior but could have passed for thirtyfive her skin was pampered and taut her hair sleek and glossy and her figure trim she joined him under the shade of the umbrella smelling subtly of her favored white diamonds im going to console myself with a champagne cocktail she crossed legs garbed in thin raw silk between that and sitting with the most handsome man in the club my mood should immediately improve and i was just thinking what a beautiful woman i have for a sister her face lit up you always say the sweetest things it was true she thought he did when he won it made her all the more pleased that shed tanked the match lets not wait for deke she said still beaming at him lord knows when hell finish his game she ordered her cocktail and a cobb salad moaning dramatically when evan selected shrimp scampi oh i hate you for your metabolism you never gain an ounce im going to have a bite of yours then curse you when im tortured tomorrow by my personal trainer a little more discipline barbara and youd keep your figure without paying someone to make you sweat believe me shes worth every penny the sadist with a contented sigh she sat back careful to keep her face out of the sun tell me darling what did you want to talk to me about im going to give a party at the monterey house its time to yes she leaned forward again to cover his hand with hers squeezed yes it is time im so glad to see you looking well again evan to hear you making plans you went through such a horrible time tears welled and her affection for him was such that she blinked them back thinking not of her mascara but of his sensibilities he detested public scenes youve begun to move on in the past few months thats healthy helen would have wanted that youre right of course he eased his hand away as their drinks were served he didnt like being touched casually of course was one thing in the business world hugs and kisses were just another tool but he detested being touched with intensity i havent entertained not really since it happened business affairs of course but helen and i planned every detail of our parties together she handled so much of it the invitations the menu all subject to my approval of course i was hoping i could impose on you to help me of course i will you just tell me what you have in mind and when i went to a party just last week very lavish and fun ill steal some ideas it was pamela and donald pamelas often a pain in the neck but she does know how to throw a party speaking of her i feel i should tell you and i hope it doesnt upset you im afraid youll hear it from someone else what is it pamelas been nattering you know how she is evan could barely picture the woman about what she and donald took a holiday out east a couple of weeks ago cape cod primarily though she talked him into driving about and staying at a few bedandbreakfasts like nomads she claims while they were out there sightseeing in some little village or other she saw a woman who looked just like helen evans hand vised on his glass what do you mean she cornered me at her party went on and on about it claimed that at first glance she thought shed seen a ghost in fact she was so insistent about how this apparition might have been poor helens double she asked me if helen had a sister i told her no of course i imagine she caught a glimpse of some fineboned blonde about helens age and enhanced the whole thing in her mind the way shes going on about it i didnt want you to hear some rumor that would cause you any pain the womans an idiot well shes certainly imaginative barbara said now that weve gotten that out of the way tell me how many people youre planning to invite two hundred twofifty he said absently just where did pamela claim to see this ghost of hers oh some island off the east coast im not even sure of the name as i was busy trying to change the subject something about sisters formal or casual what the party honey formal or casual formal he murmured and let his sisters voice buzz in his head like bees lulu lived in a saltbox two blocks back from high street it stood out from its more conservative neighbors with its lipstickred shutters and porch on that red porch was a glider splattered and streaked with a rainbow of paint in a mad pattern that rivaled a jackson pollock canvas a purple gazing ball stood on the thin swath of lawn and shaded a gargoyle who squatted permanently sticking out his tongue at passersby a winged dragon of iridescent green flew on the roof as a weather vane along with a wildly striped wind sock in the short driveway sat a dignified latemodel sedan in practical black and lulus dayglo orange vw circa love beads from the same era dangled from the rearview mirror following instructions nell parked on the street one house down then hauled her delivery to the back door lulu swung it open before nell could knock ill give you prompt and with this lulu grabbed nells arm just above the elbow and yanked her inside i sent the lot of them out for a walk and dont figure theyll be back for twenty minutes more if im lucky syls been a pain in my butt since she was born your sister my parents insist she is but i have my doubts lulu poked her head in the box the minute nell set it down on the center island the idea that i share blood with that pompous narrowminded pissy little twerp gives me the willies im eighteen months older so we went through the sixties at close to the same pace difference is she remembers them which says it all ah nell tried to imagine lulu as a freewheeling freeloving hippie and found it wasnt that much of a stretch for the family dinner shed donned a sweatshirt that announced she was all out of estrogen and had a gun fair warning nell decided urn still its nice that you sometimes get together like this she just comes out here once every damn year to lord it over me according to the gospel of sylvia a woman isnt a woman unless she has a husband and children chairs some crappy committee and knows how to make an emergency centerpiece out of twine spit and an empty tuna can were going to do a hell of a lot better than that nell busied herself by putting the roast in the oven turning it to warm i made it au jus so you just spoon that over and serve it with the side dishes the autumn salad goes first tell them to leave room for the pumpkin cheesecake thatll totally amaze her lulu poured another glass of the wine she was tippling to get through the event i had a husband she said it so fiercely so viciously that nell turned to stare oh dont know what made me do it legal i wasnt knocked up or anything stupid i guess i did it to prove i could still rebel he was no good just as useless as he was handsome it turned out his idea of marriage was having someplace to go after hed finished boinking whatever floozie caught his fancy that particular night im sorry no need to be sorry live and learn i kicked his ass out in nineteeneightyfive the only time it bothers me is when syl comes around gloating about her husband whos no more than a paper pusher and has a spare tire you could ride on to cleveland her kids who are a couple of snotty teenagers in twohundred dollar track shoes and the joys of her life in the suburbs id rather be shot dead than live in some cookiecutter house in the burbs since either the wine or the situation with syl was making lulu loquacious nell took advantage so you didnt grow up here together hell no we grew up in baltimore i took off when i was seventeen went straight to haightashbury i lived in a commune in colorado for a while traveled experienced when i came here i wasnt yet twenty ive been here over thirtytwo years now god the idea of that had her knocking back the wine and pouring more mias grandmother gave me a job doing this and that for her then when mia came along her mother hired me to mind her when she needed minding carly devlins a nice enough person but the fact was she didnt have much interest in raising a child so you did i didnt realize no wonder nell thought she was so protective of mia whatever your sister thinks youve got a daughter at the heart of it damn right she gave a little nod then set down her glass do whatever you need to do here ill be right back she started out turned back if syl the pill comes back before i do just tell her how you work at the bookstore and stopped in to ask me something about work no problem keeping tabs on the time nell organized the meal slipping the salad and the dressing in the refrigerator sliding the scalloped potatoes and the herbed green beans in with the roast she peeked into the dining room saw the table had yet to be set and hunted out dishes and linens first half of your payment lulu announced as she came back in with a wrinkled shopping bag thanks listen i didnt know what dishes you wanted but i think thesell work well its family and theyre casual and cheerful good thing as thats all ive got lulu waited while nell dipped into the shopping bag then smiled smugly at the gasp of pleasure oh oh lulu it was a simple design a mock turtleneck that could and would be worn with everything but the color was a deep rich blue and the material was as soft as a cloud i never expected anything like this already nell was holding it up rubbing her cheek against the shoulder its absolutely wonderful you wear too many neutrals pleasing herself lulu tugged and fussed then stood back to admire the result they wash the color out of your face this brings it in goes with your coloring i started on the second one nice tunic length in a good strong red i dont know how to thank you i cant wait to try it on and theyre back lulu hissed and immediately began shoving nell toward the door go get you need to toss the salad just before yes yes go nell clutched her new sweater as lulu slammed the door in her face serving she finished and chuckled all the way to the car the minute she got home she stripped off her sweatshirt and slid into the magnificent sweater unable to get a satisfactory view from top to bottom she dragged a chair in front of the mirror and stood on it thered been a time when shed had dozens of sweaters cashmere silk the softest cottons the thinnest wools none of them brought her the sheer joy of this one handmade by a friend or close enough to a friend she thought and payment for a job well done she took it off again folded it lovingly in a drawer she would wear it to work on monday for now the sweatshirt was a better choice she had messy work to do her trio of pumpkins waited on a bed of newspapers on her kitchen table shed already used a portion of the largest for lulus dessert it only waited to be carved into the appropriate design she would make pumpkin bread she thought as she began on the second and pie cookies the hulls would serve as decorations on her front porch big fat scary pumpkins to entertain the neighbors and children she was up to her elbows in pumpkin meat and seeds when zack strolled in the door i get to do the third one he came up behind her wrapping his arms tight nuzzling her neck im a jackolantern master the things you learn about people want me to dump the guts for you dump them how would i make a pie with a can his brow furrowed as he watched her slide chunks of pumpkin into a large bowl you mean you actually use that stuff of course where do you think they get the stuff in the cans i never thought about it pumpkin factory he picked up the knife to start on the third while nell washed her hands youve obviously led a very sheltered life sheriff todd if thats so i cant think of anyone id rather have corrupt me how about when we finish this we take a drive to the windward side sit in my cruiser and break a few laws love to she came back with a magic marker and began to draw a hideous face on the first pumpkin everything quiet in the village it tends to be on sundays this time of year did you get lulu all set i did i didnt realize shed been married once long time ago some drifter who worked on the docks for a bit im told seems to me i heard it didnt last six months i guess it soured her on men because ive never known her to take up with one since she worked for mias grandmother then her mother thats right lus kept the reins on mia as long as i can remember in fact thinking about it lus the only one mias let hold the reins for very long mia had a thing going with sam logan his family owns the hotel it didnt work out and he left the island jesus its been ten years maybe more oh i see sam logan nell thought the man mia had loved once sam and i hung out together some back when we were younger zack went on as he hollowed out the pumpkin weve lost touch but i remember that when sam and mia were seeing each other lulu watched him like a hawk he grinned remembering it then pulled the knife out of the heart of the pumpkin nell saw it gleam in the overhead light she saw it drip she saw as a rushing wind filled her head the blood that stained his shirt his hands and pooled like a red river on the floor at his feet she made no sound at all as she slid bonelessly from the chair hey hey hey come on nell come on back now his voice was dim as if they were both underwater something cool slid over her face she seemed to rise from fathoms deep slowly toward the surface as her eyes opened she saw a white mist that rolled away layer by gauzy layer until she saw his face zack in terror she grabbed at him yanking his shirt to check for wounds her fingers felt fat and fumbling hold on he might have laughed at the way she pulled at his buttons if her face hadnt been deathly white lie back down get your breath blood so much blood ssh his first reaction when shed fainted had been panic and hed dealt with it as he always did by doing what came next hed picked her up carried her to the couch and revived her now the penetrating fear she exuded tied knots in his belly i bet you havent eaten enough to keep a bird alive today have you somebody who cooks as much as you do should learn how to eat regular meals im going to get you a glass of water something to eat if youre not feeling steady then im calling the doctor im not sick im not hurt you were bleeding her hands shook as they ran over him there was blood all over your shirt your hands the floor the knife i saw im not bleeding honey not so much as a nick he lifted his hands turning them to prove it just a trick of the light thats all it wasnt she locked her arms around him held on ferociously i saw it dont touch the knife anymore dont touch it okay he kissed the top of her head stroked her hair i wont everythings all right nell she closed her hand around her locket ran a charm for protection through her head i want you to wear this steadier now she eased back and slipped the chain over her head all the time dont take it off he looked at the carved heart at the end of the chain and had a normal mans reaction i appreciate that nell really i do but thats a girl thing wear it under your shirt she said impatiently no one has to see it i want you to wear it night and day she looped it over his head even as he grimaced i want you to promise me you will anticipating his next protest nell framed his face with her hands it belonged to my mother its the only thing of hers i still have the only thing i brought away with me please do this for me zack promise me you wont take it off not for any reason all right ill promise that if you promise me youll eat something well have pumpkin soup youll like it that night while she slept she ran wildly through the woods unable to find her way in the dark of the moon the scent of blood and death chased her chapter sixteen contents prev next nell put it all out of her mind or tried to and went to work she served coffee and muffins joked with regulars she wore her new blue sweater and stirred the pumpkin soup she had simmering for the lunch crowd she replenished the stack of business cards mia had suggested that she put beside the cafés cash register it was all so normal almost breezy except she reached for the locket she no longer wore a dozen times through the morning each time she did the image of zack covered with blood flashed through her mind hed had to go to the mainland that morning and the idea of him being offisland was one more fear he could be attacked on the street mugged left to lie bleeding and dying by the end of her shift shed concluded she hadnt done enough and needed help she found mia helping a customer with a selection of childrens books she waited mentally wringing her hands until the choices were made and the customer headed to checkout i know youre busy but i need to talk to you all right let me get my jacket well take a walk she was back moments later with a suede jacket tossed over her short dress both were the color of butternut squash that made her hair glint like a mane of fire she waved at lulu as she walked out the front door taking my lunch break great sweater she added as they stepped outside lulus work isnt it yes youve jumped a hurdle she wouldnt have made you something that fine if she hadnt decided to accept you congratulations thanks i did you want to get some lunch no mia shook her hair back breathed deep there were times rare times when she felt locked inside the bookstore when she needed space desperately i want to walk ripley had been right about indian summer the cold snap had given way to balmy days of warmth and moist breezes that carried the scents of both sea and forest the sky was clouded up and against that dull pewter the trees rose like flaming beacons the ocean mirrored the sky and its kicky waves foretold a storm brewing itll rain within the hour mia predicted and look she gestured out to sea seconds later as if shed ordered it a pale jag of lightning cracked the steel mirror of sky storms coming i love a good storm the air goes electric and the energy of it pumps into your blood makes me restless though i want my cliffs in a storm mia slipped out of her lovely shoes hooked them on her fingers and stepped barefoot into the sand the beach is almost empty she pointed out its a good place to walk and for you to tell me whats troubling you i had a i dont know if it was a vision i dont know what it was it frightens me mia slid her free arm through nells and kept the pace easy tell me when she finished mia kept walking why did you give him your locket it was all i could think of an impulse the thing that mattered most to me i suppose you were wearing it when you died you brought it with you into your new life this symbol of where you came from this connection to your mother your talisman strong magic hell wear it because you asked him to and that makes it stronger yet its a locket mia something my father bought my mother for christmas one year its not particularly valuable you know better than that its value is its meaning to you and the love you have for your parents the love youve given to zack is it enough i dont see how it can be i know what it meant mia and this was the terror that stretched like a beast inside her in the vision his face was gray and the blood there was so much blood in the vision he was dead she made herself say it again he was dead isnt there something you can do shed already done all she could think of all she felt within her power what do you think i can do that you havent i dont know so much more was it a premonition is that what you believe yes yes even thinking of it stopped her breath it was so clear hes going to be killed and i dont know how what we see are possibilities potentials nell nothing is absolute nothing good or bad is guaranteed you were given this vision and you acted to protect isnt there a way to stop whoever will try to hurt him a spell spells arent a cure for every circumstance or shouldnt be and remember what you send out can come back to you or yours threefold attack one thing unleash another she didnt say what went through her mind stop the knife mia thought grimly and you may load a gun a storms coming she repeated and more than the lightning is going to slash through the sky this afternoon you know something i feel something i cant see it clearly perhaps its not for me to see that was a frustration this barrier and the knowledge that she so long a solitary witch couldnt do what needed to be done alone ill help you all i can that i can promise even as she worried it wouldnt be enough she saw ripley standing on the edge of the sand call ripley down shell come for you tell her what youve told me nell didnt have to call only to turn and look in her practical chinos and sensible boots ripley strode toward them youre going to get wet if you stay out here much longer thunder mia said and a dull rumbling of it rolled above the sea some lightning and it burst like a firewall toward the west but no rain for a half hour or so you forecasting the weather now glinda ripley said pleasantly you ought to get yourself a job on tv dont not now nell expected the sky to break open any second but she didnt care im worried about zack yeah me too ive got to worry when my brother starts wearing girlie jewelry but i have to thank you for giving me the opportunity to razz him did he tell you why hes wearing it no and i hesitate to repeat just what he did say to me in such polite company but it got our day off to a fine start i had a vision nell began oh perfect in disgust ripley started to turn away stopping when nell gripped her arm i like you nell but youre going to piss me off let her go nell shes afraid to listen im not afraid of anything and it burned her butt that mia knew exactly which button to push go ahead tell me what you saw in the crystal ball i wasnt looking at a crystal ball i was looking at zack nell said and told her no matter how hard she denied it how carelessly she shrugged ripley was shaken down to the toes zack can take care of himself she paced away and back again look in case you havent noticed hes a capable thoroughly trained officer of the law he carries a weapon and knows how to use it when and if he has to if he makes the job look easy its because he knows how to handle whatever comes along id trust him with my life i think nells asking if she can trust you with his ive got a badge ive got a weapon and a solid right cross thats how i handle things ripley said furiously if someone comes after zack you can bet your ass theyll have to go through me one times three ripley deliberately mia laid a hand on her arm in the end thats what itll take im not going to do it mia nodded they were standing in a circle under the angry sky you already are instinctively ripley stepped back broke the connection dont look for me she said not this way she turned her back on them and the rising wind and kicking at the sand she walked back to the village shell think about this and struggle with it as her heads made of granite its going to take longer than i like but for the first time in years shes wavering mia gave nell a comforting pat on the shoulder she wont risk zack they went back to the bookstore and had no sooner stepped inside when the rain fell in a torrent nell burned the candles in her trio of jackolanterns not just to decorate now but for their original purpose she set them on her porch to frighten away evil between the knowledge gleaned from the books mia had lent her and her own instincts she set about making her cottage as safe a haven as she could manage she swept away negative energy lit candles for tranquility and protection she laid red jasper and small pots of sage on the windowsills and moonstones and sprigs of rosemary under the pillows on her bed she made a pot of chicken soup it simmered while the rain lashed and her little cottage became a cozy cocoon but she couldnt relax in it she paced from window to window door to door she looked for busywork and couldnt find it she forced herself to sit in her office to complete a job proposal but after ten minutes she was up again her concentration as fractured as the lightningstruck sky giving up she called the station house surely zack was back from the mainland by now she would speak to him hear his voice then shed feel better but it was ripley who answered and told her in a voice as cold as a slap that zack hadnt returned that he would be back when he got back now her worry doubled the storm took on the proportions of a tempest for her the howl of the wind was no longer musical but full of teeth and threats the rain was a smothering curtain and the lightning a weapon hurled dark pressed against the windows as if it would break the glass and burst in the power shed learned to accept even to embrace began to waver like a candle flame under hot breath a thousand scenarios raced through her mind each more horrible than the last in the end unable to bear it she grabbed her jacket she would go down to the docks wait for the ferry will him to come she wrenched open the door in a blast of lightning in the blind dark that followed she saw the shadow move toward her she opened her mouth to scream then through the scent of rain and wet earth and the sting of ozone she caught the scent of her lover zack she leaped at him nearly sending the two of them tumbling off the stoop as he caught both her and his balance ive been so worried and now youre wet he carried her into the house i picked a hell of a day to go offisland bitch of a ferry ride back he set her on her feet then stripped off his soaking jacket idve called but i couldnt get my cell phone to connect thatll be the last ferry coming or going tonight in this weather he dragged a hand through his hair scattered rain youre soaked to the bone and because his shirt was wet she saw with relief the faint outline of the locket just above his heart and cold she added when she took his hand ive got to admit ive been dreaming about a hot shower the last half hour and would have had one by now he thought if ripley hadnt met him at the front door interrogated him then told him nell had called in a panic go take one now then you can have a bowl of hot soup definitely the best offer ive had all day he cupped her face in his hands im sorry you worried you shouldnt have now im not go on before you catch cold islanders are hardier stock than that but he kissed her lightly on the forehead and went straight for the shower he left his clothes in a sopping heap on the bathroom floor turned the spray on hot and let out a grateful sigh when he stepped in the little room and the tub in it hadnt been designed for a man of sixone the nozzle was aimed straight at his throat and if he wasnt careful he rapped his elbow against the wall whenever he moved his arms but hed developed a routine during the time hed been with nell bracing his hands on the front wall he bent over so the spray sluiced over his head and back since she tended to use fragrant and feminine soaps and shampoos hed casually placed some of his own on the ledge above the lip of the tub neither of them had mentioned these additions or the change of clothing hed left on the shelf of her closet they didnt talk about the fact that they rarely spent a night apart other people did he knew he saw the winks and was becoming accustomed to having his name and hers roll off peoples tongues together as if they were one word but they hadnt spoken of it maybe it was a kind of superstition he thought not to speak out loud what you were most afraid to lose or maybe it was just another kind of cowardice he wasnt sure it mattered but he was sure it was time to take another step forward hed taken one himself the biggest step hed ever taken on the mainland that afternoon he had to admit he felt good about it hed felt a little jittery but that had passed quickly enough even the hideous ride back from the mainland hadnt managed to dampen his mood the sounds on the other side of the curtain surprised him enough to make him move too quickly the rap of his elbow against the wall echoed in the little room and was followed viciously by a stream of curses are you all right torn between amusement and sympathy nell pressed her lips together tight and kept his wet bundle of clothes crammed against her chest he wrenched off the spray and whipped the curtain back this room is a hazard ive a good mind to check the code and what are you doing with those well i she broke off baffled when he all but leaped naked out of the tub and snatched them back from her i was just going to toss them in the dryer ill take care of it later ive got a change around here he dumped them on the floor again ignoring her wince as they hit with a wet plop behind him at least hang them up theyll just mildew lying in a pile like that okay okay he grabbed a towel ran it roughly over his hair did you just come in here to pick up after me actually yes now her gaze traveled down slowly over the damp chest where her locket glittered the flat belly the narrow hips he swagged in the towel but right at the moment im not thinking tidy is that so one look from her did more to warm his blood than an ocean of hot water what are you thinking im thinking the very best thing to do with a man who has just come in from a storm is tuck him into bed come with me he let her take his hand and draw him through to the bedroom are we going to play doctor because i think i could get really sick if it was worth my while she chuckled then tossed back the quilt in yes maam before he could twitch off the towel she did it for him but when he grabbed for her she evaded then gave him a nudge onto the bed you may know she began and picking up matches walked around the room lighting candles that in lore and legend witches often served as healers candlelight swayed and it shimmered im starting to feel really healthy ill be the judge of that im counting on it she turned to him do you know what ive never done for anyone no but im riveted she slowly lifted the hem of her sweater she remembered the day shed stood poised like this on the sunny back of his inlet i want you to watch me inch by inch she peeled the sweater up her body and want me if hed been struck blind he would have seen her skin glowing in delicate light she slipped out of her shoes in a kind of graceful dance her simple white bra cut low and sweet over the subtle curve of her breasts she lifted her hand to the center clasp watched his eyes follow the move then she deliberately left it fastened and trailed her fingertips down her midriff to the hook of her slacks his pulse began to thrum as the fabric slithered over her hips down her legs when it pooled at her feet she stepped out with that same fluid ease why dont you let me do the rest her lips curved and she stepped closer but not close enough shed never set out to seduce a man before and wasnt ready to surrender the power she could imagine his hands on her as she ran her own up her body as his breath rushed out of his lungs with that faint and knowing smile on her face she flicked open her bra let it slide away her breasts already felt full and tender she peeled the panties over her hips stepped free of them she was already wet i want to take you she whispered slowly i want you to take me she eased onto the bed on hands and knees to straddle him slowly she seemed to melt over him as if therell never be an end to it her lips were warm and soft on his seeking the taste of him slid through her system like a drug when he rolled to take more to deepen it she went with him but not in surrender she ran her fingertips lightly up and down his back finding pleasure in the ridge of muscle the ripple of it as she aroused him she let herself float on sensation as he gave her and took from her the gradual glide shed demanded candlelight shifted then the flames ran straight and true as spears and filled the air with fragrance they rose together danced on that scented air they knelt on the bed centered on it torso to torso and mouth to mouth if it was a spell hed have stayed bound eternally without question without struggle witch or woman a blend of both she was his he watched the way his hand looked against her skin dark to light rough to fragile the way her breasts could be cupped in his palms and how the tips hardened under the brush of his thumb they touched and tasted a brush a sip a lazy caress a long slow drink when at last he slipped inside her the gentle rise and fall was like waves of silk magic shimmered as they watched each other as for each for that moment no one else existed beat to beat with an intimacy that was more than mating that abounded past needs and outraced passion it welled in her heart overflowed in a spill like gold her lips curved again as he lowered his mouth to hers their hands joined fingers linking as they slid off the world together when she lay curled to his side her palm over the steady beat of his heart it seemed nothing could touch them her haven she thought was safe as they were safe inside it all of her fears and worries that creeping dread seemed foolish now they were simply a man and a woman in love lying in a warm bed and listening to the last of a storm pass overhead i wonder if ill ever learn how to manipulate objects honey you manipulate just fine he chuckled no she gave him a playful slap i mean moving things from one point to another if i could id chant the proper incantation and so on and wed have chicken soup in bed it doesnt work like that does it he asked i bet it does for mia if she wants it enough but for lowly students such as me it takes getting up going into the kitchen and doing it all the oldfashioned way she turned her head to give his shoulder a pecking kiss then rolled away why dont you stay here and ill get the soup she tossed a look over her shoulder as she walked to the closet for the robe shed finally gotten around to buying clever of you to suggest that after i was already up i thought so and since you caught me ill throw some clothes on and come out and give you a hand fine bring out that wet heap in the bathroom while youre at it wet heap it took him a minute to remember so she was already out of the room when he leaped out of bed and snatched up his sodden pants from the floor digging in the pocket he let out a breath as his fingers closed around a small box she had a round loaf of bread on a cutting board and was ladling up wide bowls of soup when he came in she looked so pretty so at home in her soft pink robe he thought her feet bare her hair a little mussed nell why dont we let that cool a minute well need to do you want some wine in a minute odd he thought hed be nervous at least a little instead he was rock calm he laid his hands on her shoulders turned her then ran them down to her elbows i love you nell i it was as far as she got before his lips silenced hers i thought of different ways to do this taking you for a drive one night or a walk on the beach next full moon or for a fancy dinner at the hotel but this is the right way for us the right place and the right time the little flutter in her stomach was a warning but she couldnt step back she couldnt move at all i thought of different ways to ask you what words might suit best and how i should say them but the only ones that come to me right now are i love you nell marry me the breath that she had been holding released as joy and grief waged a helpless war inside her zack weve been together such a short time we can wait a while to get married if you want though i dont see the point in it why cant we just leave things the way they are of all the reactions hed been expecting the hitch of fear in her voice hadnt been among them because we need a place of our own a life of our own not pieces of yours and mine marriage is just a legality thats all she turned away reached blindly into the cupboard for glasses for some people he said it quietly not for you or me were basic nell when basic people fall in love and mean it they get married start a family i want to share my life with you make children with you grow old with you tears threatened everything he said was what she wanted so deep in her heart that it was into her soul youre moving too fast i dont think so he took the box from his pocket i bought this today because weve already started our life together nell its time to see where it takes us her fingers curled into her palms as she looked down hed bought her a sapphire a rich warm stone set in a simple band of gold hed have known she would need warmth and simplicity evan had chosen a diamond a brilliant square in platinum that had sat on her finger like ice im sorry zack im so sorry i cant marry you he felt the slice through his heart but he never flinched as he watched her face do you love me nell yes then i deserve to know why you wont make a promise to me and take one from me youre right she struggled to steady herself i cant marry you zack because im already married nothing she could have said would have stunned him more married youre married for gods sake nell weve been together for months i know it wasnt just shock she saw now it wasnt just anger he stared at her as if she were a stranger i left him you see more than a year ago he struggled over the first hurdle the fact that shed been married and hadnt told him but he couldnt make it over the second that she was married still left him but didnt divorce him no i couldnt i and you let me touch you you slept with me let me fall in love with you knowing you werent free yes it was so cold suddenly so cold in the little kitchen that it penetrated her bones i dont have any excuses for it i wont ask when you were planning to tell me obviously you werent he closed the box with a snap jammed it back in his pocket i dont sleep with other mens wives nell a word from you one goddamn word from you and we wouldnt have gotten to this point i know its my fault as his anger grew hardened his face she felt the strength shed rebuilt draining away like the color in her cheeks you think that makes up for it he shot back as temper and misery careened inside him you think taking the blame for it cleans the fucking slate on this no goddamn it he spun away from her and caught the way she flinched at the move ill yell when i need to yell youre only making me madder standing there like youre waiting for a punch im not going to hit you not now not ever and its insulting for you to stand there wondering if i will you dont know what its like no i dont because you wont tell me he reined himself in as much as he could though temper was still sparking or you tell me just enough to keep things running smooth until the next time maybe thats true but i told you i couldnt tell you everything that i wasnt going to go into the details this isnt a damn detail youre still married to the man who did this to you yes are you planning on ending the marriage no well thats plain enough he snatched up his boots his jacket i cant let him find out where i am i cant let him find me he started to yank the door open then stood there a moment his hand on the knob did you ever stop and think just once did you ever stop and look at me and know id do whatever needed to be done for you id have done it nell for a stranger because its my job how could you not know id do it for you she did know she thought as he walked away from her it was only one of the things that frightened her unable to cry she sat miserably in the house she had made safe and empty chapter seventeen contents prev next ive lost him ive ruined it nell sat in mias great gorgeous cavern of a living room in front of an oxroasting fire sipping a cup of healing cinnamon tea isis stretched her lean warm body over her lap like a cozy blanket none of it lifted her mood damaged it perhaps and nothings lost that can be found again i cant fix this mia everything he said to me is true i didnt want to think about it to see it but its true i had no right to let things get as serious as they did i dont happen to have a hair shirt handy but i imagine we can make something up at nells shocked stare mia lifted one shoulder elegantly its not that i dont sympathize with both of you because i do but the fact is nell you fell in love both of you and both of you dealt with it the way you needed to deal with it you brought each other something that not everyone is given thats nothing to regret i dont regret loving him or being loved by him i regret a lot of things but not that all right then you need to take the next step there is no next step i cant marry zack because im legally tied to someone else and even if evan decides to divorce me in absentia or whatever i still couldnt marry zack my identification is false details not to him yes youre right she tapped her pretty fingernails on the side of her cup as she considered some things zack would see because hes zack as black and white im sorry i didnt think this far ahead and warn you of that i know him mia continued as she rose to stretch i didnt anticipate that hed move toward legal binding so quickly im jaded when it comes to love she poured more tea pondered while she roamed the room and sipped there were two sofas both in deep hunter green that begged for a body to sink down and sink in they were scattered with jeweltoned pillows all in soft fabrics texture was essential to luxury and when at leisure mia insisted on luxury the room was populated with antiques because she preferred the old to the new unless it was in business equipment the rugs on the wideplanked chestnut floor were satisfactorily faded there were flowers everywhere in priceless crystal or in cheerful colored bottles of no special value some of the candles she surrounded herself with in every room were lit the white ones for peace youve hurt him nell on two levels one by not falling into his arms in utter delight when he proposed she stopped lifting one brow i told you i was jaded in this area but nonetheless when a man asks a woman to marry him hes not going to be pleased when she says no thank you im not a complete idiot mia no darling im sorry contrite though secretly amused at the biting tone mia stopped behind the sofa and stroked nells hair of course youre not and i should have said three levels the second being his sense of honor he has just discovered himself poaching on what he would consider another mans territory oh really im not a damn rabbit zack would see himself breaking a code the third level is that he would certainly have done so anyway if hed known if youd told him the circumstances he could adjust his line there because he loves you and wants you and because he would be relieved that youd escaped from a horrible situation but the fact that you didnt tell him that you let him go into this let him fall in love with you blind is going to be hard for him to swallow why cant he see that my marriage to evan means nothing im not helen remington anymore do you want comfort or truth mia asked flatly i cant have both it may as well be truth you lied to him and by lying you put him in an untenable position more you told him you didnt intend to end the marriage i cant wait you wont end it and without an end there cant be a beginning this is purely your choice nell and no one can or should take it from you but youve blocked zack from being able to stand for you to stand with you or more to his liking i imagine to step in front of you and face your demon nell she sat again taking nells hands do you think he wears a badge for amusement for the pathetic pay for the power no but he doesnt understand what evan can do what hes capable of mia theres a madness inside him a kind of cold deliberate madness that i cant begin to explain people tend to think the word evil is overdramatic mia said when actually its extremely simple yes a few knots untangled she should have known by now that she didnt have to explain to mia and he doesnt understand that i cant bear the idea of seeing evan again of hearing his voice i think id break this time i think it would shatter me youre stronger than that nell shook her head he shrinks me i dont know if you can understand what i mean yes i do do you want a spell a charm to bolster yourself to shield yourself from one man so you can have the other mia reached over stroked isis along her sleek back the cat raised her head exchanged what seemed to be a telling look with her mistress then curled up there are things that can be done mia said briskly now to protect to center yourself to enhance your own energies but beneath it all nell the powers inside you for now she slipped the silver chain and its silver disk over her head you gave zack your talisman so ill give you one of mine it was my greatgrandmothers i cant take it from you on lend mia said slipping the chain over nells head she was a very canny witch my greatgrandmama married well made a killing on the stock market and kept it for which i continue to be grateful i wouldnt like being poor she acted as doctor on the island before we had one with a medical degree living here she treated warts delivered babies stitched up gashes and nursed half the population through a dangerous run of influenza among other things its lovely what does the carving mean its an old language similar to what was written on the ogham stones in ancient ireland it means courage and now that youre wearing my courage ill give you my advice sleep let him wrestle with his feelings while you examine your own when you go to him and as much as he loves you he wont come back to you be clear in your mind what it is you want and what youre willing to do for it youre being an asshole zack okay now will you shut up ripley considered never shutting up a sisters privilege listen i know she screwed up but dont you want to know why she slapped her hands on his desk leaning down so she could get in his face in a satisfactory manner dont you want to push dig maneuver until she tells you why shes still married she had plenty of time to tell me if she wanted to zack concentrated on his computer his business on the mainland hadnt just been buying a ring he had also testified in a court case now that it was done he could update his file ripley made a sound somewhere between a groan and a scream you make me crazy i dont know how you dont make yourself crazy youre in love with a married woman he spared her a withering glance that fact is very clear in my mind right about now go do your patrol look its obvious she doesnt want the other guy she ditched him also obvious is that shes moony about you and vice versa nells been here what five months and from all appearances shes digging in for the duration whatever came before is over shes legally married that doesnt spell over for me yeah yeah dudley doright the fact that she admired his code of honor didnt mean it couldnt exasperate her so let it ride for a while just let things go as theyve been going why the hell do you have to marry her anyway oh wait i forgot who im talking to but if you want my advice i dont i really dont fine stew in your own juice then she grabbed her jacket then immediately tossed it down again im sorry i cant stand to see you hurting because he knew that he gave up on pretending to update files rubbed his hands over his face i cant make a life with someone who has another life that she hasnt finished i cant take a woman to bed whos legally married to another man and i cant love someone the way i love nell and not want not expect marriage home and children i cant do those things rip no you cant she came to him then wrapping her arms around his neck from the back resting her chin on top of his head maybe i could though she couldnt imagine loving anyone enough to make the choice but i understand you cant what i dont understand is why if you love her and you want her you cant sit her down and make her explain it you deserve to know im not going to make her do anything not only because i dont work that way but because i have a feeling the man shes married to did plenty of making her zack ripley turned her head so that her cheek rested on his hair did it ever occur to you that shes afraid to divorce him yeah his stomach did a quick nasty pitch i came around to that about three oclock in the morning if its true ive got plenty of feelings to punch into that bag but it doesnt change what is shes married she didnt tell me she doesnt trust me enough to be there for her whatever it takes he reached up closed his hand around hers thats how nell saw them when she opened the door holding on to each other and she saw the beam of blame shoot out of ripleys eyes even as the shutters came down on zacks i need to speak with you alone please instinctively ripley tightened her grip but zack gave her hand a squeeze ripley was just heading out on patrol yeah sure toss me out just when its getting good she was shrugging into her jacket contemplating that this was what it felt like when people said you could cut the tension with a knife when betsy poked her head in the door sheriff hi nell ripley sheriff bill and ed sutter are starting to mix it up out in from of the hotel it looks like it could get messy ill take care of it no zack got up at ripleys statement well take care of it the sutter brothers vacillated between staunch family loyally and hating each other like poison since they were both bullheaded and built like the same animal he thought it best not to let ripley get into a twoonone situation he gave nell a brief glance as he walked outside youll have to wait so cold she thought rubbing her arms it was hard to accept ice from a man who had such warmth he wasnt going to make this easy oddly enough even after the worst of it the evening before shed convinced herself that he would he would let her talk he would sympathize understand hold her standing alone in the station house nell watched that little fantasy crack in two and disappear here she was swallowing her pride risking her peace of mind and wellbeing and all he could do was spare her a single icy look well then maybe she should just let bad enough alone stung she pulled open the door two steps out and she could not only see the commotion up the street she could hear it freezing in place she hugged herself and watched it play out one big man with shortcropped hair bellyslammed another big man with shortcropped hair curses were flying an interested crowd was gathering at a safe distance and some of them appeared to be taking sides by hooting and calling out names zack and ripley were already wading in muscling the men apart nell couldnt hear what they were saying but while it quieted the crowd it didnt appear to have much impact on the sutter brothers they were all but snapping at each others faces nell cringed closed in when she saw the first fist strike there was a lot of shouting now and she heard it like the pounding of the surf a lot of motion that seemed lost in a fast blur zack had one mans arm ripley the others both had their handcuffs out bumping shoving curses and clipped warnings then one brother swung viciously at the other missed his mark and plowed his fist into zacks face she watched zacks head snap back heard the crowd gasp as one voice everyone went so still it seemed like a film stopped in a freezeframe she was already rushing across the street as motion and voices started again well goddamn it ed youre under arrest zack snapped the cuffs in place as ripley did the same and for good measure the same goes for you bill couple of hotheaded peckerbrains you people go on about your business now he ordered as he muscled ed around he caught sight of nell standing on the sidewalk like a deer caught in the headlights and cursed again come on sheriff you know i wasnt aiming at you doesnt matter a damn to me who you were aiming at not when he tasted blood in his mouth you just assaulted an officer he started it like hell bill shot back as ripley walked him briskly along but im sure as hell going to finish it when i get the chance you and what army just shut up ripley ordered couple of fortyyearold delinquents eds the one who punched him whatre you hauling me in for youre a damn public nuisance if the two of you want to butt heads do it in the privacy of one of your homes and keep it off the streets youre not going to put us in jail calmer now as he saw his fate ed turned his head to appeal come on now zack you know my wifell skin me if you lock me up it was just family business after all not when its on my street and not when it involves my goddamn face his jaw throbbed like a bitch he marched ed straight into the station house and back to one of the two tiny holding cells youre going to have some time to cool off before i get around to calling your wife whether she cares enough to come down and make your bail is up to her same goes ripley told bill cheerfully as she uncuffed him and nudged him into a cell once the cell doors were shut and locked she dusted her hands ill write up the report i type slower than you do ill call the wives too though i suspect theyll hear about this before i even start on the paperwork yeah disgusted zack swiped the back of his hand over his mouth and smeared blood youre going to want some ice on that jaw lip too ed sutlers got a fist the size of idaho hey nell why dont you take our hero to your place and give him some ice unaware that shed come in zack turned slowly and stared at nell as she stood in the open doorway yes all right theres ice in the back i can take care of it youd be better off putting some distance between yourself and ed ripley advised until youre sure youre not going to unlock that cell and punch him back maybe his eyes werent cold anymore nell noted they were hot green glass she moistened her lips icell help keep the swelling down and some rosemary tea might help the ache fine great his head was already ringing why not finish it off twohundredandfiftydollar fine for both of them he snapped at ripley or twenty days they dont like the sound of that fill out a formal arrest warrant and they can deal with the court yes sir ripley beamed as zack stalked out wasnt this great she thought the whole thing had really brightened her mood they walked to the cottage in silence nell no longer knew what to say or how to say it this furiously angry man was every bit as much a stranger as the icy cold one had been there was no doubt in her mind that he didnt particularly want to deal with her right now she knew just how long it could take to regain equilibrium after a blow to the face still hed taken a fist at short range and other than the head and temper snap hed had little reaction people were always saying someone was tougher than he looked it seemed to be true about zachariah todd she opened the cottage door and still saying nothing walked back to the kitchen and began to make an ice pack out of a plastic bag wrapped in a thin cloth appreciate it ill get the dishcloth back to you shed already lifted the kettle to make tea she blinked at him where are you going to walk off what i can of this mad seeing no choice she set the kettle down again ill go with you you dont want to be with me right now and i dont want to be with you it was quite a discovery to learn that there were times a slap was preferable to words that cant be helped we have things to talk about and the longer its put off the harder itll be she opened the kitchen door waited lets try the woods we can consider it neutral territory he hadnt bothered with a jacket and the rain that had swept in the night before had left cool temperatures in its wake he didnt seem to mind she glanced up at him as they headed into her little wedge of forest that ice isnt going to do any good if you dont use it he pressed it to his aching jaw and felt mildly ridiculous in the summer when i came here i wondered what it would be like to walk through the trees in autumn with all the color and the first bites of cold id missed the cold the change of seasons when i lived in california she let out a little breath drew one in i lived in california for three years los angeles primarily though we spent a lot of time in the house in monterey i preferred it there but i learned not to let him know that or hed have found ways to cancel trips north he liked to find little ways to punish me you married him i did he was handsome and romantic and clever and rich i thought why here comes my prince and well live happily ever after i was dazzled and flattered and in love he worked very hard to make me fall in love with him theres no point in going into all the details youve guessed some of them anyway he was cruel in little ways in big ones he made me feel small small smaller smallest until i all but disappeared when he hit me the first time it was a shock no one had ever hit me before i shouldve left right that minute or tried he would never have let me but i shouldve tried but id only been married a few months and somehow he made me feel id deserved it for being stupid or clumsy or forgetful for all manner of things he trained me like a dog im not proud of that did you get help it was so quiet in the woods she could hear in that quiet every step she and zack took over the ground already strewn with fallen leaves not at first i knew about abuse intellectually id read articles stories but that didnt apply to me i wasnt part of that cycle id come from a good stable home id married an intelligent successful man i lived in a big beautiful house i had servants she slipped a hand into her pocket shed made a magic bag for courage and had tied it with seven careful knots letting her fingers worry it helped calm her nerves it was just that i kept making mistakes that was all i thought that once i learned everything would be fine again but it only got worse and i couldnt keep deluding myself one night he dragged me upstairs by my hair i had long hair then she explained i thought he would kill me i thought he would beat me and rape me then kill me he didnt he didnt do any of those things but i realized he could have and i wouldnt have been able to stop him i went to the police but hes an influential man he has connections i had a few bruises but nothing major they didnt do anything knowing that burned a hole through him they should have they shouldve taken you to a shelter as far as they were concerned i was a rich spoiled trophy wife causing trouble it doesnt matter she said wearily they could have taken me anywhere hed have found me i ran once and he found me and i paid for it he made it clear to me he made sure i understood one vital point i belonged to him and i would never get away wherever i went hed find me he loved me it sent a violent chill through her to say it she stopped turned to face zack his version of love beyond rules beyond bounds selfish cold and obsessive and powerful he would see me dead before hed let me go thats not an exaggeration i believe you but you got away because he thinks im dead she told him her voice clear and empty of emotion what she had done to break the chains jesus christ nell he threw the ice bag to the ground its a miracle you didnt kill yourself either way i was getting away i was coming here i believe completely believe that the minute that car went over the cliff i started coming here and to you because he wanted too strongly to touch her and wasnt yet sure if it would be a caress or a furious shake he jammed his hands in his pockets i had a right to know when things changed between us i had a right to know i didnt expect things to change between us but they damn well did and if you didnt know where we were heading then you are stupid im not stupid her voice took on an edge maybe i was wrong but im not stupid i didnt expect to fall in love with you i didnt want to fall in love with you or even get involved with you you pursued me it doesnt make any difference how it happened the fact is it did you know where you stood and why but you didnt let me know im a liar she said evenly im a cheat im a bitch but dont you ever call me stupid again jesus christ at his wits end he stalked away lifted his gaze to the sky i wont be demeaned not by anyone not ever again i wont be belittled and i wont be brushed aside until its convenient for you to pay attention again curious he turned his head stared at her is that what you think this is im telling you how it is i did a lot of thinking since you walked out of the house yesterday im not going to whimper and slide into the corner just because youre annoyed with me that insults both of us well three cheers oh go to hell he turned completely around and stepped toward her the dread curled in her stomach her palms went clammy but she stood her ground its a hell of a time to pick a fight with me especially when youre wrong im only wrong if im standing where you are standing here i did what i had to do i wish i hadnt hurt you but i cant go back and change that no you cant so we go from here did you leave out anything else i should know the woman who drove off that cliff was named helen remington mrs evan remington i dont answer to that name anymore its not who i am remington he said it softly she could all but see him flipping through some mental data file hollywood type thats right you got about as far away from that as you could manage thats right too ill never go back ive found the life i want here with or without me for the first time since shed begun her story her stomach clutched thats up to you no its not you already know what i want now its what you want i want you you know that then you have to finish what you started you have to end it file for divorce i cant havent you heard anything ive said every word and more that you didnt say part of him wanted to soothe her to draw her close shelter her to tell her none of it mattered now but it did you cant live your whole life wondering looking over your shoulder or pretending three years away neither can i for one thing its going to start eating at you and for another the worlds a small place youll never be sure he wont find you if he does or if youre afraid he has are you going to run again its been more than a year since i left he cant find me if he thinks im dead youll never be sure you have to end it but you dont have to end it alone i wont let him touch you this isnt his turf he said lifting her face with a finger under her chin its mine youre underestimating him i dont think so i know im not underestimating myself or ripley or mia or a lot of people on the island who would go out of their way for you i dont know if i can do what youre asking for more than a year ive focused on doing everything i could to make certain he doesnt find out im alive he doesnt find out where i am i dont know if ive got it in me to step out again i need to think i need you to give me time to think all right tell me what you decide he stooped to get the ice bag the ice was mostly melted as he didnt care a great deal about the pain in his jaw he opened it spilled out the contents if you dont want to marry me nell ill accept that but after you think all this through i need you to tell me what you decide there too i love you i dont have to think that through he stared at her standing in the quiet woods where the leaves rioted color and the air still carried the faintest scent of yesterdays rain he held out a hand for hers ill walk you home chapter eighteen contents prev next ripley gave zack her most pitiful look and whined she saved up her whines to add to the impact when she whipped one out but i dont wanna go to mias living with her for nearly thirty years made him immune to such tactics though he had to give her big points for delivery when you were a kid you practically lived at mias then now see the difference why cant you go because i have a penis ill restrain myself and not ask if you see the difference be a pal rip she spun in a circle her version of drumming her heels on the floor if nells going to be hanging out at mias tonight then mia can keep an eye on her jesus zack dont be such a mommy the asshole in la doesnt even know shes alive yet if im being overprotective well just all have to live with it i dont want her driving to the cliffs alone at night the thought of her car flying over cliffs three thousand miles away left a ball of ice in his gut until this thing is resolved i want to keep an eye on her so keep your eye on her youre the ones trying to decide if youre going to be longsuffering starcrossed lovers or ward and june cleaver he let the insult pass as it was her way of starting a pissing match so she could storm out and get out of doing what he asked ill never figure how it is i know more about women than you do when youre of the same species watch it slick he supposed he hadnt let the insult pass after all she doesnt need me hovering over her she doesnt need a man even such a sterling example of manhood as myself crowding her shes got tough decisions to make im trying to keep a little distance without making an issue of keeping a little distance until shes made them gee you sure do think a lot the simple fact was he was putting her in a hell of a pinch he wanted her to keep an eye on nell and ripley wanted to keep an eye on zack she hadnt had an easy moment in the two days since hed told her nells story blood on the moon she thought nells vision of zack covered with blood a sociopathic potentially homicidal husband and ripleys own disturbing dreams she hated knowing she was dipping into omen territory but hell it didnt bode well what are you going to be doing while im babysitting the love of your life at witch central there was something else hed learned in nearly thirty years of knowing her he could always count on ripley taking both our evening patrols buying some takeout and going home to a lonely dinner if you think that makes me feel sorry for you think again id trade places with you in a heartbeat she walked to the door ill go by nells tell her i want to tag along tonight i want you to watch your back excuse me i dont want to talk about it im just saying ill watch my back and buy some beer you drank the last bottle she slammed the door because just because mia set out fresh charms every day it seemed the air got a little heavier as if something was dragging it down she glanced outside it was already dark there was so much night at the end of october so many hours until dawn there were things it wasnt wise to speak of at night or even think night could be an open window she burned incense of sage to counter negativity fastened on earrings of amethyst to strengthen her intuition shed been tempted to slip some rosemary under her pillow to help chase away her troubled dreams but she needed to see needed to look she added jasper to the chain around her neck a strengthener of energy a reliever of stress it was the first time in years she could recall being so constantly hounded by stress tonight wasnt the time for it she reminded herself she was going to take nell to the next step and such things should be joyful she fingered the magic bag in her pocket filled with crystals and herbs and as shed taught nell tied with seven knots she detested being so edgy as if waiting and waiting for disaster to strike foolish really when shed been preparing for disaster and how to divert it all her life she heard the car saw the streak of lights slash across her front windows as she walked to the door she visualized pouring the stress into a small silver box locking it so she appeared to be her usual calm self as she opened the door until she saw ripley slumming deputy didnt have anything better to do she was surprised to see mia in a long black dress mia rarely wore black the one thing ripley had to admit the woman wasnt often obvious special occasion as it happens i dont have any objections to you being here if nell wants you but dont interfere you dont interest me enough to interfere is this argument going to take long nell asked pleasantly i was hoping for a glass of wine i think were done come in and welcome well take the wine with us with us where are we going to the circle youve brought what i told you yes nell patted the large leather pouch she wore good ill get what i need then well go ripley wandered around freely enough while mia got ready she had always liked the cliff house loved it the big crowded rooms the odd corners the thick carved doors and glossy floors shed have gotten by happily enough with one room and a cot but she had to admit mias place had style and class as far as atmosphere went you couldnt top it class style and atmosphere aside it was always comfortable a place where you knew you could sink into a chair and put your feet up a place she recalled where she had once run as free and as welcome as a pet puppy it was a hell of a note to realize all at once how much shed missed it missed it all you still use the gable room ripley asked casually while mia selected a red wine from the rack when mia glanced back their eyes met shared memories yes some of your things are still there she said as she wrapped three glasses in white linen i dont want them theyre still there in any case since youre here you can carry this bag she gestured then picked up the second that held the wine and glasses she opened the back door and isis streaked through it surprised nell as the cat generally couldnt be bothered to join them its a special night mia threw up the hood of the cloak she swirled over her shoulders black again with a lining of deep winered she knows it its nearly samhain nell needs to practice lighting the balefire ripleys head snapped up moving a little fast arent you mia merely studied the moon as they walked it was down to a thumbnail and would soon be full dark around that sliver of white she could see a haze blacker thicker than the sky no annoyed that mia had made her uneasy yet again ripley shrugged halloween lifting the dead the night boils with evil spirits and only the brave or foolish walk in the dark nonsense mia said lightly and theres no point in taking that route to try to scare nell the end of the third and last harvest of the year nell breathed deep of the night a time for remembering the dead for celebrating the eternal cycle also the night when the veil between life and death is said to be its thinnest hardly a negative time but one of reaffirmation and fun and of course mias birthday the big threeoh this time too said ripley dont be so smug there was a little bite in mias voice a not entirely playful nip youll be hitting it yourself in six weeks yeah but youll always be older than me isis was already in the clearing sitting still as a sphinx in the center we have some candles for working light you can put them on the stones ripley and light them no she shoved her hands very deliberately into the pockets of her bomber jacket carting your bag of tricks is one thing i wont participate oh for pity sakes youll hardly spoil your magic celibacy by lighting one or two candles but mia snatched the bag from her and stalked to the stones ill do it nell insisted theres no point in either of you being angry when youre each doing what you want why are you so angry ripley kept her voice down crouched as mia came back to select what she needed from her bags i usually have to work a lot harder to get under your skin maybe my skins thinner these days you look tired i am tired somethings coming its pushing and pushing closer i dont know how much longer i can hold it back or even if im meant to therell be blood she gripped ripleys wrist held her still and pain terror and grief and im afraid that without the circle therell be death if youre so sure of this afraid of this why havent you sent for someone you know others its not for others and you know it she glanced back toward nell maybe shes strong enough mia straightened tossed back her hood nell well cast the circle whatever shed expected to feel ripley hadnt expected the yearning that ribboned through her as she watched the basic ritual as the familiar words echoed in her head shed given it up she reminded herself shed set it aside she watched wand and athame glimmer she had always preferred the sword her mouth pursed in consideration as mia lit candles with a wooden match even as she opened her mouth to speak to question mia sent her a quieting look fine your way as usual ripley thought and kept her comments to herself earth wind fire water elements hear this call from your daughters while the moon above does ride within the magic circle rise with her head thrown back and her arms raised mia waited and the wind lifted all but sang the candle flames speared rulerstraight despite the swirl of humming air under her feet the earth trembled lightly and in her cauldron fragrant liquid began to bubble as mia lowered her arms again each subsided nell had yet to get her breath back over the past months shed seen and done and been told the fantastic but until tonight she hadnt been treated to such a vivid display power awaits mia told her and held out a hand when nell clasped it she found mias skin warm nearly hot it waits in you your link is air and calling to it comes most easily to you but there are four tonight youll make fire the balefire yes but we didnt bring wood with a little chuckle mia stepped back we wont need it center yourself clear your mind this fire does not burn this fire does no harm it lights the dark and glows from charm when you make its golden tower you will know your strength and power and once begun bring harm to none its too soon for her ripley said from outside the circle quiet youre not to interfere look at me nell you can trust me and yourself watch and see hold on to your hats ripley muttered and stepped a bit further back just in case mia opened her hands empty hands spread her fingers turning them over she held her arms out as if reaching there was a spark electric blue then another then a dozen then too many to count they sizzled like fire on water turned the air within the circle to deep sapphire and there where the bare ground had been rose a bright and gilded pillar of flame nells legs simply folded until her butt hit the ground with a solid thump nothing that was going through her mind had she been able to capture any of the scattered pieces of her thoughts could have made its way out of her mouth told you ripley sighed shook her head quiet mia spun away from the fire held out a hand to help nell to her feet youve seen me do magic before little sister youve done magic yourself not like that its a basic skill basic mia really you made fire out of nothing what she means is its along the lines of losing your virginity its kind of a jolt ripley said helpfully it might be less pleasurable than you expect the first time around but after a while you get better at it close enough mia agreed now center yourself nell you know how clear your mind visualize gather the power make your fire i cant possibly mia cut her off with a lifted hand how do you know unless you try concentrate she stepped behind nell laid her hands on nells shoulders theres light inside you and heat energy you know it bring it together feel it its like a tingling in the belly and it rises toward the heart it spreads up fills you gently she put her hands under nells arms lifting them it runs under your skin like a river flows down your arms to your fingertips let it come its time while they worked ripley watched there was something lovely about it in a strange way something like watching mia balance nell on her first twowheeler offering encouragement keeping pace building confidence the first time wasnt easy on student or teacher she knew nells face was sheened with the sweat of effort the muscles in her arms trembled the clearing never completely silent seemed to vibrate the air here never completely still sighed there was a faint and fitful spark when nell would have leaped back mia was there holding her in place her quiet and steady encouragement like a chant another spark stronger ripley watched mia step back leaving her little sister wobbling on two wheels solo despising the weakness ripley felt tears pure sentiment gather in her eyes and a little spurt of pride as nells fire shimmered to life for the first time since shed begun nell felt the beat of her own heart the rise and fall of her own chest power bright as silver pumped through her blood its better than losing your virginity its beautiful and bright she whispered nothing will ever be the same for me again she turned full of joy but mia was no longer looking at her but at ripley we need three furious ripley refused to let the tears fall you wont get the third from me mia had seen the tears and understood them she also understood ripley very well to nell she said she probably cant do it anymore dont tell me what i cant do ripley piped up itd be hard for her to find that out especially after watching you do so well after such a short time and stop talking like im not here i hate that why are you here mia asked with annoyance nell and i can make the third together which had been mias plan before shed seen ripley at the door we certainly dont need you and your pathetic rusty attempts she was never as good as me she said to nell it always infuriated her that what came so easily to me was such an effort for her i was every bit as good as you hardly better ah mia thought ripley never could turn down a challenge prove it weakened by sentiment stirred by longing and bristling with the dare ripley stepped into the circle no nell thought she swaggered she didnt hold out her arms as mia had but seemed to throw them and the fire that burst from their tips onto the ground the minute she did she hissed like a snake you did that on purpose perhaps but so did you and look here the sky did not fall you made the choice ripley i couldnt have pushed you into it unless youd wanted it this doesnt change anything its one time only if you say so but you might as well have some wine while youre here mia studied the trio of flames as she picked up the bottle ripleys was bigger than hers a result of temper but not mia thought with satisfaction nearly as elegant and pouring the wine she felt a fire inside herself that was hope they had another glass when they returned to mias house restless now ripley wandered from window to window jingling the change in her pocket mia ignored her for as long as shed known her ripley had never been a quiet soul and at the moment mia understood there was a considerably testy war going on inside of her have you decided how youre going to handle your situation with zack nell glanced up at her she sat on the floor mesmerized by the fire no part of me hopes that evan will divorce me take it out of my hands and the rest of me knows thats not the core of the problem if you dont stand up to bullies they tromp all over you nell admired ripley strong wiry and ready she thought knowing that and acting on it are two different things evan would never have taken a piece out of someone like you ripley lifted a shoulder so take it back she will when shes ready mia countered you of all people should know that its impossible to push one persons beliefs ideas or standards on another or to erase someone elses fear shes upset with me because i hurt zack i cant blame you hes a big boy ripley shrugged then sat on the arm of the couch what are you going to do about him zack that is in the meantime do yeah do are you just going to let him slide through his brooding phase which is what comes after the pissedoff phase with him and let me tell you is a lot harder to live with i figure weve gotten to be pals more or less since youve been here do a pal a favor and snap him out of it before i have to smother him in his sleep weve talked i dont mean talk i mean action is she really that much of a sweetie ripley asked mia apparently ripley in her own delicate way is suggesting that you lure zack back to bed and soothe away your troubles with a bout or two of hot jungle sex which is her answer to all manner of pesky annoyances including hangnails bite me mias given up sex which explains why shes such a bitch i havent given it up im simply more selective than a cat in heat it isnt about sex making the statement making it firm and fast was nells only solution to fending off another argument ripley snorted yeah sure right mia sighed it pains me more than i can say to agree with ripley even partially certainly your relationship with zack isnt as all of ripleys are based on sex but its a vital part of it an expression of your feelings a celebration of them and your intimacy you can put flowers on it its still sex ripley gestured with her glass however highminded zack is hes still a guy being around you and not getting laid ripley please not having intimacy she said in a prissy tone after mias reprimand is going to make him edgy if hes going to deal with your la asshole he should be in top form hes been very careful to keep me at a distance in that area then close the distance in that area ripley said simply heres what we do you drop me off at your place ill bunk there tonight you go over to the house and take care of business youve been hanging out with him long enough to know what buttons to push thats sneaky deceitful and manipulative ripley cocked her head at nell whats your point despite herself nell laughed maybe i will go over to talk she added whatever you want to call it ripley polished off her wine maybe you could take these glasses and things back into the kitchen get your stuff together sure she rose began to gather the glasses ill just be a minute take your time mia waited until nell was out of the room it wont take her long so say what you didnt want to say in front of her what i did tonight doesnt change anything thats redundant just shut up she paced again shed opened herself only for a short time but thats all that had been needed shed felt that heaviness in the air the pressure okay troubles coming im not going to pretend i dont feel it and im not going to pretend i havent tried to figure a way to deal with it maybe i could but i wont bet zack on it im going to sign up for this mia she turned back but just for this mia didnt rub it in in fact it didnt occur to her to do so well light the balefires at midnight on samhain eve well meet at ten on the sabbat zack already wears nells talisman but id protect your house if i were you do you remember how i know what to do ripley snapped once this passes things go back the way they were this is yes i know mia retorted a onetimeonly zack had given up on paperwork given up on his telescope and pretty much given up on the idea that he could will himself to sleep he was trying to bore himself to sleep now by reading one of ripleys gun magazines lucy was sprawled beside the bed in a deep sleep that he envied every now and then her legs would twitch as she chased dream gulls or swam in her dream inlet but she lifted her head one sharp motion let out a soft warning woof seconds before zack heard the front door open relax girl its just ripley at the sound of the name lucy was up and scrambling for the door where she stood wagging her entire body forget it its too late to play the knock on the bedroom door had lucy barking joyfully and zack cursing what lucy whipped herself into happy circles as the door opened then she leaped enthusiastically on nell zack shot up in bed lucy down sorry i thought it was rip he nearly threw back the covers then remembered he was buck naked is something wrong no nothing she bent over to pet lucy wondering which of them was more embarrassed and decided it was a tie i just wanted to see you talk to you he peeked at the clock noted it was coming onto midnight why dont you go downstairs ill be right there no he wasnt going to treat her like a guest this is fine she came over sat on the side of the bed he still wore the locket and that meant something i made fire tonight he studied her face okay no she laughed a little and scratched lucys head i made it not with wood and a match with magic oh there was a tickling inside his chest i dont know what im supposed to say to that congratulations or wow it made me feel strong and excited and complete i wanted to tell you it made me feel something like i do when im with you when you touch me you dont want to touch me because i have a legal tie to someone else it doesnt stop the want nell she nodded let the relief of that come you wont touch me because i have a legal tie to someone else but the fact is zack the only man i have a real tie to is you when i ran i told myself i would never tie myself to another man never risk that again then there was you i have magic in me she lifted a hand fisted to her heart and its amazing and thrilling and sweet still its nothing nothing zack to what i have in me for you any defense any rational reason he may have had quite simply crumbled nell i miss you just being with you im not asking you to make love with me i was going to i was going to try to seduce you he skimmed his fingers through her hair what changed your mind i dont want to ever lie to you again even in a harmless way and i wont use one set of your feelings against another set i just want to be with you zack just be dont tell me to go he drew her down until her head was cradled on his shoulder and he felt her long long sigh of contentment echo his own chapter nineteen contents prev next it wasnt easy for an important successful man to get away by himself for a few days it was a complicated and tedious business to reschedule meetings postpone appointments inform clients alert staff there was a whole world of people dependent upon him more tedious yet was making travel arrangements personally rather than using the services of an assistant but after careful thought evan decided there was nothing else to be done no one was to know where he was or what he was doing not his staff not his clients not the press naturally he could be reached via cell phone if there was a crisis of any sort otherwise until hed done what he set out to do he would remain incommunicado he had to know he hadnt been able to get the information his sister had so casually passed on to him out of his mind helens double helens ghost helen he would wake up at night in a cold sweat from images of helen his helen walking along some picturesque beach alive laughing at him giving herself to any man who crooked his finger it couldnt be borne the terrible grief hed felt upon her death was turning slowly inexorably into a cold and killing rage had she tricked him had she somehow planned and executed the faking of her own death he hadnt thought her smart enough certainly not brave enough to try to leave him much less succeed she knew the consequences he had made them perfectly clear till death do us part obviously she couldnt have done so alone shed had help a man a lover a woman especially a woman like helen could never have devised such a scheme on her own how many times had she sneaked off to lie with some wifestealing bastard working out the details of her deception laughing and fucking plotting and planning oh there would be payment made he could calm himself again continue about his business and his life without an outward ripple he could nearly convince himself again that pamelas claims were nonsense she was after all a woman and women by nature were given to flights of fancy and foolishness ghosts didnt exist and there was only one helen remington the helen who had been meant for him but at times in that big glamorous house in beverly hills he thought he heard ghosts whispering or caught the bright sound of his dead wifes taunting laughter what if she wasnt dead he had to know he had to be careful and clever ferrys loading his eyes pale as water blinked i beg your pardon the ferry worker stopped blowing on his takeout cup of coffee and instinctively stepped back from that blank stare it was he would think later like staring into an empty sea ferrys loading he repeated youre going to three sisters aint ya yes the smile that spread over the handsome face was worse than the eyes yes i am according to legend the one known as air had left her island to go with the man who promised to love her to care for her and when hed broken those promises and turned her life into a misery she had done nothing shed borne children in sorrow raised them in fear had bowed and had broken had died her last act had been to send her children back to the sisters for protection but she had done nothing even with her powers to protect or save herself so the first link in the chain of a curse was forged nell thought of the story again of the choices and mistakes and of destiny she kept it clear in her head as she walked down the street of what had become her home what she intended to keep as her home when she walked in zack was delivering a blistering lecture to a young boy she didnt recognize automatically she started to step out again but zack merely held up a finger and never broke rhythm youre not only going straight over to mrs demearas and clean up every last scrap of pumpkin guts and apologize for being a moron but youre going to pay a fine for possession of illegal explosives and willful destruction of property five hundred dollars five hundred dollars the boy thirteen at the outside nell calculated lifted a head that had been sunk low jeez sheriff todd i aint got five hundred dollars my moms going to kill me as is zack merely raised his eyebrows and looked merciless did i say i was finished no sir the boy mumbled and went back to looking so hangdog that nell wanted to go pat his head you can work off the fine by cleaning the station house twice a week three dollars an hour three but itll take me the boy had smartened up enough to shut up yes sir you werent finished his lips wanted to twitch but zack kept them in a firm hard line ive got some odd chores around my place too saturdays and oh zack thought that one stung there was no crueler fate than being imprisoned by chores on a saturday same rate you can start there this saturday and in here monday after school if i hear youre in any more trouble like this your mothers going to have to stand in line to skin you clear yes uncle zack um i mean yes sir sheriff beat it he beat it nearly spinning the air into a funnel as he raced past nell uncle zack second cousins really its an honorary term what did he do to earn the hard labor stuck an ash can thats a firecracker in his history teachers pumpkin it was a damn big pumpkin too blew that shit all over hell and back again now youre sounding proud of him he pokered up as best he could youre mistaken idiot boy couldve blown his fingers off which is what i nearly did at about the same age when i blew my science teachers pumpkin to hell and back which is beside the point especially when well be in for similar halloween pranks tomorrow if i dont make an example now i think you did the job she walked over sat down have you got time for another matter sheriff i could probably carve out time it surprised him that she hadnt leaned over to kiss him and that she sat so straight so still so solemn whats the matter im going to need some help and some advice on the law i suppose ive generated false identification and ive put false information on official forms signing them with a name that isnt legally mine i think faking my own death is illegal too at least there must be something about life insurance fraud there were probably policies he didnt take his eyes off hers i think a lawyer would be able to handle that for you and that when all facts are known therell be no charges brought what are you telling me nell i want to marry you i want to live my life with you and make those children with you to do that i have to end this so i will i need to know what im going to have to do and if ill have to go to jail youre not going to jail do you think id let that happen its not up to you zack the false papers and so on arent going to put anyones sense of justice up the fact is hed given this angle a great deal of thought the fact is nell once you tell the story youre going to be a hero no im no ones hero do you know the statistics on spousal abuse he pulled open his bottom drawer took out a file and dropped it on his desk ive put some data together on it you might want to have a look at it sometime it was different for me its different for everybody every time the fact that you came from a good home and you lived in a big fancy house doesnt change anything a lot of people who think its different for them or that theres nothing they can do to change their situation are going to look at you hear what you did some of them might take a step they might not have taken because of you that makes you a hero diane mccoy it still bothers you that you couldnt help her that she wouldnt let you help her there are a lot of diane mccoys out there she nodded all right but even if public sentiment falls on my side there are still legalities well handle them one at a time as far as the insurance theyll get their money back well pay it back if we have to well do what we have to do together when she heard that a weight lifted i dont know where to start he rose came around to her crouched at her feet i want you to do this for me thats selfish but i cant help it but i want you to do it for yourself too be sure ill be nell todd ill have a name i want she saw his expression alter the deepening of emotion in his gaze and knew she had never been more sure of anything im afraid of him and i cant help that either but i think i realize ill never stop until this is done i want to live with you i want to sit out on the porch at night and look at the stars i want that beautiful ring you bought me on my finger i want so many things with you i thought id never have im scared and i want to stop being scared i know a lawyer in boston well call him and well start okay she let out a breath okay theres one thing i can take care of right now he straightened walked over and opened a drawer in his desk her heart gave a lovely little flutter when she saw the box in his hand ive been carting this around with me putting it in here or in my dresser at home lets put it where it belongs she got to her feet held out her hand yes lets her stomach was jumping when she left to walk back to the bookstore but there was anticipation tangled with the nerves and every time she looked down at the deep blue stone on her finger anticipation won she walked in sent a wave to lulu and practically floated upstairs to mias office i need to tell you mia turned from her keyboard all right i could spoil your moment by saying congratulations and i know youll be very happy together but i wont you saw my ring little sister i saw your face however jaded she considered herself about love the sight of it warmed her heart but i want to see the ring she leaped up snatched nells left hand a sapphire she couldnt stop the sigh its a love gift as a ring it sends out healing and can also be used as protection against evil beyond all that its a doozy she kissed nell on either cheek im happy for you we talked to a lawyer someone zack knows in boston my lawyer now hes going to help me with the complications and with the divorce hes going to file a restraining order against evan i know its only a piece of paper its a symbol theres power in that yeah in a day or two once hes got everything in place hell contact evan so hell know with or without a restraining order hell come mia i know he will you may be right was this what shed been feeling the dread the building of pressure the last leaves had died and the first snow had yet to fall but youre prepared and youre not alone zack and ripley will meet every ferry that comes here after hes been contacted if you dont plan to move in with zack right away then youll stay with me tomorrows the sabbat ripleys agreed to participate when the circles joined he cant break it that i can promise you she intended to tell ripley next if she could find her but the minute nell stepped outside she was stricken with a wave of nausea that rolled thick and greasy through her belly she staggered a little sweat popping out on her skin with no choice she leaned back against the wall of the building and waited for it to pass when the worst of it eased she regulated her breathing the jitters she told herself everything was going to start happening now and happening very fast thered be no turning back there would be questions and press and stares murmurs even from people shed come to know it was natural to be a little queasy she looked down at her ring again the hopeful glint of it and the lingering dregs of sickness passed she would find ripley later she decided right now she was going to buy a bottle of champagne and the makings for a good yankee pot roast evan drove off the ferry and onto three sisters as nell leaned weakly against the wall of the bookstore he surveyed the docks disinterested the beach unimpressed following the instructions hed been given he drove to high street and pulled up in front of the magick inn a holeinthewall in a town suitable for middleclass currier and ives buffs he judged he got out of the car studied the street just as nell turned the corner into the market he walked inside and checked in hed booked a suite but found no charm in the coffered ceilings the lovingly preserved antiques he detested the fussiness of such rooms preferring the streamlined the modern the art if one could call it that ran to misty watercolors and seascapes the minibar didnt hold his favored brand of mineral water and the view he could see nothing but beach and water noisy gulls and what he supposed were fishing boats run by locals dissatisfied he walked to the parlor from there he could see the curve of the land and the sudden sharp jut of cliffs where the lighthouse stood he noted the stone house as well and wondered what type of idiot would choose to live in such an isolated spot then he found himself squinting there seemed to be some sort of light dappling through the trees a trick of the eye he decided already bored in any case he had hardly come for the scenery thank the lord hed come to look for helen or to satisfy himself that what was left of her was still at the bottom of the pacific on an island this size he was sure he could get the task done in a day he unpacked meticulously hanging his clothes so that each garment was aligned precisely one inch from the next he set out his toiletries including his triplemilled soap he never used the amenities offered in hotels even the idea of it revolted him and last he set the framed photograph of his wife on the bureau he leaned over kissed the curved bow of her mouth through the glass if youre here darling helen ill find you on his way out he made a reservation for dinner the only meal he found acceptable to eat in a hotel room was breakfast he stepped out turned left just as nell with her two bags of groceries swung around the end of the block to the right toward home it was nell was sure the happiest morning of her life the sky was silver with sweeps and rises of rose and gold and deep red her lawn was carpeted with leaves that would crunch merrily underfoot and had left the trees bare and spooky which was perfect for an island halloween she had a man sleeping in her bed who had shown his appreciation for a good pot roast in a very satisfactory way muffins were baking the wind was shivering and she was prepared to face her demons she would be leaving her little cottage behind soon and that she would miss but the idea of setting up housekeeping with zack made up for it they would spend christmas together she thought maybe even be married by then if all the legal tangles could be unraveled she wanted to be married outside in the air it was impractical but it was what she wanted she would wear a long dress of velvet blue velvet and carry a spray of white flowers the people she had come to know would all be there to bear witness while she daydreamed the cat meowed piteously diego she bent down stroked him he was no kitten now but a sleek young cat i forgot to feed you im very scattered of brain today she told him im in love and im getting married youll come to live with us in our house by the sea and make friends with lucy she got out his kibble filling his bowl while he wound excitedly through her legs a woman who talks to her cat could be considered strange nell didnt jump which pleased both of them instead she rose and walked to zack who stood in the doorway he might be my familiar but im told thatll be up to him good morning sheriff todd good morning ms channing can i buy a cup of coffee and a muffin payment first he came to her wrapped her up in a long deep kiss that do it oh yeah just let me give you your change she drew him down again lingered over the taste of him im so happy at precisely eightthirty evan sat down to a breakfast of sweetened coffee fresh orange juice an eggwhite omelette and two slices of whole wheat toast hed already made use of the hotel health club such as it was he had only glanced at the pool he disliked using public swimming pools but had considered it until hed seen it was already being used a long lean brunette was streaking through the water as if she was in a race hed thought hed only caught glimpses of her face as she turned it rhythmically in and out of the water in time with her strokes and he didnt see as he dismissed her and walked away her sudden loss of pace the way she pulled up in the water as if gathering for attack how she shoved her goggles treading water as she looked around for what had felt like an enemy hed showered in his room dressed in a pale gray sweater and dark slacks he glanced at his watch ready to be annoyed if his meal should be above one minute late but it arrived just as requested he didnt chat with the waiter he never did such foolish things the man was paid to deliver food not to fraternize with guests he enjoyed his breakfast surprised that he could find no fault with it as he read the morning paper and listened to the news on the parlor television he considered how best to do what hed come to do walking through the village as hed done yesterday driving around the island as he planned to do today might not be enough still it wouldnt do to ask people if they knew anyone of helens description people never minded their own business and there would be questions speculation attention if by some chance helen was alive and here the less attention paid to him the better if she were what would she do she had no skills how could she earn a living without him to provide for her unless of course shed used her body to entice yet another man women were at the center whores he had to sit back and wait for the fury to pass it was difficult to think in logical steps through anger however justified he would find her he reassured himself if she was alive he would find her he would simply know and that took him to what would be done when and if he did there was no question that she would have to be punished for distressing him for deceiving him for attempting to break free of the promises shed made to him the inconvenience the embarrassment of it all couldnt be calculated he would take her back to california of course but not right away they would need to go somewhere quiet somewhere private first so he could remind her of those promises so he could remind her who was in charge they would say shed been thrown from the car that shed struck her head or some such thing shed had amnesia and had wandered away from the scene of the accident the press would love it evan decided they would eat it up they would work out the details of the story once they were settled in that private quiet place if none of that was possible if she tried to refuse him to run again to go crying to the police as shed done before he would have to kill her he made the decision as coolly as he had decided what to have for breakfast her choices were just as simple in his opinion live or die at the knock on his door evan folded the paper precisely walked over to answer good morning sir the young maid said cheerfully you requested housekeeping service between nine and ten thats right he checked his watch noted it was ninethirty he had lingered over his thoughts longer than hed planned i hope youre enjoying your stay would you like me to start in the bedroom yes he sat with his last cup of coffee watched a report on a fresh hot spot in eastern europe that couldnt have interested him less it was too early to call the coast and see if there was anything he needed to know but he could call new york he had a deal cooking there and it wouldnt hurt to stir the pot he went into the bedroom to retrieve his memo book and found the maid her arms full of fresh linen staring at the framed photograph of helen is there a problem what she flushed no sir im sorry she moved quickly to make the bed you were looking at this photograph very intently why is that shes a lovely woman his voice was sending skitters up her spine she wanted to get the suite clean and get out yes she is my wife helen the way you looked at the photograph i thought perhaps you might have met her at some time or other oh no sir i doubt it its just that she reminded me of someone he had to consciously stop his teeth from grinding oh she really looks a lot like nell except nell doesnt have all that beautiful hair or that look of i dont know polish i guess youd say really his blood began to sizzle but he kept his voice mild now almost friendly thats interesting my wife would be fascinated to know theres a woman who looks that much like her nell helens mother had called her nell a simple inelegant name he had always disliked it does she live on the island this nell oh sure shes lived here since early summer in the yellow cottage runs the café at the bookstore does catering too cooks like a dream you should try the café for lunch theres a soupandsandwich special every day and you cant beat it i might do that he said very softly nell strolled through the back door of café book called out a casual greeting to lulu then continued upstairs once she was there she moved like lightning just under two minutes later she called down in a voice she tried to infuse with frustrated apology mia im sorry but could you come up here a minute ought to be able to set up on her own by now lulu mumbled and earned a slanted look from the boss you ought to be able to give her a break by now mia returned and started upstairs nell stood by one of the café tables where a pretty frosted cake glittered under the lighted birthday candles also on the table were a small wrapped box and three flutes frothy with mimosas happy birthday the sweetness of the gesture made up for being caught off guard as she rarely was mias smile bloomed absolute delight thank you cake she lifted a brow as she picked up a flute mimosas and presents it almost makes it worth turning thirty thirty coming up behind her lulu snorted still a baby when you hit fifty well talk she held out another wrapped box a larger one happy birthday thanks well what first wish first nell ordered and blow out the candles it had been a long time since shed made anything as simple as a wish but she did so now then swept her breath over the candles you have to cut the first piece nell handed her a cake knife all right then i want my presents mia cut then picked up the large box and tore in the throw was soft as water the color of midnight sky scattered over it were the symbols of the zodiac oh lu its fabulous keep you warm its beautiful nell stroked the throw i tried to imagine it when lulu described it but its so much more thank you mia turned rubbed her cheek over lulus before kissing it though pleased color pinched lulus cheeks she waved mia away go on open nells before she bursts its just that they made me think of you nell began as mia set the throw aside to open the little box inside were earrings a dangle of silver stars twinkling against tiny globes of moonstone theyre wonderful mia held them up to the light before she kissed nell and perfect particularly today she added holding out her arms she was wearing black again but the sleek sweep of the dress was picked out in tiny silver stars and moons i couldnt resist it for halloween and now these she made quick work of slipping off the earrings shed put on that morning and replacing them with nells just top it off okay then lulu raised her glass to hitting the big threeoh oh lulu dont spoil it but mia laughed as she clicked glasses i want cake she lifted her little silver watch that dangled from one of her chains were going to open just a few minutes late today it wasnt difficult to find the yellow cottage evan drove past it slowing his car to study the small house tucked among the trees little better than a shack was his opinion and the insult of it nearly choked him she would live in that hovel rather than in the beautiful homes hed provided for her he had to fight the urge to go to the café to drag her out and into the street public scenes he reminded himself were not the way to deal with a deceitful wife such things required privacy he drove back to the village parked his car then went back on foot his blood was already bubbling careful study showed him that none of the neighboring houses were close enough to worry him still he strolled into the trees first circled around stood in their shadows watching the house when nothing moved nothing stirred he crossed to the back door there was a wave of something something strong and fretful it seemed to push against him as if to bar him from the door for a moment it laid what might have been fear over his skin and he actually found himself stepping back off the stoop fury bubbled burned away that fear while the stars hanging from the eaves chimed madly in a sudden gust of wind he shoved through what seemed like a wall of solid air and gripped the doorknob she didnt even lock the house he thought in disgust as he let himself in see how careless she was how foolish he saw the cat and nearly snarled he detested animals filthy creatures they stared at each other for one long moment then diego streaked away evan scanned the kitchen then began to walk through the cottage he wanted to see how his dead wife had been living this past year he could hardly wait to see her again chapter twenty contents prev she started to head home half a dozen times that afternoon but there was so much fun in the village most of the merchants had decked themselves out in costumes to celebrate the day there were demons selling hardware and fairies ringing up produce she had a late lunch with ripley and an impromptu meeting with dorcas about catering a christmas party and it seemed that every second person she passed stopped her to congratulate her on her engagement she belonged to the village she thought to zack and finally finally she belonged to herself she swung by the station house to make a date with zack to hand out the goody bags shed already made up for the ghosts and goblins expected at dusk i might be a little late have to run herd on some of the older kids zack told her ive already dealt with a couple of teenagers who tried to convince me the twelve rolls of toilet paper they were buying were for their mothers how did you get the toilet paper for rolling houses when you were a kid i stole it out of the bathroom closet at home like anyone with half a brain her dimples deepened any more exploding pumpkins no i think the word got out on that he cocked his head you sure look chipper today i am chipper today she stepped forward wrapped her arms around his neck hed just gotten his arms around her when his phone rang hold that thought he told her and answered sheriffs office yeah mrs stubens hmm he stopped lowering his hip to the corner of the desk and stood straight again is anybody hurt good no just stay right there im on my way nancy stubens he told nell as he strode over to the coat rack for his jacket teaching her boy how to drive he ran straight into the bigelows parked honda civic but is he all right yeah ill just go sort things out for them it might take a while that honda was brandnew you know where to find me she walked out with him felt a nice steady glow when he leaned down to kiss her goodbye then they walked in opposite directions shed gone half a block when gladys macey hailed her nell hold on puffing a little at the effort to catch up gladys patted her heart let me see that ring im hearing so much about before nell could offer her hand gladys was grabbing it bending over close to get a good long look should have known that todd boy would do a good job she gave a nod of approval then looked up at nell you got a winner there and i dont mean the ring i know it i watched him grow up once he got some man on him if you know what i mean i used to wonder what sort of woman would catch his fancy i like knowing its you ive got a fondness for you mrs macey undone nell hugged her thank you youll be good for him she patted nells back and hell be good for you i know youve had some troubles she simply nodded as nell drew back you had something in your eyes when you came here its not there much anymore i left all that behind im happy it shows have you set the date no not yet nell thought of lawyers of conflict of evan she would deal with it she told herself with all of it as soon as we can i want a frontrow seat at the wedding youll have one and all the champagne you can drink at our thirtieth anniversary party ill hold you to it well ive got to get on monstersll come knocking at the door before long and i dont want my windows soaped you tell that man of yours i said he did well i will that man of hers nell thought as she began to walk again what a wonderful phrase she quickened her steps she was going to have to hurry to beat dusk she went to the front of the cottage glancing around a bit selfconsciously secure that she was alone in the lowering light she held her arms out toward her jackolanterns breathed in focused it took some work a hard slap of effort and a match would certainly have been quicker but it wouldnt have given her the same rush as watching the candles spurt flame and the pumpkins glow from the fire in her mind boy she let out her breath on a quick laugh boy oh boy that was so cool it wasnt just the magic she decided it was the knowing who and what she was it was finding her strength her purpose and her heart taking back control so that she could share it with a man who believed in her whatever happened tomorrow or a year from tomorrow she was now and always nell she danced up the steps and into the front door diego im home you wouldnt believe the day ive had absolutely the best day she twirled into the kitchen flipping on the light she put on the kettle for tea before beginning to fill a big wicker basket with her goody bags i hope we get a lot of kids its been years since ive done trick or treat i cant wait she opened a cupboard oh for heavens sake i left my car at the bookstore what was i thinking you always were absentminded the mug she reached for slipped like water out of her hand smashed on the counter shattered on the floor a roaring filled her ears as she turned hello helen evan walked slowly toward her its so good to see you she couldnt say his name could make no sound at all she prayed it was another vision a hallucination but he reached out and those slender fingers brushed her cheek she went cold to the marrow ive missed you did you think i wouldnt come those fingers slid around the back of her neck now and brought on a hideous wave of nausea wouldnt find you havent i told you helen so many times that nothing would ever keep us apart she only closed her eyes when he bent brushed his mouth over hers what have you done to your hair his hand fisted it tugged viciously you know how i love your hair did you cut it off to displease me a tear slithered down her cheek as she shook her head his voice his touch seemed to drain everything she was away and leave her as shed been she felt nell fading away it does displease me helen youve caused me a great deal of trouble a great deal youve stolen a year of our lives his fingers tightened went biting cruel as he jerked her chin up look at me you stupid little bitch look at me when i speak to you her eyes opened and all she could see were his those clear empty pools youll have to pay for it you know that more than a year erased and all the while youve been living in this miserable little shack laughing at me working as a waitress serving people trying to start your pitiful little business kitchen business humiliating me his hand slid from her cheek to her throat squeezed im going to forgive you after a time helen after a time because i know youre slow and just a bit stupid have you nothing to say to me my love nothing to say after this long separation her lips were cold felt as if they might crack how did you find me he smiled then and made her shudder i told you id always find you wherever you went whatever you did he gave her a hard shove that jammed her back into the counter the pain registered in kind of an absent way like a memory do you know what i found here in your little nest helen helen my whore mens clothing how many men have you slept with slut the kettle began to shriek but neither of them heard did you find yourself some strapping local fisherman let him put his fumbling workingmans hands all over you all over what belongs to me zack it was her first clear thought clear enough that her swimming eyes registered bright fear theres no fisherman she said and barely cried out when he slapped her liar you know how i detest liars theres no the tears escaped at the next slap but it snapped her back to who she was she was nell channing and she would fight keep away from me keep away she grabbed for the knife block but he was quicker hed always been quicker is this what you want he drew the long jaggededged blade free turned it in the light an inch from her nose she braced herself she thought so hell kill me after all instead he reared back smashing the side of her face with a vicious backhanded slap that sent her flying she crashed into the table striking her head against the edge of the thick wood the world went bright went dark she didnt feel her body hit the floor mia treated a young space explorer the bookstore was one of the most popular spots on halloween she had dancing skeletons grinning pumpkins flying ghosts and of course a coven of witches her usual store music had been replaced with howls and shrieks and rattling chains she was having the time of her life she served a cowboy ghoul a cup of punch from a cauldron as the dry ice packed beneath it sent out curls of smoke his eyes were huge as he watched her are you gonna ride on your broomstick tonight of course she bent down what kind of a witch would i be otherwise the witch who chased dorothy was a bad witch she was a very bad witch mia agreed i happen to be a very good one she was ugly and had a green face youre pretty he giggled and slurped his punch thank you very much you on the other hand are very scary she handed him a bag of candy i hope you wont trick me huhuh thanks lady he dropped the bag in his begging sack then ran off to find his mother amused mia started to straighten the pain came fast bright like a spear of light through the temple she saw a man with pale eyes and bright hair and the gleam of the blade call zack she rushed to the door calling out to a startled lulu theres trouble nells in trouble call zack she raced into the street swung around a group of costumed children and nearly plowed into ripley nell i know it ripleys head was still ringing we have to hurry she came to slowly her vision fractured her head screaming there was absolute silence she rolled moaning and managed to get to her hands and knees nausea sent her curling into a ball again the kitchen was dark now lit only by the faint glow of a candle in the center of the table he sat there in one of her kitchen chairs she could see his shoes the gleam of them the perfect crease in his slacks and she wanted to weep why do you make me punish you helen i can only think you must enjoy it he nudged her with his shoe is that it she started to crawl away just a moment she prayed give me one moment to breathe and i can find my strength again he simply pressed his foot into her back were going to go somewhere where we can be alone where we can discuss all this foolishness all this trouble youve caused me he frowned a little how was he to get her away he hadnt meant to put marks on her not where they could be noticed she had pushed him to it well walk to my car he decided youll wait there for me while i pack and check out she shook her head she knew it was useless but she shook her head then began to cry quietly when she felt diego brush against her legs youll do exactly as i say he tapped the tip of the knife against the table if you dont youll leave me no choice people already believe youre dead helen beliefs can easily become reality his head snapped up as he heard a sound outside the door perhaps the fishermans come calling he whispered and rose turning the knife in his hand zack opened the door hesitating cursing as the phone on his belt rang the break in stride saved his life he caught a blur of movement a glimpse of the blade hacking down he twisted going for his weapon with a crossbody draw the knife ripped through his shoulder instead of burying itself in his heart nell screamed gained her feet only to have her head spin and send her staggering in the dark kitchen she could see the two silhouettes struggle a weapon she thought biting her lip to keep from passing out again the bastard would not take what was hers he would not harm what she loved she stumbled for the knife block but it was gone she turned back prepared to leap to use teeth and nails and saw evan standing over zacks body the knife dripping in his hand oh my god no no your knight in shining armor helen is this the man youve been fucking behind my back hes not dead yet i have a right to kill him for trying to steal my wife dont she drew in a breath released it struggled to gather herself and find her core of strength ill go with you ill do anything you want you will anyway evan commanded he doesnt matter she began to edge around the counter saw diego crouched teeth bared he doesnt matter to either of us its me you want isnt it you came all this way for me he would go after her if she could get out the door hed go after her and leave zack it took all her will to keep herself from throwing herself down over zack to shield him if she did if she so much as looked at him now they were both dead i knew you would she continued every muscle trembling as she watched evan lower the knife to his side i always knew evan took one step toward her and the cat leaped like a tiger on his back with his howl of rage in her ears nell ran she veered toward the street toward the village but even as she glanced back he was coming through the door she would never make it so it would be the two of them after all putting her faith in the fates she dived into the trees zack pulled himself to his knees as evan bolted out the door the pain was like hot teeth gnawing at his shoulder blood dripped from his fingers as he got to his feet then he thought of nell and forgot the pain he was flying out the door just as the trees swallowed her and the man who pursued her zack he paused only to flick a terrified glance at his sister and mia hes after her hes got a knife and she doesnt have much lead ripley bit down on the worry his shirt was soaked with blood she nodded drew her weapon as he did whatever youve got she said to mia we use she plunged into the woods behind her brother in the dark of the moon the night was blind she ran like a wild thing tearing through brush leaping over fallen branches if she could lose him get him deep enough in and lose him she could circle back to zack she prayed with every beat of her heart that he was alive she could hear evan behind her close too close her breath was coming in gasps tattered by fear but his was a steady determined beat dizziness swept over her urged her to drop to her knees she fought it off nearly stumbled she would not lose now then his body slammed into hers and sent her sprawling she rolled kicked her only thought to get free of him then froze when he yanked her head back by her short cap of hair and pressed the knife tip to her throat her body emptied went limp as a dolls why dont you just do it she said wearily just end it you ran from me there was as much bafflement as rage in his voice you ran and ill keep running until you kill me ill keep running id rather be dead than live with you ive already died once so do it ive stopped being afraid of you she felt the blade bite at the sound of running feet he dragged her up even with a knife at her throat she felt joy when she saw zack alive the dark stain on his shirt glimmered in the faint starlight but he was alive and nothing mattered more let her go zack took his stance supporting his gun hand with his weak one drop the knife and step away from her ill slit her throat shes mine and i wont hesitate evans eyes passed from zacks to ripleys to mias as they stood in a half circle hurt her and youre dead you wont walk away from here youve no right to interfere between a husband and wife there was something almost reasonable in his voice something sane under the madness helen is my wife legally morally eternally he jerked her head back another inch with the blade throw your guns down and walk away this is my business i cant get a clear shot ripley said under her breath not enough light to be sure its not the way put the gun down ripley mia stretched out her hand the hell with that her finger itched on the trigger the bastard was all she could think as she saw nells exposed throat smelled her brothers blood ripley mia said again soft insistent under the sharp clipped orders from zack to drop the knife to step away damn it damn it you better be right zack didnt hear them theyd ceased to exist for him his only reality was nell ill do more than kill you zack held the gun rock steady and his voice was calm as a lake if you cut her so much as nick her ill take you apart piece by piece ill put bullets in your knees in your balls in your gut ill stand over you and watch while you bleed out the color that rage brought to evans face drained away he believed what he saw in zacks eyes believed the pain and death he saw there and was afraid his hands trembled on the handle of the knife but he didnt move she belongs to me ripleys hand gripped mias nell felt the punch of energy they created felt the hot waves of love and terror that rolled off zack as he stood bleeding for her and felt as she had never felt fear from the man who gripped her her name was nell channing now and always and the man behind her was less than nothing she closed her hand over the pendant mia had given her it vibrated i belong to myself power trickled back into her a slow pool i belong to me and faster and to you she said her eyes locked on zacks hes done hurting me now she lifted her other hand laid it on evans wrist lightly let me go evan and youll walk away well put all of this behind us its your chance the last chance his breath hissed at her ear you stupid bitch do you think ill ever let you go and your choice there was pity in her voice your last the chant was in her head rising as if it had only been waiting for her to free it she wondered how she could have been so afraid of him what youve done to all and me turns back to you one times three from you this night ill forever be free as i will so mote it be her skin glowed like sunlight her pupils dark as stars the knife trembled whispered along her skin away then fell she heard the choking gasp the high whine that couldnt reach a scream as evan collapsed behind her she didnt spare him a glance dont shoot him she said quietly to zack dont kill him like this it wouldnt be good for you because she could see the intent she walked to zack as evan began to moan it wouldnt be good for us hes nothing now she laid a hand over zacks heart felt its wild beat hes what he made himself evan lay on the ground twitching as if something vile slithered under his skin his face was bone white zack lowered the gun wrapped his good arm around nell he held her there a moment as she reached out clasping hands with mia and linking them all stay with them zack told her ill deal with him i wont kill him hell suffer more if he lives ripley watched her brother walk toward the writhing man take out his handcuffs he needed to do this last thing she thought and she needed to let him he gets two minutes to secure and mirandize that smear of slime then i want him taken to the clinic i dont know how bad hes hurt ill take him nell looked down at the blood zacks blood on her hand curled her fist over it and felt life pump ill stay with him courage mia reached out touched the pendant breaks the spell love weaves another she pulled nell into her arms for a fierce hug you did well little sister she turned toward ripley and you found your fate early on the feast of the saints long after the balefires were charmed away before dawn broke the sky nell sat in the kitchen of the yellow cottage her hand resting loosely in zacks she needed to come back to be there to tidy away what had happened and what might have happened shed swept away the negative forces that had lingered and had lit candles and incense i wish youd stayed overnight at the clinic she turned her hand under zacks squeezed i could say the same ive got a few stitches youve got the concussion mild she reminded him and twentythree stitches is more than a few twentythree stitches he thought a long nasty gash the doctor had called it a miracle that no muscle or tendons had been severed zack called it magic nells magic she reached out to touch the fresh white bandage then trailed her fingers over the gold locket you didnt take it off you asked me not to it got hot he told her and brought her gaze back to his an instant before he cut me i could see in my head in that quick blur the blade going toward my heart then being deflected as if it hit a shield i thought i imagined it but i didnt we were stronger than he was nell brought their joined hands to her cheek i was afraid drowning in fear from the minute i heard his voice it took away everything id built everything id learned about myself he paralyzed me sucked out my will that was his power over me but it began to come back and when he hurt you it flooded back but i couldnt think not clearly hitting my head was part of it i suppose you ran to save me and you followed to save me were a couple of heroes he touched her face gently there were bruises on it that he felt throb in his own hes never going to hurt you again ill go in and relieve ripley at dawn and contact the prosecutors office on the mainland a couple of attemptedmurder charges will keep him locked up no matter how fancy his lawyers are im not afraid of him anymore he looked pathetic in the end eaten up by his own cruelty terrified of it his madness is staring back at him now hell never be able to hide it again he could still see evan remingtons colorless eyes wide and wild in a face white as bone a padded rooms as good as a cell she got to her feet to pour more tea but when she came back to the table zack wrapped an arm around her pressed his face into her body its going to take a while for me to get the picture of you with a knife to your throat out of my head she stroked his hair we have a lifetime to put others in its place i want to marry you sheriff todd i want to start that lifetime very soon she slid into his lap sighing as she rested her head on his good shoulder through the window she could see the first streaks of color announcing dawn the pale burn across the sky laying a hand on his heart she timed its beats to her own and knew the truest magic was there turn the page for a preview of heaven and earth the second book in nora robertas three sisters island trilogy hedidnt look so very different from the other passengers on the ferry his long black coat flapped in the wind his hair an ordinary sort of dark blond flew around his face and had no particular style hed remembered to shave and had only nicked himself twice just under the strong line of his jaw his face and it was a good one was hidden behind one of his cameras as he snapped pictures of the island using a long lens his skin still held the tropical tan hed picked up in borneo against it his eyes were the luminous golden brown of honey just bottled his nose was straight and narrow his face a bit thin the hollows in his cheeks tended to deepen when he lost himself in work for long periods and forgot regular meals it gave him an intriguing starvingscholar look his mouth smiled easily sensually he was somewhat tall somewhat lanky and somewhat clumsy he had to grip the rail to keep a shudder of the ferry from pitching him over it hed been leaning out too far of course he knew that but anticipation often made him forget the reality of the moment he steadied himself again dipped into his coat pocket for a stick of gum he came out with an ancient lemon drop a couple of crumpled sheets of notepaper a ticket stub which baffled him as he couldnt quite remember when hed last been to the movies and a lens cap hed thought hed lost he made do with the lemon drop and watched the island hed consulted with a shaman in arizona visited a man who claimed to be a vampire in the mountains of hungary been cursed by a brujo after a regrettable incident in mexico hed lived among ghosts in a cottage in cornwall and had documented the rights and rituals of a necromancer in romania for nearly twelve years macallister booke had studied recorded and witnessed the impossible hed interviewed witches ghosts lycanthropes alien abductees and psychics ninetyeight percent of them were delusional or con artists but the remaining two percent well that kept him going he didnt just believe in the extraordinary hed made it his lifes work the idea of spending the next few months on a chunk of land that legend claimed had been torn from the mainland of massachusetts by a trio of witches and settled as a sanctuary was fascinating to him hed researched three sisters island extensively and had dug up every scrap of information he could find on mia devlin the current island witch she hadnt promised him an interview or access to any of her work but he hoped to persuade her a man who had talked himself into a ceremony held by neodruids should be able to convince a solitary witch to let him watch her work a few spells besides he imagined they could make a trade he had something he was sure would interest her and anyone else who was tied into the threehundredyearold curse he lifted his camera again adjusting the framing to capture the spear of the white lighthouse the brooding ramble of the old stone house both clinging to the high cliffs he knew mia lived there high above the village close to the thick slice of forest just as he knew she owned the village bookstore and ran it successfully a practical witch who by all appearances knew how to live and live well in both worlds he could hardly wait to meet her facetoface the blast of the horn warned him to prepare for docking he walked back to his land rover put his camera in its case on the passenger seat the lens cap in his pocket was once again forgotten while he had these last few minutes to himself he updated some notes then added to the days journal entry the ferry ride was pleasant the days clear and cold i was able to take a number of pictures from different vantage points though ill need to rent a boat for views of the windward side of the island geographically topographically theres nothing unusual about three sisters island its area is approximately nine square miles and its yearround inhabitants largely in the fishing or the retail and tourist trade number less than three thousand it has a small sand beach numerous inlets coves and shale beaches it is partially forested and the indigenous fauna include whitetail deer rabbit raccoon typical seabirds for this area as well as owls hawks and palliated woodpeckers in the forested regions there is one village the majority of the residents live in the village proper or within a halfmile radius though there are some houses and rental units farther afield there is nothing about the islands appearance that would indicate it is a source of paranormal activity but ive found that appearances are unreliable documentary tools im eager to meet mia devlin and begin my study he felt the slight bump of the ferrys docking but didnt look up docked three sisters island january glanced at his watch pm est the village streets were storybook tidy the traffic light mac drove through circled logging various spots on his tape recorder he could find an ancient mayan ruin in the jungle with a map scribbled on a crushed napkin but he had a habit of forgetting more pedestrian locations bank post office market ah pizzeria hot damn he found a parking place without trouble only a stop down from café book he liked the look of the place immediately the display window the view of the sea he fished around for his briefcase tossed the minirecorder inside just in case and climbed out he liked the look of the store even more on the inside the cheerful fire in a stone hearth the big checkout counter carved with moons and stars seventeenth century he decided and suitable for a museum mia devlin had taste as well as talent he started to cross to it and the little gnomelike woman sitting on a high stool behind it a movement a flash of color caught his attention mia stepped out of the stacks and smiled good afternoon can i help you his first clear thought was wow im ah hmm im looking for ms devlin mia devlin and youve found her she walked toward him held out a hand macallister booke yeah her hand was long and narrow rings sparkled on it like jewels on white silk he was afraid to squeeze too hard welcome to three sisters why dont you come upstairs ill buy you a cup of coffee or perhaps some lunch were very proud of our café ah i wouldnt mind some lunch ive heard good things about your café perfect i hope your trip in was uneventful up till now he thought it was fine thanks he followed her up the stairs i like your store so do i i hope youll make use of it during your stay on the island this is my friend and the artist of our café nell todd nell dr booke nice to meet you she showed her dimples and leaned over the counter to shake his hand dr booke has just arrived from the mainland and i imagine he could use some lunch on the house dr booke just tell nell what youd like ill take the sandwich special and a large cappuccino thanks do you do the baking too thats right i recommend the apple brown betty today ill try it mia nell asked just a cup of the soup and the jasmine tea coming up ill bring your orders out i can see im not going to have to worry about my next meal while im here mac commented as they took a window table nell also owns and runs sisters catering she delivers good to know he blinked twice but her face the sheer glory of it didnt dim okay i just have to get this out and i hope youre not offended youre the most beautiful woman ive ever seen in my life thank you she sat back and im not the least bit offended good i dont want things to start off on the wrong foot since im hoping to work with you and as i explained over the phone i dont work for audiences im hoping youll change your mind after you get to know me better he had a potent smile she decided charmingly crooked deceptively harmless well see about that as for your interest in the island itself and its history you wont lack for data the majority of the permanent residents here are from families whove lived on sisters for generations todd for instance he said glancing back toward the counter nell married a todd just a little under two weeks ago in fact zachariah todd our sheriff while shes new to the island the todds have indeed lived here for generations he knew who nell was the former wife of evan remington a man who had once wielded considerable power and influence in the entertainment industry a man who had been found to be a violent abuser and who was now deemed legally insane and under lock and key it had been sheriff todd whod arrested him right here on three sisters after what were reputed to be strange events on halloween night the sabbat of samhain it was something mac intended to explore in more depth even as he started to bring it up something in mias expression warned him to bide his time there looks great thanks he said instead to nell as she served their lunch enjoy mia is tonight still good for you absolutely ill come up about seven then let me know if you need anything else dr booke nells just back from her honeymoon mia said in a quiet voice when she was alone with him again i dont think questions about certain areas of her life are appropriate just now all right are you always so cooperative dr booke mac probably not but i dont want to make you mad right off the bat he bit into his sandwich good he managed really good she leaned forward toyed with her soup lulling the natives into complacency youre really good too do you have psychic abilities dont we all on some level didnt one of your papers explore the development of what you called the neglected sixth sense youve read my work i have what i am mac isnt something i neglect neither is it something i exploit or allow to be exploited i agreed to rent you the cottage and to talk with you when the mood strikes me because of one simple thing okay what you have a brilliant and more important a flexible mind i admire that as far as trusting that time will tell she glanced over and gestured and here comes a bright enough and very inflexible mind deputy ripley todd mac looked over saw the attractive brunette stride on long legs to the café counter lean on it chat with nell ripleys another common surname on the island yes shes zacks sister their mother was a ripley they have long ties on both sides of their family to the sisters very long ties mia repeated if youre looking for a cynic to weigh in on your research ripleys your girl unable to resist mia caught ripleys attention and motioned her over ordinarily ripley would merely have sneered and walked in the opposite direction but a strange face on the island usually bore checking out a goodlooking guy she thought as she strolled over in a bookish kind of way as soon as the thought hit her brows drew together bookish mias doctor of freakology dr macallister booke deputy ripley todd nice to meet you he got to his feet surprising ripley with his length as he unfolded himself from the chair most of his height she judged was leg i didnt know they gave out degrees for the study of crapola isnt she adorable mia beamed i was just telling mac that he should interview you for your narrow closed mind after all it wouldnt take much time yawn ripley hooked her thumbs in her pockets and studied macs face i dont think id have much to say that youd want to hear mias the goddess of woowoo stuff around here you have any questions about the practicalities of daytoday life on the island you can usually find me or the sheriff around appreciate it oh ive only got a masters in crapola havent finished my thesis on that one yet her lips twitched cute that your rover out front yes had he left the keys in it again he wondered already patting pockets is there a problem no nice ride im going to grab some lunch she isnt abrasive and annoying on purpose mia said when ripley walked away she was born that way its okay he sat again picked up his meal where hed left off i get a lot of that kind of thing he nodded at mia i imagine you do too now and then youre awfully well adjusted and affable arent you dr macallister booke afraid so its pretty boring i dont think so mia picked up her tea studied him over the rim no i dont think so at all heaven and earth three sisters island nora roberts to all my sisters not of blood but of the heart theres the magic swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion william shakespeare prologue three sisters island september she called the storm the gales of wind the bolts of lightning the rage of the sea that was both prison and protection she called the forces those that lived within her those that dwelled without the bright and the dark slender with her cloak streaming back like birdwings she stood alone on the windwhipped beach alone but for her rage and her grief and her power it was that power that filled her now rushed inside her in wild pounding strokes like a lover gone mad and so perhaps it was she had left husband and children to come to this place left them under a spellsleep that would keep them safe and unaware once she had done what she had come to do she could never go back to them she would never again hold their muchloved faces in her hands her husband would grieve for her and her children weep but she could not go back to them and she could not would not turn from the path she had chosen payment must be made and justice however rough would be met at last she stood arms outflung in the tempest she had conjured her hair flew free and wild dark ribbons that slashed at the night like whips you must not do this thing a woman appeared beside her burning as bright in the storm as the fire after which she was named her face was pale her eyes dark with what might have been fear it is already begun stop it now sister stop before it is too late you have no right right she who was called earth whirled her eyes glowing fierce who has better right when they murdered the innocents in salem town persecuted and hunted and hanged we did nothing to stop it stop one flood cause another you know this we made this place fire stretched out her arms as if to encompass the island that rocked in the sea for our safety and our survival for our craft safety you can speak of safety of survival now our sister is dead and i grieve for her as you do pleading she crossed her hands between her breasts my heart weeps as yours weeps her children are in our keeping now will you abandon them as well as your own there was a madness in her tearing at her heart as the wind tore at her hair even recognizing it she could not defeat it he will not go unpunished he will not live while she does not if you cause harm youll have broken your vows you will have corrupted your power and what you send out in the night will come back to you threefold justice has a price not this never this your husband will lose a wife your children a mother and i another beloved sister more even more than that you break faith with what we are she would not have wanted this this would not have been her answer she died rather than protect herself died for what she is for what we are our sister abjured power for what she called love and it killed her her choice one that stayed bitter in the throat long after it was swallowed and still she harmed none do this thing use your gift in this dark way and you doom yourself you doom us all i cannot live hidden here there were tears in her eyes now and in the stormlight they burned red as blood i cannot turn from this my choice my destiny i take his life for hers and damn him for all time and calling for vengeance shooting it like a bright and deadly arrow from a bow she who was known as earth sacrificed her soul one three sisters island january sand frosted with cold crunched under her feet as she ran along the curving shore incoming waves left froth and bubbles lying on the crusted surface like tattered lace overhead the gulls called relentlessly her muscles had warmed and moved fluid as oiled gears in the second mile of her morning run her pace was a fast and disciplined jog and her breath rushed out in white plumes and rushed in sharp and cold as shards of ice she felt fabulous the wintry beach held no footprints but her own and hers were stamped new over old as she jogged back and forth across the gentle sweep of winter beach if shed chosen to do her three miles in one straight line she could have crossed three sisters from side to side at its widest point the idea of that always pleased her the little clump of land off the coast of massachusetts was hers every hill every street every cliff and inlet deputy ripley todd felt more than affection for three sisters its village its residents its wellbeing she felt responsibility she could see the rising sun glint against the windows of storefronts on high street in a couple of hours the shops would open people would walk along the streets going about the days business there wasnt much of a tourist trade in january but some would come over from the mainland on the ferry poke about in the shops drive up to the cliffs buy some fresh fish right off the docks for the most part though the winter was for islanders she loved the winter best at the end of the beach where it bumped the edge of the seawall just below the village she pivoted and headed back across the sand fishing boats plied an ocean that was the color of pale blue ice it would change as the light strengthened as the sky deepened it never failed to fascinate her how many colors water could hold she saw carl maceys boat and a figure tiny as a toy in the stern raised a hand she saluted back kept running with under three thousand islanders yearround it wasnt hard to know who was who she slowed her pace a bit not only to cool down but to prolong the solitude she often took her morning runs with her brothers dog lucy but this morning she had slipped out alone alone was another thing she liked best and shed wanted to clear her mind there was a great deal to think about some of which she preferred not to so she tucked those annoyances and problems away for now what had to be dealt with wasnt precisely a problem you couldnt call something that made you happy a problem her brother was just back from his honeymoon and nothing could have pleased her more than to see how happy he and nell were together after all theyd been through and what it had nearly cost seeing them cozied up together in the house where she and zack had grown up was pure satisfaction and over the past months since summer when nell had ended her flight from fear on the island theyd become real friends it was a pleasure to see the way nell had bloomed and toughened but all that mushy stuff aside ripley thought there was one little blight on the rose and its name was ripley karen todd newlyweds didnt need to share their love nest with the grooms sister she hadnt given the matter a thought before the wedding and even after when shed waved them both off for a week in bermuda she hadnt seen the whole picture but when theyd returned all snuggling and flushed with a honeymoon haze it couldnt have been more clear justmarrieds needed privacy they could hardly have hot spontaneous sex on the living room floor if she might stroll into the house any time of the day or night not that either of them had said anything about it but they wouldnt the pair of them might as well wear werenicepeople merit badges plastered on their chests and that ripley thought was something she would never be pinning on her own shirt she stopped used the outcropping of rocks at the far end of the beach for support as she stretched out calves hamstrings quadriceps her body was as lean and toned as a young tigers she took pride in it in her control over it as she bent from the waist the ski cap that shed tugged on fell to the sand and her hair the color of varnished oak tumbled free she wore it long because it didnt require regular trims and styling that way it was just another type of control her eyes were a sharp bottle green when she was in the mood she might fuss with mascara and eyeliner after considerable debate shed decided her eyes were the best part of a face made up of mismatched features and angular lines she had a slight overbite because shed despised her retainer and she had the wide forehead and nearly horizontal dark eyebrows of the ripley side of the family no one would have accused her of being pretty it was too soft a word and would have insulted her in any case she preferred knowing it was a strong and sexy face the kind that could attract men when she was in the mood for one which she hadnt been she mused for several months part of that was wedding plans holiday plans the time shed spent helping zack and nell unwind legal tangles so they could be married and another part she was forced to admit was her own sense of annoyance and unease that lingered from halloween when shed ripped open pockets in herself that she had purposely sewn shut years before couldnt be helped she thought now shed done what needed to be done and had no intention of a repeat performance no matter how many cool smirky glances mia devlin shot her way the thought of mia brought ripley back full circle mia had an empty cottage nell had rented it then moved out when she married zack as much as ripley hated the idea of having any sort of dealings even straight business with mia the yellow cottage was the perfect solution it was small private simple it just made sense ripley decided and started up the worn wooden steps that zagged from the beach toward the house it was irritating but it was practical still maybe it wouldnt hurt if she took a few days let the word out that she was looking for a place to rent something something that didnt belong to mia might drop in her lap cheered by the possibility ripley bounded up the steps jogged to the back porch nell would already be baking she knew just as she knew the kitchen would smell like heaven the biggest advantage was that she wouldnt have to hunt up breakfast it would just be there delicious delightful and on demand as she reached for the doorknob she saw through the glass zack and nell they were wrapped around each other she thought like ivy on a flagpole wrapped around each other and wrapped up in each other oh man hissing out a breath she backtracked then came back up on the porch stomping like a horse and whistling it would give them time to peel themselves off each other at least she hoped it would but it didnt solve her other problem she was going to have to deal with mia after all she was going to keep it casual to ripleys way of thinking if mia knew she really wanted the yellow cottage she would refuse to rent it the woman was so damn contrary of course the very best way to lock in the deal would be to ask nell to run interference mia had a soft spot for nell but the idea of using anyone to clear the path was galling she would just casually drop in at mias bookstore the way she had almost every day since nell had taken over the cooking and baking for the café section that way she could cop a righteous lunch and new digs all in one swipe she walked briskly along high street more because she wanted the business over and done than because the wind was up and blowing it tugged playfully at the long straight tail of hair that she habitually yanked through the opening in the back of her cap when she reached café book she paused pursed her lips mia had redone the display window a little tasseled footstool a soft throw of deep red and a pair of tall candlestands with fat red candles were arranged with seemingly haphazard piles of books because she knew mia never did anything in a haphazard fashion ripley had to admit the whole tone was one of homey warmth and welcome and subtly very subtly sexy its cold out the window announced come on in and buy some books to take home and snuggle up with whatever else ripley could say about mia and she could say plenty the woman knew her business she stepped inside into warmth automatically unwinding her neck scarf the deepblue shelves were lined with books parlortidy glass displays held pretty trinkets and intriguing dust catchers the fireplace was simmering with a low golden flame and another throw blue this time was tossed artfully over one of the deep sinkintome chairs yeah she thought mia knew her stuff there was more other shelves held candles of various shapes and sizes deep bowls were filled with tumbling stones and crystals colorful boxes of tarot cards and runes were tucked here and there all very subtle again ripley noted with a frown mia didnt advertise that the place was owned by a witch but she didnt hide it either ripley imagined the curiosity factor both tourist and local accounted for a healthy chunk of the stores annual profits none of her business from behind the big carved counter mias head clerk lulu finished ringing up a customers purchases then tipped down her silverframed glasses to peer at ripley over the top of them looking for something for your mind as well as your belly today no ive got plenty to occupy my mind read more know more ripley grinned i already know everything always thought you did anyway got a novelty book in this weeks shipment thats right up your alley pickup lines unisex lu ripley gave her a cocky grin as she strolled to the stairs leading to the shops second level i wrote the book lulu cackled havent seen you keeping company just recently she called out i havent felt like company just recently there were more books on the second floor and more browsers poking through them but here the café was the big draw already ripley could scent the soup of the day something rich and spicy the early crowd which would have snagged nells muffins and turnovers or whatever treat shed dreamed up for the day had shifted to the lunch crowd on a day like this ripley imagined theyd be looking for something hot and hearty before they treated themselves to one of nells sinful desserts she scanned the display and sighed cream puffs nobody in their right mind walked away from cream puffs even if the other choices were equally tempting éclairs tarts cookies and what looked to be a cake made up of many layers of pure gooey sin the artist behind the temptations rang up an order her eyes were a deep and clear blue her hair a short gold halo around a face that glowed with health and wellbeing dimples flashed in her cheeks as she smiled and waved her customer off to one of the café tables arranged by the window marriage ripley thought agreed with some people nell channing todd was one of them you look pretty bouncy today ripley commented feel great the days just flying by soup of the days minestrone sandwich is im just doing soup ripley interrupted because i need one of the cream puffs to ensure my happiness ill take coffee with it coming up im baking a ham for dinner tonight she added so no grabbing pizza before you come home yeah okay sure it reminded ripley of the second stage of business she shifted her feet gave the room another sweeping glance i didnt see mia around anywhere working in her office nell ladled up soup added a crusty roll baked fresh that morning i expect shell breeze through shortly you were in and out of the house so fast this morning i didnt get to talk to you something up no not up maybe it was rude to arrange for alternate living arrangements without saying something first ripley wondered if this fell into the area of social skills a tricky business for her will i be in your way if i chow down in the kitchen she asked nell that way i can talk to you while you work sure come on back nell carried the food over to her worktable are you sure nothings wrong not a thing ripley assured her bitchy cold out i bet you and zack are sorry you didnt stay south until spring the honeymoon was perfect even thinking of it brought on a warm satisfied glow but its better being home nell opened the refrigerator for the container holding one of the days salads everything i want is here zack family friends a home of my own a year ago id never have believed id be standing here like this knowing that in an hour or so id be going home you earned it i did nells eyes darkened and in them ripley could see the core of strength a core that everyone including nell had underestimated but i didnt do it alone the bright ding of the counter bell warned her she had a customer waiting dont let your soup get cold she slipped out her voice lifting in greeting ripley spooned up soup and sighed with contentment at the first taste she would just concentrate on her lunch and think about the rest later but shed barely made a dent in the bowl when she heard nell call mias name ripleys in the kitchen i think she wanted to see you shit shit shit ripley scowled into her soup and got busy filling her mouth well well make yourself at home mia devlin her gypsy mane of red hair tumbling over the shoulders of a long dress of forest green leaned gracefully against the doorjamb her face was a miracle formed of high iceedged cheekbones a full sculpted mouth painted as boldly red as her hair skin smooth as cream and eyes gray as witchsmoke those eyes looked ripley over lazily one brow lifted in a perfect and derisive arch i am ripley continued to eat i figure its nells kitchen this time of day if i thought otherwise id be searching my soup for wool of bat or dragons teeth and its so hard to come by dragons teeth this time of year what can i do for you deputy not a thing but i did give some passing thought to doing something for you now im all agog tall and slim she moved to the table and sat she was wearing those needlethin heels she was so fond of ripley noticed she could never figure out why anyone would put her innocent feet in such torture chambers without a gun being held to her head she broke off another piece of her roll munched you lost yourself a tenant when nell and zack tied the knot i figured you hadnt gotten around to doing anything about renting out the yellow cottage and since im thinking about getting my own place maybe i can help you out do tell intrigued mia broke off a bite of ripleys roll for herself hey im paying for that ignoring her mia nibbled a little too crowded for you at the homestead its a big house ripley gave a careless shrug then moved the rest of her roll out of reach but you happen to have one going empty its a pretty dinky place but i dont need much id be willing to negotiate a lease on it a lease on what nell swung back in straight to the fridge to get out the makings for a sandwich order the yellow cottage mia told her ripleys looking for a place of her own oh but nell turned you have a place of your own with us lets not make this sticky it was too late to regret she hadnt arranged to speak to mia privately i was just thinking itd be cool to have a little place to myself and since mias got one going begging on the contrary mia said smoothly neither i nor my possessions need to beg you dont want me to do you a favor ripley lifted a shoulder no skin off mine its so considerate of you to think of me mias tone was candysweet always a bad sign but as it happens i just signed with a tenant for the cottage not ten minutes ago bullshit you were just up in your office and nell didnt say you were with anyone on the phone mia continued with a gentleman from new york a doctor weve signed a threemonth lease for the cottage via fax i hope that relieves your mind ripley wasnt quite quick enough to mask her annoyance like i said no skin off mine what the hells a doctor going to do for three months on three sisters weve got a doctor onisland hes not a medical doctor hes a phd and as youre so interested hes coming here to work dr booke is a paranormal researcher and hes eager to spend some time on an island conjured by witches fucking a always so succinct amused mia got to her feet well my work here is done i must go see if i can bring joy into someone elses life now she strolled to the door waited a beat before she turned oh hell be here tomorrow im sure hed love to meet you ripley keep your weirdo spook hunters away from me damn it ripley bit into her cream puff shes eating this up dont go anywhere nell lifted her order peg comes on in five i want to talk to you ive got patrol you just wait damn near ruined my appetite ripley complained but managed to devour the cream puff in fifteen minutes she was stalking outside again nell glued to her side we need to talk about this look nell its no big deal i was just thinking yes you were thinking nell yanked her wool cap down over her ears and you didnt say anything to me or to zack i want to know why you feel you cant stay in your own home okay okay ripley put on her sunglasses hunched her shoulders as they started down high toward the station house it just seems to me that when people get married they need privacy its a big house were not in each others way if you were the domestic type i could see you feeling displaced because i have to spend so much of my time in the kitchen thats the least of my worries exactly you dont cook i hope you dont think i resent cooking for you no i dont think that and i appreciate it nell i really do is it because i get up so early no because i took one of the spare bedrooms for an office for sisters catering no jeez nobody was using it ripley felt as though she was being systematically pounded with a velvet bat look look its not about cooking or spare rooms or your baffling habit of getting out of bed before the sun rises its about sex excuse me you and zack have sex nell stopped cocked her head as she studied ripleys face yes we do i dont deny it in fact we have quite a lot of sex there you are ripley before i officially moved into the house zack and i often had sex there it never seemed to be a problem for you that was different that was regular sex now youre having married sex i see well i can assure you the process works in almost exactly the same way harhar nell had come a long way ripley mused thered been a time when even the hint of a confrontation would have had her backing down those days were over its just weird okay you and zack are into the mister and missus thing and youve got me hanging around what if you wanted to do the horizontal tango on the living room rug or just have dinner naked some night weve actually done the first but now ill give some serious consideration to the second ripley nell touched ripleys arm rubbed lightly i dont want you to move out jesus nell its a small island its not like id be hard to reach wherever i landed i dont want you to move she said again im speaking for myself not for zack you can talk to him separately if you want and get his feelings about it ripley i never had a sister before oh man she cringed scanning the area from behind her dark glasses dont get mushy not right out on the street like this i cant help it i like knowing youre there that i can talk to you whenever i only had a few days with your parents when they came back for the wedding but knowing them now and having you i have a family again cant we just leave things the way they are for now anyway does zack ever say no to you once you turn those big blue headlights on him not when he knows its really important to me and if you stay ill promise that when zack and i have sex well pretend were not married it might help anyway since some jerk from new york snagged the cottage right under my nose ill have to let things ride she let out a pained sigh paranormal researcher my butt phd she sneered and felt marginally cheered mia probably rented the place to him just to piss me off i doubt it but im sure shes enjoying that side benefit i wish the two of you wouldnt jab at each other so much id really hoped after after what happened on halloween you would be friends again instantly ripley closed in everybody did what had to be done now its over nothings changed for me only one phase is over nell corrected if the legend the legend is hooey even thinking of it blighted ripleys mood what we are isnt whats inside us isnt and what i do with whats inside me is my business dont go there nell all right but nell squeezed ripleys hand and even through the gloves that both women wore there was a spark of energy ill see you at dinner ripley balled her hand as nell walked away her skin still hummed from the contact sneaky little witch ripley thought she had to admire that dreams came late in the night when her mind was open and her will at rest she could deny by day close herself off stand by the choice shed made more than a decade before but sleep was a power of its own and seduced the dreaming in dreams she stood on the beach where the waves rose like terror they pounded black and bitter on the shore a thousand mad heartbeats under a blind sky the only light was the snakewhips of lightning that slashed each time she raised her arms and the light that came from her was a furious gold edged with murderous red the wind roared the violence of it the sheer unharnessed power of it thrilled her in some deep and secret place she was beyond now beyond right beyond rules beyond hope and part of her still flickering wept grievous tears for the loss she had done what she had done and now wrongs were avenged death to death to death a circle formed by hate one times three she cried out in triumph as the dark smoke of black magic streamed inside her smearing and choking out what she had been what she had vowed what she had believed this she thought as her cupped hands trembled at the force and the greed was better what had come before was pale and weak a soft belly compared to the strength and muscle of what was now she could do all and any she could take and could rule there was nothing and no one to stop her in a mad dance she spun across the sand above it her arms spread like wings her hair falling in coils like snakes she could taste the death of her sisters murderer the bright copper flavor of blood shed spilled and knew she had never supped so well her laughter shot out like bolts cracked the black bowl of the sky a torrent of dark rain fell and hissed on the sand like acid he called her somewhere through the wild night and her own fury she heard his voice the faint glow of what had been inside her struggled to burn brighter she saw him just a shadow fighting through the wind and rain to reach her love warred and wept in a heart gone cold go back she shouted at him and her voice thundered shook the world but still he came on his hands reaching toward her to gather her in to bring her back and she saw just for an instant the gleam of his eyes against the night that was love and fear out of the sky came a lance of fire even as she screamed as that light inside her leaped it speared through him she felt his death inside her the pain and horror of what shed sent out springing back times three and the light inside her winked out left her cold cold cold two he didnt look so very different from the other passengers on the ferry his long black coat flapped in the wind his hair an ordinary sort of dark blond flew around his face and had no particular style hed remembered to shave and had only nicked himself twice just under the strong line of his jaw his face and it was a good one was hidden behind one of his cameras as he snapped pictures of the island using a long lens his skin still held the tropical tan hed picked up in borneo against it his eyes were the luminous golden brown of honey just bottled his nose was straight and narrow his face a bit thin the hollows in his cheeks tended to deepen when he lost himself in work for long periods and forgot regular meals it gave him an intriguing starvingscholar look his mouth smiled easily sensually he was somewhat tall somewhat lanky and somewhat clumsy he had to grip the rail to keep a shudder of the ferry from pitching him over it hed been leaning out too far of course he knew that but anticipation often made him forget the reality of the moment he steadied himself again dipped into his coat pocket for a stick of gum he came out with an ancient lemon drop a couple of crumpled sheets of notepaper a ticket stub which baffled him as he couldnt quite remember when hed last been to the movies and a lens cap hed thought hed lost he made do with the lemon drop and watched the island hed consulted with a shaman in arizona visited a man who claimed to be a vampire in the mountains of hungary been cursed by a brujo after a regrettable incident in mexico hed lived among ghosts in a cottage in cornwall and had documented the rights and rituals of a necromancer in romania for nearly twelve years macallister booke had studied recorded witnessed the impossible hed interviewed witches ghosts lycanthropes alien abductees and psychics ninetyeight percent of them were delusional or con artists but the remaining two percent well that kept him going he didnt just believe in the extraordinary hed made it his lifes work the idea of spending the next few months on a chunk of land that legend claimed had been torn from the mainland of massachusetts by a trio of witches and settled as a sanctuary was fascinating to him hed researched three sisters island extensively and had dug up every scrap of information he could find on mia devlin the current island witch she hadnt promised him interviews or access to any of her work but he hoped to persuade her a man who had talked himself into a ceremony held by neodruids should be able to convince a solitary witch to let him watch her work a few spells besides he imagined they could make a trade he had something he was sure would interest her and anyone else who was tied into the threehundredyearold curse he lifted his camera again adjusting the framing to capture the spear of the white lighthouse the brooding ramble of the old stone house both clinging to the high cliffs he knew mia lived there high above the village close to the thick slice of forest just as he knew she owned the village bookstore and ran it successfully a practical witch who by all appearances knew how to live and live well in both worlds he could hardly wait to meet her facetoface the blast of the horn warned him to prepare for docking he walked back to his land rover put his camera in its case on the passenger seat the lens cap in his pocket was once again forgotten while he had these last few minutes to himself he updated some notes then added to the days journal entry the ferry ride was pleasant the days clear and cold i was able to take a number of pictures from different vantage points though ill need to rent a boat for views of the windward side of the island geographically topographically theres nothing unusual about three sisters island its area is approximately nine square miles and its yearround inhabitants largely in the fishing or the retail and tourist trade number less than three thousand it has a small sand beach numerous inlets coves and shale beaches it is partially forested and the indigenous fauna include whitetail deer rabbit raccoon typical seabirds for this area as well as owls hawks and pileated woodpecker in the forested regions there is one village the majority of the residents live in the village proper or within a halfmile radius though there are some houses and rental units farther afield there is nothing about the islands appearance that would indicate it is a source of paranormal activity but ive found that appearances are unreliable documentary tools im eager to meet mia devlin and begin my study he felt the slight bump of the ferrys docking but didnt look up docked three sisters island january glanced at his watch pm est the village streets were storybook tidy the traffic light mac drove through circled logging various spots on his tape recorder he could find an ancient mayan ruin in the jungle with a map scribbled on a crushed napkin but he had a habit of forgetting more pedestrian locations bank post office market ah pizzeria hot damn he found a parking place without trouble only a stop down from café book he liked the look of the place immediately the display window the view of the sea he fished around for his briefcase tossed the minirecorder inside just in case and climbed out he liked the look of the store even more on the inside the cheerful fire in a stone hearth the big checkout counter carved with moons and stars seventeenth century he decided and suitable for a museum mia devlin had taste as well as talent he started to cross to it and the little gnomelike woman sitting on a high stool behind it a movement a flash of color caught his attention mia stepped out of the stacks and smiled good afternoon can i help you his first clear thought was wow im ah hmm im looking for ms devlin mia devlin and youve found her she walked toward him held out a hand macallister booke yeah her hand was long and narrow rings sparkled on it like jewels on white silk he was afraid to squeeze too hard welcome to three sisters why dont you come upstairs ill buy you a cup of coffee or perhaps some lunch were very proud of our café ah i wouldnt mind some lunch ive heard good things about your café perfect i hope your trip in was uneventful up till now he thought it was fine thanks he followed her up the stairs i like your store so do i i hope youll make use of it during your stay on the island this is my friend and the artist of our café nell todd nell dr booke nice to meet you she showed her dimples and leaned over the counter to shake his hand dr booke has just arrived from the mainland and i imagine he could use some lunch on the house dr booke just tell nell what youd like ill take the sandwich special and a large cappuccino thanks do you do the baking too thats right i recommend the apple brown betty today ill try it mia nell asked just a cup of the soup and the jasmine tea coming up ill bring your orders out i can see im not going to have to worry about my next meal while im here mac commented as they took a window table nell also owns and runs sisters catering she delivers good to know he blinked twice but her face the sheer glory of it didnt dim okay i just have to get this out and i hope youre not offended youre the most beautiful woman ive seen in my life thank you she sat back and im not the least bit offended good i dont want things to start off on the wrong foot since im hoping to work with you and as i explained over the phone i dont work for audiences im hoping youll change your mind after you get to know me better he had a potent smile she decided charmingly crooked deceptively harmless well see about that as for your interest in the island itself and its history you wont lack for data the majority of the permanent residents here are from families whove lived on sisters for generations todd for instance he said glancing back toward the counter nell married a todd just a little under two weeks ago in fact zachariah todd our sheriff while shes new to the island the todds have indeed lived here for generations he knew who nell was the former wife of evan remington a man who had once wielded considerable power and influence in the entertainment industry a man who had been found to be a violent abuser and who was now deemed legally insane and under lock and key it had been sheriff todd whod arrested him right here on sisters island after what were reputed to be strange events on halloween night the sabbat of samhain it was something mac intended to explore in more depth even as he started to bring it up something in mias expression warned him to bide his time there looks great thanks he said instead to nell as she served their lunch enjoy mia is tonight still good for you absolutely ill come up about seven then let me know if you need anything else dr booke nells just back from her honeymoon mia said in a quiet voice when she was alone with him again i dont think questions about certain areas of her life are appropriate just now all right are you always so cooperative dr booke mac probably not but i dont want to make you mad right off the bat he bit into his sandwich good he managed really good she leaned forward toyed with her soup lulling the natives into complacency youre really good too do you have psychic abilities dont we all on some level didnt one of your papers explore the development of what you called the neglected sixth sense youve read my work i have what i am mac isnt something i neglect neither is it something i exploit or allow to be exploited i agreed to rent you the cottage and to talk with you when the mood strikes me because of one simple thing okay what you have a brilliant and more important a flexible mind i admire that as far as trusting that time will tell she glanced over and gestured and here comes a bright enough and very inflexible mind deputy ripley todd mac looked over saw the attractive brunette stride on long legs to the café counter lean on it chat with nell ripleys another common surname on the island yes shes zacks sister their mother was a ripley they have long ties on both sides of their family to the sisters very long ties mia repeated if youre looking for a cynic to weigh in on your research ripleys your girl unable to resist mia caught ripleys attention and motioned her over ordinarily ripley would merely have sneered and walked in the opposite direction but a strange face on the island usually bore checking out a goodlooking guy she thought as she strolled over in a bookish kind of way as soon as the thought hit her brows drew together bookish mias doctor of freakology dr macallister booke deputy ripley todd nice to meet you he got to his feet surprising ripley with his length as he unfolded himself from the chair most of his height she judged was leg i didnt know they gave out degrees for the study of crapola isnt she adorable mia beamed i was just telling mac that he should interview you for your narrow closed mind after all it wouldnt take much time yawn ripley hooked her thumbs in her pockets and studied macs face i dont think id have much to say that youd want to hear mias the goddess of woowoo stuff around here you have any questions about the practicalities of daytoday life on the island you can usually find me or the sheriff around appreciate it oh ive only got a masters in crapola havent finished my thesis on that one yet her lips twitched cute that your rover out front yes had he left the keys in it again he wondered already patting pockets is there a problem no nice ride im going to grab some lunch she isnt abrasive and annoying on purpose mia said when ripley walked away she was born that way its okay he sat again picked up his meal where hed left off i get a lot of that kind of thing he nodded at mia i imagine you do too now and then youre awfully well adjusted and affable arent you dr macallister booke afraid so its pretty boring i dont think so mia picked up her tea studied him over the rim no i dont think so at all mac left his things in the rover and did a solo walkthrough of the yellow cottage hed assured mia he didnt need her to come along the fact was he wanted to get a feel of the place without her she had a strong and distracting presence it was small charmingly quaint and heads above the majority of accommodations he usually had on a research jaunt he knew a lot of people thought he was a man more suited to a dark and dusty library he often was but he was just as much at home in a tent in the jungle so long as he had enough battery power for his equipment the living room here was small and cozy with a sofa that looked comfortably broken in and a little fireplace already set for lighting he decided to take care of that first and patted his pockets absently before he saw the box of wooden matches on the narrow mantel grateful for small favors he got the fire going and continued on his tour because he talked to himself habitually his voice echoed a bit two bedrooms that onell do for a suboffice i think im going to set up primarily in the living room kitchenll do if i get desperate enough to cook nell todd he dug in his pockets again came up with the business card for sisters catering that hed taken from the café counter he laid it in the middle of the stove where he would see it if he thought about cooking he looked out the windows appreciating the woods that tucked in close and the lack of other houses he often worked odd hours here he didnt have any neighbors close enough to complain he tossed the single bag hed brought in with him on the bed in the larger of the two bedrooms dropped his butt on the bed to give it a test bounce the image of mia drifted into his mind down boy he warned himself no carnal thoughts about a woman who might be able to pluck them out of your head and whos also your primary research target satisfied with his living arrangements he headed outside to unload the rover on his second trip he stopped to watch the sheriffs cruiser pull up and ripley climb out deputy todd dr booke she was feeling vaguely guilty about giving him a hard time on their first encounter which she wouldnt have felt she thought resentfully if nell hadnt scolded her about it youve got a lot of stuff here oh this is only part of it ive got more being sent in tomorrow nosy by nature she looked in the back of the rover more than this yeah lots of neat stuff she turned her head neat lots of it sensors scanners and gauges and cameras and computers cool toys he looked so pleased with the idea that she didnt have the heart to smirk ill give you a hand hauling what youve got inside thats okay some of its pretty heavy now she did smirk and hefted a large box out of the back i can handle it no question about that he decided and led the way inside thanks you work out what do you benchpress her brows lifted i do twelve reps of ninety pounds in a set she couldnt get a good gauge of his body type in the long coat and the thick sweater under it you oh about the same considering body weight he walked out again leaving her following and trying to get a sense of his shoulders and his ass what do you do with all this neat stuff study observe record document the occult the paranormal the arcane you know the different freak shows he only smiled not just his mouth she noted but his eyes as well some people think so they hauled the rest of the boxes and bags in together its going to take you a week to unpack he scratched his head scanned the piles now crowding the living space i never mean to bring so much but then you never know what you might need i was just in borneo and couldve kicked myself for not packing my backup energy detector like a motion detector but not he explained you just cant find one of those on borneo i bet ill show you he shrugged out of his coat tossed it carelessly aside before hunkering down to paw through a box surprise surprise ripley thought dr weird had one excellent butt see this ones handheld completely portable i designed it myself it put her in mind of a little geiger counter though she didnt think shed ever seen an actual geiger counter it detects and measures positive and negative force he explained simply put it reacts to charged particles in the air or in a solid object even water except this one isnt submersible im working on one that will be i can hook this up when i need to to my computer and generate a graphic printout of the size and density of the force and other pertinent data uhhuh she gave a quick glance at his face he looked so earnest she thought so pleased with his little handheld gadget youre really a total geek arent you yeah pretty much he flipped his unit on to check the batteries ive always been into the paranormal and electronics i found a way to indulge myself on both levels whatever floats your boat but she scanned the piles of boxed equipment it looked like radio shack had exploded all this hightech junk lots of dough i bet mmm he wasnt giving her his full attention his activated sensor was giving off a low but definite reading do they give you grants for stuff like this umm maybe but i never needed one im a really rich geek no kidding dont let mia know or shell jack up the rent curious she wound her way through the boxes shed always liked the little cottage well enough and was still a bit steamed that she wasnt the one moving in but things with macallister booke werent adding up for her look usually im big on minding my own business and ive got less than no interest in the stuff you do but ive just got to say you just dont seem to fit professor of strange geeky rich guy little yellow cottage what are you after he didnt smile now his face went quiet almost eerily intent answers what answers all of them i can get youve got great eyes huh i was just noticing nothing but green no gray no blue just intense green pretty she angled her head you coming on to me dr geek no he very nearly flushed i just noticed thats all half the time i dont realize im saying something thats in my head comes from spending a lot of time on my own i guess and thinking out loud right well ive got to get going he stuck the sensor in his pocket neglecting to turn it off i appreciate the help no offense before okay okay she offered her hand to shake the instant their fingers clasped the sensor in his pocket beeped madly wow wait hold on she tried again to tug her hand free but his grip turned surprisingly strong with his free hand he dragged the sensor out of his pocket look at this excitement rippled through his voice deepened it ive never had it measure anything this strong almost off the scale he began to mutter numbers as if memorizing them while he tugged her across the room hold on pal just what do you think i need to record these numbers what time is it two twentythree and sixteen seconds fascinated he passed the gauge over their joined hands jesus look at that jump is that cool or what let go right now or im taking you down huh he looked back at her face blinked once to orient himself the eyes hed admired were hard as stone now sorry he released her hand immediately and the sensors beeping began to slow sorry he repeated i get caught up especially with a new phenomenon if you could just give me a minute to record this then interface the portable with my computer i dont have time to waste while you play with your toys she shot the sensor a furious look id say you need an equipment check i dont think so he held out the palm that had clasped hers its vibrating how about yours i dont know what youre talking about ten minutes he said give me ten to put the bare essentials together and lets try it again i want to test our vital signs body temperature ambient temperature i dont let guys test my vital signs until theyve bought me dinner she jerked her thumb youre in my way he stepped to the side ill buy you dinner no thanks she headed straight for the door without looking back you are so not my type rather than waste time on annoyance when she slammed the door behind her mac searched for his recorder and began relaying the data ripley todd he finished deputy ripley todd late twenties id guess abrasive suspicious casually rude incident occurred on physical contact a handshake personal physical reactions were a tingling and warmth along the skin from point of contact up the right arm to the shoulder an increase of heart rate and a temporary feeling of euphoria deputy todds physical reaction is unsubstantiated impressions are however that she experienced the same or similar reactions which resulted in her anger and denial he sat on the arm of the sofa considering early hypothesis reached upon previous research current observations and recorded data is that todd is another direct descendant of one of the three original sisters pursing his lips mac switched off the recorder and id say the idea of that really ticks her off it took mac the rest of the afternoon and all of the evening to unpack and set up by the time he surfaced the living room looked like a hightech science lab with monitors and keyboards and cameras and sensors arranged precisely to his preferences it left very little room to maneuver but he didnt expect to be entertaining he moved what little furniture there was into one corner and tested every piece of equipment when he was finally finished the fire had long since burned out and he was starving remembering the pizzeria he grabbed his coat and started outside he was greeted by almost unrelieved darkness there was a splinter of moonlight a scatter of stars the village which according to his best memory was about a quarter mile south was nothing more than vague silhouettes shadowed under the pretty march of streetlights baffled he looked at his watch swore it was after eleven at night outside a small village on a knuckle of land there would be no pizza tonight his stomach wide awake now protested crossly hed gone hungry before often because of his own forgetfulness but he didnt have to like it without much hope he went back inside to search for crumbs in the kitchen maybe he had an old bag of trail mix or candy in his briefcase but he hit the jackpot in the freezer he found a container labeled clam chowder with instructions for heating compliments of sisters catering i love nell todd im her slave deliriously pleased he set it in the microwave at the time and temperature directed the first wisps of scent nearly had him crying he ate the entire container standing up sated refreshed and revived he decided to take a walk down to the beach two minutes later he came back and dug out a flashlight he had always liked the sound of the sea especially at night when it seemed to fill the world the cold wind was bracing the smooth velvet dark soothing as he walked he made mental notes of chores and tasks he would need to see to the following day the knowledge that most if not all of his list would be forgotten didnt stop him from making it he would need to stock up on supplies transfer some money to the local bank for convenience arrange for phone service a post office box he wanted to do more indepth research on the todd ancestry and the ripley family history as well he wondered how much information he could pump out of mia definite tension between her and the deputy hed be interested to know what caused it he needed to spend more time with both of them though neither one would be easily nudged a prickling on the back of his neck made him stop slowly turn she was glowing a faint aura of light outlined her body her face the long coils of her hair her eyes were green as a cats against the dark and watched him just as steadily just as patiently ripley he wasnt easily spooked but shed managed it i didnt know there was anyone else out here he started back toward her a ripple of air shivered over him the sand shifted under his feet he saw a single tear diamond bright slide down her cheek before she vanished like smoke three three sisters island was still and white and perfect like ripley thought one of the snow globes on the shelf at island treasures the storm that had swept through during the night had covered the beach the lawns the streets erminedraped trees stood still as a painting and the air was church quiet she hated to mar it even now zack was calling dick stubens and telling him to start up his plow soon the world would move again but for now it was still and silent irresistible a few feet of snow was one of the only things that kept her from her morning run on the beach she tossed her gym bag over her shoulder took one last whiff of whatever it was her sisterinlaw was baking and slipped out of the house for now for the length of her walk to the hotel and its health club the island belonged only to her smoke pumped from chimneys lights gleamed behind kitchen windows oatmeal was being stirred she imagined bacon was sizzling and inside those warm snug houses children were doing a dance of joy no school today was for snow battles and snow forts for sledding and mugs of hot chocolate at the kitchen table her life had been just that simple once she trudged toward the village leaving a trough in the snow the sky was a soft waiting white as if it was considering shaking out a few more inches just for good measure either way she thought she would take her hour at the gym then head back home to help zack shovel out the cruiser and nells car as she crossed into the village she looked down and frowned the snow wasnt pristine here as shed expected as shed wanted it to be someone else had been out and about early too and had left a narrow path it irritated her it was a tradition almost a ritual that she be the first to break the field of snow on this part of the island now someone had spoiled her routine and pricked her contentment bubble she kicked at the snow and kept walking the path led as hers did toward the gothic stone hotel the magick inn some mainlander she decided whod come out of his hotel room early to see a genuine new england village in the snow hard to blame him she admitted but he might have waited another hour she stomped up the short flight of steps bumped the bulk of the snow off her boots and went inside she waved to the desk clerk hitching up her gym bag and jogged up the lobby steps to the second floor she had a longstanding payasyougo deal with the hotel for health club privileges she preferred working out on her own and during the summer she used the sea as her pool so an official membership wasnt worth her while turning left she headed straight into the womens locker room as far as she could remember only a handful of guests were in residence this week more than likely she would have the gym and the pool to herself after dumping her outerwear in the locker that the hotel kept for her she stripped down to her black sports bra and bike pants tugged on her socks and crosstrainers her mood was up again at the prospect of a good sweaty bout with the resistance machines and free weights since she despised the treadmill she would save the aerobic portion of her workout for the hotel pool she circled around the locker room for the door leading to the gym she heard the clang of metal on metal before she saw anyone her mood wavered again the tv was on tuned to one of the earlymorning shows full of chatter and cheer she preferred blasting music when she worked out but her glance toward the bench press turned her scowl into interesting speculation she couldnt see much of him but what she could see was superior long legs toned and muscled and already sheened with sweat long arms sleek biceps rippling on the lift and set she approved of his shoes a good brand basic style and far from new he was benchpressing in smooth steady reps better and better this wasnt a weekend warrior but a regular and if the rest of him lived up to his limbs he was hot if she was going to have to share the equipment with someone he might as well be hot buff and sweaty just the way i like em she thought with delight she was missing men at least missing sex she would just check out mr fitness here and see if he lived up to the advertising she snagged a towel hooked it around her shoulders and wandered his way need a spotter she began then nearly choked as she looked down into macs face he grunted lowered the bar hey hows it going some snow last night huh yeah some snow in disgust she turned away to begin her warmup stretches wouldnt you just know it just as she starts to get stirred up mr fitness turns out to be dr geek nice club he commented grunting a little as he pressed the bar up i was surprised to find it empty not much traffic in the hotel this time of year she spared him a look he hadnt shaved and that shadow of stubble turned the attractive bookworm face into something edgy sexy damn it he was hot did you get a membership she asked him yeah damn lost count well he hooked the bar on the safety scooted up you work out here regularly no ive got a setup at home free weights a bowflex but when i cant run outside i like to use their stuff and the pool are you watching this junk he adjusted the weight and pressure on another machine glanced at the television not especially taking this for a no she switched it off while he settled into leg presses she turned the music on and up to blasting to discourage any conversation unfazed mac worked through his routine while she worked through hers he watched her mostly out of the corner of his eye he didnt ogle women in health clubs it wasnt well polite but he was human it was only the two of them and she had one beautiful tight body shame about the attitude he thought about what hed seen on the beach two nights before that instant when hed thought it was ripley standing there of course it hadnt been hed realized that almost immediately the eyes had been almost the same that sharp intense and pure green but the woman or the vision or whatever it had been on the beach hadnt had that taut disciplined body and her hair while dark and long had been curling coils where ripleys was straight as rain and the face though thered been some resemblance had been softer sadder rounder added to all that was the fact that he didnt think ripley todd would stand on a dark beach weeping then vanish into the air it had been one of the sisters he was sure and from the research hed done he was betting on the one called earth still deputy todd was a part of it all he was sure of that too he just wasnt sure how to chip through that flinty attitude and work on that is work with her since he intended to do just that it wasnt a coincidence that they picked up free weights at the same time she started with flies he followed suit despite the music they were close enough now for him to speak without shouting and feeling like a moron hows the food in the restaurant here two restaurants fine fancy ones pricey you up for breakfast after this im buying she slanted him a look thanks but ive got to get back he saw her gaze at his weights he was pumping twenties she was using tens but between the beat of the music and the mirrored motions they were lifting in unison ive got my equipment set up he set it casually as they both switched motions youll have to come by and take a look why would i do that curiosity if youre uneasy about what happened last time i can promise not to touch you im not uneasy about anything there was just enough bite in her voice to show him exactly how to chip away some women were vain about their looks or their brains ripley was vain about her spine i couldnt blame you for being reluctant to come around or even to talk to me after that his smile was back easygoing edging toward sheepish i tend to forget that laypeople arent used to paranormal events it can be scary you think im afraid she gritted her teeth continued her reps you dont scare me booke and neither do your stupid toys im glad to hear that voice cheerful face pleasant he finished off the mat routine and got up to do bicep curls i was a little worried the way you took off i didnt take off she snapped it out and began to work on her triceps i left whatever i had work to do okay she sucked in a breath and imagined what would happen to that dopey grin of his if she smashed her barbell in his face you may be the idle rich buddy but i work for a living absolutely if youre not worried about the energy spike the other day id really like you to come back now that im up and running itll help to recreate the event or see if it can be recreated not interested ill pay you for your time i dont need your money that doesnt make it less useful think about it he decided to cut his routine short and give her the time to do just that by the way he added as he replaced the weights nice abs she merely peeled back her lips to show her teeth as he strolled out imagine she thought as she finished out her routine a dork like that accusing her of being afraid if it hadnt been so laughable it wouldve been insulting then thinking he could buy her time for his ridiculous experiments or study or whatever the hell he called what he did it was a shame a damn shame that he was the bestlooking and certainly the bestbuilt guy shed run across in months if he hadnt been such an irritating moron they could have enjoyed some workouts of an entirely different nature instead she was going to have to make the effort to avoid him whenever possible it wouldnt be easy but she would make it her winter project with her muscles comfortably fatigued she went back in the locker room showered off pulled on her tank suit and headed into the pool area and realized immediately she should have known he was already in the pool doing laps with slow almost lazy strokes it surprised her to see that his tan covered every inch of him or every inch she could see the black speedo he wore wasnt hiding much she wasnt giving up her swim even if it meant sharing the water with him tossing her fresh towel aside she dived in when she surfaced he was an armspan away casually treading water ive got an idea i bet youre just full of them she dipped her head and slicked the hair back from her face look i want to get in my laps and go its a big pool you stay on that side ill stay on this one lets not call it an idea lets call it a proposition booke youre going to piss me off i didnt mean he did flush now a perfectly gorgeous combination with that manly stubble the little twist of lust in her belly really put her off i didnt mean to imply he took two careful breaths knowing he would stutter otherwise i meant a race he knew hed caught her competitive streak by the way her eyes glinted just before she turned in the water and swam to the side not interested ill give you a quarterlength handicap yeah no question youre going to piss me off four lengths he continued clamping onto the idea like a hound onto a bone if you win i dont bother you again if i win i get one hour of your time one hour against three months those are pretty favorable odds for you she started to brush him off wanted to brush him off he couldnt bother her if she didnt let him bother her there was only one slight hitch she couldnt resist a dare four lengths head to head she pulled swim goggles over her head adjusted them when i win you keep your distance you dont mention your project or whatever you call it to me again and you dont try hitting on me on a personal level now that last part stings deputy but agreed if i win you come to the cottage assist me in some tests one hours work with your full cooperation deal when he held out a hand she simply stared at it blandly forget it she waited for him to join her at the wall prepared herself with long slow breaths freestyle okay on three she nodded one two they pushed off together on three cut through the water she didnt intend to lose didnt even consider it a possibility she swam nearly every day of her life and she was the home team she noted his form as they paced each other on the first lap it wasnt bad but hers was better they slapped the far wall pushed off for the second lap she was beautiful to watch and he hoped he had the opportunity to do more of it under less intense circumstances it wasnt just strength he noted she had the fluid disciplined grace of the true athlete hed never deluded himself that he qualified in that area but if there was one thing he could do it was swim he had to admit he hadnt expected them to be so evenly matched he had a longer reach and a good seven inches on her in body length but the woman had a powerful kick he picked up the pace testingly on the third length she matched it he found himself both challenged and amused she was toying with him he put on more speed and admitted it was a damn good thing shed tossed his handicap back in his face the sonofabitch was like an eel ripley thought when they shoved off for the final lap in tandem she realized shed seriously misjudged his abilities gathering herself she poured it on nipped past him by a quarter of a body length felt her adrenaline kick in for that final push and was struck with shock and dazed admiration when he streamed by her and slapped the wall two strokes ahead chest heaving she surfaced shoved back her goggles no one not even zack could beat her at four lengths it was demoralizing so he panted shoved his hair back any time today good for you the bastard hadnt even had the courtesy to rub it in it only made the taste of defeat more sour hed been so so damn pleasant about the whole thing she began to wonder if he was on drugs surely no one could stay so eventempered without chemical assistance she worked off part of her mad shoveling snow soothed her bruised ego with some of nells famous cinnamon buns but it picked at her a restless fingernail at a scab throughout the day there were a number of calls to keep her busy cars sliding off the road a smashed window due to a poorly aimed snowball and the usual variety of mischief that liberated kids could create on a snow day still it worried her mind and spoiled her mood in the station house zack listened to her muttered curses watched her pour yet another cup of coffee he was a patient man and he knew his sister hed crossed paths with her several times that day on patrol and had recognized the signs of her temper brewing but since it hadnt passed he was going to have to poke it out of her now seemed like a good time he was enjoying a coffee break of his own with his feet propped up on the desk are you going to keep chewing on whatevers got your goat or spit it out nothings got my goat she slurped at coffee burned her tongue cursed youve been in a stew since you got back from the gym this morning i dont stew you stew i brood he corrected which is a solitary and thoughtful process involving finding the solution to a conflict or situation stewing is stirring a bubbling pot until it boils over and spills on someone as im the only one currently in harms way i have a vested interest about the contents of this particular pot she turned back to him with a dangerous sneer thats the stupidest thing i ever heard see he wagged his finger at her youre trying to figure out how to take it out on me tell me who pissed you off and well go whip their asses together he had a way about him ripley admitted that could make her laugh in the worst of times she walked over to the desk sat on the edge have you met this booke character the big brain from new york yeah i met him yesterday when he was out walking the village getting his bearings seems nice enough nice she snorted do you know what hes here for zack grunted an assent she only had to mention macallister booke for zack to clue in to the source of her mad rip we deal with variations of this theme off and on all the time we cant live on sisters and avoid it this is different maybe it is he was frowning himself when he got up to replenish his coffee what happened with nell last fall raises eyebrows and not just because she came back figuratively from the dead or that that bastard remington was exposed as someone who got his rocks off knocking her around during their marriage not even because he threatened to kill her once he tracked her here and stabbed you she said it quietly because she could still see the blood on his shirt the way it had gleamed dark in the shadows of the forest all of that made good press copy zack continued a big juicy scandal but you add how it all went down we kept a lid on that as best we could he agreed he stopped beside her touched her face he knew shed broken a promise to herself that night linking hands with mia using what she had inside her to save nell to save him enough got out he said quietly rumor and speculation and the babblings of a madman enough to build more to spark interest you had to expect something along these lines i expected the weirdos she admitted maybe an increase in the gawking tourists that sort of thing this booke is different hes the serious article a kind of i dont know crusader and hes got credentials a lot of people may think hes just another nutcase but a lot wont added to all that mia might get it into her head to talk to him to cooperate with him yeah she might he didnt want to add that he was all but sure nell would as well theyd already had a discussion about it its her choice rip it doesnt have to weigh on yours she gave her coffee a disgusted look he won an hour from me what sneaky sonofabitch conned me into a bet this morning i lost so i have to give him an hour with his voodoo crap ouch howd you lose dont wanna talk about it she muttered but he was already trying to work it out you didnt go anywhere but the gym this morning did you i heard he picked up a membership there is that where you ran into him yeah yeah yeah she pushed off the desk paced whod have thought he could move like that at a sprint okay i could see it because of his height advantage but not at a hundred sixty foot freestyle a swim race zack voiced his surprise he took you in a swim race i said i dont want to talk about it i was off my rhythm thats all she whirled back with a slanted look was that a laugh i heard you bet no wonder youre stewing just shut up i dont know what he thinks he can prove in an hour anyway with his energy detectors and spirit sensors its a waste of time then youve got nothing to worry about how much he take you by shut up zack she decided to get it over with the way you would a root canal and shed decided to walk leaving zack with the cruiser because that postponed the gettingitoverwith stage just a little longer it was full dark when she made the turn to the yellow cottage and the moon was new and black another three inches of snow had fallen since morning but the clouds had passed by evening the clear wash of sky and stars sucked out any hope of warmth in the air the cold was clean and sharp as a razor slicing keenly against any exposed skin she walked fast using her flashlight to guide the way she shook her head when she ran the beam over macs rover he hadnt bothered to dig it out typical nutty professor behavior she decided ignoring the practical she stomped up to the door pounded with a woolcovered fist he answered wearing a gray sweatshirt that had seen better days and jeans that looked equally well used she caught the unmistakable scent of nells beefandbarley soup and quickly decided it was that and that alone that made her mouth water hi jesus its freezing out there must be down around zero even as he stepped back to let her in he looked outside no car you walked in this are you crazy she studied the equipment jammed cheek by jowl into the tiny living room you live like this and you ask if im crazy its too cold to be out for an evening stroll instinctively he took her gloved hands rubbing them between his own you get grabby were on the clock check the attitude his voice wasnt mild and easygoing now but hot as a bullet it had her eyeing him speculatively have you ever seen frostbite as a matter of fact hey she yanked back when he pulled off her gloves to examine her fingers i was with a group in nepal a few years ago one of the students got careless ignoring her resistance he wiggled her fingers he lost two of these im not careless okay let me take your coat she shrugged out of it the neck scarf the wool cap the insulated vest piling each layer she peeled off into his arms i guess youre not careless then he glanced around looking for a place to dump everything she couldnt help it she grinned the floors good enough no well just the bed he remembered and carted them out down the narrow path hed made to the bedroom are you afraid of the dark she called out huh youve got every light on in this place i do he came out again im always forgetting to turn things off i bought a quart of nells soup today i just nuked it do you want some he waited a beat reading her perfectly eatings off the clock im not hungry she quickly responded and felt a good sulk coming on okay ill have it later so we can get started where did i put he patted his pockets circled oh yeah and found his minirecorder beside a monitor i want to get some basic personal data first so well just he broke off again brow furrowed hed piled old files clippings research books photographs and other tools on the sofa even the floor didnt offer enough room for two people to sit tell you what well do this part in the kitchen she shrugged her shoulders stuffed her hands in her pockets and followed him back im going to go ahead and eat since its here he took down a bowl then decided to take pity on her why dont you change your mind so i dont feel rude eating in front of you fine got a beer no sorry got a pretty decent merlot though thatll work she stood while he dumped soup in bowls poured wine have a seat he settled down across from her got up immediately damn it one more minute go ahead and eat ripley picked up her spoon as he hurried back out she heard muttering papers rattling and a small crash as something hit the floor he came back with a spiral notebook two pencils and a pair of metalframed glasses the minute he slipped them on her stomach clutched oh man she thought an incredibly sexy geek im going to take notes he explained back up the tape hows the soup its nells she said simply yeah he began to eat she saved my life the other night when i lost track of time i found a container of chowder in the freezer and nearly broke down and cried your brothers a lucky man i met him yesterday so he said she began to relax thinking that as long as he made small talk the clock was ticking theyre great together i got that impression how old are you what your age for the record i dont know what the hell that has to do with anything i turned thirty last month what day fourteenth sagittarius you know the time of birth i wasnt paying a lot of attention at the time she picked up her wine i think my mother said it was about eight at night after sixteen hours of sweating in the valley of the shadow and so on why do you need that ill input the data and run an astrological chart give you a copy if you want that stuffs totally bogus youd be surprised you were born on the island yeah at home doctor and midwife in attendance have you ever experienced any paranormal activity she didnt mind lying but she hated the fact that it always made her throat feel tight why would i do you remember your dreams sure i had a doozy the other night about harrison ford a peacock feather and a bottle of canola oil what do you think that means since a cigar is sometimes just a cigar sexual fantasies are sometimes just about sex do you dream in color yeah sure always she moved her shoulders black and whites for bogart movies and art photography are your dreams ever prophetic she nearly answered in the affirmative before she caught herself so far harry and i havent gotten it on but i have hope he switched tactics got any hobbies hobbies you mean like quilting or birdwatching no what do you do with your free time i dont know she nearly squirmed before she caught herself stuff tv movies i do some sailing bogart movies top pick maltese falcon what do you sail zacks little day cruiser she tapped her fingers on the table let her mind drift i think im going to get my own though nothing like a day on the water when did you realize you had power it was never a she straightened carefully wiped all expression off her face i dont know what you mean yes you do but we can let that slide for the moment if it makes you uncomfortable im not uncomfortable i just dont understand the question he set his pencil down nudged the bowl of soup aside and looked directly at her lets put it this way then when did you realize you were a witch four she heard the blood rush and roar in her head pulsing in time with the gallop of her heart he sat calmly studying her as if she were some mildly interesting lab experiment her temper began to tick like a bomb what kind of a stupid question is that with some its an instinct hereditary knowledge others are taught the way a child is taught to walk and talk there are some who come into it at the onset of puberty countless others i believe who go through life without ever realizing their potential now he made her feel as though she was a slightly dimwitted student i dont know where you get this stuff or where youve come up with the halfbaked idea that im she wasnt going to say it wasnt going to give him the satisfaction of saying it this hocuspocus area is your deal not mine dr weird intrigued he cocked his head why are you angry im not angry she leaned forward want to see me angry not particularly but im willing to bet that if i put a sensor on you right now id get some very interesting readings im finished betting with you in fact im finished with you period he let her get to her feet continued to make notes you still have fortyfive minutes on your time if youre going to renege he swept his gaze up met her furious stare i can only assume youre afraid it wasnt my intention to frighten or upset you i apologize stuff your apology she strained against pride always her most fretful war shed made the damn bet shed accepted the terms with a badtempered jerk she scraped her chair back out and sat again he didnt rub it in only continued to make notes as if ripley thought grinding her teeth hed known all along he would win im going to take a wild leap here you dont practice i have nothing to practice youre not a stupid woman and my impression is youre very selfaware he watched her face she was trying to remain steady but there was something beneath the calm veneer some strong even passionate emotion he wanted desperately to dig in discover it discover her but he would never get the chance he realized if he alienated her so quickly im assuming this is a sensitive area for you im sorry ive already told you what you can do with your apology you can do the same with your assumptions ripley he lifted a hand spread his fingers in a gesture of peace im not a reporter looking for a story im not a groupie looking for a show or a neophite searching for a mentor this is my work i can promise to respect your privacy keep your name out of my documentation i wont do anything to hurt you you dont worry me booke youre going to have to look for your guinea pig elsewhere im not interested in your work is nell the third you leave nell alone before she could think she reached across gripped his wrist you mess with her ill take you apart he didnt move didnt even breathe her pupils had gone so dark they were nearly black where her fingers gripped were points of heat so intense he wouldnt have been surprised to see his skin smoke bring harm to none he managed in a voice that somehow remained steady thats not just craft philosophy i believe it i wont do anything to hurt your sisterinlaw or you ripley very slowly watching her as he might a guard dog who had snapped its chain he brought his hand up to cover hers you cant control it can you his voice was soft not completely he gave her hand a squeeze that was almost friendly youre burning my wrist with that statement she lifted her fingers spread them but her hand wasnt steady as she looked down saw the red welts where her fingers had been i wont do this she struggled to bring her breathing back to normal to close off that violent spike of energy to be herself again here she hadnt heard him get up or go to the sink in an instant he was standing beside her offering her a glass of water after shed taken it gulped it down she was no longer sure whether she was angry or embarrassed but she was sure it was his fault youve no right to come here prying into peoples lives knowledge and truth save us from chaos his tone was quiet reasonable and made her want to bite him tempering them with compassion and tolerance makes us human without those things fanatics feed on fear and ignorance the way they did in salem three hundred years ago not hanging witches anymore doesnt make the world tolerant i dont want to be part of your study thats the bottom line okay she looked so tired all at once he noted boneweary it stirred him a mixture of guilt and sympathy all right but something happened the other night that might make that difficult for both of us he waited a moment while she shifted in her chair then gave him her reluctant attention i saw a woman on the beach at first i thought it was you same eyes same coloring she was very alone and brutally sad she looked at me for one long moment then vanished ripley pressed her lips together then picked up her wine maybe youve been drinking too much merlot she wants redemption i want to help her find it you want data she tossed back you want to legitimate your crusade maybe cop a book deal i want to understand no he admitted that wasnt all of it that wasnt the core of it i want to know then talk to mia she loves attention you grew up together yeah so it was easier he decided even more pleasant to deal with her when she had her attitude back in place i caught some tension between the two of you i must repeat myself so curiosity is the scientists first tool it also killed the cat ripley said with a glimmer of her former sneer and i dont call bopping around the globe playing witchhunter science you know thats just what my father says he spoke cheerfully as he rose to take their soup bowls to the sink your father sounds like a sensible man oh he is that im a constant disappointment to him no thats unfair mac decided as he came back topped off their wine im more a puzzle and hes sure some of the pieces have gone missing so tell me about your parents theyre retired my father was sheriff before zack my mother was a cpa they took their life on the road a while back in a big winnebago hitting the national parks that and whatever theyre having the time of their lives like a couple of kids on an endless spring break it wasnt what she said so much as how she said it that told him the todd family was tight and happy her problem with her power didnt stem from family conflict he was sure of that you and your brother work together obviously there was no doubt about it she was back i met him the other day youre not much like him he glanced up from his notes except for the eyes zack got all the niceguy genes in the family there werent any left over for me you were there when he was injured while arresting evan remington her face went very still again do you want to read the police report actually i have it mustve been a rough night and lets just circle around that for now he decided do you like being a cop i dont do things i dont like lucky you why the maltese falcon huh i was wondering why you picked that instead of say casablanca ripley shook her head adjusted her thoughts i dont know because i figure bergman shouldve told bogart paris my butt instead of getting on the plane in falcon he did the job he turned astor over that was justice i always figured ilsa and rick got together after the war and sam spade well he just kept being sam spade what kind of music do you like what music you said you like working out to music what does that have to do with your project you said you didnt want to be involved in my work we might as well pass the rest of the time getting to know each other she blew out a breath sipped her wine youre a really strange individual all right then enough about you lets talk about me he sat back and when her face blurred out of focus remembered to remove his reading glasses im thirtythree embarrassingly rich the second son of the new york bookes real estate the macallister branch we have that surname as first name in common theyre corporate law i got interested in preternatural subjects when i was a kid the history variations the effect on cultures and societies my interest caused my family to seek the advice of a psychologist who assured them this was just a form of rebellion they took you to a shrink because you liked spooky when youre a fourteenyearold college freshman someones always calling the shrink fourteen she pursed her lips that had to be strange well it was pretty hard to get a date let me tell you the slight twitching of her lips pleased him i channeled the energy from what would have been those first sexual rumbles into study and my personal interest so you got off on books and research in a manner of speaking by the time i was eighteen my parents had given up on trying to box me into one of the family firms then i hit twentyone and came into the first lap of my trust fund and could do what i wanted she angled her head she was interested now couldnt help herself did you ever get a date a couple i know what it is to be pushed in a direction you dont want to go or one youre not ready for people say they know whats best for you maybe sometimes its true but it doesnt matter if they keep pushing until they take your choices away is that why youre letting me off the hook tonight thats one reason another is because youre going to change your mind dont get steamed he said quickly when her mouth thinned when i first came here i thought it would be mia i needed to work with but its you at least primarily its you why thats something id like to find out meanwhile youve paid off your bet ill drive you home im not going to change my mind then its a good thing ive got plenty of time to waste ill get your coat and i dont need you to drive me home we can armwrestle over that he called back but im not letting you walk home in the dark in subzero temperatures you cant drive me home you didnt dig out your car so ill dig it out then drive you home five minutes shed have argued with that but the front door slammed and she was left stewing in the house alone curious she eased open the back door stood shivering while she watched him attack the snow around the rover with a shovel she had to admit those muscles shed seen that morning in the gym werent just for show it appeared that dr booke knew how to put his back into the job at hand still he wasnt particularly thorough she nearly called out to say so when it occurred to her that any comment she made would prove shed been interested enough to watch him instead she shut the door and rubbed the warmth back into her hands and arms when the front door slammed again and she heard him stomping his feet she was leaning against the kitchen counter looking bored bitching cold out there he called back where did i put your stuff in the bedroom and since she had a minute she scurried around the table to flip through his notes hissed when she saw they were in shorthand or what she assumed was shorthand in any case the notes were odd symbols lines and loops that meant nothing to her but the sketch in the center of a page had her gaping it was her face and a damn good likeness too a quick pencil sketch full face she looked annoyed she decided and watchful well he was right about that too there was no doubt in her mind that macallister booke bore watching she was standing a foot away from the table her hands innocently in her pockets when he came back took me a few minutes longer because i couldnt find my keys i still cant figure out what they were doing in the bathroom sink poltergeist she said sweetly and made him laugh i wish i just never seem to put anything in the same place twice hed tracked snow through the house rather than point it out ripley slipped on her vest and scarf he held her coat made her shake her head when she realized he intended to help her on with it i can never figure that out how do you guys figure we get our coats on when youre not around we have no idea amused he set her cap on her head then pulled her hair through the back as hed seen her wear it gloves she pulled them out of her pocket are you going to put them on for me too daddy sure honey but when he reached out she slapped his hand away and was grinning until she saw the welts on his wrist guilt churned in her she didnt mind hurting someone when they deserved it but not that way never that way still what was done could be undone even if it did mean swallowing pride he saw a change in her expression as she stared at his wrist its no big deal he began and started to pull his cuffs down it is to me she didnt bother to sigh but took his wrist again her gaze shot up held his this is off my time off the record off everything understood all right what in anger i have harmed i regret and spin this charm heal this hurt caused by me by the power of one times three as i will so mote it be he felt the mild pain the heat lift away from his skin the flesh where her fingers lay was now cool as if theyd drawn the burns out there was a jump in his belly not so much from the physical change as from the change in her eyes he had looked into power before and knew he looked into it now it was something he never forgot to respect thanks he told her dont mention it she turned away i mean that when she reached for the doorknob on the kitchen door his hand its wrist unmarked closed over it first we dont know how you open doors either he said theyre so heavy and complicated funny guy when they stepped out his hand slid under to cup her elbow the long baleful look she sent him only brought on a shrug its a little icy i cant help it its very difficult to resist early childhood training she let it go and didnt have the heart to jab at him when he walked her around the rover and opened the passenger door for her it wasnt much of a drive but as she directed him she realized she was indeed grateful for the lift even in the hour shed been inside the temperature had dropped the heater wouldnt have time to kick in but at least they were out of the open air air that seemed cold enough to break if youre looking for more firewood jack stubens sells it by the cord she told him stubens can you write that down steering onehanded he dug in his pocket got any paper no try the glove compartment she opened it and felt her jaw drop in shock there were dozens of notes countless pens rubber bands a halfempty bag of pretzels three flashlights a hunting knife and several unidentified objects she pulled one out that looked to be made up of red twine various beads and human hair whats this he glanced over grisgris it was a gift no paper she stared at him another moment then put the charm back and pulled out one of the many scribbled notes stubens she repeated scrawling it on the scrap of paper jack over on owl haunt lane thanks he took the paper stuffed it in his pocket turn here its the twostory wraparound porch as the police cruiser was in the drive he couldve figured it out for himself lights were glowing cheerfully in the windows and smoke puffed out of the chimney nice house he got out and though shed already hopped down before he could come around and open her door he took her arm again look mac its kind of cute and all that but you dont need to walk me to the door this wasnt a date its a compulsion besides we had a meal and conversation and wine so thats several date elements she stopped on the porch turned hed pulled a ski cap on and his dark blond hair escaped here and there he couldnt help but look at her intensely so what you want a kiss good night now okay the response was so cheerful so harmlessly cheerful she grinned but only for an instant he had moves smooth unexpected incredible moves it wasnt fast but it was so slick so silky she had no time to readjust to think his arms came around her slid her against him body to body so that without any real pressure she was molded to him he dipped her back just the slightest bit and somehow conjured the illusion that they were horizontal instead of vertical the intimacy of it jolted through her sent her head on a dizzy spin even before his mouth took hers soft warm deep his lips didnt brush or nibble but simply absorbed now the dizziness was joined by a shimmering wave of heat that seemed to start in her toes and rise until it melted every bone a little sound stunned pleasure hummed in her throat her lips parted in welcome oh more it took two tries to lift her boneless arms and circle his neck her knees buckled it wouldnt have surprised her to feel her body simply dissolve and slide in little liquid drops into a pool at his feet when he eased back gently set her away her vision was blurred her mind blank well have to do this again sometime he said uh she couldnt quite remember how to form words he gave her hair a friendly tug better get inside before you freeze ah she gave up turned blindly and walked into the door let me get that for you he spoke quietly quite soberly and turned the knob nudged the door open good night ripley mmm she stepped inside then had no choice but to lean back against the door he closed until she got her bearings and her breath back harmless had she actually thought he was harmless she managed to stagger a few steps then lowered herself to the bottom tread of the staircase she would just wait until her legs were back under her she decided before she tried to make it upstairs to her room january pm est ill transcribe my notes and the tape from my initial interview with ripley todd shortly i didnt make as much progress with her as id hoped however there were two specific incidents that will be set down in more detail in my official log my personal reaction however belongs here ripleys temperament and her protective attitude toward her sisterinlaw nell todd can and will overpower her reluctance to discuss her gift or as i learned tonight to demonstrate that gift its my impression that her warning to me when i mentioned nell was instinctive and the result was unplanned harming me was a byproduct rather than a goal the burns on my wrist from visual examination matched the grip and shape of her fingers it wasnt a flash burn but more a steady increase in heat as you might experience when turning up a flame her physical changes during this phenomenon were a dilation of pupils a flush under the skin her anger turned inward immediately i believe this lack of control and a fear of what she is capable of are what cause her reluctance to discuss and explore the nature of her talents shes an interesting woman one obviously close to her family in all areas but this i sense and observe a complete confidence an ease of self shes beautiful when she smiles he stopped nearly crossed out his last observation it wasnt even accurate she wasnt beautiful attractive intriguing but not beautiful still he reminded himself the journal was for impressions the thought that she was beautiful must have been in his mind for him to note it down so it stayed the second incident occurred just before we left and was i have no doubt more difficult for her the fact that she would remove the burns deliberately demonstrate her ability indicates a strong sense of right and wrong that as with her instinct to protect who and what she loves overcomes her need to block off her gift i hope as time goes on to discover what event or events influenced her to deny or abjure her powers i need to see her again to verify my suppositions oh hell he muttered if he couldnt be honest here where i want to see her again on a completely personal level ive enjoyed being with her even when shes rude and insulting it worries me a bit that i might enjoy being with her because shes rude and insulting beyond that theres a strong sexual attraction unlike the sheer admiration for beauty i felt on first meeting mia devlin and the completely natural and human fantasy that resulted this is more basic and therefore more compelling i want on one level to carefully take this complex woman apart piece by piece and understand what she is on the other i just want to nope mac decided even a personal journal needed some censoring he couldnt write down just what he wanted to do with ripley todd i find myself wondering what it would be like to be her lover there he thought that was acceptable no point in going into graphic detail i drove her home tonight as the temperatures are hovering at zero fahrenheit the fact that she had walked here and would have walked home under such conditions demonstrates her stubbornness as well as her independence she was very obviously amused at simple courtesies such as helping her with her coat holding the door not insulted but amused which i found disarming i wouldnt have kissed her if she hadnt brought it up i certainly had no intention of doing so at this early stage of our relationship her response was unexpected and arousing shes a strong woman body and mind and to feel her going almost limp he had to stop take a breath guzzle some of the water hed poured to feel the reaction of her body to mine and the heat knowing the chemical and biological causes for the increase of body heat during such an event doesnt diminish the wonder of the experience i can still taste her strong again a strong and sharp flavor and hear the kind of purr she made down in her throat my legs went weak and when her arms came around my neck it was like being surrounded by her another minute another instant and i would have forgotten that we were standing on an open porch on a bitterly cold night but since i had despite her teasing initiated the embrace it was my responsibility at least i had the satisfaction of seeing her face and the dazed dreamy expression in her eyes and of watching her walk straight into the door that was a good one of course i nearly ran off the road twice coming back to the cottage and got lost but that part isnt atypical without the stimuli yes i want to see her again on a number of levels and i dont expect to sleep particularly well tonight five nell iced the last batch of cinnamon buns and bided her time she had an hour before she needed to load up her car with the café stock todays soup was porcini mushroom and it was already sealed in the kettle the three salad selections were prepared the muffins baked shed finished the napoleons shed been up and at it since fivethirty diego her sleek gray cat was curled on one of the kitchen chairs watching her lucy the big black lab sprawled in a corner watching diego they had come to terms diegos terms and lived together in an acceptable state of distrust and suspicion while her cookies baked nell kept the radio on low and waited when ripley entered blearyeyed wearing the sweatpants and football jersey shed slept in nell simply held out a mug of coffee ripley grunted as close to a thankyou as she could manage before caffeine and plopped into a chair too much snow for your morning run ripley grunted again she never felt completely herself without her three miles but the coffee was helping she sipped idly patted lucys head when the lab came over to greet her shed have to use the damn treadmill hated that but she couldnt go two days without a run zack was taking the first shift where the hell was zack so she could wait until midmorning before popping into the gym she didnt want to run into mac not that he worried her or anything shed already reasoned out a number of very plausible excuses for her reaction to that goodnight kiss she just didnt want to deal with him that was all there was to it nell set a bowl in front of her ripley blinked at it what oatmeal suspicious and far from enthusiastic ripley leaned over and sniffed whats in it nutrition nell took a batch of cookies from the oven slid in another tray try it before you make icky faces okay okay she had been making icky faces behind nells back it was sort of lowering to be caught at it she sampled pursed her lips took another spoonful there didnt seem to be anything nell put together that didnt go down well its good my mother used to cook oatmeal in the winter but it looked like gray glue tasted worse your mother has other talents nell poured herself a cup of coffee shed all but shoved zack out of the house early so she could grab this time with ripley she didnt intend to waste it she sat so how did it go what your evening with mac booke it wasnt an evening it was an hour defensive nell thought cranky well well how did your hour go it came and it went which wraps up my obligation i was glad he drove you home at ripleys lifted brows nell blinked her baby blues innocently i heard the car and had looked out the window had seen mac walk ripley to the door thered been quite the little time lag before hed walked back to the car yeah he was all its too cold out youll get frostbite and die before you get home she shoved oatmeal into her mouth then wagged her spoon like i dont know how to take care of myself guys like that burn me he cant even find his keys half the time but im going to wander off and turn into a popsicle please im glad he drove you home nell repeated yeah well ripley sighed toyed with her oatmeal by putting little crescentshaped dents on it with the tip of her spoon she decided it looked sort of like a moonscape if he hadnt driven her home shed have been fine but shed have missed one whale of a kiss not that she was obsessing about it or anything you wouldnt recognize the cottage she went on it looks like the den of some mad scientist all this electronic and computer junk shoved in there no place to sit down except the kitchen the guys totally wrapped up in his spook show hes even got some voodoo charm in his glove compartment he knows about me she finished in a rush and lifted her gaze to nells oh nell drew in a quiet breath did you tell him ripley shook her head her insides jittered infuriating her he just knew like i had a sign on my forehead saying local witch its all real academic with him well this is interesting deputy todd perhaps you could conjure something for me for the recorder did he ask you to do magic no ripley rubbed her hands over her face no she said again but i damn it he pissed me off and i i burned him oh my god coffee sloshed at the rim as nell set her cup down i didnt set him on fire or anything i burned his wrist with my fingers she stared down at them now harmless ordinary maybe a little on the long side with short unpainted nails nothing special lethal i didnt think about it not consciously all the mad went to heat and the heat went to my fingers i havent needed to think about it to worry about it in so long the last few months since you opened back up to help me nell finished quietly she rose at the buzz of the oven timer i dont regret that nell not for an instant it was my choice and id do it again its just that its been harder to lock everything down again i dont know why wouldnt admit why she thought and ground that thought to dust it just is i caused physical harm i had to fix it but that doesnt make up for causing it how did he deal with it like it was no big deal got me a glass of water practically patted me on the head and went back to conversation like id done nothing more than spill some wine on the tablecloth the mans got cajones ill give him that nell walked back stroked ripleys hair as she might have stroked a child youre too hard on yourself i cant even count the mistakes ive made in the past few months even with mia guiding me step by step its not a good time to bring her name up ripley leaned over again began to eat as if the food would ease the clenching in her stomach if she hadnt brought him here she didnt bring him ripley the faint but unmistakable edge of impatience in nells voice had ripley hunching her shoulders and if she hadnt rented him the cottage hed have found another or stayed at the hotel did it ever occur to you that by renting him her cottage by agreeing to talk to him she controls the situation to an extent that she couldnt otherwise ripley opened her mouth shut it again no it didnt it should have she never misses a trick im going to talk to him too the spoon clattered into the bowl thats just a bad idea allround bad idea ive thought about it hes promised mia that he wont use real names without permission im interested in his work she continued scooping cookies off the tray and onto the cooling rack id like to know more about it myself i dont have the same feelings for what i am as you do i cant tell you what to do but ripley would make certain mac didnt push too hard or in the wrong direction how does zack feel about it hes left it up to me he trusts me respects me thats every bit as wonderful as knowing he loves me im not worried about dr booke hes sneakier than he looks ripley muttered he sort of lulls you into thinking hes like this harmless puppy dog but hes not what is he smart slick oh hes got those puppydog qualities in there and the combination throws you off one minute hes looking around with that lost look wondering where he put his head last time he took it off and the next nell sat again and the next he kissed me nells fingertips tapped together before she laced them really it was supposed to be like a joke guy has to walk you to the door like youre coming back from prom night then he just sort of she trailed off as she tried to mime the way his arms had slid around her and you know reeled me in taking his time about it and everything got blurry and hot then it was like being gulped down slow oh my i didnt have any bones left so i was just like fused against him while hes doing all these incredible things to my mouth she blew out a breath sucked another in ive kissed a lot of men and im damn good at it but i couldnt keep up wow well nell scooted her chair an inch closer what happened next i walked into the door ripley cringed it was mortifying i walked right into the door blap and dr romeo just politely opens it for me its the first time a kiss ever made me feel like an idiot and its going to be the last if youre attracted to him hes cute hes built hes sexy of course im attracted to him ripley gave a quick shake of her head but thats not the issue he shouldnt have been able to dissolve my brain with one kiss the problem is i havent been going out in a while its been more than four months since i had you know ripley nell gave a quick laugh i figure this was just like i dont know spontaneous combustion or something hes got good moves boom now that i know whats up i can handle it feeling better she polished off the oatmeal i can handle him mac browsed the bookstore flipping pages scanning covers hed already acquired and read material on three sisters but there were a couple of books here hed yet to come across he tucked them under his arm and continued to wander the store had a nice eclectic selection he found a pretty volume of elizabeth barrett brownings sonnets from the portuguese the latest in a vampire hunter series he liked two books on local sites flora and fauna and a handbook for solitary witches and two other books on the paranormal to replace those hed misplaced somewhere then there was a really cool arthurian tarot deck not that he collected them or anything never one to miss an opportunity to indulge in books he took them all they would he thought entertain him in his free time and give him the opening he wanted to talk to lulu he carried the books to the checkout counter offered his most innocent smile terrific bookstore you dont expect to see this kind of selection in a small town lots of things around here people dont expect lulu glared at him over the top of her glasses to let him know shed yet to make up her mind about him cash or charge uh charge he dug out his wallet tilted his head to see the title of the book shed been reading serial killers their hearts their minds oh boy hows the book too much psychobabble not enough blood intellectual types dont cut much mustard a lot of intellectual types dont get out in the world enough too much classroom not enough fieldwork he leaned companionably on the counter as if she were handing him roses instead of thorns did you know one theory is jack the ripper had preternatural powers and while his period in london was the first documented case of serial killing hed lived before and killed before in rome gaul brittany she continued to watch him over the top of her glasses as she rang up the books i dont hold with that me either but it makes a good story the ripper murder through time the way i read it he was the first to use the hornless goat human sacrifice he explained when lulus eyes narrowed in ritual magic black magic very black is that what youre looking for around here blood sacrifices no maam wicca uses no blood sacrifice the white witch harms none lulu dont call me maam she sniffed at him pretty clever arent you yeah sometimes it irritates people youre barking up the wrong tree with me pretty boy im not a witch no you just raised one it mustve been interesting watching mia grow up and ripley he began to shuffle his purchases idly theyre about the same age arent they yes she thought very clever boy what of it you know how it is with intellectual types were full of questions id like to interview you if mia doesnt mind caution warred with delight what for call it human interest most people dont understand the ordinary the everyday pattern of an extraordinary woman even if they open their minds to the extraordinary they tend to think theres no usual no simple no math homework or getting grounded for coming in after curfew or having someones shoulder to lean on lulu swiped the credit card he handed her have you got personal designs on mia no but i sure like looking at her i dont have time to talk to some college boy for his term paper mac signed the credit slip without lulu noted looking at the total ill pay you she heard the faint sound caching in the back of her mind how much fifty an hour what are you stupid no loaded shaking her head lulu handed him his sack of books ill think about it okay thanks when he walked out she shook her head again pay her to talk could you beat that she was still wondering over it when mia glided down the stairs too quiet in here today lu i think im going to run a cookbook sale upstairs get people in nell could make some samples from some of the books whatever college boy was just in who oh mia handed lulu the cup of tea shed brought her from the café the interesting and yummy macallister booke shelled out over a hundred fifty for books without batting an eye mias businesswomans heart went pittypat bless him looks like he can afford it he offered me fifty an hour to talk to him really sipping her own tea mia lifted an eyebrow she knew lulu had an ongoing love affair with profit an affection shed learned at lulus knobby knee i shouldve charged him more rent what does he want to talk to you about you said it was like human interest how many times i had to swat your butt when you were growing up that sort of thing i dont think we need refer back to the unfortunate incidents of buttswatting mia said dryly but this is interesting and unexpected id thought hed be pestering and pressuring me to discuss and demonstrate instead hes letting all that sit to one side and offering you a consultant fee to discuss my formative years she tapped a fingertip on her bottom lip both were painted bold red very clever of him he admitted he was and that it irritated some people im not irritated im intrigued which is just what hed hoped for i imagine claims he doesnt have any designs on you of a personal nature now im insulted with a laugh mia kissed lulus cheek still watching out for me you could do worse than take a look in his direction hes polite rich and has brains and hes not tough to look at hes not for me with a little sigh she rested her cheek on lulus hair id know if he was lulu started to speak then kept her tongue still hooked an arm around mias waist im not thinking of samuel logan mia said though she had been the only man whod ever held her heart the only man whod ever crushed it im just not romantically attracted to the interesting clever and yummy dr booke are you going to talk to him depends if youre worried that i have an objection i dont i can protect myself if i need protecting and i wont not from him there was something else something not quite clear that slithered around the edges of home but it didnt come from macallister booke she drew away picked up her tea again in fact i may agree to talk to him myself fifty dollars an hour she let out a low delighted laugh fascinating loaded down with portable equipment mac plowed through the snow piled on the floor of the narrow forest beside his cottage the police report and the newspaper stories hed read cited this as the place nell had run to when evan remington attacked her and zack todd hed already completed scans of the kitchen area the site of the attack hed found no negative energy there no remnants of violence which had surprised him until hed reasoned out that either nell or mia would have cleansed the house he hoped to find something in the woods the air was still and cold ice gleamed on the dark trunks and branches of trees snow lay on them like fur he saw and was charmed by what he recognized as deer tracks and automatically checked his camera to be certain hed loaded film he passed a little brook where trickles of water forced their way over rocks and ice though his gauges didnt register any anomaly he felt something it took him a moment to realize it was simply peace simply pleasure a bird called flashed by like a bullet mac just stood happy and content it felt good here he thought a place where the mind could be quiet a place for picnics or contemplation with some reluctance he continued to walk but promised himself he would come back and just enjoy he wandered and though he hated to spoil the mood he tried to imagine what it had been like to run fleeing in the dark from a man bent on violence a man armed with a knife already bloody bastard he thought the bastard had hunted her down a rabid wolf after a doe because he could because he would rather have seen her dead than free of him prepared to swipe the knife over her throat rather than lose what he considered his possession fury raged in him hot roiling fury he could almost smell the blood the hate the fear steeped in it he needed several moments to realize that his sensors were going wild jesus he jolted back shook himself and was abruptly the coolheaded scientist again here right here he swept with scanners dragging out his tape recorder muttering data into it he paced off the area using another gauge to measure distance radius diameter down on his knees in the snow he recorded calculated documented considered while the numbers and needles on his tools swung wildly highest charge almost pure positive energy encompasses an area of twelve feet in a perfect circle most rites of paranormal origin involve protective circles this is the most powerful ive found pocketing his tools he used his hands to dig to clear a light sweat covered his back before he uncovered a reasonable portion of the energy circle there are no markings under the snow no symbols ill need to come back with a shovel to clear the entire circle if this was made on the night evan remington was arrested it was cast more than two months ago and would have been ritualistically closed on that same night yet there is a positive echo registering a steady sixpointtwo on my scale sixpointtwo his mind leaped at the data hot dog my previous experience with an active circle during an initiation rite registered no more than fiveeight check those data he got to his feet again snow clinging everywhere as he took photographs he dropped his tape recorder cursed and spent some time scooping it out of a pile of snow then worrying that hed damaged it but nothing could diminish the thrill he stood in the silent wood and wondered if he had stumbled across the heart of the sisters an hour later without bothering to go back to the cottage mac was trudging along the snowy beach the tide had moved in moved out and swallowed some of the snow with it but the damp and the cold had packed what remained like bricks in a wall the air was far from still here shivering in from the sea in icy streams despite the layers he wore his fingers and toes were beginning to feel it he thought idly about a steaminghot shower steaminghot coffee as he examined the area where he remembered seeing the woman on his first night on the island what the hell are you doing he looked up and saw ripley standing at the seawall and was mildly embarrassed that looking at her turned his thoughts immediately to steaminghot sex working how about you she set her hands on her hips he couldnt see her eyes as she wore dark glasses it made him wish hed remembered his own for the sun bouncing off the snow was blinding working at what becoming the abominable snowman the yeti isnt indigenous to this part of the world take a look at yourself booke he did glancing down he was indeed covered with snow it was he knew going to be a damn mess when he peeled everything off for that shower i guess im really into my work he shrugged since it didnt appear that she would come to him he started toward her it wasnt an easy process and he managed to find a couple of snowdrifts that hit above his knees but he trudged to the seawall hitched himself up on it and caught his breath ever hear of frostbite she said dryly i can still feel my toes but thanks for thinking of me how about some coffee i dont happen to have any on me buy you a cup im working maybe i do have frostbite he turned his head and sent her a soulful look wouldnt it be your duty as a civil servant to assist me to a warm and sheltered location no but ill call the health clinic okay strike one he swung over the wall remembering in the nick of time to protect his dangling camera and stood beside her where are you headed why i thought wherever it was thered be coffee she sighed he looked frozen and ridiculously adorable all right come on im heading in anyway didnt see you at the gym this morning i got a late start didnt see you around the village either youre seeing me now she had a long stride he noted he barely had to check his to keep pace with her she stopped in front of the station house took a good look at him stomp that snow off your boots he obeyed sent a little flurry of snow from his coat and pants oh for gods sake turn around she slapped and brushed at the snow that clung to him scowling as she worked her way around to the front then her eyes flicked up caught his grin what are you smiling at maybe i just like being handled want me to do you youll watch your step if you want that coffee she shoved the door open and was bitterly disappointed that zack wasnt in she peeled off her gloves her coat unwinding her neck scarf as he did the same what the hell were you doing crawling around in the snow do you really want to know i guess i dont she walked to the coffeepot poured the last of the thick brew into two cups ill tell you anyway i was in the woods earlier and found the area where you dealt with remington that night her stomach did a quick jerk and clench a sensation he seemed to cause regularly how do you know you found it he took the coffee she held out its my job to know you closed the circle didnt you talk to mia about that just yes or no its not a hard choice yes curiosity needled her why because theres an energy echo unprecedented in my experience strong magic like i said thats mias area patiently he blew on the hot coffee is there a specific reason the two of you dont get along or is it more general its specific and general and none of your business okay he sipped it tasted like hot mud but hed had worse want to have dinner tonight yes i do and i plan to his lips twitched i meant with me then no its going to be hard to work my way around to kissing you good night again if we dont have dinner first she leaned on the little table that held the coffeepot that was a onetime deal you might change your mind after we split a pizza she was already changing her mind just looking at him whetted her appetite are you as good with the rest of the routine as you are with kissing now how am i supposed to answer that without sounding like an idiot good point lets say ill think about splitting a pizza at some later date if and when that event occurs your work as it involves me is off the table i can agree to that he held out a hand she considered ignoring it but it seemed cowardly she clasped his hand shook and felt great relief that there was nothing there but the casual meeting of palms but he didnt let go this is really terrible coffee he said i know what was happening now was completely natural she told herself that stirring of the blood woman for man the anticipatory thrill the memory of just what that mouth of his was capable of oh hell she moved into him do it i was hoping youd say that he set his coffee down this time he took her face a light framing with his hands a slight skim of fingers that made her skin hum his mouth touched hers sank in and sent her brain tumbling oh man man you are really good at this thanks he slid one hand to the base of her neck now be quiet okay im trying to concentrate she linked her arms around his waist plastered herself against him and enjoyed through her lashes she saw that his eyes were open focused on her it made her feel like the only woman in the world another first shed never needed that from a man but being given it was a silky stroke the fingers at the base of her neck began to knead lightly softly finding odd little points she hadnt known existed he changed the angle of the kiss as if experimenting and toppled her from pleasure to need she nearly crawled over him crawled into him her heart rate bounded her blood flashed he held her there a moment had to hold her there trembling until he found his own balance again and drew her away with hands that were no longer steady okay she sucked in a breath wow ive got to give it to you what did you study exotic sexual techniques or something actually he cleared his throat he really really needed to sit down in a manner of speaking and merely as an offshoot of research she stared at him i dont think youre kidding sexual rites and customs are often an important part of why dont i just show you uhuh she held up a hand to ward him off im on duty and youve already managed to get me stirred up enough ill let you know if and when im ready for that pizza give me five minutes and youll be ready he stepped forward until her palm met his chest no deal put your coat back on and go away for a moment she didnt think he was going to do as she asked then like magic he stepped back when the time comes i like my pizza large and loaded funny so do i that keeps it simple he dragged on his coat picked up his camera it was nice running into you deputy todd thanks for the coffee were here to serve dr booke outside he pulled on his ski cap he would go back to the beach he decided throw himself bodily into the icy water if he didnt drown he would cool off six it took a lot of fast talk a lot of grease for a lot of palms and the tenacity of a bulldog but jonathan q harding was willing to invest all of those elements when it came to a hot story his instincts which he considered the best in the business told him that evan remington was going to be his funnel to the story of the decade not just the sizzle of scandal that was still shooting out a few sparks all the angles on remington himself how he had hidden that violent face from the world from his fancy hollywood clients from the upper crust of society had been done to death as far as harding was concerned even most of the details on how his pretty young wife had escaped him risked her life to get free of his abuse and his threats were common fodder now harding didnt bother with the common hed dug around a bit and he had enough confirmed information on where shed run how shed run where shed worked lived during the first eight months after shed ditched her mercedes over a cliff it was decent stuff the former society wife the pampered princess living in cheap furnished rooms working as a shortorder cook or a waitress moving from town to town dyeing her hair changing her name he could get some ink out of it but it was the period of time from after shed landed on that bump of land out in the atlantic to when remington had been dragged into a cell that had his nose twitching things just didnt add up there not tidily enough for harding to close the book or maybe it was just too tidy remington tracks her down pure coincidence knocks her around enter the hero the local sheriff and new love interest got himself stabbed for his trouble harding thought now but he kept on riding to the rescue took remington into custody in the woods talking him out of slitting the pretty heroines throat hauled him to jail and got himself sewed up good boy saves girl bad boy goes into a padded cell good boy marries girl happy days that story with all its angles had been fourwalled in the media for weeks after remingtons arrest and had as most did pretty much petered out but thered been whispers the kind no one could confirm that more had gone on in the woods that night than an inthenickoftime arrest whispers of witchcraft of magic harding had been willing to dismiss that idea maybe play on the angle for a few column inches but just for the novelty after all remington was a raving lunatic his statement about that night which harding had paid good money for could hardly be taken without a truckload of salt and yet dr macallister booke the indiana jones of the paranormal had taken up temporary residence on three sisters island didnt that prick up the ears booke wasnt one to waste his time harding knew the man hacked his way through jungles hiked over miles of desert climbed mountains to do research in his unlikely chosen field and mostly on his own nickel of which he had plenty but he didnt waste his time he debunked more socalled magic than he verified but when he verified people tended to listen smart people if there wasnt something to those whispers why would he have gone helen remington excuse me nell channing todd wasnt making any claims shed spoken to the police of course but there was no mention of witchcraft phenomena in her statement none in the press release funneled through her attorneys either but macallister booke had deemed three sisters worth his time and that interested harding interested him enough that hed read up on the island its lore its legends himself and his reporters nose had scented a story a big fat and potentially juicy story hed tried unsuccessfully to pry interviews out of mac before the macallisterbookes were eyecrossing rich influential and staunchly conservative with a little cooperation he could have generated a series of solid features on the family and their spookchasing son but nobody particularly booke himself cooperated and that stung still it was just a matter of finding the right crowbar and knowing the correct amount of pressure to apply harding was confident that remington himself would help him ease the lid off after that he could take care of the rest harding walked down the corridor of what he thought of as the loony bin remington had been judged legally insane which had saved the taxpayers the cost of a long detailed trial and cheated them out of the meaty morsels the media could have dispensed had there been one the fact was the weapon used against the island sheriff had remingtons fingerprints on it the sheriff and two witnesses including the islands deputy had given statements that remington had held that knife to his wifes throat and had threatened her life even more damning remington hadnt simply confessed hed screamed about murdering her babbled about till death do us part and carried on about the need to burn the adulterous witch of course hed screamed about a lot of other things too about glowing eyes blue lightning snakes crawling under his skin between the physical evidence the witness statements and his own rantings remington had copped himself a room in the barred and guarded section of the nuthouse hardings visitors badge flapped on the lapel of his tailored suit jacket his tie the exact shade of charcoal as the suit was perfectly knotted his hair was dark shot with silver and meticulously cut to suit his square ruddy face his features were blocky and his eyes a dark brown tended to vanish when he smiled his mouth was thin and when annoyed he appeared to be lipless if his face and his speaking voice had been marginally more appealing he might have wormed his way into television news hed once wanted that the way some boys want that first touch of female breast lustfully gleefully but the camera was not his friend it accented his features and made his short stocky build resemble a tree stump his voice as some smartmouthed tech had once told him sounded like a wounded goose when miked the cruel loss of that childhood dream had helped turn harding into the kind of print reporter he was today ruthless and icebergcold he listened to the echo of locks being released heavy doors opening he would remember to describe them when he wrote of this visit of the eerie clang of metal on metal the impassive faces of the guards and medical staff the oddly sweet smell of madness he waited outside yet another room there was a final check here an attendant beside the door with a bank of monitors on his desk the inmates in this section harding had been told were under twentyfourhour surveillance when he stepped in with remington he himself would be watched as well that was he admitted a comfort the last door was opened harding was reminded he had thirty minutes he intended to make the most of it evan remington didnt look like the man harding was used to seeing in the glossy pages of magazines or in sparkling color on the television screen he sat in a chair dressed in a violently orange coverall his posture rulerstraight there were restraints on his wrists his hair once a golden crown was dull yellow and cut short his handsome face was puffy now from the institutional food from medication from lack of salon treatments the mouth was slack the eyes dead as a dolls they had him sedated harding imagined take your average sociopath toss in a few psychoses and violent tendencies and drugs were everyones best friend but he hadnt counted on trying to wend his way through the chemical maze to remingtons brain there was a guard at the door to remingtons back who was already looking bored harding sat on his side of the counter looked between the bars mr remington im harding jonathan q harding i believe you were expecting me today there was no response harding cursed inwardly couldnt they have waited to give him his zoning pills until after the interview i spoke with your sister yesterday mr remington nothing barbara your sister a thin line of drool slid out the corner of remingtons mouth fastidiously harding looked away from it i was hoping to talk to you about your exwife about what happened on three sisters the night you were arrested i work for first magazine or he did for the moment his editors were becoming entirely too delicate and pennypinching for his taste i want to do a story on you mr remington to tell your side your sister is eager for you to talk to me that wasnt entirely true but he had convinced her that an interview might lead to a sympathetic story which might in turn give weight to her legal action to have her brother moved to a private facility i might be able to help you mr remington evan he corrected i want to help you he got nothing but that dead and silent stare and the sheer emptiness of it scuttled along his skin im planning to talk to everyone involved to get a fully rounded story im going to talk to your exwife im going to arrange to interview helen at the sound of the name the dark dull eyes flickered someones at home after all harding thought and edged slightly forward is there anything youd like me to tell helen for you any message i can take to helen helen the voice was raspy hardly more than a whisper harding told himself that was why a cold finger tickled down his spine at the sound of it thats right helen im going to see helen very soon i killed her the slack mouth bowed up into a stunning and brilliant smile in the woods in the dark i kill her every night because she keeps coming back she keeps laughing at me so i kill her what happened that night in the woods with helen she ran from me shes mad you know why else would she run would she think she could get away i had to kill her her eyes burned blue lightning did they burn like blue lightning it wasnt helen remingtons eyes darted black birds on the wing helen was quiet and obedient she knew who was in charge she knew as he spoke his fingers began to scrabble on the arms of the chair who was it a witch came out of hell all of them so much light so much light they blinded me they cursed me snakes under my skin snakes circle of light circle of blood can you see it for a moment he could clear as glass and terrifying harding had to force back a shudder who are all of them theyre all helen he began to laugh a high keening sound that shivered along hardings skin until the fine hairs on his arm stood up all helen burn the witch i kill her every night every night but she comes back he was screaming now so that harding whod seen his share of horrors pushed away leaped up even as the guard surged forward a lunatic harding told himself as attendants hustled him out of the room mad as a hatter but but the smell of the story was too strong to resist some people might have been nervous at the prospect of spending an evening in the home of a witch being nervous they might have stocked up on wolfsbane or carried a pocket full of salt mac went armed with his tape recorder and notebook and a bottle of good cabernet hed waited patiently through his first week on the island hoping for this initial invitation he was about to dine with mia devlin it hadnt been easy to resist driving up to her house on his own hiking through her woods poking around in the shadows of the lighthouse but that would have been by his standards rude patience and courtesy had paid off and shed casually asked him if he would like to come up for dinner hed accepted just as casually now as he drove up the coast road he was filled with anticipation there was so much he wanted to ask her particularly since ripley shut down each time he tried to question her he had yet to approach nell two warnings by two witches made a definite point he would wait there until nell came to him or the path was cleared there was plenty of time and he still had that ace in the hole he liked the look of her place the old stone high on the cliff standing against time and the sea the art of the gables the romance of the widows walk the mystery of the turrets the white beam from the lighthouse cut through the dark like a wide blade swept over sea the stone house the dark stand of trees it was a lonely spot he thought as he parked almost arrogantly alone and undeniably beautiful it suited her perfectly the snow had been neatly cleared from her drive from her walk he couldnt imagine any woman who looked like mia devlin hoisting a snow shovel he wondered if that was a sexist opinion he decided it wasnt it had nothing to do with her being a woman and everything to do with beauty he simply couldnt imagine her doing anything that wasnt elegant the minute she opened the door he was certain that he was right she wore a dress of deep forest green the sort that covered a woman from neck to toe and still managed to tell a man that everything under it was perfect was fascinating stones glittered at her ears on her fingers on a braided silver chain a single carved disk glinted almost at her waist her feet were seductively bare she smiled held out a hand im glad you could come and bearing gifts she accepted the bottle of wine it was her favorite she noted how did you know huh oh the wine its my job to dig up pertinent data with a laugh she drew him inside welcome to my home let me take your coat she stood close let her fingertips graze his arm she considered it a kind of test for both of them im tempted to say come into my parlor her laugh came again low and rich so i will she gestured to a room off the wide foyer make yourself comfortable ill open the wine slightly dazed he walked into a large room where a fire burned brightly the room was full of rich color soft fabrics gleaming wood and glass old beautifully faded rugs were spread over a wideplanked floor he recognized wealth comfortable tasteful and somehow female wealth there were flowers lilies with starshaped petals as white as the snow outside in a tall clear vase the air smelled of them and of her even a dead man mac imagined would have felt his blood warming his juices flowing there were books tucked on shelves among pretty bottles and chunks of crystals and intriguing little statues he gave those his attention what a person read gave insight into the person im a practical woman he jumped shed come in silently like smoke excuse me practical she repeated setting down the tray that held the wine and two glasses books are a passion and i opened the store so i could make a profit from my passion your passions eclectic single channels are so monotonous she poured the wine crossed to him her eyes never leaving his youd agree since your interests are varied as well yes thanks to a variety of passions then her eyes laughed as she touched her glass to his she sat on the low sofa smiling still as she patted the cushion beside her come sit tell me what you think of our little island in the sea he wondered if the room was overwarm or if she simply radiated heat wherever she went but he sat i like it the village is just quaint enough without being trite and the people friendly enough without being obviously nosy your bookstore adds a touch of sophistication and the sea adds glamour the forests mystery im comfortable here handy and youre comfortable in my little cottage more than ive gotten considerable work done already youre a practical soul too arent you macallister she sipped red wine against red lips despite what many would consider the impracticality of your chosen field it felt as though the collar of his shirt had shrunk knowledge is always practical and thats what you seek under it all the knowing she curled up and her knees brushed his leg lightly a seeking mind is very attractive yeah well he drank wine gulped it hows your appetite his color rose my appetite he was she decided absolutely delightful why dont we move into the dining room ill feed you great good she uncurled trailed fingertips down his arm again bring the wine handsome oh boy was his only clear thought the dining room should have felt formal intimidating with its huge mahogany table the wide sideboards and highbacked chairs but it was as welcoming as her parlor the colors were warm here too deep burgundy shades mixed with dark golds flowers in the same hues scented this air as well and speared out of cut crystal a fire crackled like an accompaniment to the quiet music of harps and pipes the trio of windows along the wall was left uncovered to bring the contrast of black night and white snow into the room perfect as a photograph there was a succulent rack of lamb and the light of a dozen candles if shed been intending to dress a stage for romance she had succeeded expertly as they ate she steered the conversation into literature art theater all the while watching him with flattering attention it was almost he thought hypnotic the way she looked at a man fully directly deeply candlelight played over her skin like gold on alabaster in her eyes like gilt over smoke he wished he could do better than rough pencil sketches hers was a face that demanded oil and canvas it surprised him that they had so much common ground books enjoyed music appreciated then again each of them had spent considerable time learning of the others background he knew shed grown up here in this house an only child and that her parents had given most of her daytoday care into lulus hands shed gone to college at radcliffe and had earned degrees in literature and business her parents had left the island before shed graduated and rarely returned she came from money as did he she belonged to no coven no group no organization and lived quietly and alone in the place of her birth she had never married nor had she ever lived with a man he wondered that a woman so obviously so elegantly sexual had not done so you enjoy traveling she said theres a lot out there to see i guess i enjoyed it more in my twenties the kick of packing up taking off whenever i wanted or needed to and living in new york the excitement the stimulation it has its advantages but my work can be done anywhere do you get to new york often no i rarely leave the island i have all i need and want here museums theater galleries i dont have much of a thirst for them i prefer my cliffs my forest my work and my garden she added its a pity its winter or we could take a stroll through my garden instead well have to settle for coffee and dessert in the parlor she treated him to delicate profiteroles which he enjoyed offered him brandy which he declined a clock from somewhere deep in the house bonged the hour as she once again curled herself on the sofa beside him youre a man of great personal restraint and willpower arent you dr booke im not sure thats ever come up why because youve been in my home alone with me for more than two hours ive plied you with wine candlelight music and yet you havent brought up your professional interest in me nor have you tried to seduce me is that admirable i wonder or should i be insulted i thought about both those things really and what did you think that you invited me into your home so to bring up my professional interest was inappropriate ah she tilted her head deliberately giving him the opening to lean in take her mouth and the seduction if theres a man whos been within a half a mile of you and hasnt imagined seducing you he needs therapy immediately oh i do like you more than id counted on actually now ill apologize for baiting you why i liked it mac she leaned over touched her lips lightly to his were going to be friends arent we i hope so i might have enjoyed being more but it would have been brief and it would have complicated destinies yours or mine both and more were not meant to be lovers i didnt know youd already realized that i hope you dont mind if i regret it a little id be annoyed if you didnt she tossed back her curling flood of darkred hair ask the professional question thats most on your mind ill answer if i can the circle in the woods by the cottage how did you cast it surprise had her pursing her lips she rose to give herself a moment to think thats a good one she said wandering to the window how did you find it before he could answer she waved a hand no never mind its your job i cant answer a question that involves others who may not wish it i know about ripley and nell she glanced back over her shoulder do you from research process of elimination observation he shrugged his shoulders from being good at what i do i havent approached nell because both you and ripley objected i see are you afraid what wed do if you ignored our objections no no just that simple and quick a courageous man not at all you wouldnt use your gift to punish or harm not without cause or provocation and then only to protect ripley doesnt have your control or dedication but she has her own code possibly more strict than yours you read people well and youve approached ripley youve spoken to her yes i have the corners of her mouth bowed up but there was little humor in the smile and you say youre not courageous there was enough bite to the words to intrigue what happened between the two of you thats a second question and ive yet to decide if ill answer the first until ripley confirms your supposition its not a supposition its fact and she has confirmed it now you surprise me puzzling it out mia paced to the fireplace from there to the coffeepot to pour though she had no desire for coffee youd protect her too mac said quietly she matters to you a great deal we were friends as close as friends can be for most of our lives now were not she said it simply though it was anything but simple but i havent forgotten what we were or what we shared even so ripley can protect herself i cant think why shed have admitted to you so quickly what she has what she is i boxed her in he hesitated only a moment then told mia of the energy burst the woman on the beach the hour hed spent with ripley in the cottage mia took his wrist examined it herself her temper was always a problem but her conscience is even stronger shell suffer for having harmed you shed have transferred the burns you know pardon that would have been her way to do penance to make it right and just again taking the burns from your flesh onto her own he thought of the heat the pain swore damn it that wasnt necessary for her it was let it go she released his wrist wandered about the room and settled her mind you want her sexually he shifted on the sofa the blush wanted to creep up his neck im not entirely comfortable getting into that subject with another woman men are so often squeamish about sex discussing it not having it thats all right she came back sat again now to answer your question im sorry would you object if i recorded your answer dr booke amusement sang in her voice as he took the little tape recorder out of his pocket such a boy scout always prepared no i dont suppose id object but well just put it on record as well that this goes into no publication without my written permission youre a boy scout yourself agreed nell had taken precautions and so had i legal action was about to begin as further protection zack who is also good at his job and very much in love with nell was also protecting her yet evan remington came to the island and he found her he hurt her and terrorized her he nearly killed zack and would have killed nell despite everything he would have taken her life that night she ran to the woods to keep him from killing zack who was already wounded ran there knowing he would follow her shes a courageous woman oh indeed she knew the woods theyre hers and it was the dark of the moon yet still he found her as part of her knew he would there are fates that nothing can turn no magic no intellect no effort her eyes were deep and intense as they met his now do you believe that yes i do she nodded as she studied his face i thought you would and on some level you even understand it he was meant to find her this test that held her life in the balance was written centuries ago her courage and faith in self were key she paused a moment gathering herself even knowing that i was afraid as a woman is afraid he held a knife to her throat her face was already bruised from his hand i abhor those who prey on others who deliberately cause fear and pain in those they see as weaker youre a civilized woman he said am i dr booke do you also understand that it was within my power to have caused evan remingtons heart to stop to have stopped his life given him unspeakable pain in the instant he threatened my sister a curse of that magnitude that violence requires the belief of the one being cursed and a complex ritual with he trailed off because mia was sipping coffee and smiling pure amusement now all my research confirms that as you like she said it lightly and the back of his neck prickled what i could have done is one thing im bound by my own beliefs my own vows i cant break faith and be what i am we stood the five of us in that wood both zack and ripley had weapons but using them would certainly have ended nells life as well as remingtons there was only one path one answer the circle of three we cast it that night without the ceremony the tools the chants that are most often required we cast the circle through will fascinating he thought amazing ive never seen that done nor had i until that night ever attempted it needs must she murmured a link mind to mind to mind and power dr booke ran in a ring like fire he couldnt harm her when she would not be harmed he couldnt stay sane when forced to face what lived inside him she spoke quietly but something the word magic seemed almost too ordinary shimmered in the room stroked over his skin ripley told me you closed the circle ripley is uncharacteristically chatty with you yes we closed the circle the energys still there stronger than any open circle ive documented the three are very strong when linked i suspect the energy will be there long after were just memories nell found what she needed the first step toward the balance the air cooled again and she was just a beautiful woman holding a china pot more coffee she asked seven the slickhanded son of a bitch first he puts the moves on her then he worms his way past her better judgment with that cute trustme act then he makes it clear he wants to have sex ripley ground her teeth as she jogged along the beach then then at the first chance he cozies up to mia men she decided were slugs she might not have gotten wind of it either if nell hadnt casually commented about mia having mac up to her house for dinner dinner she snorted right dinner she just bet he had his mind on his stomach when he bought a bottle of mias favorite fancy french wine at island liquors shed heard about that too after the fact hed even asked the clerk which type vintage mia preferred well he was free to put the make on mia and on every female on the island but not when hed put it on ripley todd first bastard cityslicker bastard getting her all stirred up and twitchy then sneaking off to nibble on mia mia had probably cast out lures just to get her goat it would be just like her she swung around at the end of the beach pounded in the opposite direction no damn it it wasnt however much she would have enjoyed jabbing her elbow in mias face on principle she couldnt delude herself mia never went sniffing after someone elses man the fact was she didnt sniff after men at all which was probably why she was such a moody irritating woman a little recreational sex would improve her attitude but it wasnt mias style and however much at odds they were mia devlin was entirely too loyal and too damn classy to poach which brought ripley back full circle to mac his fault completely and totally all she had to do now was figure out the most satisfying way to make him pay for it she finished her run showered dressed for the day in dark wool slacks and a turtleneck buttoning a flannel shirt over it she laced up her boots then took a good long look at herself in the mirror she could never compete with mia in the looks department who could then again shed never wanted to she had her own style and was comfortable with it still she knew just how to bump up the package when she was in the mood toying with the outline of an idea for vengeance she slicked on lipstick smudged on eyeliner and shadow brushed on mascara satisfied that shed made the best use of what she had to work with she sprayed on some of the perfume nell had put in her christmas stocking it was a deep earthy scent and suited her more than anything floral or airy after some debate she ditched the flannel shirt she might be a bit chilly before end of day but the turtleneck and slacks showed off her curves pleased with the results she strapped her holster to her belt and headed out to work pete stahrs mutt had gotten off the leash again hed nosed out a goodly pile of frozen fish guts feasted on same then had sicked them up along with his morning ration of kibble on gladys maceys pristine front stoop it was the sort of neighborhood crisis ripley preferred leaving to zack he was more diplomatic more patient but zack was on the windward side helping to deal with a couple of downed trees that left her stuck ripley im at the end of my patience i dont blame you for that mrs macey they stood hunched against the cold and several steps downwind from the mess on the front stoop that dog she pointed to where the unrepentant hound sat tied to a tree trunk by a length of clothesline hes got no more sense than a block of wood no arguing there either ripley watched the dopeyfaced dog grin and loll his tongue but you know hes affable gladys merely puffed her cheeks full of air blew it out why hes taken such a shine to me i dont know but the fact is every blessed time he gets loose hes over here doing his business in my yard burying some mangy bone in my flower beds and now this she set her hands on her hips and scowled at her stoop just whos going to clean up that awful mess if youre willing to wait ill see that pete does it its coming up to lunchtime and ill root him out and make him come over and deal with it gladys sniffed nodded sharply justice she thought was justice and the todds usually found a way to meet it i want it done soon and i want it done right ill see to that petes going to get slapped with a fine too gladys folded her lips been fined before yes maam he has okay ripley thought what would zack do the dog was harmless puppyfriendly and dumb as a turnip his major flaw was his obsession with dead fish parts which he either joyfully rolled in or greedily consumed each with revolting results as inspiration struck ripley hardened her face the fact is that dogs a public nuisance and petes been warned she tapped her fingers on the butt of her weapon well have to impound the dog this time well i should think gladys trailed off blinked what do you mean impound dont you worry about that mrs macey well take care of the dog he wont be coming around your yard to do any kind of mischief in the future the little clutch in gladyss throat had her voice quavering now wait just a minute as ripley had counted on gladys gripped her arm do you mean to take that dog in and and have it put down he cant be controlled ripley let the sentence and its implication hang the dog cooperated by sending out a pitiful whine ripley todd im ashamed of you for suggesting such a thing im not having it not for a minute now mrs macey dont you mrs macey me incensed she wagged her finger in ripleys face thats the most heartless thing ive ever heard putting that harmless dog down just because hes stupid but you said i said he pooped in my yard gladys waved her arms currently covered in the shockingpink wool of her sweater what are you going to do pull that gun and put a bullet in his ear no i oh i cant even talk to you right now you go on and you leave that dog be i want my stoop cleaned and thats the end of it yes maam ripley hung her head let her shoulders droop as she walked away and winked at the dog zack she decided couldnt have done it any better she tracked down pete read him the riot act he would go without lunch the macey stoop would sparkle and the dog who already laid claim to a snazzy red doghouse complete with a heated blanket would get a stronger chain to keep him on the stahr property when no one was home and that ripley thought would likely wrap up the keeping of the peace of three sisters island for the day on her way back to the station house she spotted a small figure climbing through the firstfloor window of a clapboard saltbox okay she decided with her hands on her hips maybe there was a bit more peace to be kept her brows lifted then knit it was the home of one of her cousins and the bright blue jacket on the b and e man was very familiar dennis andrew ripley what the hell do you think youre doing she heard his yowl of pain when he bumped his head on the window and felt no sympathy he was twelve and any boy of twelve who didnt own a hard head should in her opinion develop one he went still for a moment half in half out battlescarred hightops dangling then slowly he wiggled to the ground his hair was pale blond and stuck out in tufts around his ski cap freckles exploded over his face and stood out in sharp relief against his bright flush ah hi aunt ripley he said innocently he was ripley thought with admiration an operator thats deputy todd to you you little weasel whatre you doing crawling in the window um i dont have a key dennis well i dont mom and some of her lady friends went over to the mainland to shop and stuff she mustve locked the door lets try the question this way why are you crawling in the window of your own house instead of sitting at your desk at school because im sick he answered hopefully is that so come on then ill take you over to the clinic right now your mother has her cell phone doesnt she well just give her a call and let her know her sweet baby boys feeling poorly i bet shell come home on the next ferry ripley had the satisfaction of watching his face blanch dont call her okay please im feeling a lot better it musta been something i ate is all i just bet spill it kiddo and if you try to bullshit me again im hauling you to the clinic and telling them to get out their biggest dullest needle were having a history test he blurted out and talked very fast now historys the pits aunt rip its all about dead people anyway so you know who cares and its like european history crap and we dont even live there i mean hey do you know the capital of liechtenstein didnt study did you he shifted from foot to foot jeez what was it with boys and their big clown feet she wondered and attempted a pitiful look from under his lashes i guess maybe not so you decided to blow off the test and hook school just one stupid day i could take the test later i was going to hang out in the woods today and study he added with quick inspiration but its too cold so you were going to go inside and study um yeah yeah i was going to hit the books couldnt you just pretend you didnt see me no aw aunt rip he sighed recognizing the look on her face deputy todd she hooked him by the ear youre getting a police escort to school moms going to kill me thats right im going to fail the test shouldve studied for it ill get inschool suspension kid youre breaking my heart when he muttered shit under his breath she gave the back of his head a quick tap watch the mouth peewee were going to pay a visit to the assistant principal youll make a full confession and take your lumps like you never hooked school when i did i had enough brains not to get caught therein young skywalker is the power of the force he snorted out a laugh and because he did because he was hers she walked him the rest of the way to judgment with her arm companionably around his shoulders the mornings work and her replay of both incidents for zack put her in a much better frame of mind she strolled into the bookstore looking for lunch and gave a quick wave at lulu put your belly on hold a minute and come over here about a minutes all my belly can wait but ripley detoured and walked to the counter whats up i got a letter from jane yeah ripley thought of the cafés former chef she and her man had taken off for new york so he could have a shot at a part in an off broadway play howre they doing well enough sounds to me like they mean to stay lulu glanced toward the stairs lowered her voice guess who strolled big as life into the bakery where janes working harrison ford at lulus steely stare ripley shrugged ive had a thing for him lately okay who sam logan no shit ripleys voice dropped as well what does jane say about him hows he look whats he doing if youd shut up for five seconds ill tell you he looks so jane says better than ever tall dark and dangerous thats jane speaking she got all giddy because he recognized her she never had two licks of sense i dont suppose he said what he was doing or she didnt ask otherwise shed have put every word of it down but she did say he asked after mia what do you mean asked after just that casual according to jane hows mia and and nothing that was it that was all he bought a box of pastries wished jane good luck and walked out again considering ripley pursed her lips juggled the angles in her mind funny coincidence of all the bakeries in all the city he walks into the bakery where mias excook works i dont think it was coincidence i think his curiosity took him there i wont disagree are you going to tell her no lulu sucked air through her nose i thought about it chewed on it twisted it around and i dont see the point are you asking my opinion do you think im telling you all this to give my tongue a workout okay then i agree with you theres no point in it it still hurts her she sighed because it could still hurt just a bit to know that mia hurt besides if mia wanted to know what hes up to she could find out lulu nodded just feels better to have somebody agree with me go eat soups black bean today thatll hit the spot oh lu ripley paused on her way to the stairs if you write jane back tell her not to say anything about this you know already done that ripley told herself was that three good deeds in one day what more could anyone ask she strolled up to the counter started to ring the bell then saw through the kitchen door nell serving soup and a sandwich to mac he was sitting at the kitchen table a place reserved for friends shed taken two long strides toward the end of the counter before she stopped herself this wasnt the way she thought going in guns blazing metaphorically wasnt the way to deal with the man the situation or her own annoyance she gave herself a moment to calm then walked around the counter into the kitchen hi nell mac doing everything she could to radiate goodwill she sniffed the air smells great ill have what hes having okay if i eat back here of course coffee with that nell asked her lets jazz it up and go with a latté ripley unbundled her coat hung it on the back of a chair and sent mac a slow warm smile dont mind a little company do you professor no you look great today thanks she sat across from him whatre you up to i asked him to come back ripley nell squeezed ripleys shoulder before setting down a bowl of soup to talk annoyance clawed up in her throat and was dutifully swallowed if youre all right with it im all right with it actually macs been entertaining me with some stories of his travels and his work its fascinating im going to order those books you recommended nell added tossing him a glance as she made ripleys sandwich i hope youll tell me what you think after youve read them i will she served the sandwich ill get your latté when she was out of earshot mac leaned forward im not pushing her ripley held up a hand truce nells in charge of her own life makes her own decisions you miserable son of a bitch okay but i want you to understand that i know shes been through more than anyone should ever have to go through i wont push whatever the circumstances the fact that she believed him didnt change a thing she ate with him listened to his laugh when she told him about the dog the boy it irritated her to realize she liked talking to him hearing him laugh the man was good company even if he was a slug under other circumstances shed have enjoyed spending time with him getting to know him better finding out all the stuff that went on inside of that highvoltage brain his smarts werent boring shed already figured out that much then there were those terrific brown eyes the long slow smile the really superior body to say nothing of the moves which were past excellent then she imagined him using those moves on mia only hours hours after hed danced with her there was only one recourse he must be annihilated so she said you must be keeping pretty busy hunting spooks and searching for what is it vortexes or whatever busy enough im getting my bearings getting to know the island and the natives she said sweetly sure you know my days still pretty flexible he told her i can wander over to the gym almost anytime id enjoy the workout more with company why dont you ask mia to come sweat with you she thought what time do you usually go over in the morning she knew of course she knew everything that went on under her own damn nose about seventhirty that could work for me in fact she decided it would be perfect she walked into the gym at sevenfortyfive he was already on the stepper and just working up a sweat he hadnt shaved again when he shot her a quick grin she could only think it was too damn bad she had to crush him like a bug he was working out to music instead of tv wasnt it just like him to try to be obliging she set the weight on a leg machine slithered onto the bench on her belly and began to work on her hamstrings the added benefit was to give him a good view of her butt look and dream pal she thought look and dream i heard were in for more snow she counted off reps the skys full of it did you get that wood not yet i lost the name its in your coat pocket it is he looked cute when he was baffled thats where you stuck it after i wrote it down for you right pocket of your long black coat oh nobody seems to be thinking of health and fitness this morning she commented actually there was a guy in here before he finished up right before you came in great legs youve got there deputy todd you think she slid a flirtatious smile onto her face gave him a deliberate onceover yours arent so bad either dr booke you shouldve seen me at eighteen well twenty he corrected any time up to twenty i was the model for the guy who gets sand kicked in his face at the beach skinny were you a toothpick with a sign on his back saying please pick on me there was a little tug of sympathy for the skinny undoubtedly awkward boy remembering her mission she ignored it so you decided to get cut she switched to work her calf muscles a guy with my body type doesnt get cut unless he devotes his life to it i just wanted to get in shape i read up on bodybuilding she couldnt stop the laugh read up on it thats my approach he said with a shrug then i experimented with different programs until i found what i could do obviously amused at himself he grinned over at her i made charts no joke no joke he admitted charts graphs a computer analysis before and after a merging of the intellect and the physical worked for me ill say he flushed a little well it didnt take long to figure out that if i was going to be hiking trails climbing into caves hacking through the occasional jungle id better be able to handle the physical part of the job walk a few miles in a hundred percent humidity carrying a full pack and sensitive equipment you realize youd better put in a few hours a week at the gym whatever the reason the results are fine she rose to change machines and gave him a quick pinch on the butt as she passed when he only stared at her she laughed you can pinch me back anytime cutie she worked her quads pleased to note that shed ruined his rhythm have you taken a tour of the island yet not complete he lost count of his reps and struggled to get his pacing back ive been working more or less inch by inch next time the two of us have a couple of hours free ill show you around he was starting to heat up and it wasnt just the exercise i can be free anytime now thats a dangerous thing to say to a woman i like it she all but purred i like a man willing to take risks she licked her lips have you been thinking about me only ten or twelve times a day ah she wriggled off the bench as he picked up free weights another risky statement not to be outdone ive given you considerable thought as well she walked to the weights but instead of selecting hers skimmed a fingertip over his arm mmm all slicked up arent you me too she shifted closer brushed bodies wouldnt we just slither and slip all over each other right now maybe just maybe if all the blood hadnt drained out of his head hed have caught the hardedged glint to her eyes when she smiled but even the best man often stopped thinking with his brain when a hot sexy willing woman was rubbing herself against him let me put these down he managed before i drop them on my foot or yours i like lean muscles on a man she squeezed his biceps long lean limber the weights clanged like a pair of anvils against the stand he fisted a hand in her hair drew her up had his mouth a breath from hers then her elbow rammed straight into his gut back off he coughed it was the only way his body could gather air what what the hell he was too shocked for anger too busy trying to breathe normally again to do anything but stare into her suddenly furious face you think i want your hands on me he managed the breath rubbed gingerly at his stomach yes well think again nobody juggles me with another woman what the hell are you talking about and dont pull that innocent act maybe you think you can pretend you forget youve been hitting on me when you decide to hit on her and vice versa but thats taking the absentminded professor act one step too far who what she bunched both fists and nearly used them very nearly used them youre not worth it she turned on her heel and stalked into the womens locker room she kicked the wall just because it felt good then limped to her locker she was just about to strip off her sports bra when mac swung in after her you turn around and march straight out of here she ordered otherwise im arresting you for lewd and lascivious behavior he didnt turn he didnt march he stalked seriously surprising her until he stood toetotoe with her im entitled to an explanation of what just went on in there youre not entitled to anything from me now beat it if you think you can sashay in there tease me half to death punch me in the stomach it was an elbow jab and ive never sashayed in my life you deliberately came on to me with the express purpose of slapping me back i want to know why because i dont like cheats i dont like sneaks and i dont like men who try to see how many women they can sleep with at one time especially when theyre trying to add me to the list i havent slept with anyone i havent even gone out with anyone since ive been here lets add i dont like liars to that list he took her firmly by the elbows lifted her straight off her toes i dont lie and dont even think about spitting any magic at me she opened her mouth shut it again when she spoke it was dead calm take your hands off me he set her on her feet took a full step back ive made it clear im interested in you on a personal level it happens that im not interested at the moment in anyone else on that same level i havent juggled anyone i dont have the reflexes for it you bought a bottle of fancy wine and spent an evening snuggled up to mia where the hell do you get this flustered he dragged his hands through his hair i went to mias for dinner though thats completely my business shes one of the main reasons im here thats a professional interest however i also happen to like her very much i didnt sleep with her dont intend to sleep with her fine because shed started feeling like a fool even before hed released her she turned to her locker its your business like you said youre jealous he paused a moment as if to gather his wits or his temper after i get over being seriously pissed off i might find that flattering she whirled back im not jealous replay that little scene he suggested jerking a thumb toward the gym see what you come up with now im going to go soak my head i suggest you do the same he strode out sending the swinging door slapping eight there was one thing ripley hated more than feeling guilty it was feeling ashamed it took her a while to get there as her temper wasnt of the flashandfade variety she wallowed in anger enjoyed the way it bubbled and churned inside her and kept clear rational thinking at bay she rode on that blissful annoyance most of the day and it felt good it felt just the energy it gave her had her whipping through a backlog of paperwork at the station house and taking zacks turn at cleaning the premises she did her patrol on foot then still raring to go volunteered to take her brothers cruise shift she drove all over the island looking for trouble hoping for it when trouble didnt cooperate she spent an hour at home beating the hell out of her punching bag then common sense began to trickle through she hated when that happened that trickle opened a crack and through the crack she was able to view her own behavior with distressing clarity shed been stupid and that was hard to swallow shed been wrong and that was a bigger nastier gulp feeling like an idiot made her depressed so she skulked down to the kitchen when no one was around and ate three of nells brownies she could hardly believe shed worked herself up into that sort of a state over a man in the first place not that it had been jealousy she thought contemplating a fourth brownie he was completely wrong about that but she had overreacted big time and she she decided as the feeling of stupidity began to slide toward the first sticky edge of guilt had treated him shabbily shed teased him she had no respect for women who used sex as a weapon or a bribe or a reward for that matter but shed used it as bait and punishment that shamed her replaying her actions in the gym drove her to brownie number four even if he had been interested in mia which she was now convinced he hadnt been he was a free agent a couple of lip locks with her didnt make them exclusive or oblige him to fidelity though she firmly believed that if you were nibbling on one cookie you finished it off before you picked up another but that was neither here nor there the best thing to do she thought rubbing her now slightly unsettled stomach was nothing stay out of his way nip any personal connection in the bud though it was probably a little late for the bud stage she admitted they would just pretend nothing had ever happened which of course it shouldnt have she crept back up to her bedroom closed herself in and decided it would be wise to avoid all human contact for the next eight hours sleep didnt come easily but she put that down to overdosing on chocolate and deemed it fair punishment for her crimes the dreams when they came seemed harsher than she deserved the winter beach was deserted solitude weighed like chains around her heart the moon was full ripely white so that its light washed over the shore and sea it seemed you could all but count every grain of sand that glittered in that beam the sound of the surf drummed in her ears a constant sound that reminded her she was alone would always be alone she flung up her hands called out in pain in fury the wind answered and spun those sparkling grains of sand faster faster power sliced through her a blade so cold it burned hot the storm she called roared and built until it blocked the light of that pure white moon why do you do this she turned in the torrent and looked at her lost sister golden hair shimmered blue eyes were dark with sorrow for justice she needed to believe that for you no the one who had been air didnt reach out but stood quiet hands folded at her waist for vengeance for hate we were never meant to use what we are for blood he spilled yours first and should my weakness my fears excuse yours weak magic dark boiled inside her i am stronger now than ever i was i have no fears you are alone the one you loved sacrificed and she could see like a dream within the dream the man who had held her heart she watched him watched again as he was struck down taken from her and their children by the bitter edge of her own actions the tears that swam into her eyes burned like acid he should have stayed away he loved you i am beyond love now air turned over her hands hands that gleamed as white as that blinding moonlight there is no life without love and no hope i broke the first link between us and lacked the courage to forge it back again now you break the second find your compassion make your amends the chain grows weak i would change nothing our sister will be put to the test urgently now air stepped closer without us she may fail then our circle is broken once and forever our childrens children will pay i have seen it you ask me to give up what i have tasted what i can now call with a thought she flung out a hand and the great sea rose to rage against the shimmering wall of sand a thousand voices screaming i will not before i am done with this every man every woman every child who cursed us who hunted us like vermin will writhe in agony then you damn us air said quietly and all who come after us look and see what may be the wall of sand dissolved the furious sea reared back froze for one throbbing moment the moon so white so pure split and dripped cold blood across the black sky lightning slashed and whipped stabbed down toward the earth to smoke and to burn flames erupted fed by the wild and greedy wind so that the dark was blinded with light the night became one long terrified scream as the island was swallowed by the sea however upsetting the dream ripley could convince herself it was a result of guilt and chocolate in the light of day she could shrug off the anxiety it had caused and expend her energy shoveling the latest snowfall by the time zack joined her shed finished the steps and half the walk ill do the rest go in and get some coffee some breakfast couldnt eat i gorged on brownies last night so i can use the exercise hey he caught her by the chin lifting her face for a long study you look tired didnt sleep very well whats gnawing at you nothing i ate too many sweets didnt sleep well and now im paying for it baby youre talking to somebody who knows you when youve got a problem you march through work physical and mental drudgery until you come out the other side spill it theres nothing to spill she shuffled her feet then finally just sighed her brother could simply stand and wait through an entire geological era for an answer okay im not ready to spill it im working it out all right if all this shovelings helping you with that ill just leave you to it he started back in she didnt just look tired he thought she looked unhappy at least he could take her mind off that he scooped up a handful of snow smoothed it into a ball what were big brothers for and let it fly it hit the back of her head with a solid whomp he wasnt leadoff pitcher for the islands softball team without reason ripley turned slowly studied his cheerful grin so want to play do you she grabbed up snow as she sidestepped the instant he bent down for ammo she fired straight between his eyes she played third and it was a brave or foolish runner who tried to steal home against her arm they pummeled each other winging snowballs across the halfshoveled walk slinging insults and taunts after them by the time nell came to the door the once pristine blanket over the lawn was bisected with messy paths dented with furrows where bodies had temporarily fallen lucy with high delighted barks shot through the door like a bullet and dived into the action amused nell hugged her arms against the chill and stepped out on the porch you children better come in and get cleaned up she called out or youll be late for school it was instinct more than plan that had brother and sister doing instant and identical pivots the two snowballs hit nell dead center the resulting squeal had ripley laughing so hard she had to drop to her knees where lucy leaped on her oops zack swallowed the grin as he caught the dangerous glint in his wifes eyes sorry honey it was you know a reflex ill show you a reflex its comforting to know the entire island police force will shoot the unarmed she sniffed shot her chin into the air i want that walk cleared off and you can clean off my car while youre at it if you can spare a moment from your hilarity she sailed back inside slammed the door ouch ripley said then dissolved into laughter again looks like you may be bunking on the sofa tonight hotshot she doesnt hold a grudge but he winced hunched his shoulders ill go take care of her car got you whipped doesnt she he merely burned her with a look ill kill you later still chuckling ripley hauled herself to her feet as her brother and lucy plowed through the snow toward the back of the house nothing she thought like a good snow fight to put everything back on an even keel as soon as she finished the walk she would go inside and make nice to nell still shed counted on nells having a little more sense of humor what was a little snow between friends brushing herself off ripley picked up the shovel then heard the pained howl the wild barks gripping the shovel like a bat she raced around the side of the house as she cleared the corner she was greeted by a face full of snow the shocked gasp caused her to swallow some of it choke as she spit it out rubbed it off her face she saw her brother covered to his shoulders with snow and nell standing with a smug smile and two empty buckets she banged them together smartly to shake out any remaining snow that she said with a nod was reflex boy ripley tried to dig under her collar where snow was dribbling cold and wet shes good she was able to maintain the good even mood through most of the day she mightve stayed there if dennis ripley hadnt come shuffling into the station house its my favorite delinquent as he rarely failed to entertain her ripley propped her feet on the desk and prepared to enjoy the show whats up with you im supposed to apologize for causing trouble and to thank you for taking me back to school and blah blah gosh den ripley dabbed at an imaginary tear im touched the corner of his mouth turned up mom said i had to i got two days iss im grounded for three weeks and i have to write essays on responsibility and honesty essays thats the worst huh yeah he plopped down in the chair across from her sighed weightily i guess it was pretty stupid guess it was no point in hooking school in the winter he added no comment how about the history test i passed no kidding you are a jackass den well it wasnt as hard as i thought it was going to be and mom didnt wear me out like i figured she would dad either i just got the lecture oh ripley obliged him with a shudder and made him grin not the lecture i can use most of it in the essays i guess i learned my lesson though do tell well besides planning better so you dont freeze your ears off in the woods when you ditch school its less trouble to just do what youre supposed to mostly in the first place mostly she agreed and because she loved him she rose to make him a cup of instant hot chocolate and because you made me go in and say what i did right out i didnt have to sweat it out you know dad said how when you mess up you have to face up to it make it right then people respect you and even more you can you know respect yourself she felt a twinge in her gut as she dumped chocolate powder in a mug man she muttered everybody makes mistakes but cowards hide from them thats a good one doncha think aunt rip i can use that in the essay yeah she cursed under her breath thats a good one if a twelveyearold boy could face the music ripley told herself then a thirtyyearold woman had to be able to do the same maybe shed rather be grounded maybe shed rather write the dreaded essay than knock on macs door but there was no option not with guilt shame and the example of a twelveyearold crowding her she thought mac might just slam the door in her face and she couldnt find it in herself to blame him if he did of course if he did then she could just write a polite note of apology which was almost like an essay when you thought about it facetoface had to be the first move though so she stood in front of his cottage door as the light dimmed with dusk and prepared to eat crow he opened the door he was wearing his glasses and a sweatshirt that carried an emblem from whatsamatta u and a picture of bullwinkle under any other circumstances it would have been amusing deputy todd he said very coolly can i come in for a minute she swallowed the first stringy morsel of crow please he stepped back gestured she could see hed been working a couple of the monitors were booted up one of them had zigzagging lines that put her in mind of hospital equipment he had a fire going and she could smell stale coffee im interrupting she began thats all right let me take your coat no defensively she pulled it tighter this wont take long then ill get out of your hair i want to apologize for the other day i was wrong totally wrong and completely out of line theres no excuse for what i did what i said or how i behaved well that about covers it hed wanted to stay angry with her hed been very comfortable in that groove accepted she jammed her hands in her pockets she didnt like it when things were too easy i overreacted she said im not going to argue there id like to finish her voice frosted go right ahead i dont know why i overreacted but thats what i did even if you had been with mia in a in an intimate fashion it was none of my business im responsible for my own actions my own decisions and my own choices and thats the way i like it ripley he said gently now let me take your coat no im not staying i got myself worked up about it way more than it warranted considering that pisses me off and the fact is id talked myself into thinking that youd put the moves on me then put them on mia to try to soften both of us up so wed help you out with your work well he took his glasses off dangling them by the earpiece thats insulting i know it she said grimly and im sorry for it more im ashamed that i let myself use that to justify me using sex you know getting you worked up like i did as a punishment women who do that give sex a bad name so she blew out a breath tested herself no she didnt feel better damn it she felt mortified so thats all ill let you get back to what you were doing she turned to the door and he moved with her braced a hand on it digging beneath the surface which is something i like doing theres a small specific area of your overreaction that i find satisfying in a strictly shallow egotistical manner she didnt look at him refused to why bother when she could hear the smirk in his voice that just makes me feel more like an idiot im not opposed to that result he ran his hand down her long tail of hair im taking your coat he tugged it off her shoulders want a beer no it surprised her that what she wanted was a hug just a quick little cuddle and shed never been the cuddling type no im on call he touched her hair again a quick dance of his fingers down the soft stream of it want to kiss and make up i think well just take a break from the kissing part of the agenda she took the coat from him sidestepped and dumped it on the floor by the front door she nodded at his sweatshirt your alma mater hmm he glanced down focused yeah i did some postgrad work there you havent lived till youve seen spring in frostbite falls she smiled and felt better i cant peg you mac me either do you want he broke off as the phone rang then stood looking blankly around the room sounds like the telephone to me ripley said helpfully yeah which one bedroom he decided and loped away she reached down for her coat it would probably be best if she just eased out while he was busy then she heard him speaking what she thought was spanish what was it about foreign languages she wondered that stirred the juices she left her coat where it was and strolled casually toward the bedroom he was standing by the bed his glasses now hooked by the earpiece in the front pocket of his jeans the bed was made she appreciated that basic tidiness in a man books were stacked piled spread everywhere he paced as he spoke and she noticed he wasnt wearing shoes just thick socks one black one navy it was so cute he seemed to be talking very quickly whenever she heard a foreign language it seemed to be rapid just a flood of incomprehensible words in fascinating accents she cocked her head he seemed to be concentrating fiercely but not she thought on the spanish it came too fluently to be anything but second nature then he began searching the room patting his shirt with one hand right front pocket she said and caused him to turn and blink at her glasses uh no yes qué no no uno momento why dont i have a pen she walked over picked up one of the three that lay on his nightstand when he still looked frustrated she offered a pad to go with it thanks i dont know why they always como sí sí he sat on the side of the bed and began to scribble since shed already poked her nose in this far ripley didnt see any reason to stop now she angled her head to read his notes only to be confounded when they were again in shorthand probably in spanish too she decided and took the opportunity to study his bedroom there werent any clothes strewn around there wouldnt have been much room for them with the books the magazines the stacks of paper no personal photographs which she thought was too bad there was the usual pile of loose change on the dresser along with a saint christophers medal she remembered the grisgris in his glove compartment and wondered how many other bases hed covered there was a leatherman knife a set of small screwdrivers a few unidentifiable bits of plastic and metal that might have been some sort of fuse and some kind of glassy black rock she touched it and feeling a low vibrating hum decided not to touch it again when she turned back he was still sitting on the side of the bed hed hung up the phone and was staring into space with an expression both distracted and dreamy she cleared her throat to get his attention so you speak spanish mmm bad news huh no no interesting a colleague in costa rica thinks he may have a line on an ebe whats that oh ebe extraterrestrial biological entity a little green man sure mac set the note aside it goes with all the broomriding witches ive documented ha anyway its interesting well see how it goes if nothing else it got you in my bedroom youre not as fogbrained as you look only about half the time he patted the bed beside him thats a really thrilling offer but ill pass im going to head home why dont we grab some dinner he took off his glasses tossed them carelessly on the bed out well go out and get some dinner is it dinnertime it could be take your glasses off the bed youll forget and sit on them or something right he picked them up laid them on the nightstand how did you know i do that wild guess mind if i call home let my family know i wont be home for dinner go ahead when she stepped to the phone he took her hand turned her nudging her in until she stood between his legs id like to discuss that break from kissing you talked about and i think since youre the one who apologized you should be the one to kiss me im thinking about it she picked up the phone first kept her eyes on his as she called spoke briefly to zack then replaced the receiver okay heres the deal hands on the bed and you keep them there no touching no grabbing thats very strict but okay he placed his palms down on the edge of the bed it was time she decided to show him he wasnt the only one with moves she leaned over slowly letting her hands run through his hair before they rested on his shoulders her mouth paused an inch from his curved no hands she said again a brush of lips a slight scrape of teeth a hint of tongue she nibbled one corner of his mouth then the other let her breath come out on a long sigh she eased back a breath away held the moment suspended then her fingers dived into his hair fisted and she plunged instant heat enough to burn a man alive from the inside out his hands tightened like vises on the edge of the bed and his heart spiked straight into his throat it was like being devoured with merciless greed she took him over pumped into his system like a fastacting drug one that scraped nerve endings raw rather than numbing them he could feel too much and waited for his system to simply implode she nearly shoved him back nearly gave in to the need plunging inside her and pushed him back on the bed something happened to her every time she was with him that jangled her brain shocked her body squeezed her heart even now when shed demanded and taken control she was losing she felt him tremble and her own shiver of response it took every ounce of will for her to end the kiss to draw back he let out a ragged breath she could see the pulse beating in his throat like a jackhammer yet he hadnt touched her that kind of control was something to respect she thought to admire and to challenge she dabbed a fingertip at the corner of her mouth lets eat she said and strolled out of the room point for point she decided as she scooped up her coat they were dead even nine jonathan q harding knew how to get people to talk it was a matter first of all of knowing that under the veil of dignity and discretion or reluctance people wanted to talk the seamier or more bizarre the subject the more they wanted to gab about it it was a matter of persistence patience and occasionally palming over a folded twenty the story had its teeth in him every bit as much as he had his teeth in it he started back at the cliff on highway where a desperate woman had faked her own death it was a picturesque spot sea sky rock he imagined stark blackandwhite photographs the drama of them he was no longer thinking just a feature in a magazine harding had upped the bar to a big juicy bestselling book the seeds of that ambition had been planted during his first visit with remington it was odd he thought that it hadnt occurred to him before that he hadnt realized how well hungry he was for the fame for the fortune others had done it turned their expertise or their hobby into a book with a glossy cover and fast sales why couldnt he why was he wasting his time and his considerable skill on magazine bylines instead of him pursuing larry king for an interview this time around larry king would come to him a voice he hadnt known was inside him had awakened and it continually whispered cash in thats just what he intended to do gathering tidbits of information morsels of speculation and hard bites of fact from police records he began to follow helen remingtons now nell channing todds trail he had an interesting conversation with a man who claimed to have sold her the secondhand bike shed used as her initial transportation and after various questions asked at the bus station in carmel confirmed the bikes description helen remington had started her long journey pedaling a blue sixspeed he imagined her riding up and down the hills shed been wearing a wig some reports said red some brown he was going with the brunette she wouldnt have wanted to be flashy he spent more than two weeks tracking backtracking rapping into the wall of false leads until he hit his first jackpot in dallas where nell channing had rented a cheap motel room with kitchenette and taken a job as a shortorder cook in a greasy spoon her name was lidamae it said so on the name plate pinned to the candypink bodice of her uniform shed been waiting tables for thirty years and figured shed poured enough cups of coffee to fill the whole of the damn gulf of mexico shed been married twice and had kicked both sons of bitches out on their lazy asses she had a cat named snowball a tenthgrade education and a texas twang so sharp you couldve cut diamonds with it she didnt mind getting off her dogs for a few minutes to talk to a reporter and didnt scruple to refuse the offer of a twenty for her time and trouble lidamae tucked the bill just where youd suppose she would into the generous cup of her bra the sheer perfection of her the overbleached hair teased into an enormous cascade the blowzy body the staggering blue of the eyeshadow that covered her lids almost to her eyebrows had harding wondering who might play her in the film based on his book i told tidas tidas he runs the kitchen back there i told tidas there was something odd about that girl something spooky what do you mean by spooky a look in the eye a rabbit look scared of her own shadow always watching the door too course i knew right off she was on the run with a satisfied nod lidamae took a pack of camels out of her apron pocket women we sense these things about our own kind my second husband tried to kick me around a time or two she dragged in smoke like breath hah it was his ass got kicked a man raises his hand to me hed better have a good health policy cause hes gonna spend some quality time in a medicaltype facility did you ever ask her about it wouldnt say boo to a goose that one lidamae snorted sending a dragonstream of smoke out of her nostrils kept to herself did her work you cant say different and never was anything but polite a lady i said to tidas that nells a lady got quality written all over her thin as a rail her hair all whacked off any which way and dyed mongrel brown didnt matter quality shows she took another drag then wagged the cigarette i wasnt the least bit surprised when i saw the news report recognized her right off too even though she was all polished up and blond in the picture they showed i said to suzanne suzanne and me were working the lunch shift i said suzanne look at that on the tv set that one there over the counter she added for hardings benefit i said thats little nell who worked here a few weeks last year coulda knocked suzanne over with a feather but me i wasnt surprised how long did she work here right about three weeks then one day she just doesnt show for her shift didnt see hide nor hair of her again till that news report on the tv tidas was pissed let me tell you that girl could cook did anyone ever come looking for her pay more attention to her than seemed natural nope hardly ever poked her head out of the kitchen anyway do you think tidas would let me see her employment records lidamae took a last drag on her cigarette studying harding through the curtain of blue smoke dont hurt to ask does it it cost him another twenty to look at the paperwork but it gave him the exact date of nells departure armed with that and a reasonable assessment of her finances harding scouted out the bus station he tracked her to el paso nearly lost her but then dug up the man whod sold her a car he followed her trail by day read over and over every news article interview statement and commentary that had been written since remingtons arrest shed worked in diners hotel restaurants coffee shops rarely staying in one spot longer than three weeks during the first six months of flight there seemed little rhyme and no reason to her route and that harding thought had been the point she would head south then east then overlap her own tracks and drive north again even so shed always eventually headed east again though he didnt put much credence in lidamaes opinion of her own insight he did find a thread of consistency throughout his interviews with employers and coworkers nell channing was a lady how much more she was hed have to judge for himself he couldnt wait to meet her facetoface but before he did he wanted more he wanted evan remingtons story unaware that her life was currently under a microscope nell took advantage of her day off and a break in the weather the february thaw offered a teasing hint of spring with warmth that required no more than a light jacket she took lucy for a walk on the beach and toyed with the idea of going into the village to buy something foolish and unnecessary the fact that she could toy with the idea was one of her daily miracles for now she was content with the beach the sea and the big black dog while lucy entertained herself chasing gulls nell sat on the sand and watched the waves lucky for you im in a good mood or id have to write you up for having that dog off the leash nell glanced over as ripley dropped down beside her youd have to write yourself up too i didnt see a leash when the two of you went for a run this morning i used the invisible leash this morning ripley wrapped her arms around her updrawn knees god what a day i could take a few hundred of these i know i couldnt stay in the house my todo list is as long as your arm but i ran away itll keep its going to when nell continued to stare at her ripley tipped down her sunglasses peered over them what nothing you look pleased with yourself nell decided i havent seen much of you in the past couple weeks but whenever i have youve looked quite smug is that so well lifes good uhhuh youve been spending some time with macallister booke ripley trailed her fingers through the sand drawing little curlicues is that your polite way of asking if were doing it no nell waited a beat exhaled well are you no not yet content ripley leaned back braced her elbows in the sand im enjoying this presex interlude more than i figured i would mostly ive always figured if youre going to dance just get up and dance but romance is a dance of its own ripleys look was sharp and quick i didnt say we were having a romance like hearts and flowers and cow eyes hes an interesting guy to hang out with thats all when hes not caught up in spook patrol hes been all over the place i mean to places i didnt even know were places hed known the capital of liechtenstein she remembered imagine that did you know he graduated from college when he was sixteen she continued is that brainy or what even with all that he gets into regular stuff like movies and baseball i mean hes not snooty about what is it popular culture no intellectual snobbery nell commented enjoying herself yeah thats it hes into rocky and bullwinkle and he listens to regular music its like hes got this enormous brain capacity so it can hold on all the eequalsmcsquared junk but it still has room for the barenaked ladies plus hes totally buff and hes got excellent form in the water but sometimes he just trips over his own feet its kind of cute nell opened her mouth to comment again but ripley was already plowing on sure hes a complete geek but its sort of handy he fixed my headset when i was going to pitch it and the other day she frowned when she caught nells wide grin what now youre smitten oh please what kind of a word is that she snorted crossed her legs at the ankles smitten jesus its the perfect word from where im sitting and i think its wonderful dont get on that romance boat of yours and sail nell were just hanging out then well have sex and hang out well keep it friendly as long as he doesnt shove the witch angle down my throat then hell go back to new york and write his book or paper or whatever were not stuck on each other whatever you say but in all the months ive been on the sisters i havent seen you spend this much time with anyone else or look as happy doing it so i like him better than most ripley sat up again shrugged and im more attracted to him than most smitten nell said under her breath shut up bring him to dinner huh bring him home to dinner tonight why because im making zacks favorite and therell be plenty were having yankee pot roast ripleys mouth began to water im sure mac would appreciate sitting down to a homecooked meal instead of eating takeout or eating in a restaurant or heating up one of my deliveries nell stood up brushed sand off her pants sure he likes to eat nell youre not going to try any matchmaking deal are you her blue eyes widened with innocence of course not tell him sixthirty and let me know if thats not convenient she clapped her hands called for lucy then started for home she had a great deal to do in a short amount of time im not doing a spell mia angled her head smiled sweetly as nell scowled at the potato she was peeling then why did you ask me to come by and discuss your plans for tonights dinner because i admire your taste try again because you know ripley better than i do keep going oh all right grimacing in disgust nell snatched up another potato its not a spell that would be wrong wouldnt it she added with a quick sidelong glance yes that would be wrong you have neither partys permission added to that interfering with anyones personal life crosses a line i know it nells shoulders slumped just for a minute even when you have their best interest at heart she let the statement hang as a question though she knew the answer she looks so happy youve seen it for yourself you should have heard her she was absolutely bubbling about him deputy dawg bubbling mia chuckled id have paid to see that one she was and it was adorable all i wanted was to give her a little nudge not with a spell she added quickly before mia could speak a nice friendly family dinner and if i added a little of this a bit of that just something to encourage clear vision something that would lower the boundaries just a tiny inch or two and if theyre seeing what they need to see feeling what they need to feel at this moment can you be sure your nudge wont be in the wrong direction youre so frustrating when youre practical worse when youre right its hard not using whats available to help powers a tricky business if it wasnt it wouldnt mean anything youre in love yourself mia said still riding on that lovely rush of it all and youre seeing everyone coupled and cozy and content not all of us are meant for what you have with zack if you could have heard the way she babbled about him before she caught herself shaking her head nell scrubbed her peeled vegetables shes halfway in love with him and doesnt even know it mia indulged herself in one moment of pleasure and envy at the thought of her childhood friend taking the fall and if she did know it if you helped her see what may be happening inside her she might scramble back from that edge before she falls it would be just like her youre right again i hate that tell me what you think of him youve talked to him more than i have i think hes a very clever man very astute and very focused hes not pushing ripley with his research because he knows shell balk so he circles around that mia wandered to the cookie jar dipped in chocolate chunk im doomed thats calculation automatically nell moved to the stove to brew tea to go with mias cookie if hes using her wait mia held up a finger swallowed of course hes using her that isnt always wrong she refuses to let him be direct in this area so hes indirect why should he ignore what she is because she does nell to spend time with her to play on her feelings thats wrong i didnt say that and i dont think he is hes too well mannered and i think besides being smart hes also a very good man nell sighed yes so do i i imagine hes quite attracted to her despite the fact that shes abrasive annoying and hardheaded nell nodded that makes sense you care about her a great deal despite those facts i once did mia said flatly your kettles boiling she matters to you you matter to each other no matter what happened between you nell turned to deal with the tea and missed mias soulful expression shell have to deal with me again and i with her until she accepts who she is what she is and what shes meant to do shell never be open to what you have you had fear so does she so do we all whats your fear as soon as she asked nell turned back im sorry but i look at you and see only confidence such incredible assurance i fear feeling my heart break a second time because im not sure i could survive it id rather live alone than risk the pain the statement the quiet truth in it made nells own heart ache you loved him that much yes it hurt mia thought just to say it as much as it ever did i had no barriers where he was concerned so you see it could be dangerous to nudge at ripleys macallister booke is part of her destiny you know that yes looking isnt interfering theyre connected to each other but what they do about it the choices made are for them alone there was no arguing with mias logic but there was no reason not to choose pink candles for the table she neither charmed nor inscribed them the color being that used for love spells could be purely coincidental she already had rosemary potted on the windowsill for cooking of course and also to absorb negative energy it was true that that particular herb was used in love charms but that was neither here nor there nor was the rose quartz tumbled in a bowl nor the amethyst crystals that stimulated intuition it wasnt as if shed made a charm bag shed used zack and ripleys grandmothers china the silver candlesticks shed unearthed weeks before and polished to a gleam an antique lace tablecloth that had been a wedding present and a centerpiece of lily of the valley that shed forced to keep the winter gloom away the wineglasses had been another wedding gift and their garnet stems went well she thought with the pale pink candles and the rosebuds on the china she was so intent on judging the results that she jumped when zack came up behind her and wrapped his arms around her waist pretty fancy he rubbed his lips over her hair the table hasnt looked like that in come to think of it ive never seen it look like that i want it to be perfect i dont see how it could look better or smell better i nearly fell to my knees in reverence when i passed through the kitchen how come rips not helping you out its her date isnt it i chased her out half an hour ago she was in my way and so she turned kissed him briefly are you i figured you needed somebody to sample some of those little canapé things youve got in the kitchen no too late he grinned at her theyre great zack damn it i had them arranged i scooted everything in he told her as he followed her back into the kitchen no gaps keep your fingers out of the food or i wont make beef stew and dumplings with the leftovers nell honey thats downright mean no sulking now let me look at you she stepped back skimmed her gaze over him my arent you handsome sheriff todd he hooked a finger in the belt of her slacks come over here and say that she obliged was just lifting her mouth to his when she heard the knock on the front door thats him she broke free dragged off her apron hey come back here ripley can get the door no she cant she needs to make an entrance oh just she waved a hand at him as she hurried out go put on some music or something mac brought wine and flowers and earned nells approval three times that nell counted he touched ripleys hand as they enjoyed appetizers in the living room it was comfortable as shed wanted casual as shed planned and watching the two of them together she felt a nice warm glow by the time they settled down in the dining room nell was already patting herself on the back of all the places youve been she asked mac which is your favorite wherever i am is always my favorite three sisters is like this perfect little slice of the world and the natives are friendly enough zack added they are mac sent ripley a grin as he ate his roast mostly we discourage munching on missionaries and explorers these days ripley stabbed a potato mostly lucky for me ive had some interesting interviews lulu the maceys you talked to lulu ripley interrupted mmm she was top of my list shes lived here a long time but she wasnt born here and theres her close association with mia its intriguing to me the easy almost casual way lulu accepts the metaphysical she accepts mias gifts the way another might accept a childs hair color it would be different for you he said to nell coming into your talents as an adult i suppose she didnt mind talking about it in fact nell thought she might enjoy discussing the entire matter on an intellectual scientific plane but she recognized the warning signals in ripleys stiff shoulders more beef she asked brightly thanks its great zack i wonder if i could schedule some time with you get your perspective as someone whos lived here all his life and who married a woman of considerable talents sure my times fairly flexible he wasnt oblivious to his sisters reaction but he considered it her problem youre going to find that most of us dont think about the history of the island on a daily basis we save that for the tourists most of us just live here thats one of my points you live with it go about your business create and maintain normal lives we are normal ripley said softly exactly mac lifted his wine studied her coolly power doesnt alter doesnt have to alter elemental human needs home family love financial security the close familial relationship between lulu and mia for example isnt based on what mia is but on who she is he looked at zack i dont imagine you married nell because shes a witch or despite it but because shes nell true then there was her pot roast which cant be discounted strong emotion feeds power ive been pretty emotional about nells cooking since my first bowl of soup zack chuckled as he topped off everyones wine good thing i saw her first timing is key if lulu hadnt landed here when she landed here she might not have had the major role in mias upbringing and as i understand it nell if you hadnt walked into the bookstore at the exact moment that mias former café chef was quitting you might not have made that connection or not that precise connection that connection led to one with zack and to ripley and in a winding indirect way to me i dont have anything to do with it ripleys voice remained soft but the barbs were poking through your choice mac said easily choice is another key in any case since youre reluctant to show me around the island when im working i wanted to ask you about a place on the south point great old house lots of gingerbread wide covered porch theres not much else around it its just up from a cove that has a shale beach theres a terrific little cave the logan place she said shortly the family that owns the hotel it looked empty they dont live here anymore they rent it out now and then during the season why do you care first because its a beautiful spot and an appealing old house next because i got particularly strong readings in that area he watched ripleys gaze flick to her brothers face hold a moment i havent heard much about the logans they show up in my research of course but no one has much to say about them in the village how long since any of the family lived in the house more than ten years zack answered when ripley remained silent mr logan or one of his representatives comes back now and then to look things over but they stay at the hotel shame to let a beautiful house like that sit empty is it haunted zacks lips twitched at the muttered rumble his sister made not that i know of too bad and he meant it how about the cave i got the strongest readings there the caves a cave ripley shot there was a little twist in her heart and it annoyed her we used it as boys zack began to play pirate and hunt for treasure teenagers have been known to treat it as a kind of lovers lane he stopped abruptly as it struck home sam logan and mia theyd been teenagers once and the cave would surely have been theirs one look at his sisters face told him shed known and was trying to protect a childhood friends privacy wouldnt surprise me if your equipments picking up on all those hormones zack said cheerfully whats for dessert honey at sea nell rose ill get it ripley mind giving me a hand no fine sure annoyed ripley pushed away from the table and stalked into the kitchen what is it nell demanded what dont you want to say about the logan place its just an old house ripley i cant help if im in the dark with her hands in her pockets ripley paced the kitchen sam and mia they were a major item i know that much he left and hasnt been back it still hurts her yeah well she ought to get the hell over it with a sigh ripley bent down to stroke diego the cat they were lovers mia and i we were still we were friends we knew everything about each other the first time she was with sam the first time they were together was in the cave it was one of their meeting places i see its still a raw spot with her and she doesnt need some jerk asking questions and taking energy readings ripley dont you think if mac knew hed be less likely to rub against that sore spot i dont know what to think about him disgusted ripley straightened one minute hes a nice guy and the next hes trying to wheedle data out of you over your own pot roast hes got no business coming here as a guest and pressuring you and zack i didnt feel pressured nell took a boston cream pie out of the refrigerator im sorry it upsets you ripley but ive already decided to talk to mac im interested in his work and im interested in contributing to it you want to be one of his lab rats i dont feel that way im not ashamed of what i am and im not afraid of what ive been given not anymore you think im afraid ripleys temper flared thats bullshit as big a pile of bullshit as this idiotic project of his i dont want anything to do with it ive got to get out of here she turned on her heel and shoved out the back door she couldnt think but she knew she needed to walk off the anger before she said or did anything regrettable nells business was nells business she tried to tell herself as she jogged down the beach steps in the pearl glow of moonlight and if nell wanted to make an exhibition of herself expose herself to gossip to ridicule to god knew what she was entitled to do so in a pigs eye ripley called out kicking at sand as she hit the beach what nell said or did had a direct link to her there was no avoiding it not only because they were related by marriage but because they were connected and that son of a bitch macallister booke knew it he was using her to get to nell using nell to get to her shed been stupid to let her guard down these past few weeks stupid and there was little she hated more than realizing shed been a fool at the barking behind her she turned just as the big black shape leaped out of the dark lucys exuberance knocked ripley on her butt damn it lucy are you hurt are you okay mac rushed up behind the dog started to lift ripley to her feet get off me youre freezing what the hells wrong with you running out without a coat here even as she slapped at his hands he bundled her into the jacket nell had given him fine youve done your good deed now beat it your brother and nell are probably used to your spontaneous displays of rudeness he heard the scolding tone of his own voice but the closed and stubborn look on her face told him that she deserved it however id like an explanation rude she used both hands to shove him back two full steps youve got the nerve to call me rude after that interrogation at dinner i recall a conversation at dinner not an interrogation just hold on he grabbed her arms as lucy wanting to play wiggled between them you dont want to talk to me about my work and i havent pressed you that doesnt mean im not going to talk to anybody else you hook nell and you know its going to involve me you talked to lulu and you damn well asked her questions about me ripley patience he warned himself she wasnt just angry she was scared i never said i wouldnt ask questions im just not asking you if you want control of what involves you then talk to me otherwise i have to use what i get secondhand all of this was just to corner me he was a patient man by nature but that patience had its limits you know better just as you know saying that is an insult to both of us so just can it just i have feelings for you it makes it complicated but im dealing with it and that aside ripley youre not the center of this youre only part of it ill work around you or with you its your choice i wont be used neither will i as a target for your emotional storms he was right bullseye right and she wavered i wont be ogled like a sideshow ripley his voice gentled youre not a freak youre a miracle i dont want to be either cant you understand that yeah i can i know exactly what its like to be looked at as one or the other or both at the same time what can i tell you all you can be is who and what you are temper was gone she couldnt even find the pieces of it hed talked her down not because he wanted something but because he got it at the core he got it maybe i didnt think youd understand youd know maybe i should have i guess being the big brain is a kind of magic and its not always comfortable how do you do it she demanded how do you stay so goddamn balanced im not cut it out lucy still gripping ripleys arms he shifted as the dog barked and vibrated between them then he saw what had caught lucys attention she stood on the beach as she had before and she watched them her face was pale in the moonlight her hair dark as the wind teased it her eyes seemed to glow against the night deeply green deeply sad the surf foamed up spilled over her feet and ankles but she made no sign of feeling the cold or wet she simply stood watched and wept you see her mac whispered ive seen her all my life tired now ripley stepped away from him because it would be too easy frighteningly easy to step toward him ill let you know what i decide when i decide it and i want to apologize for being rude and swiping at you for mucking things up but right now i need to be by myself ill walk you back no thanks but no come on lucy mac stayed where he was between two women both of them pulled at him ten nell found it strange to knock on the door of a house where shed once lived part of her still thought of the yellow cottage as hers she had lived much longer in the white palace in california and had never considered it hers unless it was to think of it as her prison one shed risked her own life to escape but the little cottage by the wood had been hers for only a few months and had given her some of the happiest moments of her life her first home the place where she had begun to feel safe and strong the place where she and zack had fallen in love even the terror shed known there the spilled blood couldnt spoil the sense of belonging that the little yellow cottage with its dollhouse rooms gave her still she knocked and waited politely on the front stoop until mac opened the door he looked distracted he was unshaven his hair sticking up in wild spikes sorry did i wake you what no up for hours um he dragged a hand through his hair tousling it further what was she doing there did they have an appointment jeez what time was it sorry my minds come on in the peek past him showed her the room jammed with equipment lights were glowing and something was beeping steadily you must be working i wont disturb you i just wanted to bring you some of last nights dessert you missed it dessert oh right thanks come in actually im on my way to work so ill just since she was now talking to his retreating back nell shrugged and stepped inside closed the door behind her why dont i just put this in the kitchen for you uhhuh look at this wait wait he held up one hand making notes with the other as he studied a printout that put nell in mind of a seismograph after a moment he looked over at her again and beamed you just sparkle dont you excuse me the readings changed the minute you came into the house really fascinated she stepped a little closer and realized that no matter how close she got she would never understand a thing about it its different with ripley mac went on her readings are all over the chart and you never know but you youre a dependable soul her lips pursed the beginnings of a pout that makes me sound boring on the contrary he took the plate from her lifting the protective wrap to break off a piece of the pie scattering crumbs youre a comfort id say youre a woman whos found her place and is happy there im sorry i messed up dinner last night you didnt if youre going to eat that now let me get you a fork when she walked back to the kitchen he followed her watched her go to the right drawer take out a fork does it sorry does it bother me to be in here she finished for him and handed him the fork no this house is clean i cleansed it myself i needed to do it myself a strong comfort sheriff todds a very lucky man yes he is sit down mac ive got ten minutes do you want coffee with that well he glanced down at the pie he couldnt quite remember if hed eaten any breakfast besides the pie was here sure you said it was different with ripley nell said as she measured out coffee what was already in the pot looked nearly as hideous as it smelled and she poured it straight down the drain youre right i dont know all the reasons why but she doesnt talk about it and if i did i wouldnt talk about it its for her but shes my sister so im going to ask you straight out is your interest in her only to do with your work no he shifted a bit seeking comfort he was a man more used to asking the questions than answering them in fact it would probably be easier for me and certainly easier for her if she wasnt involved in the work but she is was she all right when she got home last night she wasnt angry anymore unsettled but not angry im going to confess and get this out of the way i set things up last night you mean the pink candles the rose quartz sprigs of rosemary and so on relaxed again mac shoveled another bite of pie into his mouth i noticed so much for subtlety irked nell got down a mug i didnt do a spell appreciate it he said with his mouth full i also appreciate knowing you thought about doing one im flattered youd consider me someone youd like to see with ripley are you making fun of me not exactly i upset her last night and im sorry for that but its something were both going to have to come to terms with she is what she is i do what i do angling her head nell studied him she wouldnt be attracted to you not for long anyway if you were a pushover good to know will you talk to me on the record yes just like that no qualifications she set his coffee on the table i wont tell you anything i dont want you to know im still learning mac i may learn as much from you as you do from me but now i have to get to work one question does the power make you happy yes happy and centered and strong but i could be all those things without it her dimples winked now ask me if i could be this happy without zack i dont have to after shed left mac sat thinking about her for a while about how she seemed to fit so comfortably into the rhythm of the island the rhythm of her power it couldnt have been easy for her yet he thought she made it seem like the most natural thing in the world to have started a new life out of the horrors of another what had happened to her hadnt scarred her shed been able to trust again to love again to become that he decided made her the most admirable woman of his acquaintance he could also see why ripley was so determined to protect her somehow he would have to make the hardheaded deputy see that nell was in no danger from his direction he packed up the equipment he wanted to take with him on his planned field trip and spent ten frustrating minutes searching for his glasses before realizing that hed hooked them onto his shirt pocket he found his keys in the bathroom medicine cabinet scooped up a few extra pencils and was on his way to the south point of the island the logan house pulled at him he could think of no other way to describe the almost physical tug he experienced when he stood on the edge of the narrow shale road and studied it it was big and rambling he wouldnt have said it was particularly grand particularly charming compelling he decided as he dragged out his recorder to log his thoughts the logan house sits on the south point of the island and is accessible by a narrow crushedshale road there are other houses nearby but this one sits on the highest rise and is closest to the sea he paused a minute let himself feel the wind taste the salt in it the water was a hard blue today a hue that made him wonder why the sea didnt slice itself open with its own waves when he turned a circle he studied the other houses more rentals he deduced there was no sound no movement except the sea and the air and the gulls that swooped over this quiet stretch to cry mias cliffs and wasnt it odd that they were at nearly the precise opposite end of the island were more picturesque he thought more dramatic more everything yet this spot seemed right somehow right for him its three stories he continued with recording his observations it looks as though several additions have been made to the original structure its wood cedar at a guess faded to silver someone must maintain it as the paint a grayish blue is fresh on the shutters and trim the porches front and back are deep and wide with a section of the back area screened off it has narrower balconies off many of the second and thirdstory windows with curling maybe theyre called valances ill look it up along the overhangs its a lonely spot but it doesnt feel lonely more like its waiting its odd that it feels as if its waiting for me he walked across the sandy patch of lawn around the side of the house to the back where he could stand just above the beach and study the quiet cove there was a dock again well maintained but no boat tied to it he would want a sailboat he decided maybe a motor launch as well and the masculinity of the house needed to be softened a bit with some flora he would have to research what grew best in this type of soil he wondered if both the chimneys were in working order and what it would be like to sit in the winter with a fire roaring while he watched the sea shaking off the daydreams he went back to his land rover and unloaded his equipment it was only a short hike to the cave he noted that the shadowed mouth of it was hidden from the house by the slight curve of the land making it more private more mysterious a perfect spot for kids adventures and young lovers he decided but if it was still used for such purposes there was no sign he could see no litter no footprints no markings as he walked across the shale he had to make two trips and though the air in the cave was cool and slightly damp he shed his jacket he set up his equipment to the pretty music of lapping water and the echoes of the underground chamber the cave wasnt large he measured it at just over eleven feet long and just under eight wide he was grateful that the heart of it was more than seven feet high hed spent time in others that had forced him to squat or hunch or even explore on his belly armed with a halogen flashlight something he hadnt had along with him on his first trip he studied every inch of the cave while his equipment ran something here he mumbled i dont need the machines to tell me theres something here like layers of energy new over old nothing scientific about that but there you go its a strong sense gut sense if this is the cave mentioned in my research it means whats this he paused shining his light on the wall of the cave he had to squat after all to see it clearly looks like gaelic he said reading the words carved into the stone ill have to translate it when i get back for now he copied down the words in his notebook and the symbol beneath them celtic knot trinity pattern this carving isnt that old ten years twenty maximum another guess ill test and verify then he ran his fingers along the carvings the indentations filled with lights that lanced out in narrow beams his fingertips warmed with the heat of them holy shit is that cool or what he sprang up to get his gauge and his video camera forgetting the curve of the cave ceiling and he rapped his head hard enough to see stars idiot son of a bitch damn it god with one hand clamped on his head he paced and cursed until the sharpest edge of the pain dulled to a vicious throb pain was replaced by disgust when he noted the wet smear of blood on his palm resigned he dug out a handkerchief dabbed gingerly at the knot that was forming he held the cloth in place while he gathered his camera and gauge this time he sat on the ground he took measurements logged them then prepared to document the changes ran his fingers over the carving again and nothing happened come on now i saw what i saw and i have the minor concussion to prove it he tried again but the carving stayed dark and the stone cool and damp undeterred he stayed where he was cleared his mind he ignored the nasty headache already full blown as he lifted his hand again his monitors began to beep what the hell are you doing holding a séance ripley stood at the mouth of the cave the sun throwing a nimbus around her body too many thoughts jumbled in his mind and all of them involved her he gave up for now on the carving and just looked at her are you on cave patrol today i saw your car she scanned his equipment as she stepped into the cave it was still madly beeping what are you doing sitting on the ground back there working he scooted around to face her then sat back on his heels got any aspirin on you no she played her flashlight over him then rushed forward youre bleeding for gods sake mac just a little i hit my head shut up let me see she yanked his head forward ignoring his yelp of protest pawed through his hair to get to the scrape jeez nurse ratched have a heart its not too bad you wont need stitches if you didnt have all this hair to cushion your lame brain itd be a different story are we on speaking terms again she sighed a little then lowered herself to the cave floor sitting as he was back on her heels i did some thinking i dont have any right to interfere with your work i dont have any business resenting it either you were up front about it right from the start and what you said last night was true you havent pushed me she was wearing earrings she didnt always these were tiny dangles of silver and gold he wanted to play with them and the pretty curve of her ear that sounds like a lot of thinking i guess it was maybe ive got to do some more but for right now id like to put things back the way they were id like that but i need you to know im going to talk to nell on the record ripley pressed her lips together thats up to nell its just that shes ill be careful with her ripley looked in his eyes yeah she said after a moment you will and with you i dont need you to be careful with me maybe id enjoy it he slid his arms around her waist rising to his knees drawing her up to hers in the back of his mind he could hear the monitors pick up again he could have cared less he wanted one thing at that moment and only one thing his mouth on hers as their lips met her arms wound around him her body fit to his like the last piece of a complex and fascinating puzzle for a moment it was soft and it was warm and it was everything shaken she drew back something inside her was trembling mac lets not talk about it his mouth brushed her cheeks her temples skimmed down to graze her neck after a while talk just intellectualizes everything i ought to know good point it has to be soon his lips crushed down on hers soon or im going to lose my mind i need to think about it a little more he let out one ragged breath before he gentled his grip think fast okay she laid her palm on his cheek im pretty sure im about done with that section of our program how odd mia said as she strode into the cave and how awkward as she watched ripley and mac draw apart she tossed her hair back i dont mean to interrupt even as she spoke macs equipment began to shrill needles slashed like whips as one of his sensors began to smoke he scrambled up saying nothing she spun around and walked back into the sunlight jesus it fried it it fucking fried it since he sounded more excited than distressed ripley left mac to his equipment and followed mia outside hold up as if she hadnt heard mia continued over the shale to where the water of the cove lapped and retreated where small tidal pools teemed with life mia wait a minute i didnt think you walked over this way anymore i walk wherever i please but not here she thought staring blindly across the water never here until today did you bring him here she spun around hair flying eyes brimming with a terrible grief did you tell him what this place is to me the years fell away between them for that moment oh mia how could you think that im sorry one tear escaped shed sworn never to shed another over him but one escaped i shouldnt have i know you wouldnt she dashed the tear away turned to face the water again it was just seeing you in there together holding each other and in that particular spot what oh god mia ripley pressed her fingers to her forehead as she remembered the carving i didnt realize i swear i wasnt thinking why should you it shouldnt matter anyway she crossed her arms over her breasts hugged the elbows tight because it did matter and it always would it was long ago when he wrote that long ago when i was foolish enough to believe he meant it to need him to hes not worth it no mans worth it youre right of course but i believe unfortunately that theres one person for each of us whos worth everything rather than speak ripley laid a hand on mias shoulder left it there when mia reached back held it i miss you ripley the grief of it trembled in her voice like tears the two of you left holes in me and neither of us will be pleased tomorrow that i said that today so briskly she released ripleys hand stepped away poor mac i should go make amends you smoked one of his toys i think but he seemed more jazzed by it than upset still one should have more control she replied as you well know bite me ah were back well then ill go see what i can do to patch things up she started back toward the cave glanced over her shoulder coming no you go ahead ripley waited until mia disappeared into the shadow of the cave before she let out a long breath i miss you too she stayed there crouching at a tidal pool until she pulled herself together mia had always been better she thought at smoothing her ruffles and ripley had always envied her that degree of selfcontrol she watched the little world in the water a kind of island she supposed where each depended on the others for survival mia was depending on her she didnt want to think about it didnt want to accept her connection or the responsibility it put on her shoulders refusing to believe it had given her a decade of normality and cost her a cherished friend then nell had come and the circle had formed again the power of that had been so brilliant so strong as if it had never been locked away it had been hard very hard to turn the key again now there was mac she had to decide if he was the next link in a chain that would drag her down or the key to another lock she wished with all her heart he could be just a man mias laughter drifted out of the cave and ripley straightened how did she do that ripley wondered how did she turn herself around in such a short span of time she started toward the cave just as mia and mac stepped out for an instant she saw another woman hair bright as flame sweep out of that dark mouth bundled in her arms was a sleek black pelt the vision wavered blurred then slid away like a painting left out in the rain it left behind the vague headache that those images always brought with them ten years she thought again for ten years shed blocked it all now it was seeping back liquid through cracks in a glass if she didnt shore up those cracks it would all break free and never be contained again though her knees had jellied she strode forward so whats the joke just enjoying each others company mia wrapped her arm around macs sent him a slow warm look from under her lashes ripley just shook her head get the goofy grin off your face booke she does it on purpose what is it about you and men mia you get within two feet of one and his iq drops below his belt just one of my many talents dont look so flustered handsome she rose to her toes to kiss macs cheek she knows i never poach then stop teasing him hes starting to sweat i like him deliberately mia cuddled against macs side hes so cute is there any way i can enter this conversation mac wondered without sounding like a moron no but i think were done now ripley hooked her thumbs in her jacket pockets hows your head nothing a bottle of aspirin wont cure when he reached up to probe gingerly at the knot mia asked did you hurt yourself let me see she was a great deal more gentle than ripley had been but just as firm after she took a look she hissed out a breath you might have had some compassion mia snapped at ripley its just a scratch its seeping blood swollen and painful none of which is necessary sit she ordered mac and gestured at a tumble of rocks really its nothing dont worry about it im always banging into something sit mia all but shoved him down then drew a small bag out of her pocket i have a connection to the cave she said as she took some cayenne out of her bag and so a connection to this be still she stroked her fingers over the cut he felt a gathering of heat a focus of the pain before he could speak she was chanting quietly with herb and touch and thought to heal this wound under my care to seal from illness and pain let him now be free as i will so mote it be there now she bent over touched her lips to the unmarked top of his head better yes he blew out a long breath the ache the throbbing had vanished before shed finished her chant ive seen cayenne work on minor cuts but not like that not instantly the herbs a kind of backup now be more careful with that handsome head of yours friday night then im looking forward to it wait ripley held up a hand what i thought it only fair that i make it up to mac for damaging his equipment ive invited him up on friday to observe a ritual ripley was speechless for a moment then she grabbed mias arm can i talk to you of course why dont you walk me to my car mia sent mac an easy smile friday after sunset you know the way obviously youve lost your mind ripley began as she accompanied mia across the shale since when do you perform for an audience hes a scientist all the more listen ripley broke off as they started up the rise to the road okay listen she started again i know youre probably a little shaken up right now and not thinking straight im fine but i appreciate your concern fine my ass ripley took three long strides away three long strides back waved her arms why dont you sell tickets hes not a gawker ripley and you know it hes an intelligent man with an open mind i trust him mia angled her head and those witchsmoke eyes were both amused and puzzled im surprised you dont its not a matter of trust but she rolled her shoulders as though she felt a twinge just take some time think it through before you do something you cant take back hes part of it mia said quietly you already know that i feel something for him not sexual she added but intimate nonetheless a warmth without heat if thered been heat id have acted on it he wasnt for me she said the last pointedly what you feel for him is different and it unsettles you if it was just sexual attraction youd have had sex with him how do you know i havent when mia merely smiled ripley cursed and this has nothing to do with anything it has all to do with everything youll make your own choices in your own time im going to ask nell to join us if shed like mia opened the car door as ripley stood and steamed youre welcome of course if i wanted to join the circus id have learned how to juggle your choice as i said she climbed in then lowered her window hes an exceptional man ripley i envy you that statement had ripleys mouth dropping open as mia drove away mac was packing up when ripley came back hed gotten all he believed he was going to get that day but he intended to return when the atmosphere wasnt quite so volatile in any case he needed to do some repairs and needed to settle himself as well when ripleys shadow crossed the opening of the cave he tucked his palmcorder into its bag you tried to talk her out of meeting with me thats right is that how you refrain from interfering in my work this is different why dont you give me your definition of interference okay youre pissed off im sorry but im not going to keep my mouth shut when someone i someone i know makes a decision because shes whacked out emotionally it isnt fair you think id take advantage of whatever it is that upset her wouldnt you he was quiet for a moment then shrugged i dont know she has several days to change her mind she made the deal shell keep it thats how she works so do you youre like two pieces of the same puzzle what caused the rift between you its old news no its not she hurt and you bled for her i watched you now youd protect her if you could he picked up two of his bags straightened youre the same with nell youre a shield for those who matter to you who stands for you ripley i can take care of myself i dont doubt it but thats not the point they stand for you and thats what you dont quite know how to handle you dont know me well enough to know what i can handle ive known you all my life she reached out to stop him before he walked outside again what is that supposed to mean i asked you once about your dreams one day ill tell you about mine hed put dreams in her mind thats what she told herself even as she was sucked into them knowing it was a dream didnt stop the action she was on the beach with a storm charging in like a runaway train and the storm was her fury there were others with her shadows and lights love and the barbed trap of its opposite a bolt sliced out of the sky a silver blade that cleaved the earth in two the world around her was madness and the taste of it wildly tempting the choice is yours now and always power snapped and stung the choice now and always she could reach out clasp the hand that beckoned that offered a bridge to the light or she could stay in the dark and feed she was hungry ripley awoke weeping with images of destruction still reeling in her mind eleven she rarely sought counsel in her experience advice was never easy to swallow but the dream had broken her back half a dozen times during the day shed nearly dumped it all on zack hed always been there for her and their friendship was as solid and true as their blood tie but she was forced to admit she wanted a womans shoulder mia and nell were out of the question they were too tightly connected but there was one who was linked to all of them and who could always be counted on to speak her mind whether or not you cared to hear it she went to lulu she waited until she thought that lulu had had time enough to get home from the bookstore but not enough to settle in too comfortably after shed waded through the lawn art adjusted her eyes to the virulent colors that lulu habitually selected to paint her house and knocked on the back door ripley was pleased to see her timing was good lulu had changed out of her work clothes into a sweatshirt that read coffee chocolate men some things are just better rich she had an unopened bottle of wine in her hand and was wearing ratty red slippers and the faintly irritated look of a woman whod been interrupted whats up with you she demanded it wasnt the warmest of welcomes but it was lulu got a minute i guess i do she turned away and clomped back to the counter for her corkscrew want a glass of this wouldnt mind it good thing i didnt light that joint ripley winced damn lu lulu let out a cackling laugh and popped the cork just kidding always could get you havent had a toke in she sighed nostalgically twentysix years your daddy was the first and last to bust me confiscated my pretty little plant and my stash told me he knew i could get more where that came from if i had a mind to or i could keep on working for mias grandmother and tending mia and he figured i had the good sense to know which i needed more always liked your daddy thats a heartwarming story lu just chokes me up lulu poured wine into two glasses then sat and propped her feet on one of the kitchen chairs what brings you to my door deputy can we start with some light conversation so i can work up to it okay lulu sipped savoring the first taste of the end of the workday hows your sex life thats sort of part of what im going to work up to never thought id see the day when leterrip came to my door for a sex talk before she could stop herself ripley squirmed jeez lu nobody calls me that anymore lulu grinned i do always did admire your upfront approach to things got man trouble baby doll sort of but nicelooking man phdeelicious lulu smacked her lips not your usual type of course kinda slow and thoughtful and a little on the sweet side not so sweet he hurts your teeth or anything just a nice flavor if i were thirty years younger yeah yeah youd have a taste of him yourself sulking ripley propped her chin on her fists dont smartass me anyway its nice to see you realize brains are sexy so hows he rate in the sack we havent been there rather than surprising her the statement confirmed lulus recent observations she set down her glass pursed her lips figured and that tells me one thing he scares you im not scared of him accusations of that nature always put ripleys back up especially when they were true im just being cautious and taking my time its complicated lulu pressed her fingertips together in a kind of prayer tent here is some wisdom of the ages grasshopper despite herself ripley grinned whos the smartass shut up and listen the wisdom is this sex is better when its complicated why because when you can snatch the pebbles out of my hand you will know the answer for yourself i really like him i mean really whats bad about that nothing i just wish sort of that wed gone ahead with it right off the bat so there wouldnt be all these jitters and wondering and buildup so it all seems so important the breath whizzed out of ripleys lungs okay yeah important worse i think he knows its important and if he does it means when it all comes down im not going to be really you know in charge lulu just sipped and waited and that sounds really stupid doesnt it okay ripley nodded oddly settled on one very important level i think maybe ive got that now theres more yeah mias going to let him observe a ritual on friday ripley blurted out and if mias involved nell will be too shes only doing it because she was upset yesterday at the cave you know the cave she got all twisted up and it doesnt matter how quick she manages to untwist again it shakes her shes just doing this to prove she can handle everything she can handle it lulu said quietly if youd stuck with her all those years ago youd have a better grip on what she can handle i couldnt thats done matters more what youre going to do now i dont know what to do thats the whole thing are you looking for me to tell you ripley lifted her glass i guess i wanted to know what youd say what you thought this messes me up lu its coming back on me in me oh fuck i dont know how to explain it i wanted it to go away i made it go away now its like there are these little openings all over the place and i cant plug them all it never did sit comfortable on you some things arent meant to be comfortable maybe i was worried it would get too comfortable i dont have mias control or nells compassion i dont have those things circles lulu thought they always came around no what youve got is passion and an innate sense of right and wrong and a need to see it served up thats why the three of you make the circle ripley bringing to it the best of yourselves or the worst and that was her fear her terror thats the way it went down three hundred years ago if you buy into it you cant change what was but you can whats coming but you cant hide from either it sounds to me like youre thinking youve been hiding out long enough i never thought of it as hiding im not a coward even after we dealt with remington i could pretty much pull it back maintain the status quo but since mac it keeps slipping out of my fingers so youre worried that if youre with him you wont be able to pull anything back not just what you are but what you feel thats about it so youre going to tiptoe around lulu let out a huff of breath shook her head worry and fret and whatnot about what might be instead of swinging into the saddle and finding out what is i dont want to hurt the ones who matter to me doing nothing sometimes hurts more than doing something life doesnt come with a guarantee which is just as well because most guarantees are bullshit well when you put it that way there was nothing and no one like lulu ripley thought for clearing out the murk i guess ive been on the edge of doing something for a while now and not doing it is making me crazy and stupid she added as she would have said to few others you gonna take that last step now ripley drummed her fingers on the table then sighed lets say im going to take a step and see what happens next can i use the phone what for i need to call in a pizza order it took mac most of the day to fix the sensor and even then it was only juryrigged it would take a day or two to get the replacement parts and with friday looming he was in a crunch im not sure what to expect on friday he wrote its better that way its a mistake to go into an experience anticipating specific results closes off the mind to possibilities i do now have a theory on the events in the logan cave the gaelic phrase carved into the cave wall translates to my heart is your heart ever and always while it will take time to ascertain the age of the carving i continue to believe it was made within the last twenty years based on that the location of the cave and mia devlins reaction to finding me and ripley there its a logical assumption that the cave has particular and personal meaning for her the carving i believe was done by her or for her the logans had a son samuel who was raised on the island no one speaks of him in connection with mia its a studied deliberate omission which naturally leads me to conclude that he and mia devlin were involved most probably were lovers before he moved offisland this in turn may be the foundation for the last step of the legend which is mirrored by the descendants of the original sisters nell to zack being the first and hypothetically mia to logan being the last which leaves ripley in the middle ripley and his fingers fumbled so he stopped sat back rubbed his eyes under his glasses he reached absently for his coffee mug and knocked it off the table the obligatory cleanup gave his system time to settle im connected to the pattern he continued i sensed it before i came here and with the documents ive yet to share with the others ive formed certain theories but theories and reality are different matters with different effects on those involved on me its more difficult than id imagined to maintain objectivity to stay in the role of observer documenter when i cant stop thinking about her trying to separate feelings from professional judgment is hard enough but how can i be sure those feelings dont stem from professional interest and glands he muttered but he didnt write that down does deputy ripley todd fascinate me because she has a preternatural gift that has come down to her over three centuries or because shes a woman who has managed to attract me on every possible level im beginning to think its both and that im already in too deep to care where these feelings come from he sat back again and as his concentration level dipped he tuned in to the beeps and buzzes of his equipment in the living room he shoved away from the little desk rapping his knee sharply on its underside then limped cursing out of his office ripley stood inside the door scowling at his machines dont you ever turn these things off no he had to resist rubbing his stomach it ached just looking at her i knocked i was in the office working didnt hear you youre lucky im persistent she held up the cardboard box she carried pizza delivery large and loaded as requested in the mood his mouth watered and his belly tightened it so happens ive been craving a pizza for weeks now me too she set it down on top of what happened to be a machine that cost in the high six figures she shrugged out of her coat and let it fall on the floor she pulled off her cap tossed it in the general direction of her coat as she walked toward him hungry oh yeah good im starved she leaped hitching herself up wrapping her legs around his waist and crushing her mouth down on his he stumbled back two full steps every rational thought slipped out of his brain and drained out of his ears sex now she said breathless as she raced her lips over his face bit his neck pizza later good for you excellent he staggered toward the bedroom made it as far as the doorway before he had to brace her against the jamb just let me he changed the angle of the kiss sinking deep until her moan echoed his i taste you all the time he scraped his teeth along her throat all the time drives me crazy me too i want you naked she began to tug at his sweatshirt wait slow down why laughing she did tormenting things to his ear with her tongue because jesus because ive been thinking about this a while his fingers dug into her hips as he started toward the bed feels like centuries i dont want to rush it he managed to get a handful of her hair to draw her head back until their eyes met i want to savor it savor you i want he leaned in nibbled at her mouth to take years to make love with you to touch you he continued as he lowered her to the bed taste you gently he lifted her arms over her head she quivered beneath him you talk a good game she managed for a geek lets see how it plays he traced the exposed line of her belly when her sweater rode up with a little teamwork he lowered his head and at the last instant angled away so his lips rubbed over her jaw her body was taut under his pumping off energy in almost visible waves he wanted that all of that but first he wanted her limp weak and stunned from pleasure her hands flexed under his but she didnt struggle her heart pounded against his and her lips yielded when he asked for them that alone was arousing knowing she would let him set both pace and tone she was strong enough what she felt was strong enough to give him that gift now he would show her he treasured it shed never known a man who could light so many fires with his mouth alone even as she yearned for his hands her bones her muscles melted under the heat she sighed and surrendered to it her pulse thickened her mind blurred when he released her hands her arms felt soft heavy she lifted them slipping off his glasses tossing them aside so she could frame his face to bring his mouth back to hers again he touched her now a skim and glide of fingers as he inched her sweater up off a lazy journey over her breasts just at the edge of her bra then a teasing dance over the center clasp she tugged his sweatshirt off let her hands roam in turn then his mouth came to hers again and brought out a quiet sound of pleasure weightless she floated on the kiss she nuzzled stroked contented as a cat when his mouth skimmed the curve of her shoulder shivered lightly in anticipation as his tongue trailed down the side of her neck moaned when it dipped under cotton to tease her nipple then cried out arching helplessly as his mouth closed hot and hungry over her breast she fought for breath for balance her fingers dug into the bedclothes as her system was plunged abruptly from contentment to desperation it was like throwing open a door to a furnace he thought a man could be consumed by all that heat still he craved more he snapped open her bra found flesh he felt her gather beneath him storm clouds merging into one electric mass and shuddered at her strangled cry of release as she went limp again he moved down her down the lean taut lines of disciplined female form angles and curves dips and lovely lovely lines he wanted to wallow in them exploit them absorb them the jump of her pulse here then here matched the leap of his own and the taste of her grew warmer stronger until he wondered how hed ever lived without it she was helpless had never been helpless had never been taken with such ruthless patience he owned her and there was a thrill in it in knowing she would let him do anything he pleased in knowing she would enjoy it her skin was damp hot it seemed he knew every nerve in her body and would send each quivering one by one she reached for him opened to him gave to him with a freedom shed never felt for another every move seemed impossibly slow as if they swam through water his body trembled for hers his heart raced she felt it all and the tensing bunch of his muscles under her stroking hands when his senses were full of her the scent the flavor the texture he rose over her waiting waiting until those eyes clouded now with pleasure opened he slid into her deep deeper he took her long slow thrusts until her breath began to sob and his blood to pound he watched the pulse in the lovely line of her throat rage as she came again her arms slid bonelessly from around him i cant just let me he replied as he pressed his mouth to hers again let me as if spellbound she rose with him fell with him and felt the impossible need build yet again go with me she gripped his hips groaned as she felt herself being swept up one more time he already was his world wavered burying his face in the dark spread of her hair he lost himself she felt perfect as if her skin had turned to velvet dusted with gold every ounce of tension had drained away in fact she didnt see how she could possibly worry about anything ever again great sex she decided was the best of all possible drugs she wasnt much of a cuddler afterward and had never been big on pillow talk but here she was wrapped cozily around mac snuggled in because it felt exactly right her legs were tangled with his her head cradled on his shoulder her arm hooked around his neck what made it even better was the way he held on to her as if he was just as content to stay there for the next two or three years himself did you learn some of those moves by studying the sexual habits of primitive societies he rubbed his cheek against her hair i like to think i put my own spin on them you do good work right back at you i threw your glasses on the floor you want to watch out you dont step on them sure i meant to tell you something before what youre beautiful get out youre in a sexual haze you have all this dense dark hair and i keep wanting to bite that heavy top lip of yours add that really swell body and its a great package when she tipped her head up and stared at him he blinked until he had her in focus what he asked im just trying to think whens the last time i heard anyone use the word swell that way in a sentence youre really weird mac cute but weird she lifted her head just enough to nip at him need fuel she said want pizza okay ill get it nope i brought it ill get it you just stay where you are and stay naked she added as she rolled over him and off the bed by the way youve got a really swell body too she strolled into the other room stretched luxuriously limber and naked she went into the kitchen for a couple of beers to go with the pizza she grabbed a pile of napkins then did a quick spin could she feel any better she wondered not just the sex she thought with a dreamy sigh that would have embarrassed her if she hadnt been so loose it was mac he was so sweet and smart so steady without being boring or stuffy about it she loved listening to him watching the way his mouth quirked just a little higher on the left corner than the right when he grinned and the way his eyes got all blurred and unfocused when he was thinking the way his hair all dark blond and thick was never quite tidy then there was all that fascinating intensity balanced by the easy humor he was the first man shed ever let herself be involved with she admitted who had so many layers he wasnt simple and didnt expect her to be and wasnt that lovely with the bottles clanging cheerfully together she wandered back into the living room to retrieve the pizza happiness soared through her and before she realized what was happening her heart did a slow turn a kind of waltz then suddenly fell her eyes popped wide oh my god before she could react to the abrupt and slightly terrifying realization that shed fallen in love every machine in the cottage went into action her head rang with the sound of them beeping squealing buzzing humming needles whipped lights flashed and she stood frozen in shock mac gave a shout and leaped out of bed he sprinted toward the living room tripped over a pair of sneakers and went sprawling cursing he scrambled up and ran naked into the room whatd you touch whatd you do nothing nothing ripley gripped the bottles like lifelines later she told herself much later she would look back at this and it would all be so ridiculous shed crack a rib laughing but for now she could only stare as mac rushed from machine to machine calling out readings actually patting his naked body as if he might find a pocket in his skin where a pencil was hiding man man would you look at this he pulled up sheets of paper holding them almost to his nose as he scanned the printout major events the first one nearly an hour ago i think i cant read the time cant see a fucking thing on the graphs where the hell are my glasses holy cow fried another sensor this is great mac yeah uhhuh he waved a hand at her as if she were a vaguely annoying fly i just want to rewind the videotape see if there were any visible manifestations youd better put some clothes on because youre a little vulnerable to injury at the moment hmm what was that he asked distractedly why dont we both get dressed and ill let you get back to your work only an idiot he thought would turn a naked woman away to play with toys especially when the woman was deputy ripley todd dr macallister booke was no idiot no lets have pizza he picked up the box and the scent of it of her stirred his appetite again ill go over the data tomorrow its not going anywhere he went to her skimmed his knuckles over her cheek i dont want you going anywhere either fair enough she decided she would go over her internal data tomorrow too watch your step this time i dont want you falling on the box and smashing dinner ordering herself to settle down she walked with him back to the bedroom howd you get the scar on your butt oh i sort of fell off a cliff jesus mac they settled on the bed the pizza between them and she handed him a beer only you she hadnt meant to stay sleeping over was entirely different in ripleys view from sleeping with it added another layer of intimacy that too often got sticky but somehow without her being entirely sure how he managed it she ended up squeezing into the tiny shower with him the next morning he proved to be very adept in tight places as a result she was feeling loose a bit muggy in the brain and vaguely embarrassed when she let herself into her own house her hope was to sneak upstairs change into sweats for a run on the beach and act as if nothing much had happened that hope was dashed as nell called out from the kitchen is that you ripley coffees fresh damn it she muttered under her breath and reluctantly changed directions she was mortally afraid there was about to be a girl talk and hadnt a clue how she should handle it there nell was working in the kitchen that was alive with the homey scents of baking looking daffodilfresh as she filled another round of muffin tins one look and ripley felt bedraggled awkward and ravenous want breakfast nell asked cheerfully well maybe no she sucked it in i really want to get a run in first ah i guess i shouldve called last night to let you know i wouldnt be home oh thats all right mac called i just didnt think in the act of reaching into the fridge for a bottle of water she froze mac called yes he thought we might worry he thought ripley repeated which made her what an inconsiderate idiot what did he say that the two of you were having hot monkey sex and not to worry she glanced up from her muffins dimples flashing as she laughed uproariously at the horrified shock on ripleys face he just said you were with him i inferred the hot monkey sex arent you a laugh riot in the morning ripley countered and twisted the top off the water bottle i didnt know hed called you i should have done it it doesnt matter did you have a good time im walking in at what seven fortyfive in the morning you should be able to infer something from that i would except you seem a little cranky im not cranky scowling ripley glugged down water okay it just seems to me that he could have told me he was going to call you or suggested i call you but either way that wouldve been assuming i intended to stay the night which i didnt but which he obviously decided i was going to which is pretty pushy if you ask me because it wasnt as if he actually asked me to stay in the first damn place nell waited a beat huh i dont know i dont know what i just said god irritated with herself she ran the cold bottle over her forehead im just weirded out over stuff over him yes i dont know maybe ive got all these feelings piling up and im not ready for them i need to run ive done a lot of running myself nell said quietly i mean on the beach at nells sympathetic nod ripley sighed okay i get you but its too early for metaphors then let me ask one straight question are you happy with him yeah ripleys stomach tied itself into slippery knots yeah i am it wouldnt hurt to just go with that for a while and see what happens next maybe i would maybe i could but ive figured out that hes always one step ahead of me sneaky bastard she gave up sat i think im in love with him oh ripley nell leaned down took ripleys face in her hands so do i i dont want to be i know ripley hissed out a breath how do you know so damn much ive been where you are and not so long ago its scary and exciting and it just changes everything i liked things the way they were dont tell zack she said then immediately regretted it what am i saying of course youll tell zack its like a rule just maybe give it a few days first i may get over this okay nell walked over to transfer baking trays it could be ive just got the hots for him and its messing me up i suppose and if last nights any indication well probably burn each other out in a couple of weeks max it happens ripley tapped her fingers on the table if youre just going to stand over there and humor the fool im changing im going for my run nell set the muffins on the rack to cool totally content with herself as ripley stormed out go ahead and run she said softly bet he catches you twelve considering that he was criminally insane evan remington had his good days he could depending on what pictures were wheeling through his mind be fairly lucid even momentarily charming there were moments according to one of the nurses harding interviewed when you could see the sly intellect that had made him a top hollywood power broker other times he just sat and drooled to harding he had become a fascination that was edging toward an obsession remington was a man in his prime by all accounts a brilliant operator of the entertainment machine one who had come from wealth and privilege and yet hed been brought to nothing by a woman the woman was also a fascination a quiet biddable little mouse if you accepted the opinion of many whod known her during her marriage a courageous survivor who had escaped a nightmare if you went with the popular feminist take harding wasnt convinced that she was either but he was willing to consider she was something more there were so many angles there beauty and the beast destroyed by love the monster behind the mask already he had mountains of notes reams of tape photographs copies of police and medical reports he also had the beginnings of a rough first draft of the book he was certain would make him very rich and very famous what he didnt have as yet were solid personal interviews with the key players he was willing to invest a lot of time and effort into acquiring them while he followed nells trail across the country forming impressions gathering data he flew back to visit remington regularly and each time he did he was fueled with more purpose more ambition and an underlying anger that baffled him the anger would fade but it came back stronger every time most of the travel was dumped on his expense account and though he shot off stories to the magazine he was well aware that there would come a day of reckoning he was already dipping into his personal funds couldnt seem to stop himself whereas once he had been proud of his magazine work had enjoyed even thrived on the pace and demands of it he now found himself resenting every hour he had to spend fulfilling his professional obligations the remington todd story was like a fever burning in him on valentines day and he would always find that wonderfully ironic he made his first real connection with evan remington they think im crazy it was the first time remington had spoken to him without prompting it took everything harding had not to jump at the quiet reasonable sound of his voice he gazed at the recorder to be sure the tape was running who thinks that the people here my traitorous sister my adulterous wife have you met my wife mr harding something icy seemed to slick the inside of hardings gut at being called by name he had introduced himself on every visit but hed never believed never really considered that remington had heard or understood no i havent i was hoping you would tell me about her what can i tell you about helen there was a sigh a sound of patient amusement she deceived me shes a whore a cheat a liar but shes my whore i gave her everything i made her beautiful she belongs to me has she tried to seduce you the spit in hardings mouth dried up ridiculous as it seemed it felt as if remington could see into his mind i havent met your wife mr remington i hope to have the opportunity to meet her when i do id be happy to take her a message from you oh i have plenty to say to helen but its private he said whispering the last word as a slow smile curved his lips many things between a man and his wife should be private dont you agree what happens between them in the sanctity of their home is no ones concern harding offered a sympathetic nod its difficult isnt it to balance that privacy when youre a man who has the publics attention remingtons eyes clouded fog over ice and began to dart around the room the intelligence the crafty humor in them had vanished i need a phone i seem to have misplaced my phone wheres the damn concierge im sure hell be right here could i ask you what it was about mrs remington that first attracted you to her she was pure simple like clay waiting to be formed i knew immediately she was meant to be mine i sculpted her his hands flexed at the ends of his restraints i didnt know how deeply flawed she was how much work would be involved i devoted myself to her he leaned forward his body vibrating as it strained do you know why she ran why because shes weak and stupid weak and stupid weak and stupid he said it again and again like a chant as his fisted hands pounded i found her because im not he turned his wrist as if checking the rolex that was no longer there its time i left here isnt it time i fetched helen and took her home she has a lot of explaining to do call the bellman for my bags hes on his way tell me what happened that night on three sisters island i dont remember anyway its not important i have a plane to catch theres plenty of time harding kept his voice low and soothing as remington began to squirm in his chair you went to find helen she was living on the island you must have been pleased to find her alive living in a hovel hardly more than a tool shed little bitch pumpkins on the porch a cat in the house something wrong with the house he licked his lips it doesnt want me to be there the house didnt want you she cut her hair i didnt give her permission to do that she whored herself she has to be punished has to be taught has to remember whos in charge she makes me hurt her remington shook his head she begs for it she asked you to hurt her harding asked cautiously something stirred in him something ugly and unrecognizable something that was aroused by the thought it shocked and appalled him nearly made him pull back once more but then remington was speaking she doesnt learn can she be that dense of course not she enjoys punishment she ran when i killed her lover but he came back from the dead remington went on i had a right to kill him for trying to take what belonged to me a right to kill them both who are all those people what people in the woods remington said impatiently the women in the woods where did they come from what business is this of theirs and him why didnt he die when i killed him what kind of world is this what happened in the woods the woods he rubbed his lips together as his breath began to rush through them there are monsters in the woods beasts hiding behind my face crawling inside me light in a circle fire too many voices screaming who is that screaming hang the witch thou shalt not suffer a witch to live kill them all before its too late he was screaming now howling like a madman as aides rushed in ordered harding to leave he picked up his tape recorder with a trembling hand and didnt see the crafty gleam in remingtons eyes ripley slogged her way through paperwork shed lost the coin toss with zack which still irritated her since the false spring was hanging on it would be close to sixty degrees by afternoon and she was stuck on desk duty the only good part was that he wasnt around so she was free to sulk and call him nasty names under her breath when the door of the station house opened she prepared to launch a few at him facetoface but it was mac who walked in behind what looked to be most of hollands supply of tulips whatre you doing going into the florist business no he crossed to her held out the rainbow of spring flowers happy valentines day oh well wow even as her heart went soft as putty her stomach jumped um you say thanks and kiss me now mac told her helpfully thanks there were so many of them she had to hold them out to the side before she could manage the kiss and when she would have kept that part of the ritual light he simply slid his arms around her drew her closer sucked her down into that soft slippery world there are a lot of flowers he rubbed his lips over hers stirring them both say thanks again th he took the kiss deeper until her skin was humming and shed risen to her toes that ought to cover it he ran his hands up and down her sides i guess she had to clear her throat theyre really pretty she felt silly holding them sillier still because she wanted to bury her face in them and sniff like a puppy but you didnt have to bring me flowers i dont really go in for the whole valentines gig yeah crass commercialism and blah blah so what he made her laugh and she stopped feeling silly theres a hell of a lot of them the florist must have fallen weeping to his knees when you walked out let me see if weve got something around here to hold them she had to settle for a plastic scrub bucket but did indulge herself with some sniffing and sighing as she filled it with water from the bathroom tap ill do better by them when i take them home she promised as she carried them back out i didnt know tulips came in so many colors i guess i havent paid attention my mom goes for tulips she what do you call it forces the bulbs in little glass jars every winter ripley set the makeshift vase on the desk i bet you sent your mother flowers today sure did she looked at him shook her head youre a hell of a sweetheart dr booke think so he dug in his pocket frowned dug in the other and came up with a little candy heart then dropped it into ripleys palm be mine she read and felt that little jitter in the belly again so how about it he reached around to tug on her ponytail are you going to be my valentine boy youre really into this looks like youve got me now im going to have to go buy you a mushy card its the least you can do he continued to play with the sleek tail of hair listen about tonight i didnt realize it was valentines day when i made the arrangements with mia if you want i can reschedule that and we can go out to dinner take a drive whatever youd like oh it was friday she remembered shed done her best to block that particular fact out of her head now he was giving her the perfect way to put it all off to put off something that was important to his work yep she thought with an inward sigh the man was a sweetheart no dont worry about it its already set up you could come with me when she started to turn away he kept her in place with his hand on her hair turning a tender gesture into a nononsense one with a simple flexing of fingers i dont know what im going to do dont count on me whatever you say he hated to see her struggle but knew of no way to smooth it all away there are some things i want to talk to you about if you decide to give the session at mias a pass can you come by the cottage afterward what things well talk about it he gave her hair a last tug before walking to the door ripley he paused his hand on the knob and looked at her a gun at her hip a pail of tulips at her side i know were standing on opposite sides of a line in one area as long as we understand why and accept that accept each other were okay youre so damn stable hey my parents spent a lot of money to make sure of it shrinks she said and worked up a sneer for him damn right see you later yeah she murmured when the door closed behind him problem was she wasnt quite so stable not quite so okay because she was crazy about him it was difficult for a woman to maintain her dignity and reputation as somewhat of a hardass when she was walking around with a bucket full of tulips it was damn near impossible when that same woman got caught perusing a dwindling display of sentimental valentines day cards i like this one gladys macey reached around her and tapped a huge card with an enormous pink heart ripley did her best not to squirm yeah i picked it out for carl a week ago and he liked it fine when i gave it to him this morning men like big cards must make them feel more manly having no doubt that gladys knew more about such matters than she did ripley plucked the card out of the slot last one she commented lucky me lucky you indeed gladys bent down to admire the tulips must be four dozen tulips in there five ripley corrected okay shed counted she couldnt help it five dozen mmm and they cost the earth this time of year pretty as a picture though you get candy too ripley thought of the little heart that shed tucked in her pocket sort of candy too gladys nodded wisely the mans smitten ripley nearly bobbled the bucket what did you say i said the mans smitten smitten something tickled ripleys throat but she wasnt sure if it was panic or humor that words getting around these days why do you think that well for heavens sake ripley a man doesnt buy a woman flowers give her candy and so forth on valentines day because he wants a canasta partner what makes young people so thickheaded about these things i just figured he was one of those people who make hallmark stand up and cheer men dont make grand gestures unless theyre reminded to in trouble guilty or smitten gladys ticked these possibilities off on her fingers with nails newly polished in valentine red not in my experience did you remind him what day it was no i forgot about it myself you have a spat no ripley conceded anything you can think of for him to be guilty about no theres nothing in particular for him to feel guilty about well then where does that leave him according to your lineup smitten shed have to think about it she studied the card in her hand so they like the big ones absolutely you put those flowers in something pretty now theyre too sweet to stay in that old bucket she gave ripley a pat on the shoulder then wandered off as soon as she could manage it gladys would be spreading the word that the village deputy was sweet on the mainlander and vice versa the mainlander was back at work hed studied organized and logged the varied data that had come through on the night he and ripley had been together he was formulating theories hypotheses and working toward logical conclusions he hadnt noted the time when he and ripley had made love his mind had been on more important matters nor had he clocked the duration but his printouts assuming that his theories on energy dispersal were correct pinned it down for him the machines had picked up burst after burst spikes long steady rises fluctuations wasnt it interesting that he hadnt heard the clatter of them as they recorded hed been so completely absorbed in her now he could look at the tangible record of what theyd brought to each other it was oddly arousing he measured distances between the spikes and rises calculated the valleys between energy peaks and the output of each then he had to get up and walk around until he could stop imagining her naked and concentrate on science long steady holding pattern here lowgrade energy levels he crunched on an apple pushed up his glasses afterglow period were just lying there now languor pillow talk makes sense so why does it start building again here it was almost like steps he noted a rise a plateau a rise a plateau he tried to think shed gotten up gone for the pizza into the kitchen for a couple of beers maybe shed been thinking about making love again he didnt mind thinking she was it was a nice boost to the ego but it didnt explain the abrupt and violent energy flash nothing steplike there it had been like a rocket going off nothing he could find indicated that it came from an outside source or an underlying well of energy to his best recollection hed been in a kind of twilight sleep just sort of floating while he waited for her hed been thinking about the pizza about eating it in bed with her naked it had been a pleasant image but he hadnt been the cause of this therefore ripley had but how and why were the puzzles an aftershock sort of thing that was possible but aftershocks were rarely as powerful as the initial quake and this one punched right through the ceiling if he could recreate the event that was a thought of course he would need to find a delicate way to propose that to her they had a lot to talk about he bit into the apple again and felt happy just remembering the stunned look on her face when hed walked in with all those flowers he liked surprising her that way then watching her deal with it he just liked watching her he wondered how much work it was going to be for him to talk her into taking a trip with him maybe in the spring before he had to buckle down and turn his data and theories and conclusions into a book they could make a quick stop in new york he wanted her to meet his family then they could take a few days somewhere anywhere she wanted he wasnt particular some time alone with her away from work it might help him evaluate another hypothesis he was working on that he was falling in love with her ripley decided to keep her distance from whatever was going to happen at mias that evening since zack had chosen to go along she would have the house to herself for a change she could take advantage of that by turning the tv up too loud eating junk food and watching a really bad action movie on cable shed been spending nearly all her free time with mac and maybe that was part of the problem a little alone time in her own space was just what she needed she would work off some energy lifting weights take a long hot shower then settle in with popcorn loaded with salt and butter and watch tv with her pals lucy and diego she turned the music up to earsplitting in the spare room she used for workouts then with the dog and cat trailing her walked into the bedroom to change into her gear and there were the tulips the charming explosion of them taking over her dresser the air was sweet with them valentines days just a racket she said out loud then gave up but it really works she picked up the card shed bought for mac it wouldnt take her very long to run over to the cottage slip it under his door in fact it would probably be better if she didnt have to give him something so well mushy facetoface and she could add a little note saying that she would see him tomorrow the more shed thought about it the less she wanted to talk about whatever it was he wanted to talk about when he was still pumped from his witch session she didnt care if it was unfair or unrealistic or even stupid for now for a while longer she wanted to keep whatever it was they felt for each other separate from his work and her gift shed never been in love before what was wrong with holding on to that for a while and putting off the rest okay back in ten she told lucy and diego no smoking drinking or making long distance calls while im gone she grabbed the card and headed toward the door leading out to the deck and stepped out onto the beach into a rising storm the wind slashed the icy tip of a whip the air was blue with lightning she was spinning spinning through it flying on a current of power that pulsed in a thousand heartbeats over her skin the circle was a white flame on the sand she was in it and above it outside it three figures ringed inside it she saw herself who was not herself link hands with her sisters and the chants that rose up hummed inside her she saw herself yet not herself standing alone beyond that bright circle arms lifted hands empty and the grief shot up out of that lonely heart into her own she saw herself as she was as she could be alive in that storm beyond the circle where her sisters waited rage and power twisted inside her one man cowered at her feet and another ran toward her in the violent dark but she could not be reached would not be reached in her hand was the bright silver sword of justice with a cry she brought it down and destroyed them all she awoke sprawled on the deck shuddering helplessly in the balmy night her skin was damp and there was the electric smell of ozone stinging the air her stomach spasmed as she pushed herself to her hands and knees too weak to stand she stayed there rocking gently taking gulping breaths to feed her starved lungs the roaring in her head subsided and became the endless rolling of the sea it had never come on her like that never so abruptly so physically not even when she was practicing when she had willingly sought such things she wanted to crawl back into her room to curl up on the rug in the dark and whimper like a baby it was the small pitiful sounds coming from her own throat that made her force herself up until she was kneeling until she was breathing deep and steady again with the vision still pounding at her she scrambled to her feet and ran thirteen are you sure you want to do this nell linked her hand with zacks deliberately slowing the pace thin clouds sailed overhead filtering the starlight the fat curve of moon was a soft and waiting white she knew her way in the dark through mias gardens past her jutting cliffs and into the winter forest with her hand warm in zacks she let mia and mac pull ahead she could hear mias voice like a light trail of music slip back through the trees and shadows would you rather i stayed behind no its just that youve never come with me before you never asked me before her fingers curled in his she stopped she could see him clearly enough she could always see him clearly it wasnt that you werent welcome in the starlight she saw his brows arch and she smiled exactly in a slow easy movement he lifted their joined hands to his lips does my being here make you uncomfortable not uncomfortable a little nervous maybe because she was she touched him just a skim of her fingers over his arm im not sure how you might react how youll feel about this part of me nell he put his hands on her shoulders gave them a little rub im not darren who you know darren bewitched you twitch your nose and i get all grumpy about it it took her a minute then she wrapped her arms around his waist nerves doubts worries were completely swamped by joy i really love you i know there is one thing i was going to be openminded and not bring it up but he glanced over to where mac had disappeared into the dark with mia ive read up on rituals and magic and that sort of thing and i know that sometimes they involve getting naked i dont care how stupid it sounds but i want you to keep your clothes on when macs around she tried to hide her amusement hes a scientist like a doctor i dont give a rats ass in this particular area im darren well darren its not warm enough to go skyclad and to be perfectly frank i keep my clothes on even when its just me and mia apparently im a very prudish witch suits me they began to walk again with him letting her lead the way so does mia get naked skyclad nell corrected and i dont see why youd be interested purely from an academic standpoint yeah right they were still teasing each other as they stepped into the clearing shadows gray as smoke ringed the edges hanks of dried herbs and chains of crystals hung from the bare branches of the trees a trio of stones rose up in a kind of altar mac crouched in front of it busily taking readings mia had denied him his video camera and tape recorder no amount of persuasion had moved her on that point but she had permitted his sensors and his notebook and his mind mia had already set down the bag she carried and now walked over to zack to take the one hed brought for nell lets give our scientist a moment to play shall we she gestured toward mac hes so happy then she slipped an arm around nells shoulders theres no need to be nervous little sister it just feels a little odd and im still new to all this your man stands with you you come here already more powerful than you were the first time and more aware of self she shifted her gaze to zack studied his face cant you feel his pride in you in all that you are there are some who never have that vital magic without it the lights never quite bright enough as much to bolster herself as nell she gave nells shoulders a little squeeze before going to join mac shes so lonely nell confided to zack she doesnt think it and shes so confident so complete no one sees it but there are times shes so lonely it makes me ache youre a good friend nell mia laughed at something mac said then spun away from him it wasnt quite a dance mac would think later but still somehow balletic her long gray dress billowed then settled as she lifted her arms and her voice rich and full was the music this is our place the place of the three it was conjured from need and knowledge from hope and despair from power turned away from death and fear and ignorance this is our place she repeated passed down to us the three to the three for tonight we are two mac got slowly to his feet she was changing in front of him her hair was more vivid her skin sheening like marble her already staggering beauty increased as if some thin veil had been lifted he wondered if she used her magic to enhance what she had now or if she used her gift to dim it at other times and he cursed the lack of recording equipment we come here to give thanks to honor those who came before to offer and remember this ground is sacred you are welcome here macallister booke when youre invited i wont insult you by asking for your promise not to come here otherwise you have it anyway she inclined her head a regal acknowledgment zack you are nells and this place is hers as much as mine so its yours you can ask questions if you like she added as she bent to open her bag i imagine dr booke has most of the answers because the request was implied mac crossed over and stood with the other man the candles theyre getting out are ritual candles i imagine theyve already been consecrated and inscribed theyre using silver representing the goddess female power the symbols on them he edged a little closer squinted ah yeah the four elements earth air fire water mia wouldnt tell me what ritual theyd do tonight but from the setup its probably a call to the four elements an offering of respect he continued maybe a request for dream interpretation or clairvoyance those are represented by the silver candles too its an attractive ritual youve seen it before zack watched his wife remove a knife with a curved handle a goblet a wooden wand with a crystal tip from her bag yeah if the ritual generates enough power you may feel a little tingle in the air even without that my sensors will pick up the energy increase theyll cast a circle and light the candles with wooden matches matches zack felt his face split into a grin brother keep watching amused now and fascinated by his wife zack slipped his hands into his pockets rocked back on his heels mac scribbled in his notebook as they cast the circle it was a fairly standard casting little variation on the other chants and movements hed observed too bad its cloudy he commented as he checked the new reading on his sensor we could use more light even as he spoke a thin line of silver shimmered over the ground a perfect circle of light jeez with equal parts shock and fascination he took a step forward notebook forgotten from the center of the circle mia and nell set the candles alight with no more than a sweep of arm i thought youd seen this deal before zack said not like this never like this catching himself ogling he pulled himself back and got to work we are two mia said and we bring two more one for love and one for knowledge one to be cherished the other to be sought she picked up her wand such things are tools she said conversationally now tools are to be respected she opened a small jar and took out a handful of petals iris for wisdom from another nell took a sprig of rosemary and this for love she took up her ritual knife and used the tip to draw symbols on the earth and here we twine them here we bind them love and knowledge blessed with hope within the circle and without sought and cherished they conquer fear and vanquish doubt hearts and minds open and free mia continued sprinkling herbs and flowers into a wide bowl only then can we meet our destinies because these things we both hold dear we allow two to witness what we do here in this place and on this night we open our ritual to their sight this i do willingly as do i nell responded all right then any questions professor ive never seen that particular ritual just a little precaution we wouldnt want you to be taken as peeping toms consider it a kind of warmup act for the main performance still youre not to attempt to enter the circle or even approach it once we begin understood oh yeah then one more mac lifted a finger ask mia said with a nod what is this place mia held out a hand palm up fingers gently cupped as if she held something precious the air mac would have sworn it pulsed it is she said quietly the heart then she lowered her hand mia nodded at nell blessed be little sister nell drew in breath held it as she lifted her arms i call to air both restless and sweet on her breast my wings will beat rise and turn and blow your breath warm come stir the wind but do no harm i am air she called out as the hanging crystals began to sing and she is me as i will so mote it be the wind swirled dancing in the once still night mac could smell the sea in it feel it whisper then rush over his face and hair amazing was the best he could do and watched mia mirror nells gesture before she picked up the chant i call to fire her heat and light in her heart life burns strong and bright flame like the sun bring harm to none i am fire and she is me as i will so mote it be the silver candles sprang like torches and the shimmering circle rose like a flaming wall macs sensors rang like alarms for the first time in his long career he gave them not a thought the pencil he held slipped unnoticed out of his fingers he could feel the heat see through it the women behind that sheer fiery curtain glowed just as brightly and the wind sang like a woman in love within the circle nell and mia turned to each other clasped hands ripley rocketed out of the woods mac caught only a glimpse her pale pale face dark eyes then she was diving into the fire no with images of her burning he leaped forward stay back mia snapped out the order even as she knelt beside ripley damn it shes hurt mac lifted one unsteady hand pressed against an invisible barrier it sparked hissed but wouldnt give way nothing hed seen or done had prepared him to stand helpless behind magic unable to reach the woman he loved break the circle he demanded let me through this isnt for you she is he curled his fists against the shield ignoring the heat that radiated from it nell zack strained at the edge of the fire he felt the scorch of its power and for the first time a ripple of fear its all right shes safe here i promise watching her husband she cradled his sisters head please you know better mias voice was steady even as she brushed back ripleys hair even as she watched ripleys eyes clear her heart thudded i wasnt prepared for you nor you for this dont scold her shes shaking what is it ripley nell asked what happened shaking her head ripley struggled to her knees i cant control it i couldnt stop it i dont know what to do tell me mia insisted as she gave a worried glance toward the men her will and her wall wouldnt hold them out much longer no defense lasted against love and be quick a vision hit me like a fist what was what might be its bad its me she moaned and sank into a ball it hurts you know what needs to be done no you know mia repeated and ruthlessly dragged her up again you came youre here and you know what you have to do for this for now the rest comes when it comes her stomach pitched cramped i dont want this and still you came to save us well save yourself first do it now her breath was coming in ragged gasps and the look she shot mia was anything but friendly but she held out a hand well damn it help me up i wont do it on my knees nell took one hand mia the other and when ripley stood on her feet they let her go i dont remember the words yes you do stop stalling ripley hissed out a breath her throat was so tight it stung and her stomach was alive with cramps i call to earth generous and deep in her we sow that we may reap she felt the power rising swayed with it mia finish give us your charm and bring no harm i am earth and she is me as i will so mote it be power gushed into her flooded out the pain the ground at her feet sprang with flowers and the last mia gripped her hand firmly took nells they were linked a circle within a circle we are the three we call to water stream and sea within her great heart nell continued life came to be with your soft rain bring no harm no pain ripley lifted her face and joined her sisters in the last of the chant we are water and she is we as we will so mote it be rain fell soft as silk and bright as silver we are the three mia said again quietly so that only nell and ripley could hear because he had no choice mac waited until the ritual was complete and the circle closed the minute he could reach her he grabbed ripleys arms a shock of electricity jolted through his hands but he held on are you okay yes i need to dont pull away from me his voice carried an undertone of steel i wouldnt pull if you didnt grab i beg your pardon he said and released her look damn it she poked at his arm as he turned away im a little churned up right now i could use a few minutes to settle down take all the time you need ive got plenty to do he walked back to pick up his notebook check his equipment that was unkind of you mia scolded dont hassle me now suit yourself were going back to the house youre welcome of course or you can go to the devil which often suits you as well she shot her nose in the air and walked off to join mac hey zack stepped to her ran a hand through her hair then framed her face scared me scared me too keeping that in mind you might want to cut the guy some slack ive seen a little of what the three of you can pull off together before he hasnt rip he pulled her close a moment you go running through fire it shakes a man up some yeah okay nothing she thought ever felt quite as solid and steady as her brother ill talk to him why dont you take nell and mia back to the house well be along in a minute you got it she gathered herself picked up one of macs scattered pencils and took it to him im sorry i snapped at you no problem look dont go sulky on me you dont know what its like to no i dont he shot back and you dont know what its like to just stand there fucking stand there when i dont know if youre hurt okay im sorry i couldnt to her horror her voice broke and her vision wavered with tears damn it i told you i was churned up okay whoa he drew her into his arms stroked her hair why dont you just hold on here a minute crying pisses me off i bet just hold on she gave in gave up and wrapped her arms around him ill get it together in a minute thats okay because i want to hold on too i thought you were he saw it again that flash of her face that was white as bone as she leaped into a wall of golden flame i dont know what i thought im prepared for a lot of this kind of thing ive seen magic i believe in it but nothing ive seen or imagined comes close to what the three of you did tonight i didnt want to be here then why were you what scared you enough to bring you here she shook her head i only want to tell it once lets go back to mias he hitched his equipment bag onto his shoulder you were in pain i saw that the circle wasnt prepared for me and i wasnt prepared for it no before that before you did your deathdefying leap you see a hell of a lot dont you for a guy whos always losing his glasses theyre just for reading and close work he wanted to stroke to tend to cuddle and was afraid if he did theyd both fall apart is there any pain now no she sighed no i took the power called my element made the circle of three theres no pain now but youre not happy about it like nell she knew her way through the forest through the dark already she could see the glimmer of light from mias windows it brings nell joy and gives mia a kind of i dont know foundation for nell its an exploration for mia its like breathing and for you for me its a goddamn stampede so you chose to fence it in and i didnt use strong enough nails she finished with just a hint of bitterness and shook her head to ward off any more questions mac supposed the food and wine were another kind of ritual one used as a bridge between the fantastic and the ordinary though he doubted he would forget even the smallest detail about the night he scribbled in his notebook as mia played hostess is it all right to ask questions she smiled at him of course she replied as she curled cozily in a chair but they may or may not be answered what you did tonight your preparations your ceremonial tools and ritualistic well trappings were very simple very basic for such extraordinary results too many trappings and too much ceremony is usually a cloak to disguise a lack of power or used to feed the ego perhaps to impress an audience do you need them at all what an interesting question mac what do you think i think not and even he before tonight wouldnt have believed it i think the gift in each one of you is beyond them i think you could light the fire in your hearth without moving from that chair without casting a circle without ritual she sat back regarding him what was it about him she wondered that tugged at her that made her want to share with him what shed shared with no outsider theres a reason for traditions even for superstition for ceremony it helps focus power and pays respect to the source but of course behind her the fire leaped to life in the hearth youre quite right showoff ripley muttered she laughed and the fire damped down to a soft and pleasant glow youre right too she sipped her wine and her eyes met ripleys over the rim of her glass you used to have more of a sense of humor about it and you used to lecture that i should take more responsibility i suppose i did how tedious of me oh dont start pinching at each other nell ordered you wear me out we could have used her as a mediator years ago mia sipped her wine again we are the three it cant be changed avoided or ignored you know the legend she said to mac very well the one called air left the sanctuary of the island she married a man who couldnt accept her wouldnt cherish her and in the end destroyed her she destroyed herself nell said disagreeing by not believing in who she was by lacking the courage to maybe mac nodded the one called earth refused to accept what had happened it ate through her until she used her power to avenge her sister she wanted justice ripley rose to prowl she needed it her need caused her to break trust mias hand lifted an inch off the chair then lowered again it wasnt time to reach out to turn from everything she was and had been given and use power to harm she couldnt control it ripley said in a shaky voice she couldnt stop it she didnt control or stop it and doomed herself and what she loved and the third ripley spun back she who was fire found a silkie in human form sleeping in a cave near a cove and taking his pelt she hid it and bound him to her its not against the laws of magic to do so in a casual move that cost her a great deal mia leaned over and selected a cube of cheese from a tray she took him as lover as husband raised her children with him then the children of her lost sisters the food tasted like chalk in her throat but she nibbled casually she gave him her heart but the day came when she was less than vigilant and he found his pelt and though he had loved her when a silkie has his pelt the sea beckons he forgot her their life their love their children as though they had never existed and left her for the sea mia lifted a shoulder without sister without lover without husband she pined and pining despaired she cursed her magic for bringing her love then stealing it away and abjuring it leaped from the cliffs to the sea where her lover had gone death isnt the answer nell added i know it was at that moment hers mia stated so three hundred years later the descendants of the sisters of the three must make restitution must turn back each key one by three or the island they made will tumble forever into the sea if you believe that why do you live here ripley demanded why are you in this house why the bookstore why anything this is my place and my time the same as its yours and nells if you dont believe it why are you here tonight mia could feel her temper begin to snap and yanked it back she also saw the misery on ripleys face it was hard after so many years to reach out but she got to her feet held out a hand tell me let me help i saw it was painful like being ripped open head to gut and so fast there was no time to react you know it doesnt have to be that way you know it doesnt ask for pain nor want harm threefold a single tear spilled over before she could stop it what you send comes back times three she destroyed them not alone each of them had responsibility tell me she wiped the tear from ripleys cheek herself what did you see i saw she replayed the vision her voice calming as she spoke i dont know who he was or what he represented but hell come none of you could stop me no more than i could stop myself it was my sword mia my ritual sword i killed him with it and killed us all you wont you wont she repeated before ripley could protest youre stronger than that i wanted to hurt him i could feel the rage ive never had control over power when my emotions take over why the hell do you think i stopped because you were afraid the temper came bubbling back a decade of fury you turned away from me from what you are because you were afraid of what you might do youre just stupid she whirled away then yelped when ripley grabbed her by the hair and yanked who the hell are you calling stupid you skinny snotty selfserving bitch her eyes narrowed when mia lifted a bunched fist then she let out a laugh yeah like that scares me hit me with your thumb tucked in that way youre going to hurt yourself more than me youre such a damn girl mia thats an interesting observation since youre the one doing the hair pulling with a shrug ripley let go okay were even she blew out a breath blinking when she realized that all the other people in the room had gotten to their feet shed forgotten they were there sorry after smoothing her hair mia slid into her chair again pissed you off when i called you stupid didnt i damn right so watch it but you didnt use power to strike at me when my back was turned mia lifted her glass again you didnt even consider it tricky witch ripley thought with reluctant admiration shed always been tricky i wasnt that mad yes you were zack commented and settled down again you really hate being called a coward or stupid she did both and all you did was pull her hair its not the same thing close enough zack took his wifes hand studied his sister there are two things youre not rip youre not a coward and youre not stupid everyone in this room can handle themselves i dont know as much about all this as the rest of you but i know you and its time you stopped thinking everything hinges on you nobodys alone here i couldnt stand to hurt you to be responsible for it i couldnt live with it mom and dad nell answer me this she demanded turning back to mia and no bullshit what if i leave the island if i pack up get on the ferry and just dont come back could it break the chain you already know the answer but why dont we ask mac to give it this is his field as an academic an observer and someone who has done considerable research into such matters your objective opinion dr booke the island itself has power in sort of a holding pattern until its stirred up or applied then if i leave it i take away my what conduit to it can i do that on some level yes but that would only decrease potentially decrease your personal focus of energy it wouldnt change a thing im sorry where you go isnt the point what you do is he could see she wasnt satisfied so he spread his hands and tried to explain his theory okay if for the purposes of this discussion we take legend as fact youll have a choice to make something to do or not to do youre here he used a napkin as the island placed three olives on it then he plucked one olive up and set it on a tray you leave all you do is change the location of the choice the act the restraint wherever you go the four elements exist you cant defy basic natural law what you are doesnt change and what you do carries back by earth air fire water he jabbed a fingertip onto the napkin right back to the source inevitably staying is your only logical choice youre stronger here and the three of you together make the difference hes right nell spoke and brought ripleys attention around weve already changed the pattern once were three when before there were only two left without you and mia without you she said to zack there would only be two now their circle was broken by this point ours isnt but it is rusty mia said and chose another cube of cheese youll need to get back in shape deputy ripley snagged an olive popped it into her mouth the hell i will fourteen how about for tonight you turn those things off ripley stood on the threshold of the yellow cottage she wasnt willing to go in and have a bunch of damn machines start scanning her not after the evening shed had sure mac slipped by her set down his equipment bag then began shutting down he hadnt expected her to come back with him though she didnt look it he imagined she was tired or at the least had had enough of people in general perhaps him in particular shed bounced back that was certain back to trading sharp little barbs with mia to behaving as if what had happened in the clearing had been nothing major it was an unbelievable shield that she hefted he thought nearly as impressive as the one that had kept him out of the circle in the clearing he wondered just how vulnerable she felt when her grip on that shield slipped you want to sit he asked when she stepped inside and shut the door or just go to bed well thats cutting to the chase his color rose i didnt mean sex i thought you might want some sleep she saw now that was exactly what hed meant yeah he was a damn sweetie all right she decided and prowled what she could of the room its a little early to bunk down i thought you had stuff you wanted to talk to me about i do i didnt figure youd be up for it tonight im not tired it doesnt work that way how here let me take your jacket she stepped back before he could and shrugged out of it herself if i know youre thinking the question you might as well ask it how does it work i feel like ive got a tanker load of caffeine in my system energized she continued crossing to him to give him a quick firm shove edgy and another so yeah i want to go to bed the last shove pushed him through the bedroom doorway and nobodys going to sleep okay then why dont we just she shoved him again then slapped on the lights i dont want conversation and i dont want the dark right for some reason he felt as if hed just opened the door to a very hungry shewolf her eyes were different greener sharper predatory his blood began to pump quickly helplessly ill just close these curtains leave them ripley his laugh was a little strangled were pretty isolated but nonetheless with the lights on leave them she yanked her sweater off in one quick move if you like that shirt youd better strip it off and now otherwise its toast you know he let out a breath tried to work up an easy smile youre scaring me good be afraid she leaped at him knocking him back on the bed hunching over him like a sleek cat she made some primitive sound in her throat as she bared her teeth then set them on his neck christ he went hard as rock i want it fast she panted tearing open his shirt and rough and now he reached for her but she fisted her hands in his hair yanked then ravished his mouth the sheer heat of her seared through him scorching the nerves stealing the breath boiling the blood he spiraled down into the dark where pain and pleasure were twins equally vital equally irresistible in response the animal inside him lunged straining at the end of its tether snapping it his body reared up beneath hers and his hands were hard and bruising as they tore and took he yanked her hair dragging her head back to expose her throat for his teeth it wasnt desperation that filled him but appetite they rolled over the bed fighting for more flesh more heat she was alive with need and all of it feral energy pumped through her and all of it savage her nails raked at him her teeth nipped and when his fingers drove into her her cry was one of fierce and greedy triumph higher was all she could think faster she wanted peak after violent peak lights danced in her mind a blinding silver shower and the storm that fueled them fueled her she slithered over him like a snake straddled him and filled herself it was like being consumed devoured whole she closed over him like a fist trapping him in hot wet heat holding him there by the power of her own climax staggered he watched it rip through her watched her body pearled with sweat bow back and shudder shudder and she began to move lightning fast her hair fell forward a tangle of dense brown as she leaned down chewed restlessly on his bottom lip he pistoned himself into her hard fast strokes while his hands gripped her hips like a vise then she leaned back rode him ruthlessly to the barbed edge of peak not yet not yet she panted even as his vision blurred as his system strained toward that blessed release she lifted her arms above her head as she had done when shed called her power he felt the shock of it like a redtipped arrow through the haze of mad pleasure clean sharp and stunning as it pierced through her and into him he lay like a dead man but it didnt seem to matter dying for such an experience didnt seem too high a price to pay right at the moment he felt as though hed been hulled out every care every worry every spare thought carved away to be replaced by pure sensation he might not be able to walk or speak or think again but those were minor inconveniences he was going to pass out of this world a very happy man ripley made a little purring sound aha he thought vaguely he could still hear that was a nice bonus then her mouth closed over his his body could still register sensation better and better mac he opened his mouth some sound came out it wasnt words but there were a great many forms of verbal communication hed make do mac she said again and slid her hand down his body closed her fingers over him oh yeah he was definitely able to feel sensation uhhuh he cleared his throat managed to open one eye he wasnt blind after all another plus yeah i wasnt asleep his voice was rusty but there and he realized his throat was desperate with thirst i was having a neardeath experience it wasnt bad now that youre back from beyond she slithered up his body again and rendered him speechless when he saw she still had that gleam in her eye again hey well he had some trouble breathing when her lips trailed down his chest youre going to have to give me a little time to recover you know maybe a month she laughed and the wicked sound of it rippled over his skin in that case youre just going to have to lie there and take it her mouth kept going he melted into the bed well if i have to i have to ripley knew she was in trouble shed never shared power with a man before never felt the need or desire to do so with mac it had been a kind of compulsion a deep drowning need to extend that intimacy link that part of her with him there was no longer any doubt that she was in love with him or any hope that she could rationalize it away traditionally todds waited a long time to fall in love and when they did it came hard and fast and it was forever it looked as if she was upholding the family name but she didnt have a clue what to do about it right at the moment she couldnt seem to care as for mac he felt slightly drunk and saw no reason to fight the sensation the wind had started to rise the sound of it shivering against the windows only made the cottage cozier it was as if they were the only two people on the island as far as he was concerned it could stay that way what was that stuff you wanted to tell me hmm he continued to play with her hair and thought he could happily stay under those tangled sheets with her for the rest of his life it can wait why im here youre here im thirsty she sat up scooped her hair back didnt you say something about wine probably you sure youre up for wine and conversation she angled her head its that or youll have to get up for something else as lowering as it was to admit it he was certain if she jumped him again he would never live through it ill get the wine she laughed as he rolled out of bed here he pulled open a drawer tossed her some sweats might as well be comfortable thanks got any food depends on your definition just some munchies ive got a craving tell me about it ive got potato chips thatll do she tugged on the sweatpants adjusting the drawstring until she was reasonably sure theyd stay up ill dig them out when he was gone she pulled on the sweatshirt and indulged herself by sniffing at the sleeves exploring the sensation of wearing something that was his it was foolish and female she admitted but nobody had to know about it but her when she walked into the kitchen he already had the wine open two glasses out and a bag of chips on the counter she snagged the chips plopped down in a chair and prepared to gorge lets not ah do this in here mac began nerves pricked at his bubble of contentment he had no idea how she would react to what he had to tell her that was just one of her fascinations for him her unpredictability why and there was another he thought she asked why nearly as often as he did himself because well be more comfortable in the other room the living room well sit on your equipment haha no theres the couch its still in there and we can get a fire going are your feet cold want some socks no im fine but he wasnt she noted something was making him jumpy she pondered it as she followed him back into the living room since they had to squeeze their way through to get to the sofa she doubted hed used it for its intended purpose since hed taken over the cottage he put the wine on the floor then began to move stacks of books off the cushions and set them aside she opened her mouth to protest the trouble then shut it again with an almost audible snap wine conversation a cozy fire romantic just the sort of romantic setup she imagined a man might want when he told a woman he loved her her heart began to beat thickly is this an important conversation she asked him through lips that felt trembly and soft i think so he hunkered down in front of the hearth im a little nervous about it i didnt expect to be im not sure how to start youll figure it out her legs wobbled a little so she sat down he set logs kindling then glanced back at her it took her a minute to clue in to his speculative look what she thought of as his scientist look yes i could start it from here she told him but i wont just wondering ah lore holds that making fire is the basic form of magic usually the first learned and the last lost would that be accurate i guess if youre talking about a tangible form one that requires direction focus control because she felt hot and itchy she shifted mias better than i am at explaining that sort of thing i dont havent been thinking about it for a long time she never stops thats probably why the control and philosophy come more naturally to her he struck a long wooden match set it against the starter your powers more i dont know explosive while hers is more centered he got to his feet as the flames began to lick rubbed his hands on the hips of his jeans im trying to think how to approach what i want to tell you a flock of sparrows divebombed in her stomach you could just say it i work better with a buildup he bent down to pour the wine i had it pretty well set in my head before tonight but first seeing you understanding to some extent what you went through what you feel then being with you ripley he sat beside her handed her the wine then touched the back of her hand i want you to know that its never been like it is with you not with anyone else there were tears in her throat and for the first time in her life she found the taste of them lovely its different for me he nodded felt a little hitch in his heart as he took that to mean she experienced intimacy differently because of what she was all right well what im trying to say here is that because of whats he dragged a hand through his hair because you matter because whats between us matters to me the rest of it is a little more complicated i guess im concerned that especially after i get into the rest you might think you matter to me only because of my work thats not true ripley you just matter everything smoothed out inside her like silk brushed with a loving hand i dont think that i wouldnt still be here if i did i wouldnt want to be here and i do he took her hand and kissing her palm sent a long slow ripple sliding from her toes to her throat mac she whispered originally i was going to tell mia first but i want to tell you i you mia theoretically shes the main connection but its all linked anyway plus i realized i needed to tell you first he kissed her hand again somewhat absently this time then sipped his wine like a man wetting his throat before preparing to lecture her lovely mood went ragged at the edges i really think youd better spit it out mac okay each one of the sisters had children some stayed on the island others left never to return and others traveled married then came back to the island to raise their families i imagine you know all that and that their children did the same and so on down the generations as a result some of their descendants have always remained on three sisters but others scattered over the world i dont know what youre getting at id probably be better off showing you hold on a minute she watched him get up then wind his way through the equipment hearing him curse lightly when he stubbed his toe gave her small but vicious satisfaction the son of a bitch she thought rapping her fisted hand on the cushion he wasnt about to pledge his undying love to pour out his heart to beg her to marry him hed circled right back around to his stupid research while shed been sitting there starryeyed and whose fault is that she reminded herself she was the one whod gotten it all twisted up she was the one whod left herself open for the clip on the jaw she was the stupid one the one whod gone all mushy with love and stopped thinking clearly she would just have to fix that not the love she was a todd and accepted that she loved him and always would but she certainly could get her head on straight again and start thinking he was the one meant for her so he was going to have to deal with it dr macallister booke wasnt just going to study witches he was damn well going to marry one as soon as she figured out how to make him sorry he skirted the equipment more carefully this time it wasnt where i thought i put it nothing ever is his expression changed with the glittering look she sent him ah something wrong no not a thing playfully she patted the cushion beside her i was just thinking its a waste to sit alone in front of the fire when he sat she slid her leg intimately over his much better well his blood pressure began a steady rise as she leaned in and rubbed her lips over his jaw i thought youd want to read this mmm why dont you read it to me she nibbled lightly on his earlobe you have such a sexy voice she took the glasses out of his pocket and you know how turned on i get when you wear these he made some sound then fumbled the glasses on these are ah photocopied pages i have the original journal in a vault because its old and fragile it was written by my great well a number of greats grandmother on my mothers side the first entry was made september and written on three sisters island ripley jerked back what did you say i think you should just listen today he read my youngest child had a child they have named him sebastian and he is hale and healthy i am grateful hester and her fine young man are content to remain on the island to make their home and family here my other children are so far away now and though from time to time i look into the glass to see them my heart aches that i am unable to touch their faces or the faces of my grandchildren i will never leave the island again this also i have seen in the glass i have time yet on this earth and i know death is not an end but when i see this beauty of life in this babe of my babe i am saddened that i will not be here to see him grown he risked a quick glance at ripley saw she was staring at him as if shed never seen him before best to finish it all he told himself just get it all out at one time i am saddened that my own mother did not choose life he continued that she denied herself the joy i have felt this day on seeing a child come from one of my own time moves swiftly what comes from this boy will one day balance the scales if our children remember and choose wisely though shed forgotten she held it ripleys knuckles were white on the stem of her glass where did you get this last summer i was going through some boxes in the attic of my parents house i found the journal id been through those boxes before i used to drive my mother crazy because i was always pawing through the old stuff i dont know how i missed it unless you subscribe to the theory that it wasnt there for me until last june june when a shudder worked through her ripley got to her feet nell had come to the island in june and the three had linked she sensed that mac started to speak and she held up a hand she needed to focus youre assuming this was written by an ancestor not assuming ive done the genealogy ripley her name was constance and her youngest daughter hester married james macallister on may their first child a son sebastian edward macallister was born on three sisters island he fought in the revolutionary war married had children settled in new york the line runs down through my mother and into me youre telling me youre a descendant of i have all the documentation marriage records birth records you could say were really distant cousins she stared at him then turned to stare into the fire why didnt you tell us when you first came here okay thats a little sticky he wished she would sit back down cuddle up against him again but he didnt think that was going to happen until they got through this i thought i might have to use it as an incentive a kind of bargaining chip your ace in the hole she remarked yeah if mia put up roadblocks i figured this information would be a good way to knock some of them down but she didnt and i started to feel uncomfortable about withholding it i was going to tell her tonight but i needed to tell you first why because you matter i realize youre ticked off but she shook her head not really unsettled she thought but not angry idve done the same thing to get what i wanted i didnt know youd be here you know what i mean you i didnt know wed be involved like this im in what most people consider an illogical field its only more essential to approach it logically but under it on a personal level ive been pulled to this place all my life without knowing where it was that i was being pulled last summer i finally knew but you didnt come i had to gather data research analyze factcheck always the geek she sat on the arm of the couch it was he thought a step i guess i dreamed of the island before i knew where it was or if it was i dreamed of it i dreamed of you all of that was so strong so much a part of my life that i needed to approach it the way id been trained as an observer a recorder and what do your observations tell you dr booke ive got reams of data but i dont think youd be interested in reading it she shook her head at his questioning look right but ive also got one simple feeling that im where im supposed to be i have a part in this i just dont know yet exactly what it is she was up again a part in what balancing the scales do you believe in that detailfiling brain of yours that this island is doomed to fall into the sea how can you buy some centuriesold curse islands dont just sink like swamped boats there are a number of respected scholars and historians who would argue that point using atlantis as their example of which you would be one she said sourly yeah but before you get me started on that and i bore you senseless let me just say that theres always room for lessthanliteral interpretations a force five hurricane an earthquake earthquake shed felt the earth tremble under her feet shed made the earth tremble and didnt want to think of it jesus mac you dont want me to start on plates and pressure and shifts do you she opened her mouth shut it again and settled for shaking her head didnt think so ive got degrees in geology and meteorology and i can get really boring anyway put simply natures a bitch and she barely tolerates us she studied him consideringly earnest sexy quiet somehow unshakably confident hardly a wonder that shed fallen for him you know what i bet youre not as boring when you get going as you think youd lose because he thought she would accept it now he reached out to take her hand heaven and earth ripley do more than hold us between them they expect us to deserve it and we have to decide how far well go that pretty much wraps it up she puffed out her cheeks blew out a breath it gets harder to tell myself this is all crap first nell then you and now this she added glancing down at the copies of journal pages it starts to feel like somebodys added bars to a cage so theres less and less chance of squeezing out again she frowned down at the pages as another thought sprang into her head youve got a blood connection to the sisters her gaze flashed up to his do you have magic no seems like a ripoff to me he said i may have inherited the interest the fascination but none of the practical usage she relaxed and slid down on the seat beside him well thats something at least fifteen mia read the first journal entry while sitting at her desk in her office a freezing rain had come in behind the wind and was now battering her window shed dressed in bright bold blue to dispel the gloom and wore the little stars and moons nell had given her for her last birthday at her ears as she read she toyed with them sending star colliding with moon when shed finished the entry she leaned back and studied mac with amusement well hello cousin i wasnt sure how youd take it i try to take things as they come may i keep these a while id like to read the rest of them sure she set the pages aside picked up her latté its all so nice and tidy isnt it i realize its quite a coincidence he began but she stopped him coincidence is often what tidies things up i can trace my family back to its start on the sisters i know some stayed some scattered and i remember now there was a macallister branch the one son among three daughters he left the island survived a war and began to make his fortune odd isnt it that i didnt think of that until now or connect it with you i suppose i wasnt meant to still i felt something for you a kinship thats nice and tidy too and comforting comfort wasnt my first reaction when i put it all together what was excitement descended from a witch and a silkie how cool is that he broke off a piece of the applesauce muffin shed urged on him then i was pretty irked that i didnt get any power out of the deal youre wrong the affection and admiration in her voice nearly made him flush your mind is your power the strength and the openness of that mind make very strong magic stronger yet because it doesnt close off your heart well need both she waited a beat shell need you it gave him a jolt mia had said it so quietly so simply do me a favor and dont mention that to ripley itll just piss her off you understand her recognize all of her various flaws numerous shortcomings and irritating habits but you love her anyway yes i he trailed off set the muffin aside that was very sneaky id apologize but i wouldnt mean it her laughter was too warm and soft to sting i thought you were in love with her but i wanted to hear you say it can you be happy living on the island he said nothing for a moment you really know her dont you ripley would never be happy anywhere else so yes i can be happy here ive been heading here all my life in any case i like you very much enough to wish just a little that it had been me you were meant for and you she added when he looked slightly panicked whod been meant for me since neither of those things is im glad we can be friends i think youll help each other find the best you can be you really love her dont you for an instant mias calm ruffled color washed her cheeks a rare occurrence then she shrugged yes nearly as much as im irritated by her now i trust youll keep that to yourself as i keep your feelings to myself deal and to seal it she rose and turned to the shelves behind her she took down a carved wooden box and opening it removed a starshaped pendant of silver set with a sunstone this has been in my family our family she corrected since we began here on the sisters its said that she who was mine forged the pendant from a fallen star and the stone from a sunbeam ive kept it for you mia but she only kissed him lightly and slipped the chain over his head blessed be cousin harding paid one more visit to evan remington his plans were set his schedule outlined but he felt it imperative to see remington again before he left he felt an odd kinship with the man the realization of it was both appalling and alluring to him remington was a kind of monster and yet didnt all men have that beast lurking inside them the sane the civilized and harding considered himself both restrained it controlled it he supposed it only made those who did neither who indulged it kept it fed and ready more fascinating he told himself that his regular visits to remington were research business but in truth he had come to find those frequent brushes with evil thrilling we were all one step away from the pit harding thought composing notes in his head as he waited to be admitted only by observing by learning from those who had fallen would we understand what waited for us on the other side of sanity harding stepped into the visitation room heard the echo of the lock is that the last sound we hear as we fall he wrote in his head the hopeless shooting of the bolt remington wasnt restrained this time harding had already been told that as part of his treatment and rehabilitation remington had been taken off full restraints hed exhibited no violence to others or himself and had been responsive and cooperative in recent sessions the room was small and nearly empty one table with two chairs while the restraints were missing harding heard the bright jingle of chain from the cuff on remingtons right wrist there was a third chair in the corner occupied now by a broadshouldered pastyfaced guard security cameras recorded every sound and movement the pit harding thought whatever name we gave it offered no privacy and little comfort mr remington evan today you could hardly see the madness after all this we can hardly be formal ill call you jonathan do you know jonathan youre the only one who comes to talk to me they tell me my sisters been here but i dont remember i remember you the voice was quiet but perfectly clear harding experienced a small inward shudder as he remembered just how remington had looked and sounded on his first visit he was still thin and too pale his hair lank but harding thought if you put him back in a designer suit and shipped him off to la his associates would take a look and simply think hed been working a bit too hard youre looking well evan hardly my best but one must take the facilities into account a muscle twitched in his cheek i dont belong here my attorneys bungled the entire business but ive taken care of that dealt with that stupid incompetent bastards ive fired them i expect to have new representation within the week and my freedom shortly after i see i think you do remington leaned forward then he gazed up toward the security cameras i think you do see i was defending myself and mine his eyes stayed on hardings now and something dark seemed to swim behind their colorless surface i was betrayed and misused those who stood against me they belong in here not i harding couldnt look away couldnt break the connection your exwife my wife remington corrected then in barely a whisper mouthed till death do us part tell her im thinking of her when you see her wont you i beg your pardon you cant finish what youve started you cant get what you want until you deal with her and the rest of them ive thought about it remington nodded slowly and his eyes pale as water stayed locked on hardings i have plenty of time for thinking i need someone to remind her i havent forgotten i need someone to show them all that i cant be ignored an agent if you will mr remington evan im a reporter a writer i know what you are i know what you want fame fortune recognition respect i know how to get those things for you i made it my business to get those things for others you want to be a star jonathan i make stars something seemed to move behind his eyes again like sharks swimming in a deep pool harding shuddered but couldnt look away and as his skin crawled cold he could feel himself being pulled in his breath came short beneath a terrible pressure in his chest im going to write a book yes yes an important book youll tell it as its meant to be told end it as it needs to be ended i want them punished he reached over with his free hand clasped hardings limp fingers i want them dead something snapped in the air sizzled and brought the guard to his feet no contact thou shalt not suffer a witch to live harding said dully as a fierce grin flashed on remingtons face no physical contact the guard ordered and strode toward the table but remington was already breaking his grip im sorry remington kept his gaze averted his head lowered i forgot i just wanted to shake his hand he comes to visit me he comes to talk to me we were just saying goodbye to his own ears hardings voice sounded tinny with distance i have to take a trip and wont be able to visit for a while i have to go now harding got unsteadily to his feet a headache blasted in his temples remington lifted his gaze one last time ill see you again yes of course remington allowed himself to be led away he kept his head lowered shuffled obligingly back to his cell in his heart black glee bloomed like a fetid flower for he had discovered that there was power in madness by the time harding was on the ferry for three sisters he could barely remember his last visit to remington it irritated him made him worry that he was coming down with something his memory for details was one of his most polished skills and now an event less than eight hours old was like some sketchy scene behind foggy glass he couldnt remember what theyd spoken of only that hed been suddenly struck with a blinding headache it had made him so ill hed been forced to stretch out on the front seat of his car and wait for the chills the pain the nausea to pass before hed dared drive away even now just thinking of it gave him the shakes his condition wasnt helped by the fact that the seas were rough and a needlesharp icy rain was pounding he had to huddle inside his car dryswallow more seasickness pills he was terrified that he would have to race through that vicious rain and vomit into the pitching sea in defense he once more lay down across the seat fighting to breathe slowly and evenly he began to count the minutes until he reached solid land again and must have fallen asleep he dreamed of snakes sliding under his skin the slither of them ice cold of a woman with blue eyes and long gold hair who cried out all pain and pleas as he brought a cane down again and again to batter her shes quiet now quiet now spawn of satan of a bolt of blue lightning that shot like an arrow out of the sky and into his heart he dreamed of terror and vengeance and hate he dreamed of a lovely woman in a white dress who wept as she curled on a marble floor of a wood dark under a new moon where he stood holding a knife to a smooth white throat and this time when it sliced clean and her blood covered him the world erupted the sky split and the sea opened its mouth wide to swallow all who had stood against him he awoke with screams strangling in his throat slapping at himself as if to kill whatever was crawling inside him for an instant he stared horrified in the rearview mirror and eyes that werent his eyes pale as water stared back then the ferry let out its blasting note to herald the docking on three sisters the eyes that stared back at him as he dragged out his handkerchief to wipe his damp face were redrimmed haunted and his own just caught a little bug he assured himself hed been working too hard traveling too much crossing time zones too often he would take a day or two to rest to let his system catch up bolstered by the idea he snapped on his seat belt started his car and drove off the ferry ramp and onto three sisters island the storm turned into a gale on the second day of it mac surfaced from his work and took a good look around hed had another shipment of books sent in and replacement parts for some of his equipment right now he had pieces of a sensor spread all over the little kitchen table a monitor that was acting up stood on the counter with its guts spilling out the kitchen still smelled of the eggs hed burned that morning which he had to admit hed had no business making when his mind was elsewhere hed broken a glass too and had a nice slice in his heel since hed gotten distracted before he swept it all up hed turned the entire cottage into a lab which wasnt so bad but without a lab assistant cleaning things up behind him hed also turned it into a disaster he really didnt mind working in a disaster area but it certainly wouldnt do as a permanent living arrangement if the cottage was too small to accommodate him and his work on more than the short term it was certainly too small to accommodate a ripley he thought quickly he wasnt quite ready to use the term wife even in his thoughts not that he didnt want to marry her because he did and not because he doubted she would marry him he would just wait her out in that area until she caved hed match his patience against her stubbornness any day of the week but first things first when a man wanted to settle down permanently he had to find a place to settle however much affection he had for the cottage it wouldnt fill the bill and he doubted seriously if mia would sell it he rose and managed not only to tread on a screw but to step on it at the exact point of his recent cut he spent a little time on some inventive cursing and hobbled out to find the shoes hed thought hed already put on he found a pair in the bedroom doorway where they had obviously planted themselves cagily waiting for him to trip over them and holding them took a look at the bedroom winced he didnt usually live like a slob okay he admitted he didnt usually intend to live like a slob it just happened forgetting the shoes he pushed up his sleeves he would shovel out the bedroom and use the manual labor to clear his mind he needed to think about a house it needed to be a pretty good size so his equipment didnt get in everybodys way he would need an office too not entirely sure when he might have changed his sheets last he decided to err on the side of caution and stripped them off it would be good if there was space to set up weights and exercise equipment ripley would want some space of her own too he imagined and started gathering up socks shirts underwear somewhere she could get away from him when he started to drive her crazy his mother called hers an escape hatch he remembered and reminded himself to phone home he carted the laundry to the tiny room off the kitchen missed stepping on the same screw by a hair and stuffed everything that would fit into the washing machine he added soap then deciding he should write down some of the basic house requirements wandered out to find a pad and forgot to turn on the washing machine three bedrooms minimum he thought four would be better someplace close to the water not that anywhere on the island was far from it but ripley was used to living right on the beach so booke you idiot its staring you right in the face you knew the first time you saw it he dashed to the phone and dialed long distance information new york city he told the operator i need the number for logan enterprises an hour later to celebrate what he considered the first step in becoming a homeowner he braved the elements thaddeus logan hadnt jumped at the offer but he hadnt dismissed it out of hand either it hadnt hurt that logan was acquainted with macs father connections within connections mac thought as he hissed in his breath and decided to walk to café book rather than risk the icedover roads in his rover he had a good feeling about it and he was certain logan would negotiate which reminded mac he should call his father for advice in that area the one thing he was sure of was if you wanted something too much and the other party knew it you were asking to get skinned he needed to do some research on real estate values in the area and he patted his pockets absently hoping for a handy piece of paper to make a note to himself not that the money mattered all that much but the principle did and he imagined that if he let himself get taken ripley would get torqued about it that would start the whole process off on a bad note tomorrow mac promised himself he would take a drive and get another good look at what was going to be theirs delighted with the idea he strolled along head down as the wind screamed in his ears and the ugly mix of ice and snow swirled and spat just look at him ripley thought out in this mess when he doesnt have to be not looking where hes going and bopping along as if its a sunny day in july the man needs a keeper she would just have to take on the job she started toward him then judging time and distance planted herself and let him walk straight into her jeez since she was braced and he wasnt he went skidding reflexively he grabbed her and that took them both on a fast slide sorry but she was laughing and the little elbow jab she gave him was friendly how many walls do you walk into on your average day i dont count its demoralizing gosh youre pretty he grabbed her again but was steady this time lifting her to her toes he planted a long warm kiss on her mouth her system tilted sweetly what i am is cold and wet my nose is red and my toes are ice cubes zack and i just spent a miserable hour out on the coast road weve got power lines down and cars off the road and the best part of a tree through ed sutters workshop roof nice work if you can get it very funny i think the worst of itll blow out by tomorrow she said looking as islanders had for centuries out to sea and sky both were gray as pewter but were going to be cleaning up after this one for a while yet what the hell are you doing out here you lose power it was on when i left i wanted some decent coffee he clued in to the direction from which shed come and the direction shed been going were you coming to check on me its my job to check on the residents of our happy little rock thats really considerate of you deputy todd how about i buy you a cup of coffee i could use it and someplace warm and dry for ten minutes he took her hand as they headed into the wind up high street how about if i buy a quart of soup and whatever take it home we can have dinner at my place later chances of the power lasting in the cottage through the night are slim weve got a generator at our place why dont you pack what you need and plan on staying there tonight is nell cooking is grass green im there he pulled open the door for her like magic lulu popped out from behind a bookshelf i shouldve known it was a couple of lunatics sensible people are home whining about the weather why arent you ripley asked because there are just enough lunatics on this island to keep the store open got a few of them up in the café right now thats where were heading did nell go home not yet mia cut her loose but shes sticking didnt see why peg should have to come out in this when she was already here were closing early in an hour anyhow good to know ripley pulled off her soaked cap as she started up the stairs do me a favor she said to mac sure can you hang around till closing make sure nell gets home safe glad to thanks itll be a load off i can let zack know and he wont worry ill ask her to come by my place help me get my stuff together ripley shot him a smirk pretty smart arent you people are always saying so he kept her hand in his as they walked to the café counter zack just called nell told them youve had a hell of a day havent you goes with the territory you can give me two large coffees to go and ill take one back to him this guys springing for them she added jerking a thumb at mac a large for me too but ill have it here and is that apple pie it is want a slice warm oh yeah ripley leaned on the counter idly scanning the café i better tell you i invited macs appetite to dinner and to bunk over were having chicken pot pie macs face lit up homemade chicken pot pie nell laughed as she fit tops on the takeout cups youre too easy ripley shifted her body away from the table area whos the guy sitting by himself she asked nell brown sweater city boots i dont know its the first time hes been in i got the impression he was staying at the hotel he came in about a half hour ago did you chat him up nell cut a generous slab of pie for mac i spoke with him in a friendly manner he came in on the ferry a couple of days ago just beat the noreaster people do come here ripley its just an odd time for a slicker to head over no business groups at the hotel now anyway she took the cups nell set on the counter thanks see you later she said to mac and might have warded off the kiss if her hands hadnt been full be careful out there he yanked her cap out of her pocket and tugged it onto her head harding watched the byplay from behind the newspaper hed brought over from the hotel hed recognized ripley todd from his files just as hed recognized nell it didnt explain his reaction to both hed expected to feel a nice zing of anticipation as he lined up the players on the stage instead in each case hed felt nearly ill a kind of whitehot fury had pumped through him when hed topped the steps and seen nell back at the café counter hed been forced to turn away to walk behind bookshelves until he had himself under control there hed sweated like a pig and had imagined his hands closing around her throat the violence of the experience had nearly caused him to turn around and leave but it had passed almost as swiftly as it had come and hed remembered his purpose the story the book fame and fortune hed been able to approach the counter to order lunch with his usual calm he wanted a day or two to observe her and the others before he attempted to interview them hed already lost some time for the first twentyfour hours on the island whatever bug hed picked up had plagued him he had been able to do little more than lie in bed sweating his way through vivid and unpleasant dreams but hed felt better by that afternoon nearly himself again he was still shaky harding told himself there was no doubt about that but a little food and a little exercise would help right him the soup had certainly soothed his system at least until the brunette had walked in then the clamminess had come back the headache the unexplained rage he had the strangest image of her pointing a gun at him shouting at him and hed wanted to leap up and pummel her face with his fists then another fast on its heels where she loomed over him in a storm her hair blowing and tipped with light and a sword that gleamed like silver gripped in her hands he thanked god she was leaving and that the strange mood was leaving with her still his hand trembled as he picked up his spoon again ripley brought zack his coffee and sipped her own while he finished a phone call as she paced she heard him reassuring someone about the storm emergency procedures medical aid had to be a new resident ripley thought probably the carters whod moved onisland in september there was no one else new enough to the sisters to panic over a midwinter storm justine carter zack confirmed when he hung up storms making her buggy shell get used to it or head back to the mainland before next winter listen i told mac to come to our place tonight powers bound to go good idea and i asked him to hang at the bookstore until nell leaves to make sure she gets home okay and an even better one thanks whats up maybe the storms making me buggy i got an itch over this guy i saw at the café cant pin it down city new boots manicure upperenddepartmentstore clothes late forties strong build but he looked a little sickly to me pale sweaty flu runs around this time of year yeah well i thought id go by the hotel see if i can wheedle some information on him because he trusted ripleys instincts zack pointed to the phone call them and save yourself another trip out in this mess no ill get more in person he gave me the jitters zack she admitted the guy was just sitting there reading his paper and eating his lunch but he gave me the jitters i want to check it out okay let me know sixteen procedures taken in planned steps after calculations and hypotheses the tools of his work science even that still considered out of the mainstream these were all familiar to him they were had always been to mac a kind of comfort as well as a path to discovery for the first time since hed started on that path he was uneasy hed never worried overmuch about taking risks as nothing worthwhile could be gained without them but each step he took now pushed him farther down a strange and fascinating road one he wasnt traveling solo are you sure you want to do this nell shifted her gaze up to where mac leaned over the top of her head im sure its just that i dont want you to feel obliged he attached the next electrode dont think you have to be polite to the crazy man you can just tell me to forget it mac i dont think youre crazy and i dont feel polite i feel interested thats good he skirted around the sofa where she was stretched out looked down at her as hed told her once before she sparkled she was also he sensed very open im going to be careful im going to go slow but anytime you want to stop you just say so and thats it got it and i will her dimples fluttered stop worrying about me its not just you at her questioning look he dragged a hand through his hair everything i do now even somehow what i dont do affects ripley i dont know how i know that its not really logical but i know it youre connected nell said softly as i am neither of us will do anything to hurt her she touched a hand to the back of his but both of us will more than likely do things that will annoy her i guess well just have to handle it i guess we will okay well he gestured vaguely with the two electrodes in his hands i need to put these you see well need to monitor your heart rate so she looked at the little white adhesive back up at his face ah if you feel uncomfortable or weird about that well just skip that part she studied his expression and decided the only man she trusted more than the one currently trying not to look embarrassed was her husband in for a penny she said and unbuttoned her blouse he was quick efficient and gentle just relax and be comfortable well get your resting rates he turned away from her to work with the machines that hed hauled over from the cottage he hadnt intended to bring them or to do the test not yet but when nell had come back to the cottage with him shed asked questions polite interest at first he thought then more direct more detailed before either of them realized it they were discussing physical reactions of magic brainwave patterns lobes pulse rates and she was agreeing to participate in a series of tests so whered you learn to cook my mother thats where my interest started after we lost my father she started her own catering business he adjusted dials watched the graph ever think about opening a restaurant i gave it a passing thought but i dont want the structure or the limitations i like my catering operation and working in mias café though i am toying with ideas there i think we she nell corrected could expand a bit outdoor seating in the season maybe a cooking club im going to talk to her about it when i have it more formulated in my mind youve got a head for business oh absolutely and she said it with no small sense of pride i ran that end of my mothers operation i like to organize and create you create with your cooking she dimpled again with sheer pleasure thats a nice thing to say its a gift like your power is a gift her vital signs were steady and stable he checked the readout on the ekg made some quick notes on his laptop i wonder when you knew you were gifted it seems to me mia was born knowing she was weve talked about it and ripley she doesnt talk about it as much but i think it was almost the same a knowing always and a burden he wondered always for you a discovery and a learning process i had dreams when i was a child of this place of people id yet to meet but i never thought of them as i dont know memories or foretelling then after evan her hands tensed deliberately relaxed again i forgot them or blocked them when i left my only clear thought was to run to get away but the dreams started coming back did they frighten you no not at all they were a comfort at first then a kind of need one day i saw a painting the lighthouse the cliffs mias home and i needed to be there it was a a destination do you know what its like to find out where it is you finally need to be he thought of the house near the cove yes i do exactly then you know its not just a relief but a thrill i drove onto the ferry that day in june and when i caught my first glimpse of the sisters i thought there finally i could belong there you recognized it part of me did another part just yearned then i met mia and everything began he continued to monitor her one part of his brain ruthlessly calculating changes peaks dips would you say she tutored you yes though she would say she just reminded me nell turned her head so she could look at mac how cool he looks she realized cool and controlled and yet his voice was warm friendly the first time she helped me try magic i stirred the air how did it feel amazing exciting and somehow familiar could you do it now now if youre comfortable with it nothing major i dont want you to spin your furniture around a little ripple for my readings youre such an interesting man mac excuse me just a little ripple for your readings she said with a chuckle no wonder ripleys crazy about you what here then a little ripple in the air just a stir from here to there a quiet breeze this man to please even before it began the readings popped like a gathering mac thought noting the rise of heart rate the fluctuation in brainwave patterns then they jumped again as the air well rippled fabulous look at this pattern i knew it its not just an increase in brain activity its like an expansion almost fully right brain creativity imagination really neat nell chuckled again and stilled the air not so cool now dr booke is it what you were looking for it goes a long way toward confirming some of my theories could you do something else something more complicated not that what you just did was small potatoes he added quickly something that requires more effort more of a punch there you go let me think her lips bowed up as she considered because she wanted him to be surprised she did the chant in her head a call to the senses that was both sweet and stunning this time the gathering came faster and bigger the needle on the ekg graph whipped in wide rapid sweeps suddenly the room was alive with music harps pipes flutes it was drenched in a rainbow of colors and tender with the scent of spring he could barely keep up with the changes desperate to be certain that he had it all on record he checked his camera his monitors nearly danced around the ekg you like it nell asked playfully its fucking great sorry beg your pardon can you just keep it going another minute he asked as he checked his energy sensor its really pretty by the way im eager for spring me too after the last two days respirations up but not that much pulse strong steady physical exertion appears to be minimal hmm heart rates actually back at rest did the use of power calm her or the result the result nell answered he blinked and focused on her again what you were talking to yourself but i think i know the answer she laughed lightly when she saw diego prance into the room to bat playfully at her rainbows its a soothing spell it relaxes me yeah interested he sat down on the floor beside her while harp strings wept would you say your physical reactions reflect the nature of the spell or charm exactly so for example the other night in the clearing it was more powerful maybe edgier because of what you were doing and the fact that the three of you were together its always stronger with the three of us i feel like i could move mountains afterward i stay energized for hours he remembered just how ripley had channeled her energy and cleared his throat okay how are you able to sustain this spell while im distracting you with conversation she looked completely blank for a moment i never thought about it that was clever of you i didnt know you were distracting me let me think its just there she suggested no thats not completely accurate its more like the way youre able to do two different things at one time like patting your head and rubbing your stomach no she responded more like cooking a roast and setting the table you can keep your mind on the one so you dont burn it and still manage the other easily enough whats nine times six fiftyfour oh i see leftbrain function im good with numbers recite the alphabet backward concentrating she began twice she fumbled backtracked hesitated but the music and color never faltered are you ticklish suspicion flickered over her face why i want to try a physical distraction he squeezed a hand on her knee made her yelp and jolt just as ripley and zack came through the door what the hell is going on hearing ripleys voice made mac wince and curse himself for not paying attention to the time then realizing he still had his hand on nells knee and her husband was armed he quickly removed it um from the looks of it zack said with a wink at nell this guys making time with my wife as lucy had come into the house with him he leaned down casually to rub her head as she sniffed the air and batted her tail i guess i have to take him outside and kick his ass get in line ripley said and reminded mac that she was armed as well i ah nell agreed to participate in a couple of tests he began thats not quite true nell corrected and succeeded in making all the blood drain out of macs face his sudden stricken look made her whoop with laughter i volunteered to participate would you mind turning off the entertainment portion of your little program ripley said coolly all right nell closed the spell and there was a moment of complete silence so zack began to strip off his coat whats for dinner you can help me with that nell spoke brightly as soon as im unhooked from these things oh sorry let me mac started to reach for the electrodes monitoring her heart rate then pulled his hands back as if hed burned them nobodys going to shoot me in the back are they he asked nell i can promise zack wont he was just teasing you hes not who im worried about as delicately as possible he unhooked her and kept his gaze discreetly averted as she buttoned her blouse again that was fun nell said as she got up and informative zack why dont you give me a hand in the kitchen now all right all right i hate missing the fun he complained as she dragged him off okay booke why dont you try explaining to me why i shouldnt start swinging because violence is never a sensible solution her answer to that was a low dangerous growl he stopped shutting down his equipment and turned to her okay i figure youre ticked off on a couple of levels so ill pick one to start there was no funny business going on between me and nell it was completely professional son if i thought otherwise youd be braying like a jackass right he took his glasses off to see her more clearly and because if she decided to try to deck him he didnt want them broken youre angry because i brought equipment here and ran tests on nell bingo i invited you here to my home its not a goddamn lab its also nells home he pointed out i wouldnt have brought anything if she hadnt agreed you wheedled her i can wheedle when i have to he said equably i didnt have to the fact is she was interested shes exploring herself and this is part of it im sorry it upsets you i was afraid it would and if id been paying more attention to the time id have shut it all down before you got home so youd have hidden it from me thats a nice touch his own temper rumbled tough to win with you deputy no ive never hidden my work from you and i wouldnt have done so now but id have tried to respect your feelings about it as ive tried to do from the start then why he cut her off by holding up one finger the simple fact is this is my work and you have to deal with that but this is your home and my being here under these circumstances upsets you ill apologize for that itll only take me about fifteen minutes to break this down and get it out ill tell nell ill take a rain check on dinner oh stop being such a jerk you know ripley you just keep pushing and pushing until nobody wins when he turned away to remove his camera from the tripod she reached up pulled her own hair until the sharp pain cleared her head maybe i do i didnt ask you to leave what are you asking i dont know i come home after a pisser of a day im tired and im irritable and i walk in on you doing your mad scientist routine with nell whos obviously not only cooperating but enjoying the hell out of it i wanted a damn beer and a hot shower not a confrontation understandable i can only apologize for the timing it doesnt change the fact that this is what i do no it doesnt nor she realized with a twinge did it change the fact that shed jumped down his throat because of it that hed expected her to not only was she being a bitch she was being a predictable bitch it was lowering you missed a level he packed his camera closed up his laptop which is i want to know why you didnt ask me i couldnt ask you if youd mind if i ran tests with nell because you werent here to be asked no why didnt you ask me to run them with you as he stopped unhooking cables to stare at her she shrugged i think its rude that you went to nell before you came to me just when he thought he had her pegged she changed the pattern on him would you have agreed i dont know she huffed out a breath maybe id have thought about it anyway but you didnt ask are you serious or are you just using this angle to twist things up so i come out being a jerk there was no arguing that however geeky he might be from time to time his mind was a scalpel that cut through all the bullshit in one swipe the jerk parts just a side benefit i shouldnt have jumped on you that way taken jabs at you and your work im sorry for it now youre apologizing i have to sit down dont milk it booke but she went to him laid her hands on his arms why dont you get us those beers then while im taking that hot shower you can explain to me what all this stuffs for maybe ill let you use it on me i can do that he reached up to take her hands before she could slide them away but i have a question first why are you considering it now because its like you said its your work your deal i respect you mac so it looks like im going to have to start respecting what you do not one of his professional or academic accolades had ever given him such pleasure as that one hardwon statement did he stepped closer to her framed her face with his hands thank you youre welcome youre still a jerk understood he felt her lips curve into a smile under his when he kissed her paranormal science now see there you lose me right at the kickoff ripley complained because to me thats an oxymoron they were in her bedroom with her sitting crosslegged on the bed while he set up his equipment there was a time when astronomy was considered outside the mainstream if science doesnt push the accepted scope study the possibilities it stagnates we dont learn anything by standing still science and education are part of what turned magic from the acceptable into the condemned then into the dismissed youre right but i would add ignorance intolerance and fear to that mix its science and education that may in time turn the tide back again they hunted us down slaughtered us and countless others it was in her voice he thought cold rage hot fear you cant forgive that could you she moved her shoulders restlessly i dont dwell on it but it pays to remember what can happen when fingers start to point youre worried about what might happen to you if outsiders look too close i can take care of myself just as the sisters took care of themselves do you know how many witches were hanged in salem town mac none she said before he could speak all were innocent powerless victims so youre a cop he said because youve chosen to protect the innocent and the powerless as others once werent protected she started to speak then just hissed out her breath you dont have to be a superhero to keep order on three sisters thats not the point though is it you protect mia educates books and nell nurtures youve all chosen to do what you can to heal old wounds to balance thats all a little deep for me he ran his hand gently over her hair before he bent down to hook up cables the gesture the simple gentleness of it loosened every muscle in her body have you ever been hypnotized just as that question tightened all her muscles up again no why he glanced back at her briefly casually id like to try it im licensed you didnt do that weird stuff with nell ill ignore the word weird no i didnt use hypnosis with nell i didnt want to push it but you and i have a different relationship and i like to think a different level of trust i wouldnt hurt you i know that it probably wouldnt work on me anyway thats part of what id like to see its a simple process based on relaxation techniques and perfectly safe im not afraid good why dont you lie down just wait panic ticked at her throat how come you cant just follow the same routine you did downstairs with nell before dinner i could id like to add a few tests if youre willing first im interested in seeing if your gift makes you more or less susceptible to hypnosis and if you can be hypnotized if youre able to demonstrate power in that state have you considered that in that state i might not have perfect control he nodded absently while he nudged her back on the bed that would be interesting wouldnt it interesting jesus youll recall that mia fried one of your toys when she was a little miffed that was cool but she didnt hurt me he reminded ripley and neither will you im just going to hook you up now i explained what the machines are for yeah yeah you need to lose the sweater she glanced toward the camera smirked so do you and your fellow geeks watch these tapes at stag parties absolutely nothing like watching a video of a halfnaked woman to break up the tedium of lab work he kissed her forehead before affixing the first electrode but ill keep this one in my private collection he took her through the same steps as he had nell casual questions monitoring and recording her resting vital signs there was a slight shift when he asked her to do a small basic spell anxiety he noted she wasnt completely comfortable opening herself to power but she obliged and the lights in the adjoining bath switched off and on rapidly i used to do that when zack was in the shower when we were kids she said just to piss him off give me something bigger more demanding her heart rate was up more than nells had been anxiety again he decided but the brainwave patterns were remarkably similar she cupped her hands lifted them he saw the ball of light glow then shoot up to the ceiling another followed still another as he watched them take position he grinned its a baseball field infield outfield nine players batter up she said and sent another light into her batters box i used to do this as a kid too and had missed it she realized when i couldnt sleep or didnt want to lets see how he likes a fastball another light small and blue shot out from the pitchers mound there was a snap of sound a burst of streaming light yes base hit deep right field lets stretch it into a triple forgetting his machines mac sat on the foot of the bed and watched marvelously entertained as she played through an entire inning keep it going he urged how old were you when you first recognized and used your gift i dont know it just always seemed to be there double play smooth as silk do you ever play on a terrestrial field sure hot corner ive got great hands you no too clumsy divide eightyfour by twelve struck him out and the side retires divide what thats math i hate math her brow furrowed you didnt say there was going to be a quiz give it a shot he told her and rose again to check the readings twelves one of the sucky ones hanging curveball low and outside its six no wait damn it seven seven times two is fourteen and carry the deal to the other deal seven so what excitement trickled through him but all that showed in his voice was amusement so you strained your left brain a bit but maintained the pattern she breezed through the backward alphabet he wasnt entirely sure what that said about her mind or her personality but her readings remained high and steady okay close the spell but ive got a man out and a man on well pick it up later this is starting to feel like school she complained but opened her hands again and drew the lights down extinguished them i need you to relax again breathe in through your nose out gently through your mouth slow deep breaths ready to pout about the game delay she looked over at him and saw what nell had seen cool calm control im relaxed enough breathe ripley count the beats slow deep easy he sat on the side of the bed with her checked her pulse with his fingers relax your toes my what your toes let your toes relax let all the tension slide out im not tense but he felt her pulse kick if this is your prelude to hypnosis its not going to work then it wont work watching her face he trailed his fingers to the pulse in the curve of her elbow back to her wrist soft steady strokes relax your feet youve been on them most of the day let the tension go out of them out of your ankles his voice was so quiet so soothing his fingers on her skin were a lovely light connection relax your calves its like warm water flowing up through your body washing out the tension your minds relaxing too just let it empty out your knees are relaxing now your thighs visualize a soft white field nothing on it its easy on the eyes it relaxes them he drew the pendant from under his shirt wrapped the chain twice around his hand breathe in the calm expel the tension its safe here you can just drift arent you supposed to tell me im getting sleepy ssh breathe focus on the pendant her pulse jumped again when he held it up in her line of vision thats mias relax focus youre safe you know you can trust me she moistened her lips this isnt going to work anyway the pendants in front of that white wall its all you can see all you need to see let your mind clear just look at the pendant listen to my voice its all you need to hear he took her down in stages gently until her eyelids began to droop then slid her deep subject is unusually susceptible to hypnosis vital signs are steady readings typical for a trance state ripley can you hear me yes i want you to remember that youre safe and that youre not to do anything that youre not willing to do and comfortable doing if i ask you to do anything that you dont want to do youre to tell me no do you understand yes are you able to stir the air yes will you do so gently she lifted her arms as if for an embrace and the air moved over him like a soft wave of water how does that make you feel he asked her i cant explain happy and afraid afraid of what i want it too much want too much of it close the spell he ordered it wasnt fair to ask her questions like that he reminded himself she hadnt agreed to it before hed put her under remember the lights the baseball lights can you bring them back im not supposed to play after bedtime she said and her voice had changed subtly become younger and full of mischief but i do he stared at her rather than the lights she threw toward the ceiling subject has regressed without direct suggestion the childhood game appears to have triggered the event the scientist in him wanted to pursue it but the man couldnt follow through ripley youre not a little girl i want you to stay in this time and place mia and i had fun if i didnt have to grow up wed still be friends it was said sulkily her mouth in a pout as she played the lights i need you to stay in this time and this place she let out a long sigh yes im here can i touch one of the lights it wont hurt you i dont want to hurt you she brought one down until it hovered above his hands he could trace it with his finger a perfect circle its beautiful whats inside you is beautiful some is dark as she said it her body arched and the lights flew around the room like bright stars instinctively mac ducked the lights began to whistle shrilly and pulse bloodred close the spell somethings here its come to hunt to feed her hair began to twist into wild curls its come back one times three ripley lights flew past his face as he rushed back to her close the spell i want you to close the spell and come back im going to count back from ten she needs you to guide the way im bringing her back mac gripped shoulders he knew were no longer ripleys you have no right to take her she is mine and i am hers show her the way show her her way she must not take mine or we are lost ripley focus on my voice on my voice it took all his control to keep his voice soothing firm but calm come back now when i reach one youll wake up he brings death he craves it he wont get it mac snapped ten nine eight youre waking up slowly seven six youre going to feel relaxed refreshed five four youll remember everything youre safe come back now wake up ripley three two one as he counted down he saw her come back not just to the surface of consciousness but physically as her eyelids fluttered the lights vanished and the room was still she breathed out swallowed holy shit she managed then found herself plucked off the bed into his lap and crushed in his arms seventeen he couldnt let her go couldnt stop blaming himself for taking chances with her nothing hed seen experienced theorized had ever terrified him the way watching ripley change in front of him had done its all right she stroked his back patted it then realizing they were both trembling she wrapped her arms around his neck and held tight im okay he shook his head buried his face in her hair i should be shot since gentle soothing wasnt working she switched tactics into something more natural to her get a grip booke she ordered and shoved at him no harm no foul i took you under left you open he pulled back and she could see it wasnt fear on his face but fury it hurt you i could see it then you were gone no i wasnt his reaction had given her little time for one of her own now her stomach quivered something had come into her no she thought that wasnt quite right something had come over her i was here she said slowly as she tried to puzzle it out for herself it was like being underwater not like drowning or sinking but just floating it didnt hurt more of a quick shock then the drift her brows drew together as she thought it through cant say i cared for it though i dont like the idea of being tucked aside so someone else can have her say how do you feel now fine actually i feel great stop taking my pulse doc let me get these things off you but when he started to remove the electrodes she closed a hand over his wrist hold on what did you get out of all that a reminder he bit off the words to be more cautious no you dont think like a scientist the way you were when we started this youre supposed to be objective right fuck objectivity come on mac we cant just toss the results out the window tell me im interested when he frowned at her she sighed its not just your deal now i have a pretty personal interest in what went on here she was right because she was right he dug down for calm how much do you remember all of it i think for a minute i was eight years old it was kind of cool you started to regress on your own he pressed his fingers to his temples clear the brain he ordered himself bag the emotion and give her some answers maybe the game was the trigger he considered if you want a quick analysis id say you went back to a time when you werent conflicted subconsciously you needed to go back to a time when things were simpler and you didnt question yourself you used to enjoy your gift yeah and for a while the craft the learning the refining i guess youd say restless now she moved her shoulders and then you get a little older and you start thinking about the weight the consequences he laid a hand on her cheek this all of this troubles you well things arent simple now are they they havent been for me for ten years he said nothing watching her patiently words trembled on her tongue then began to spill out in a flood i could see in dreams how it might be if i took a step too far if i didnt strap it in wasnt careful enough and sometimes in those dreams it felt good amazingly good to do whatever i wanted whenever i wanted screw the rules but you never did he said quietly instead you just stopped it all when sam logan left mia she was a wreck i kept thinking why the hell doesnt she do something about it make him pay the son of a bitch make him suffer the way shes suffering and i thought of what id do what i could do nobody would hurt me that way because if they tried she shuddered i imagined it and almost before i realized a bolt of light shot out of the sky a black bolt of light barbed like an arrow i sank zacks boat she said with a weak smile nobody was in it but they could have been he could have been and i wouldnt have been able to stop it no control just anger he laid a hand on her leg rubbed how old were you not quite twenty but that doesnt matter she said fiercely you know that doesnt matter and it harm none thats vital and i couldnt be sure i could keep that pledge god hed been in that damn boat not twenty minutes before it happened i wasnt thinking of him wasnt concerned about him or anyone i was just mad so you denied yourself your gift and your friend i had to there was no one without the other in this theyre too twined together she would never have understood or accepted and damn it shed never have stopped nagging at me plus i was pissed at her because she knuckled a tear away and said aloud what shed refused to admit even to herself i felt her pain like it was my own physically felt it her grief her despair her desperate love for him and i couldnt stand it we were too close and i couldnt breathe its been as hard on you as it has on her maybe harder i guess ive never told anybody any of this id appreciate it if we kept it between us he nodded and when his lips brushed hers they were warm youll have to talk to mia sooner or later i choose later she sniffled again rubbed her face briskly lets move on okay or i guess its back you got your readings you got your tape she said nodding at his equipment i didnt think youd be able to put me under i keep underestimating you it was relaxing even pleasant she pushed back her heavy hair and then what then he prompted he didnt have to check his machines to know her heart rate and respiration were spiking it was like something was trying to get it claw its way in something crouched and waiting boy that sounds dramatic and though she laughed at herself she drew her knees up protectively not her it wasnt her it was something else it hurt you no but it wanted to then i was sliding underwater and she was the surface i cant explain it any other way thats good enough i dont see whats good about it i couldnt control it like i couldnt control what happened to zacks boat couldnt control what i started with the lights tonight even though she was inside me some part of her it didnt seem as if she could control it either like the power was caught somewhere between up for grabs she shivered and felt her skin grow icy i dont want to do this anymore okay well stop he took her hands soothed im going to put everything away though she nodded she knew he didnt understand her she didnt want any of it any longer but she was afraid deeply afraid that she wasnt going to be given the choice something was coming she thought for her he tucked her in like a baby and she let him when he drew her close to comfort her in the dark she pretended to sleep he stroked her hair and she felt the beginning of tears if she was normal if she was ordinary her life could be like this she thought bitterly she could be held close in the dark by the man she loved a simple thing everything if shed never met him shed have been content to go on as she was enjoying a man now and then when he caught her fancy and her interest whether or not she would have embraced her powers again she couldnt be sure but her heart would have remained her own once you gave your heart you risked more than self you risked the one who held it how could she weary of the worry she breathed him in and gave herself to sleep the storm was back cold and bitter it drove the sea into a frenzy of sound and fury lightning blasted over the sky shattering it like glass black rain gushed from the shards to be hurled like frozen barbs by the wicked wind the storm was feral and she ruled it power fueled her pumping through muscle and bone with such glorious strength here was an energy beyond anything shed known before had believed possible and with this force at her fingertips she would have vengeance no no justice it wasnt vengeance to seek punishment for wrongs to demand it to mete it out with a clear mind but her mind wasnt clear even in the throes of her hunger she knew it and feared it she was damning herself she looked down at the man who cowered at her feet what was power if it couldnt be used to right wrongs to stop evil to punish the wicked if you do this it ends in violence in hopelessness her griefstricken sisters stood in the circle and she without i have the right no one does do this and you rip out the heart of the gift the soul of what you are she was already lost i cant stop it you can only you can come stand with us its he who will destroy you she looked down and saw the face of the man change features over features that slid from terror to glee to plea to hunger no he ends here she threw up a hand lightning exploded arrowed down to her fingertips and became a silver sword with what is mine i take your life to right the wrong and end the strife for justice i set my fury free and take the path of destiny from this place and from this hour thrilled darkly thrilled she lifted the sword high as he screamed i will taste the ripe fruit of power blood for blood i now decree as i will so mote it be she brought the sword down in one vicious swipe he smiled as its tip sliced flesh and he vanished the night screamed the earth trembled and through the storm the one she loved came running stay back she shouted stay away but he fought his way through the gale reaching for her from the tip of her sword lightning erupted and arrowed into his heart ripley come on honey wake up now its a bad dream she was sobbing with it and the wrenching grief in the sound worried him more than the trembling i couldnt stop it i killed him i couldnt make it stop its over now he fumbled for the bedside lamp but couldnt find the switch instead he simply sat up with her cuddled her rocked its all over now youre okay wake up he kissed her damp cheeks her forehead her arms banded around him like steel mac thats right im here you had a nightmare do you want me to turn on the light get you some water no just no hold on to me a minute okay absolutely not a nightmare she thought as she let herself cling to him but a vision a blend of what had been and what would be shed recognized the face the faces of the man on the beach one she had seen in other dreams hed died three centuries before cursed by the one called earth another she had first seen in the woods by the yellow cottage when hed held a knife to nells throat and the third she had seen in the café reading a newspaper and eating soup three parts of one whole three steps in one fate god how was she to know she had killed them in the end shed seen herself standing in the storm with her sword in her hand shed killed because she could because the need had been so huge and the payment horribly dear it had been mac shed seen running through the storm mac whod been struck down because she couldnt control what was inside her i wont let it happen she whispered i wont tell me tell me about the dream itll help no this will she lifted her mouth to his poured herself into the kiss touch me god make love with me i need to be with you fresh tears spilled as she melted against him i need you to comfort to fill to want she would take this and give it this last time all that might have been all that she had let herself wish would gather together and stream into this perfect act of love she could see him in the dark every feature every line every plane was etched on mind and heart how could she have fallen so deeply so hopelessly in love shed never believed herself capable of it never wanted it yet here it was aching inside her he was the beginning and the end for her and she had no words to tell him he needed none he tumbled into her the yield and demand there was a tenderness here a depth to it that neither had explored before swamped by it he murmured her name he wanted to give her everything heart mind body to warm her with his hands and mouth to hold her safe forever she rose to him drew him down met his sigh with her own love was like a feast and each supped slowly a gentle caress a melting of lips a quiet need that stirred souls she opened and he filled warmth enclosed in warmth they moved together in the seamless dark beat for sustained beat while pleasure bloomed and ripened his lips brushed at her tears and the taste of them was lovely in the dark his hands found hers linked youre all there is she heard him say it tenderly and as the wave rose to sweep them both it was soft as silk in the dark she slept away the rest of the night in his arms without dreams morning had to come she was prepared for it there were steps to be taken and she would take them without hesitation and she promised herself without regret she slipped out of the house early she took one last glance at mac how he looked sleeping peacefully in her bed for a moment she allowed herself to imagine what might have been then she closed the door and didnt look back she could hear nell already up and singing in the kitchen and knew her brother would be up and starting the day soon she needed to get a jump on it she left by the front door heading for the village and the station house at a brisk jog the wind and rain had died in the night under clear skies the air had turned bitter again she could hear the pounding of the sea the surf would still be high and wild and the beach littered with whatever the water had cast out but there would be no long freeing run for her that morning the village was as still as a painting captured under a crystalline coating of ice she imagined it waking yawning stretching and cracking that thin sheath like an eggshell determined that her home and everyone on it would wake safe she unlocked the door of the station house it was chilly inside and warned her they were running on emergency power lost power during the night and the generator kicked on she imagined that she and zack would be busy later dealing with any of the residents who didnt have backup power but that was later with a check of the time she booted up the computer she could run it off the battery long enough to get what she needed jonathan q harding she rolled her shoulders and began her search the basic police work steadied her it was routine it was second nature her stop at the hotel had garnered her his home address or the address hed given she reminded herself now she would see just who the hell he was and with that begin to piece together the puzzle of what part he played in her personal drama she scanned the data as it scrolled onscreen harding jonathan quincy age fortyeight divorced no children los angeles la she repeated and felt the little quiver shed experienced when shed gotten his city of residence from the hotel registration evan remington was from los angeles so were a lot of other people she reminded herself as she had the day before but there wasnt as much conviction in it this time around she read his employment information a magazine writer reporter son of a bitch looking for a hot story harding well its not going to happen you just try getting through me to nell and she broke off blew out a breath and deliberately consciously tamped down on the instinctive anger there had been other reporters she reminded herself gawkers parasites and the curious theyd handled it without any real trouble they would handle this one the same way she went back to the data noting that harding had no criminal record not even an outstanding parking violation so he was by all appearances a lawabiding sort she sat back considered if she were a reporter from la looking for a story where would she start remingtons family was a good bet his sister then some friends some associates research the key players who included nell from there police reports probably interviews with people who had known both remington and nell but that was all background wasnt it you couldnt get to the meat until youd talked directly to the main characters she snatched up the phone intending to contact the facility where remington was being held and heard the line crackle and die first the power she thought now the phones muttering complaints she yanked out her cell phone hit power and ground her teeth when the display announced that her battery was dead damn it goddamn it pushing herself out of the chair she paced there was an urgency in her now whether it was the cop the woman or the witch pushing didnt seem to matter she had to know if harding had met with remington all right then she steadied herself again it was imperative to stay calm and controlled it had been a long time since shed attempted a flight she had no tools with her to help focus her energy and though she wished just once for mia she accepted that in this she was on her own struggling not to rush she cast the circle and in its center cleared her mind and opened i call to all who hold the power unto me your help endower rise up the wind to aid my flight open your eyes to aid my sight my body remains but my spirit flies free as i will so mote it be it was like a drawing up a tingling that flowed gently through the body then a lifting out of what she was from the shell that held it she glanced down at her own form the ripley who stood head lifted eyes closed in the circle knowing the risks of lingering of becoming too charmed by the sensation of flight she centered her thoughts on her target and let herself soar the stream of the wind the sea beneath there was such joy in it and that she knew was a dangerous seduction before she could be lulled into the glorious silence and motion she let sounds fill her head voices humming the thoughts and the speech of an entire city were alive within her worries joys tempers passions mixed together in such a wonderfully human music as she traveled sliding downward she separated them and found what she needed there was no change overnight one nurse handed a chart to another their thoughts sent up a mild interference complaints fatigue a remembered fight with a spouse and one gnawing desire for ice cream well hes less trouble in a coma strange though the way he dropped just a couple of hours after that reporter left hed been alert stable responsive for days then this complete turnaround as the nurses moved down the corridor one of them shivered slightly as ripley passed wow got a chill she moved through the closed door and into the room where remington lay machines monitored his vital signs cameras watched him ripley hovered studying him comatose restrained behind lock and key what harm could he do now even as she thought it his eyes opened and grinned into hers she felt a stab in the heart the pain unbelievably sharp and completely real the power in her around her wavered and she felt herself falling his thoughts beat at her mind bloody vicious fists that spoke of vengeance death destruction they pinched at her greedy fingers that were somehow hideously arousing tempting her to surrender and more than surrender tempting her to take no you wont have me or mine she fought back struggling to free herself little wings of panic fluttered at her throat as she realized the sheer strength of what had come alive in him she tore free with a cry of both fury and fear and found herself sprawled in the circle shed cast on the simple wood floor of the station house wincing in pain she tore open her shirt and stared down in horror at the angry red welts between her breasts she struggled to her feet found the control to close the circle she was stumbling for the firstaid kit when the door burst open mia flew in the door like a whirlwind what the hell do you think youre doing instinctively ripley drew her shirt closed whatre you doing here did you think i wouldnt know all but shaking with anger mia closed the distance between them i wouldnt feel how dare you do such a thing on your own without proper preparation do you know what you risked it was my risk and youve got no business spying on me you risked everything and you know it just as you know i wasnt spying you woke me out of a lovely little dream ripley angled her head took a good look mias hair was in wild disarray her mouth unpainted and her cheeks pale now that you mention it you didnt take time to put on your war paint i dont think ive seen you without makeup since we were fifteen even without it ill always look better than you particularly now youre bone white sit down sit she repeated and solved the problem by pushing ripley into a chair mind your own business you unfortunately are my business if you wanted to check on remington why didnt you just look dont lecture me mia you know i have less luck with that area than you plus i didnt have a glass or a ball or a cup of water would do as youre perfectly aware its foolishly dangerous to fly without a partner someone who can call you back should it be necessary well it wasnt necessary i got back fine you could have asked me for help sorrow pierced the frustration by the goddess ripley do you hate me that much simple shock had ripley dropping her hands gaping i dont hate you i couldnt what have you done to yourself temper vanished as mia saw the welts moving quickly she pulled ripleys shirt aside and her soul shuddered he did this how is it possible you were in the circle hes just a man how could he break the protection and do this to your corporal body hes not just a man ripley said flatly not anymore theres something in him and its very strong and very dark part of its here theres a man at the hotel she told mia what she knew as she would tell nell they needed to be prepared i need to study mia said to think well find the answer in the meantime do you still have your amulet any of your protective stones mia dont be a fool not now wear the amulet recharge it first you have to stay away from this harding until we know more i know that im not going to let this happen mia i need you to promise you wont stop me however it has to be done well find a way let me tend to those burns youll stop me ripley repeated taking mias wrist squeezing urgently youre stronger than i am and you know just how close i am to the edge to admit that what needs to be done will be done impatient mia pushed ripleys hand away these are painful let me tend to them for a minute the burn was arousing ripley took a steadying breath seductive i wanted it and what it would do to me thats part of its slyness but fear cold and clammy shivered over mias skin you know that too yeah i know it and now ive felt it you and nell can hold out against it and nell stands in front of zack but i saw what could happen and im not taking any chances i cant leave it wont work so macs going to have to go he wont mia soothed the welts with her fingertips ill make him with her hand on ripleys heart mia felt the beat that was love and fear her own ached in sympathy you can try steps to be taken ripley reminded herself as she approached the yellow cottage this one most of all had to be faced she didnt need second sight or a ball of crystal to foresee that it would be painful more painful than the raw welts that even mia hadnt been able to erase completely from her skin he might hate her when she was done but he would be safe she didnt hesitate but knocked then strolled in dressed in a ragged sweatshirt and rattier jeans he stood in the crowded bedroom he was reviewing the tape from the night before it was a jolt to see him on the monitor so calm so unruffled so steady sitting on the bed beside her gently taking her pulse while his voice reassured a jolt to see him glance over at her now to see the concentration in his eyes then the easy pleasure that warmed them he stood blocking the monitor with his body then switching it off hi you snuck off on me this morning had stuff she said with a shrug back at work huh it can wait how about some coffee yeah thatd be good she didnt avoid the kiss but neither did she respond she knew he was puzzled so she breezed by him into the kitchen i wanted to talk to you she began i know weve been hanging out a lot hanging out yeah weve got a real nice sizzle between us especially between the sheets she sat stretching out her legs crossing her feet at the ankles but the thing is its getting a little intense for me wow last night especially really went over the top im going to have to back off back off he caught himself parroting her again shook his head i understand last nights session was rough he got down two mugs poured coffee you need a break from that youre not following me already bleeding inside she took the mug he offered its not just the work area ive got to admit i found it a lot more interesting than i thought i would brains are pretty sexy ive never hung out with a really smart guy before she sipped the coffee burned her tongue and kept right on talking look mac youre really a nice guy and i think we both had a good time you even helped me clear my head about a lot of stuff i appreciate that do you there he was she thought looking at her as if she were a bug on a slide you bet but im starting to feel a little you know confined i need to move on i see his voice was calm just a bit detached so youre dumping me thats a little harsh he wasnt reacting as shed expected he didnt look angry upset hurt shocked he simply looked mildly interested why dont we keep it friendly and just say its been fun okay he leaned back on the counter crossing his long legs at the ankles in a move that eerily mirrored hers then sipped his coffee its been fun great a little sliver of resentment worked through pricking her heart and her voice figured you for a reasonable type which is probably why youre not really my type i guess youll be heading back to new york pretty soon no not for several more weeks i dont see the point in staying i dont want to play anymore i guess i have to make sure youre not the center of my universe then i still have work to do on the sisters you wont get any more cooperation from me look im just thinking of how youre going to feel its a small world here people are going to know i broke things off its going to be embarrassing for you let me worry about that fine not my problem she pushed to her feet no its not he spoke pleasantly as he set his mug aside she never saw it coming one second he was studying her with that vague curiosity and the next hed yanked her against him his mouth was like a fever on hers hot angry draining why are you lying to me she was out of breath and her thoughts had scattered like ants hands off why are you lying he repeated and backed her up against the refrigerator door detached she thought wildly had she thought he was detached where did all this bull come from he gave her one quick shake why are you trying to hurt me and it did hurt a deep throbbing ache in the pit of his stomach a slow twisting twinge in the heart im not trying to hurt you but i will if you keep pushing yourself on me i dont want you youre a liar you held me when you slept i cant be responsible for what i do in my sleep you turned to me in the dark his voice was relentless a part of him felt as if he was fighting for his life you gave yourself to me sex is it wasnt sex he remembered how it had been for both of them his hands gentled and his anger became exasperation do you think you can trick me into turning away from you leaving the island why i dont want you here she shoved at him and her voice began to hitch i dont want you near me why because you moron im in love with you eighteen he ran his hands down her arms taking hers as he leaned over to touch his lips to her forehead well you idiot im in love with you too lets sit down and start there what what she would have pulled her hands free but he only tightened his grip back off no he said it gently no ripley i wont back off i wont go away and i wont stop loving you you might as well swallow that then we can work on whats scared you so much you want me gone mac if you love me youll pack up and go back to new york for a while it doesnt work that way no he repeated as she opened her mouth again dont be so damn implacable is a term ive heard applied to me occasionally its classier i think than hardheaded in this case however i dont think either applies he angled his head you get spooked about something worried about someone your instinct is to step away the way you did with your gift he continued over her protest the way you did with mia i wont let you do that with me with us ripley he lifted their joined hands kissed her knuckles im so in love with you dont her heart she thought couldnt take it just wait i hate to keep saying no to you ill make it up to you later and he lowered his head and kissed her until her bones went liquid i dont know what to do how to handle this ive never had this before me either well figure it out lets sit down and get started i told zack id be back in twenty minutes i didnt think it would take that long to to dump me he grinned at her surprise you want to call him she shook her head i cant think straight hell he knows where i am if he needs me it seemed as if everything inside her was jumping and twisting around and yet at the center of it her heart was glowing like the moon youre in love with me completely well she sniffled how come you never mentioned it before she demanded how come you didnt mention you were in love with me i asked you first got me there maybe i was building up to it you know he squeezed her arms before he nudged her into a chair softening you up maybe i was doing the same thing really telling me you were done with me is an odd way to accomplish that mac she leaned forward and this time she took his hands youre the first man ive ever said it to you have to be careful throwing that word around if youre careless with it casual with it it loses power youre the first because youre the first and for me youll be the only thats how it works with the todds we mate for life so you have to marry me his system kicked a quick boot i have to marry you yeah so that takes care of that hold on pleasure trickled through him dont i get a ring or something then you get down on one knee and ask and i say yes or no youre pushing your luck i feel lucky im buying a house oh there was a tug grief sorrow acceptance new york yeah well thats where your work is guess they always need cops there probably but im buying a house here do you think id ask you to leave your heart dont you know mines here now too she stared at him for one long moment she could do nothing but stare at him and saw their lives in his eyes dont make me cry i hate that i put in an offer on the logan place the big and beautiful and by the sea its not for sale oh but its going to be i can be very tenacious i want children so do i her fingers tightened on his itll be good with us good and solid and real but you have to do something for me first im not going away cant you trust me enough to do this one thing that wont work either tell me whats frightening you start with the dream last night she looked away from him i killed you how he asked sounding intrigued what have you got ice in your veins i ended your life your existence well figure out the solution faster if we dont panic tell me about the dream she shoved away from the table paced the room three times in tight little circles trying to burn off her agitation and told him and in telling him brought it all back so clearly that fear crawled through her like freshly hatched spiders i killed you and destroyed everything that matters she finished i cant carry that load mac cant deal with it its why i turned away from what i am turned away from mia it seemed the right the only thing to do part of me still thinks that but you know that wont work and that you have to face it youre asking me to risk you my family my friends my home no im not he said gently im asking you to protect us emotion totally swamped her god mac that was a big button to push i know it ill help you ripley i think i was meant to meant to love you he added taking her fisted hand smoothing it open to be a part of this i dont think my lifes work is a coincidence or my coming here or my sitting here with you right now and i know were stronger together than we are apart she looked down at their joined hands everything she wanted she realized and hadnt known she was looking for was right here in her grasp if i kill you its really going to piss me off his lips twitched me too are you wearing mias pendant yeah dont go anywhere without it or this she dug in her pocket she should have known where it was all heading when she felt compelled to bring it with her the ring was a complex twist of silver a trio of melded circles scored with symbols it was my grandmothers he was humbled and incredibly moved had to clear his throat so i get a ring after all looks like its going to be too small for your hand wear it on the chain with the pendant he took it from her squinting as he tried to make out the symbols without his glasses it looks celtic it is the middle circle says justice the ones on either side say compassion and love i guess that covers it its a beautiful piece he took off the chain opened it and slid the ring on thank you before he could slip the chain back over his head she gripped his wrist hypnotize me again its too dangerous dont give me that crap this is all too dangerous i want you to take me under give me some posthypnotic suggestion or whatever it is something that will stop me if i start to lose control in the first place youre too open to other energies when youre in a trance state you were like a sponge ripley soaking up what others poured into you and in the second place i have no idea if any suggestion would hold when youre conscious and aware youre too strongminded too strongwilled to be influenced in that way its another line of defense we dont know it wont work unless we try this is something you can do and im trusting you im asking you for help thats a hell of a button too okay well try it not now he added quickly i want some time to do a little more research and prepare and i want nell and mia here why cant this be just between us because its not ill try it but only when you have your circle now wait here a minute he said it in such a nononsense dontbothertoargue tone that ripley wasnt sure if she was irritated amused or impressed but she sat drumming her fingers on the table as he left the room while she listened to him rummaging around in the bedroom muttering to himself she drank the coffee shed let go cold when he came back he drew her to her feet i bought this in ireland a dozen years ago turning her hand over he placed a silver disk in her palm through its center ran a swirling rise of silver and on either side sat a small perfectly round stone rose quartz and moonstone ripley said for love and for compassion i bought it as a kind of talisman a good luck piece i always carry it with me cant find it half the time but it always turns up so i think its been pretty lucky it has a loop in the back so i imagine it was once worn as a pendant or you can just carry it in your pocket i didnt know it at the time but i bought it for you she rested her head on his shoulder this is going to make me mushy i dont mind i have to get back to work and i cant be all googlyeyed i really love you she told him as she turned her mouth up to his i really do he nudged her along careful not to behave as if he was nudging her along he had a great deal to do mac wasnt foolish enough to believe he couldnt be hurt even killed no he believed ripleys dream was a foretelling of what could be the cycle that had begun three hundred years before was still in play but he was also smart enough to know various means to protect himself and to believe that knowledge is power he would gather more knowledge and strengthen the shield over both of them he wouldnt risk putting her in a vulnerable trance state unless he was certain she would be safe he got out the copies of his ancestors journal entry and found the page he wanted february it is early before dawn cold and deep dark i have left my husband sleeping warm in bed and come to my tower room to write this a restlessness is on me a worry that nags like a bad tooth a mist hangs over the house like a shroud it presses against the glass i can hear it scratching sly little fingers made of bone how it craves to come in i have charmed the doors and windows and all the tiny cracks as my mother taught me before despair swallowed her spirit how long ago that was and yet on a night such as this it was only yesterday and i pine for her the comfort the strength the beauty of her with this chill seeping into my bones i wish for her counsel but it is barred to me even through crystal and glass it is not for myself i fear but for my childrens childrens children i have seen the world in my dreams a hundred years times three such wonders such magic such grief a cycle spins i cannot see it clearly but i know my blood before and after me spins with it strength purity wisdom and above all love will war with what now creeps outside my house it is ageless it is ever and it is dark blood of mine freed it and blood of mine will face it from this place and time i can do little more than protect what is now and pray for what will come i will leave what magic i can behind me for these beloved and distant children evil cannot and will not be vanquished by evil dark will only swallow dark and deepen the good and the light are the keenest weapons let those who come after hold them ready and end this in time beneath was a charm written in gaelic that mac had already translated he studied it again now hoping that the message from the past would help with the now harding felt better than he had in days the vague fatigue that had dogged him was put down to recovery from whatever bug had invaded his system but his mind was clear and he was certain hed passed the crisis in fact he felt well enough to be annoyed that a touch of the flu had thrown him off stride and off schedule he fully intended to rectify that by approaching nell todd that very day for his first interview in preparation for it he decided to have a light breakfast and a large pot of coffee in his room so that he could go over his notes refresh his memory of the details and plan the best strategy for persuading her to talk to him for his book the idea of the book and the money and glamour he intended to reap from it filled him with anticipation for days it seemed he hadnt been able to think of it clearly to imagine it to remember just what it was that he planned to do it was as if his mind had been locked away behind some thick door and whenever it had fought its way clear again had been too tired to function while he waited for his breakfast he showered and shaved looking at himself in the mirror he admitted that he didnt look his best he was pale a bit gaunt not that he couldnt get by without the pounds he could clearly see hed shed but the dark circles haunting his eyes offended his vanity he considered using a portion of his imagined advance for the book for a little nip and tuck and a regenerative stay in some posh spa after he had completed his initial interview with the former helen remington he would finish putting his book proposal together and send it to the new york agent hed contacted about the idea in the bedroom he considered the choice between tailored suit and the more casual look of slacks and sweater he opted for the casual more friendly approachable that was the image for nell todd rather than the formal business attire hed used with evan remington as he thought of remington a wave of dizziness washed over him forcing him to grip the closet door to steady himself not quite a hundred percent yet he thought he would feel better he was certain after breakfast his next shock came when he put on his slacks they gapped at the waist bagged at the hips he realized hed lost at least ten pounds during his bout with the flu perhaps more though his hands shook a bit as he cinched his belt in the last notch he told himself he could take advantage of this unexpected development he would just keep the weight off start an exercise program watch his diet more carefully hed look fit and trim for public appearances when his book was published by the time he sat down to breakfast at the table that room service had set up by the window hed convinced himself he was perfectly fine in fact better than ever with his first cup of coffee he gazed out the window the sun was bright almost too bright as it bounced off the ice that seemed to slick every surface he found it odd that the strength of that sun didnt appear to be melting any of the ice and that the village street seemed so still as if it was genuinely frozen a bug in amber he hoped the bookstore wasnt closed because of the weather he preferred to approach nell todd there this first time she would feel safer he imagined and more inclined to listen to his pitch he might also be able to set up an interview with mia devlin as the person whod hired nell whod rented her a house when she had first come to the island the devlin woman would add a great deal to the book more mia devlin was reputed to be a witch not that harding himself actually believed in such nonsense but something unusual had gone on in the forest the night remington had been taken into custody and the devlin angle was worth exploring blue lightning a shining circle snakes under the skin harding shuddered despite himself and began to look over his notes he could approach nell todd tempering his request for information with his admiration for her courage and intelligence and quite sincerely too harding admitted what she had done had taken guts skill and brains he would flatter her ego tell her how he had followed her trail across the country interviewed dozens of people shed worked for or with and ah yes he mused flipping a page in his notebook appeal to her sense of compassion her duty to others who found themselves in abusive situations a beacon of hope he scribbled down hastily a shining example of courage female empowerment for some escape is an option too terrifying to be considered or too far beyond their crushed spirits pleased that his thoughts were flowing smoothly again harding began to eat conception often cubbyholes victims of this nature as being part of an abuse cycle helen remington nell channing todd appears to have no such cycle in her background a cycle however must have a beginning from all appearances this cycle began and ended with evan remington harding continued to write but his concentration began to waver his fingers dug into the pen and the pen into the paper bitch whore burn the witch minemineminemineminemine blood death vengeance vengeance is mine is mine is mine he flipped pages rapidly slashing words over them as his breath quickened and the writing that was not his own all but scorched the paper they must die they all must die and i will live again when he came back to himself his notebook was neatly closed his pen set aside and he was nonchalantly drinking coffee gazing out the window and planning his day he thought it might be wise to take a nice long walk to be out exercising in the fresh air he could fill in several areas of description of the island take a closer look at the cottage where nell had lived when shed first arrived it was certainly time he had a personal look at the woods where remington had chased her that night feeling comfortably full harding tucked away his notebook secured a fresh one he slipped it along with a small tape recorder and a camera into his pockets and set out to work he remembered nothing hed written nor the bloodlust that had gushed inside him as hed done so nineteen the yellow cottage stood quiet at the edge of the little forest the trees were bare and black and cast short shadows on the ground within them was utter silence there were thin lacy curtains at the windows and the glass sparkled in the bright sunlight nothing stirred not a blade of winter grass not a single crisp brown leaf there seemed to be no sound at all though the sea was close and the village just at his back as he stood staring at the house by the wood harding thought it was like studying a photograph taken by someone else a frozen moment given to him for reasons he couldnt explain he felt a chill run up his spine his body shook with it and his breath came hard and fast he took one stumbling step back but it seemed as if he was rammed against a wall and could not turn and run as he so suddenly wanted to do then as quickly as the sensation had come it passed he was only standing on the roadside looking at a pretty cottage by a winter wood he would definitely get a checkup when he got back to the mainland he decided as he took one shaky step forward obviously he was under more stress than he had realized once he had all the background data and research for the book organized he would take that vacation just a week or two to recoup and recharge before he got down to the serious work of writing cheered by that thought he continued toward the woods now he could hear the soft and steady heartbeat of the sea the careless call of birds the light rustling of wind through naked branches he shook his head as he marched into the trees and glanced around with the suspicious condescension of a confirmed urbanite for the solitude of nature why anyone would choose to live in such a place was beyond him yet helen remington had done so shed given up great wealth a privileged lifestyle a beautiful home and a gilded social standing and for what to cook for strangers to live on a rocky lump of land and one day he imagined to raise a brood of squalling brats stupid bitch his hands clenched and unclenched as he walked beneath his feet a dirty fog began to churn to boil over his shoes he quickened his pace nearly running now though the ground was slick and patched with ice his breath came out in visible streams ungrateful whore she had to be punished to be hurt she and all the others had to pay would pay for everything theyd done they would die and if they dared challenge his power dared challenge his rights they would die in agony the fog ate along the ground and spilled at the edges of a circle that pulsed with a soft white glow his lips peeled back and a feral growl sounded deep in his throat he lunged at the ring and was repelled light rose from the circle a thin sparkling curtain of gold in fury he threw himself against it time and time again it burned white fire scorching his skin smoking his clothing as rage devoured him what was inside the body of jonathan q harding threw itself on the ground howling and cursing the light nell made up two orders of the days lunch special she hummed while she worked and toyed with adjustments to the menu for the wedding she was catering at the end of the month business was good sisters catering had found its feet and even in the slow winter months kept her busy and content but not so much so that she hadnt eked out time to work on a proposal for mia a cooking club in café book and an expanded menu were both very doable once she had the details more refined she would present the idea to mia businesswoman to businesswoman after she served the orders she glanced at the time another half hour and peg would relieve her she had a dozen errands to run and two appointments to discuss other catering jobs shed have to move fast she thought to get everything done in time to put dinner together the simple chaos of housewifely chores and business obligations piled together in overlapping layers made her happy but there were serious issues to be faced she couldnt deny it dinner that night wasnt just a social function she understood macs concern and the need to focus her energies on what was to come but she had already faced the worst and survived whatever had to be done to protect who and what she loved would be done she strolled out to clear a table in the café pocketed her tip tip money went in a special jar and was considered her splurge money paychecks were for expenses catering profits would be plowed back into the business but tip money was for fun it jingled cheerfully in her pocket as she turned to carry the plates and bowls back to the kitchen she stopped short then rushed forward when she saw harding standing by the counter staring blankly at the chalkboard menu mr harding what happened are you all right he stared at her through her you should sit down quickly she put the dishes on the counter took his arm she led him around the counter and back into the kitchen he sank into the chair she pulled out for him and she rushed to the sink to get a glass of water what happened i dont know he took the glass gratefully gulped down the cool water his throat felt scorched and raw as though it had been scored with hot needles im going to fix you some tea and some chicken soup he simply nodded staring down at his hands the nails were full of grit as if hed clawed at dirt the knuckles were abraded the palms scraped he saw that his trousers were stained with dirt his shoes filthy bits of twig and briar clung to his sweater it embarrassed him a fastidious man to find himself in such disarray might i wash my hands yes of course nell tossed a worried look over her shoulder a red streak like sunburn covered half his face it looked vicious painful and frightening she led him to the rest room waited for him outside the door and then walked him back to the kitchen she ladled the soup brewed the tea while he stood as if in a trance mr harding she spoke gently now touching his shoulder please sit down youre not well no i he felt vaguely nauseous i must have fallen he blinked rapidly why couldnt he remember hed taken a walk in the woods on a bright winter afternoon and could remember nothing he let her tend him the way the very young or the very old allow themselves to be tended he spooned up the warm soothing soup and it comforted his aching throat and uneasy stomach he drank her herbal tea sweetened with a generous dollop of honey and he basked in the sympathetic silence she gave him i must have fallen he said again i havent been feeling quite well lately the scents of the kitchen were so appealing her movements as she took and filled more orders so graceful and efficient that his anxiety receded he remembered his research on her and the admiration hed felt when hed followed her path across the country he would write a very good story book about her he thought one that spoke of courage and triumph ungrateful whore the words echoed dimly in his head and made him tremble nell studied him with concern you should go to the clinic he shook his head i prefer seeing my own doctor i appreciate your concern mrs todd your kindness i have something for that burn burn just a minute she moved out of the kitchen again spoke to peg whod just come on for her shift when she came back in nell opened a cabinet and took out a slim green bottle its mostly aloe she told him briskly itll help he reached a hand to his face snatched it away again i must have the suns deceptive he managed mrs todd i should tell you i came to the island for the specific purpose of speaking to you yes she uncapped the bottle im a writer he began ive followed your story first i want you to know how much i admire you do you mr harding yes yes indeed something wanted to crawl up from his belly to his throat he forced it down again initially i was merely interested in the story for a magazine piece but as i learned more i realized the value of what you experienced what you did it speaks to so many people im sure you know how many women are caught in the cycle of abuse he continued as she dabbed the balm on her fingers youre a beacon mrs todd a symbol of victory and empowerment no im not mr harding but you are he looked deep into her eyes they were so blue so calm the cramps in his gut eased i followed your trail across the country really she replied then her coated fingers slid over his burned cheek i spoke with people you worked with stepped in your footprints so to speak i know what you did how hard you worked how frightened you were you never gave up and i never will she said clearly you should understand that prepare for that ill never give up you belong to me why do you make me hurt you helen it was evans voice that quiet reasonable voice he used before he punished her terror wanted to burst free but it was terror she knew that it wanted you cant hurt me any longer i will never allow anyone i love to be harmed by you his skin rippled under her fingers as if something crawled there but she continued to smooth on the balm he shuddered once gripped her wrist run he whispered get away before its too late this is my home she fought her fear ill protect it with all that i am well beat you he shuddered again what did you say i said you should go rest now mr harding she capped the bottle as pity for him welled up inside her i hope youll feel better soon you let him go ripley paced the station house tugging at her hair in frustration just patted him on the head and told him to take a nap ripley zacks voice held a quiet warning but she shook her head for christs sake zack think the mans dangerous she said herself she sensed something in him its not his fault nell began but ripley whirled to face her this isnt about fault its about reality even if he were just some reporter with delusions of grandeur that would be bad enough he came here looking for you he followed your path all across the damn country talking to people behind your back thats his job nell held up a hand before ripley could snap at her again a year before she would have backed away from the confrontation times had changed im not going to blame him for doing his job or for whats happening to him now he doesnt know whats happening and hes sick hes frightened you didnt see him ripley i did no i didnt see him because you didnt call me you didnt bring me in is that the real problem i didnt ask you for advice for help nell tilted her head tell me would you have called me or mia ripley opened her mouth then shut it again in one hard thin line were not talking about me maybe we are maybe were talking about all of this its a cycle after all what started it is inside us whats inside us will end it he was hurt she said appealing to zack now confused afraid he doesnt know whats going on do you know zack asked her im not sure theres a power and its dark its using him and i think it was hard to say it hard to think it im afraid its using evan like a bridge from wherever it is through evan to this poor man we need to help him we need to get him off the island ripley interrupted we need to get his ass on the next ferry to the mainland and it doesnt take magic to do that he hasnt done anything rip zack reminded her he hasnt broken any law made any threats weve got no right to order him off the island she slapped her palms on his desk leaned forward hell come after her hell have to he wont get near her i wont let it happen she spun back to nell hell destroy what you love its his reason for being now nell shook her head i wont let him she reached for ripleys hand we wont let him ive felt what he is and what hes capable of ive felt it in me i know nells fingers linked with hers we need mia youre right ripley agreed and i hate that youre a fascinating woman little sister mia leaned on the kitchen counter and watched nell slide pasta into boiling water a crisis is upon us an event that has been brewing for three centuries ripley frets and curses and you cook and serve we all do what we do best she glanced up as she gave the pasta a quick stir what do you do mia i wait no its not as simple as that i prepare then mia lifted her wineglass sipped for whatever comes did you see this whats coming not specifically only something strong something blighted something that formed from blood and vengeance it craves what birthed it she said and grows as it feeds it uses weakness then we wont be weak it underestimates us mia continued we should take care not to underestimate it evil doesnt concern itself with rules with whats right and fair and its clever it can twist itself into the desirable were together now the three of us i have zack and ripley has mac i wish dont wish for me i have what i need mia trying to find the right words nell got out her colander even if when we face whats here now theres one more step yours do you think ill fling myself off my cliffs mia relaxed enough to laugh i can promise you i wont i enjoy living entirely too much there were other ways nell thought to leap into a void she started to say so then held her tongue they had enough to deal with for now what was wrong with them ripley listened to the conversation hum around the table spiced with the scent of good food well served everyday words in easy voices pass the salt jesus it felt as if something was simmering inside her right on the edge of boil ready to bubble up and spew over the lid and everyone else kept chatting and eating as if it were just another evening a part of her knew it was only a lull that space of time used to gather forces and brace but she had no patience with it with nells utter calm with mias cool waiting her own brother helped himself to another serving of pasta as if everything in his life that mattered wasnt teetering on the brink and mac observing absorbing assessing she thought with a helpless resentment a geek to the last there was something hungry out there something that wouldnt be sated with a tidy homecooked meal couldnt they feel it it wanted blood blood and bone death and anguish it craved sorrow and its need clawed at her this blows she shoved at her plate and conversation snapped off were just sitting here slurping up noodles this isnt a goddamn party there are a lot of ways to prepare for a confrontation mac began and laid a hand on her arm she wanted to slap his hand away and hated herself for it confrontation this is a battle a lot of ways to prepare he said again coming together like this sharing a meal a symbol of life and unity its past time for symbols we need to do something definite anger only feeds it mia chimed in then it should be full to bursting ripley snapped back and shoved to her feet because i am supremely pissed off hate anger a thirst for violence mia brought the glass of wine to her lips all those negative emotions strengthen it weaken you dont tell me what to feel could i ever you want what youve always wanted a clear answer when you dont get it you pound with your fists or turn away dont nell pleaded we cant turn on each other now right lets keep the peace ripley heard the bite in her own voice and even while it shamed her she couldnt soften it why dont we have coffee and cake thats enough rip its not enough frustrated beyond bearing she rounded on zack nothings enough until this is dealt with until its over itll be more than a knife to her throat this time more than a knife already coated with your blood i wont lose what i love i wont just sit here and wait for it to come after us on that we can agree mia set down her glass we wont lose and since arguing is bad for the digestion why dont we get to work she rose began to clear the table nell will feel better she said before ripley could make some snide comment if her house is put in order fine great she snatched up her plate lets be tidy she sailed into the kitchen and gave herself points for not simply heaving her plate into the sink what control what amazing restraint god she wanted to scream it was mac who came in quietly behind her alone he set the dishes on the counter then just turned her put his hands on her stiff and rigid shoulders youre afraid he shook his head before she could speak we all are but you feel that the weight of this what happens next is on you it doesnt have to be dont placate me mac i know when im being a bitch good then i dont have to point that out do i were going to get through this you dont feel what i feel you cant no i cant but i love you ripley with everything thats in me so i know and thats the next thing to feeling she let herself give just for a minute let herself go into his arms and be held there safe within the circle of him itd be easier if wed found this after his cheek rubbed her hair you think you couldve come along when everything was normal again and wedve gotten mushy on each other and had a regular life cookouts marital spats great sex and dental bills is that what you want right this minute it sounds aces id rather be mad than scared i work better that way just remember it all comes down to this he tipped back her head laid his lips on hers right there is more magic than most people ever know dont give up on me okay not a chance she tried to curb her impatience as the preparations were made she refused to lie down on the couch because it made her feel too vulnerable instead she sat in a chair in the living room her hands on the arms and blocked out the monitors and cameras she knew she should have felt comforted by having mia and nell standing on either side of her like sentinels but she felt foolish just do it she told mac you need to relax hed pulled a chair up to face hers and sat there almost idly holding the pendant breathe slow in and out he put her under so effortlessly this time so swiftly it brought him a quick ripple of nerves shes tuned to you mia said herself surprised at how completely ripley had given herself over and you to her that itself is a kind of strength they would need it she thought as she felt something cold shiver along her skin in response to it she stretched out her arm and across ripley clasped nells hand we are the three she said clearly and two guard the one while we are joined no harm can be done as warmth seeped back she nodded to mac youre safe here ripley nothing can harm you here its close she said with a shudder its cold and tired of waiting her eyes opened stared blindly into macs it knows you watched you and waited you share the blood youll die through me thats what it wants death to power and power to destruction through my hand grief ground down to her bones stop me her head fell back her eyes rolled back white i am earth she changed even as they watched her hair springing into curls her features subtly rounding my sin must be atoned and the time grows short sister to sister and love to love the storm is coming and with it the dark i am powerless i am lost great tears spilled down her cheeks sister mia laid her free hand on ripleys shoulder and felt the cold again what can we do the eyes that focused on mia werent ripleys they seemed ancient and unbearably sad what you will what you know what you believe trust is one justice makes two and love without boundaries makes three you are the three be stronger than what made you or all is for nothing should you live your heart will break again will you face that ill live and guard my heart she thought the same i loved her loved them both too much or not enough ive yet to see may your circle be stronger and hold tell us how to hold i cannot if the answers live inside you the questions wont matter she turned to nell then you found yours so there is hope blessed be ripley gasped again and came back in the storm she said as the first flash of lightning burst blue light into the room a lamp crashed to the floor a vase of nells flowers spun into the air to hurl itself against the wall the sofa upended itself then shot across the room even as zack whirled toward nell a table tumbled into his path he leaped it cursing and gripping her used his body to shield hers stop mia called into the wind that had gushed into the room nell stay with me she tightened her hold on nells hand used her other to take ripleys limp one still the power and quiet the air challenge this circle he who dares here we stand we are the three as we will so mote it be will pressed against will magic thrummed against magic then as abruptly as it had begun the wind died books that had been spinning in the air fell to the floor with a thud ripley macs voice remained utterly calm in direct opposition to his speeding heart im going to count back from ten youre going to wake up when i reach one slowly he leaned close to her brushed his lips over her cheeks and whispered the magic hed read in the journal youll remember that he promised her hoping it would stay in her mind when she needed it most youll hear that youll know that she felt herself rising as he brought her back as if waking from a hill of feathers the closer she came to the top the more she began to feel the cold and the dread when her eyes were open and her vision clear she saw the blood on macs face it trickled down his forehead down his cheek god my god its nothing he hadnt realized he was cut until she touched her hand to his face and brought it back smeared with blood some flying glass its nothing he repeated a couple of scratches your blood she fisted her hand over it felt the guilt the power the hunger and the fear ive done worse shaving look at me relax nell maybe you could get ripley a glass of water well take a little break here before we talk about all this no ripley snapped as she rose ill get it i need a minute she touched his face lightly im sorry i couldnt control it im sorry its all right she nodded as though she agreed with him but she knew as she walked back toward the kitchen that it wasnt wouldnt be couldnt be she knew what she had to do what had to be done his blood was already cool on her fingers as she walked out the back door and into the rising storm twenty she stepped out into the wind with only one clear purpose she would get harding and herself off the island away from mac away from nell and mia and her brother after that she would do whatever came next but the most immediate danger to those she loved was inside her and linked to whatever was inside harding she had shed macs blood she curled her fingers still damp with it into a fist again blood was power one of its most elemental sources the darker magics used it as a conduit or fed on it everything she was and believed rejected that refused it refuted it do no harm she thought she would try to do no harm but first she would see to it she would ensure that no harm could or would be done to those she loved the murdered innocents it was a whisper in her ear so clear so urgent she spun around expecting to see someone standing behind her but there was nothing but the night the dark and the bright and brutal force of the storm the farther she got from the house the more violent the storm raged and the more her anger grew it would use her to hurt mac to get to nell to destroy mia she would die first and take it with her when she reached the beach she quickened her pace then whirled around at the sound behind her lucy bolted out of the dark ears alert she nearly sent the dog back home with one abrupt command but ripley lowered the arm she had lifted to point and hissed out a breath all right then come along might as well have a goofy dog as a familiar as none at all she rested her hand on lucys head protect whats mine her hair flew in the wind as she and the dog jogged across the sand the surf pounded a wall of black water that slammed relentlessly against the shore the sound of it beat in her head her sister was dead slain like a lamb for her love for her heart for her gift where was the justice the air itself was full of howls and screams a thousand tormented voices under her feet a dirty fog began to creep along the ground rising until it was up to her ankles then halfway to her knees the chill of it seeped into her bones blood for blood life for life power for power how could she have believed there was any other way something made her look over her shoulder where the house should have been with its lights glowing against the window was nothing but a curtain of dirty white shed been cut off from home and she could see now as the fog continued to rise and swirl and thicken from the village as well fine and good she thought shoving fear down beneath fury come on then you bastard she shouted it and her voice cut through the fog like a scalpel through gauze take me on the first punch of power knocked her back a full three steps before she dug in rage curled inside her as she threw up her arms embraced it lightning slashed the sky and sea like redtipped whips ah here she thought here was magic with muscle she saw herself and not herself standing in the gale gathering forces air earth fire water beside her lucy lifted her head and let out a long ululant howl harding or what had mastered him stepped out of the fog rip always did throw a good tantrum zack said to try to lighten the mood the living room was in shambles and if he let himself he could still feel the buzz of what had whipped through it sting along his skin fear and anger anger and fear mia paced as she spoke i couldnt get through it ripleys and the one she comes from its so strong so thick like her skull mac said with a faint grin precisely id hoped to see what tactic would be taken next so that we could counter it that naturally would be too simple this hurts her nell commented i know it does mia patted nells arm absently and im sorry for it the thing to do now is to sit down and figure out how to use those emotions their negativity in what comes next a protective spell at this point is only a stopgap as much as i hate to agree with the deputy we have to take action she stopped to gather her thoughts you havent had much experience nell and it wouldnt be an easy matter in any case what wouldnt mac asked youre thinking of a casting out so handy to have a scholar around yes mia continued there are five of us wed do better with twelve but there isnt time to round up recruits just as there isnt time to do much in preparation well use what weve got once weve she trailed off and her cheeks went deathly pale shes gone shes outside the protective boundary fear leaped out of her before she could cage it shes broken the circle even as mac rushed for the door mia grabbed his arm no no think feelings not enough which is her problem we go together her gaze swept the room and we go ready do you know how its done mac struggled against panic in theory mia watched zack snap on his holster she wanted to tell him that wasnt the way but the expression on his face warned her not to bother tell us what to do nell said urgently and lets do it quickly ripley planted her feet legs spread body braced it was a dare and she knew it draw him out she thought draw him to her and save the rest and destroy him beside her lucy growled low in her throat harding she frosted her voice with amused derision middleaged paunchy city boy not such a keen choice if you ask me a useful shell the voice was deeper and somehow wetter than it should have been weve met before he told her have we i only remember interesting people whats in you remembers whats in me he circled her light on his feet ripley turned with him careful to keep facetoface she slid her fingers into lucys collar to hold her in place as the dog leaped and snapped you reached for what i have once took it into you like a lover remember the ecstasy it was not she discovered a question but a command a fast pulsing thrill pumped through her heady and full glorious a kind of fullbody orgasm that nearly brought her to her knees with its sheer and ferocious pleasure she shuddered from it didnt quite bite back a moan yes god yes she could have this such a thing would be worth any price betrayal damnation death as she struggled to clear her head she caught the flash of movement she stumbled to counter and ended up sprawled on her face in the frigid sand it felt as though shed been rammed by a truck he was chuckling a kind of tickled delight as she shoved to her hands and knees she watched lucy charge leap teeth bared and slam into a shield of air that went flaming at the edges at impact no lucy no hold i can give you what you want and more but it wont be free not free yet easy why dont you take my hand she had her breath back barely held a hand out for the dog that trembled with each growl why dont you kiss my ass he knocked her flat again one wicked sweep of wind i could crush you such a waste join your power with mine and wed rule liar she thought he lies and hes toying with you be smarter she told herself be meaner im confused she said weakly i cant think i need to know the people i love are safe of course he crooned it whatever you want can be yours give me what you are she kept her head down as she got slowly to her feet as if with great effort it was her mind she shot at him when she tossed her head back all the fury of it it was shock she saw on his face for one gratifying instant then his body flew back hurled by her temper the sand where he landed turned black beneath the fog as if scorched im going to send you to hell she promised him the light was blinding and heat and cold burst in the air like shrapnel she went on pure instinct leaping away countering attacking she felt pain bright and stunning and used it as she would a weapon you and yours will suffer he told her there will be agony then there will be nothing which is worse than agony what you love will cease to be you cant touch what i love until you get through me no she could hear his breathing ragged strained he was tiring she thought darkly she would win and even as she gathered herself to end it he clasped his hands raised them black lightning spewed out of the churning sky pierced his joined hands and formed a glinting sword he sliced it once through the air then twice his face was triumphant as he came toward her she called to the earth felt it tremble lightly as it began to quake lucy leaped to defend her even as ripley screamed the sword bit everything you love he said as the dog lay still on the ground everything dies tonight for that alone she threw her hand skyward and her power with it ill kill you she felt the hasp of the sword in her hand the fit true as a glove the weight familiar she swept it down and the clash of blade to blade rang like doom now it was she who called the storm a hundred bolts that lanced the sand and water until they circled like fiery bars and caged them its rage and violence fueled her became her her hate grew with an appetite so greedy it swallowed all else you killed the innocents he was grinning lips peeled back every one you destroyed my sisters they died weeping you murdered the man i loved then and now the thirst for his blood burned in her throat seemed to feed her with impossible strength she beat him back back toward those flaming bars dimly she heard someone calling her in her mind in her ears she blocked it out as she continued to hack and thrust as she felt his sword tremble and give a bit more each time she wanted nothing nothing so much as the glory of running her blade through his heart and feeling the power sing through her at that murderous stroke it coursed through her a little deeper a little truer every moment closer she thought so much closer she could taste the promise of it dark bitter seductive when his sword spun out of his hand and he fell at her feet she felt the thrill of it like sex with the hilt of her sword gripped in both hands she raised it high over her head ripley macs voice was so quiet through the roaring in her head that she barely heard it but her hands trembled its what he wants dont give him what he wants i want justice she shouted as her hair flew around her head in coils and snaps youre too weak to kill me the man at her feet lay back deliberately exposing his throat you havent the courage stay with me ripley look at me with the sword gripped in her hands she stared through the bars she saw mac only inches away where did he come from she thought dully how did he get here beside him stood her brother and on either side mia and nell she heard the wheeze and panting of her own breath felt the cold sweat sliding over her skin and the pulse of that greed swimming in her veins i love you stay with me mac said again remember lower the barrier mias voice was brisk and cast the circle were stronger theyll die the thing with hardings face taunted her ill kill them slowly painfully so you hear them screaming my death or theirs choose she turned away from those she loved and met her match oh yours the night exploded with sound as she brought the sword down a thousand images echoed through her mind through them she saw the triumph in his eyes the sheer glee in them an instant later they were baffled and lost and hardings she stopped the blade an inch from his throat help me he whispered it and she saw his skin ripple i will the root of magic is in the heart she began repeating the words mac had put in her subconscious from this the gift of power must start with its light we burn off the dark with its joy we leave our mark to protect and defend to live and to see as i will so mote it be beneath her ready blade harding began to laugh do you think such weak womens spells will hold me ripley tilted her head almost in sympathy yes as will this her mind was clear as glass as she closed her hand over the edge of the blade it sliced into her palm already stained with macs blood against her heart the amulet mac had given her glowed warm and bright his blood she said and my blood mixed now and true she squeezed until drops fell on his skin and he began to yell in rage she thought as she continued wonderful rage poured from the heart they conquer you this is the power that i set free as i will so mote it be bitch whore he bellowed as she stepped back strained to snatch at her to rise snarled when he could do neither her vision was suddenly so incredibly clear hope she realized was blinding bright she vanished the bars of light turned we cant leave harding like this pity for him swarmed into her poor bastard we cast it out mia said they laid out a circle of salt and silver inside it harding spat and howled like an animal and his curses grew more foul his threats more hideous faces shivered across his face as if the bones knit and reknit themselves thunder rolled across the sky in waves as wild as the surf the wind cried piercingly hardings pupils rolled as they ringed him and clasped hands we cast you out dark into dark from here till ever you bear our mark mia focused a small white pentagram scored hardings cheek he howled like a wolf into the void and into the night nell continued out of this soul and beyond the light helen i love you youre my wife my world he said in evans voice have pity it was pity she felt but the single tear that slipped down nells cheek was all she could give in this place and in this hour ripley chanted we cast you out and scorn your power we are joined we are the three as we will so mote it be we cast you out mia repeated and each who clasped hands repeated one by one until the words overlapped into a single voice the force of it came like a gale cold and fetid it swirled up a black funnel then spewed into the air and into the sea on the sand harding his face gray but unmarked groaned he needs tending nell said go ahead and take care of him then ripley stepped back immediately the strength went out of her legs and she buckled okay baby okay mac caught her lowering her gently to her knees catch your breath clear your head im all right just a bit wobbly she managed to lift her head look at her brother guess you wont have to lock me up for homicide guess not he knelt as well took her face in his hands scared me rip yeah me too she pressed her lips together to keep them from trembling were going to be busy tomorrow storm damage well handle it todds take care of the sisters damn right she breathed in breathed out and felt free you ought to give nell a hand with harding poor sap im okay you always were he kissed both her cheeks held on for another minute then looked at mac as he got to his feet make sure she stays that way she drew in another breath give me a minute will you she asked mac i can probably spare two but not much more okay she agreed as he helped her up her knees were jelly but she willed them to hold her steadied herself and turned toward mia then she forgot the weakness the shock even the echoes of power mia stood smiling just a little one hand on lucys head the dogs tail was wagging like a madcap metronome lucy in one leap she had her face buried in the dogs fur i thought she was gone i saw she jerked back and began stroking at lucy searching for the wound it wasnt real mia said quietly his sword was only an illusion a trick of violence to test you he used it to push you to repeat the sin he didnt want your death not yet he wanted your soul and your power ripley squeezed lucy one last time then straightened and turned to mia well he lost didnt he so he did did you know all along pieces mia shook her head not enough to be sure just enough to doubt and worry she held out a hand as nell crossed to them in my heart i knew you wouldnt fail but in my head i wasnt sure youve always been a difficult puzzle for me i might have done it i was mad enough frightened enough but i felt both of you inside i never wanted this she said in a furious whisper you know i never wanted this lifes tough mia said with a shrug you play the cards youre dealt or you fold i knew youd win nell took her injured hand gently uncurled the fingers you need to see to this i will its not bad she pressed her lips together i want the scar she said i need it then slowly nell curled ripleys fingers into a loose fist zack and i are going to take mr harding back to the house for now he needs a hot meal hes shaken up confused but all in all she glanced back to where zack had harding on his feet amazingly unharmed he remembers little lets keep it that way ripley demanded all right lets go back clean the rest of this up she tilted her head up to the sky saw the clouds dissolving and the halo of the moon glowing pure and white storms passing she murmured mia nodded for now ripley opened her mouth looked toward harding again maybe the guys could take harding back give us another minute here all right ill tell zack the wind had gentled to a breeze and the breeze smelled of night and of water ripley waited until the men and the cheerful dog turned toward home with mia and nell she closed the circle they had cast she took her ritual sword that had been real enough and cleansed it the surf foamed up tame now and lovely and dampened her boots when i lifted the sword she began knowing her friends were beside her i wanted blood like a craving bringing it down seemed to take hours she shifted her feet im not big on this vision crap thats your deal mia usually but i saw images i saw mac mac and me my parents my brother i saw the three of us in the forest the way we were last fall i saw nell you had a baby in your arms a baby nells voice went soft dreamy as she pressed a hand to her belly but im not not yet anyway oh boy nell let out a thrilled and baffled laugh oh boy oh boy anyway ripley continued i saw those things and more the three sisters in a dark wood in a circle of light the one who was earth on this very beach in a storm there were so many coming so fast they overlapped but each was perfectly clear and i saw you mia standing on your cliffs on the edge of your cliffs alone and crying there was darkness all around you the kind that came out of harding tonight it wanted you somehow i its always been you most of all even as the chill crept up her spine mia nodded are you telling me to beware very ware i saw something else at the instant i stopped the sword one last flash the three of us in a circle and i knew it was okay what im saying is i know it can be okay if we do what were supposed to do make the right choices you made yours tonight mia reminded her trust me to make mine youre the strongest well well is that a compliment i hear can it okay in the magic stuff youre the strongest what comes at yous going to be the strongest too none of us is alone now nell took mias hand then ripleys were three ripley took mias hand to finish the link yeah witches are us ripley told herself she was doing what needed to be done but that didnt mean she would enjoy it she watched nell soothe and charm harding bolster him with soup and tea she let mia treat and bind her hand and avoided being alone with mac until they left to walk to the yellow cottage we can load up your equipment tonight if you want ill get it tomorrow he answered he didnt touch her he didnt know why but he sensed she wasnt ready for that yet i guess hardings going to write his book after all not the one he might have had in mind but yeah i think nell likes the idea of a book that offers hope to people in an abuse cycle hes barely the worse for wear now that hes exorcised in a manner of speaking can i ask you a technical question i guess it was a beautiful night cool and fresh and clear there was no reason she told herself to be so edgy now how did you know the blood would hold him i dont know exactly hereditary knowledge mac offered and got a shrug maybe that kind of things your bag magic runs through the blood mine she said lifting her hand yours even though its pretty diluted she glanced over when he laughed thats accurate enough she said testily and blood is a transmitter a sacrifice whatever its life no argument he stopped turned at the verge of the trees where the shadows were soft and the moonlight dappled through black branches was that all theres a bond its emotional apart from intellect or logic even from ritual i guess love he waited a beat why cant you say it now youve never seen me like that before she said in a rush everything thats come before has been like kid stuff compared to tonight you were magnificent he watched her eyes widen it was going to be fun he thought to blindside her with statements like that for the next fifty or sixty years did you think that seeing what i did would change what i feel for you no i dont know mac i was nearly seduced maybe when i went out it was with the idea that i could sacrifice myself and dont tell me thats lame ive already figured that out then ill restrain myself good but the farther i got from the house from all of you the more i wanted blood there was a moment more than a moment when i might have turned when i might have grabbed what was offered the power was outrageous huge seductive staggering but you didnt take it no why i wanted me more i wanted you more and i this sounds hokey say it anyway i wanted justice more he laid his hands on her shoulders brushed a kiss over her brow then he lifted her bandaged palm and kissed that too i said you looked magnificent thats accurate too there was a light bursting out of you nothing could have dimmed it and now youre just my girl your girl she snorted please all mine he said and did what hed wanted to do since hed seen her with a shining sword gripped in her hands he lifted her off her feet nearly crushing her in an embrace as his mouth sought hers marry me live with me in the house by the sea oh god mac i love you its better than everything more than everything hell mac she tipped her head back it is everything and were just getting started she laid her head on his shoulder while he stroked her hair brilliant mind tough body generous heart her lips curved as she thought all mine when the power was in me i felt invincible tremendous its like having molten gold running through your veins do you know how i feel right now how even better she lifted her face to his once more so their lips met once more the sound of the sea was a steady heartbeat in the distance the moon sailed white overhead around them the night shimmered with the echoes of magic and was enough face the fire three sisters island nora roberts o love o fire once he drew with one long kiss my whole soul through my lips as sunlight drinketh dew alfred lord tennyson prologue three sisters island september her heart was broken the jagged shards of it stabbed at her soul until each hour each moment of what her life had become was a misery even her children those she had carried in her body those she carried for her lost sisters were no comfort nor was she to her great shame any comfort to them she had left them even as their father had left them her husband her lover her heart had returned to the sea and the parts of her that were hope and love and magic had died that day even now he would not remember the years theyd had together the joy of them he would not remember her or their sons their daughters the life theyd made on the island such was his nature such was her fate and her sisters she thought as she stood on the cliffs she loved above a sea that boiled and bucked they too had been fated to love and to lose the one who was air had loved a handsome face and kind words that had disguised a beast a beast who had shed her blood he had murdered her for what she was and she had not used her power to stop him and so the one who was earth had raged and grieved and built her hatred stone by stone until it had become a wall that no one could breach she had used her power for vengeance forsaken her craft and embraced the dark now the dark closed in and she who was fire was alone with her pain she could fight it no longer could find no purpose for her own life the dark whispered to her in the night its sly voice full of lies even knowing them for what they were she was tempted by them her circle was broken and she could not would not withstand alone she felt it creeping closer now sliding along the ground in a filthy fog it hungered her death would feed it and still she could not face life she lifted her arms so the flame of her hair snapped in the wind that she called up with a breath she had such powers left in her and the sea howled in response the ground beneath her shuddered air and earth and fire and the water that had given her great love then had stolen it away again this last time they were hers to command again her children would be safe she had seen to that their nurse would tend them teach them and the gift the brightness would be passed down the darkness licked along her skin cold cold kisses she teetered on the edge will straining against will as the storm within her and the storm shed conjured raged this island that she and her sisters had conjured for safety from the ravages of those who would hunt and kill them she thought would be lost all would be lost you are alone the darkness murmured you are in pain end the loneliness end the pain and so she would but she would not forsake her children or the children who came from them power was still in her and the strength and wit to wield it a hundred years times three this isle of the sisters is safe from thee from her reaching fingers light whipped spun a circle in a circle my children your hand cannot reach they will live and learn and teach and when my spell comes undone three more will rise to form the one a circle of sisters joined in power to stand and face the darkest hour courage and trust justice with mercy love without boundaries are the lessons three they must by free will join to face their destiny if this they fail one two or three this island will sink into the sea but if they turn back the dark this place will never bear your mark this spell is the last cast by me as i will so mote it be the darkness snatched at her as she leaped but could not reach her as she plunged toward the sea she hurled her power around the island where her children slept like a silver net one three sisters island may it had been more than ten years since hed stood on the island over a decade since hed seen except in his mind the wedges of forest the scatter of houses the curve of beach and cove and the drama of the cliffs where the stone house stood beside the white lance of the island lighthouse he shouldnt have been so surprised by the pull and tug or by the sheer simplicity of pleasure sam logan was rarely surprised but the delight in seeing what had changed and what hadnt surprised him by its depth hed come home and hadnt realized not completely what that meant to him until hed gotten there he parked near the ferry dock because he wanted to walk to smell the salty spring air to hear the voices from the boats to see the life flowing along on the little bump of land off the coast of massachusetts and perhaps he admitted because he wanted a little more time to prepare himself before seeing the woman hed come back for he didnt expect a warm welcome the fact was he didnt know what to expect from mia once he had hed known every expression on her face every inflection of her voice once she would have been standing on the dock to meet him her glorious red hair flying her smoky eyes alight with pleasure and promise hed have heard her laugh as she raced into his arms those days were over he thought as he climbed the road toward high street and the stretch of pretty shops and offices hed ended them and had exiled himself deliberately from the island and from mia now he was deliberately ending that exile in the time between the girl hed left behind had become a woman a businesswoman he thought with a half laugh no surprise there mia had always had a head for business and a view for profit he intended to use that if need be to wheedle his way back into her good graces sam didnt mind wheedling as long as he won he turned on high street and paused to take a long look at the magick inn the gothic stone building was the islands only hotel and it belonged to him he had some ideas that he intended to implement there now that his father had finally released the reins but business would wait for once until the personal was dealt with he continued walking pleased to see that while traffic was light it was steady business on the island he decided was as good as reported he had a long stride and it ate up the sidewalk quickly he was a tall man nearly three inches over six feet with a rangy disciplined build more accustomed in the last years to tailored suits than the black jeans he wore today the long dark coat he wore against the brisk breeze of early may billowed behind him as he walked his hair was black as well and windblown now from the ferry ride from the mainland swept past his collar his face was lean the long bones of his cheeks well defined the planes and angles were softened somewhat by a full and sculpted mouth and with those black wings of hair flying back presented a dramatic picture his eyes were alert as they scanned what had been and would be again his home somewhere between blue and green they were the color of the sea that surrounded the house framed by dark lashes and brows he used his looks when it suited him just as he used charm or ruthlessness whatever tools came to hand were employed to reach his goal hed already accepted that it would take everything at his disposal to win mia devlin from across the street he studied café book he should have known mia would have taken what had been a neglected building and turned it into something lovely elegant and productive the front window held a display of books and potted spring flowers scattered around a lawn chair two of her deepest loves he mused books and flowers shed used them both in a way that suggested it was time to take a break from the yardwork sit down and enjoy the fruits of the labor with a ride in a story even as he watched a couple of tourists he hadnt been away so long he couldnt tell tourists from islanders walked into the bookstore he stood where he was hands in his pockets until he realized he was procrastinating there was little more turbulent than mia devlin in full temper he expected her to lash out at him in blistering fury the minute she laid eyes on him again and who could blame her then again he thought with a grin there was little more arousing than mia devlin in full temper it would be entertaining to strike swords with her again just as it would be satisfying to soothe that temper away he crossed the street and opened the door to café book lulu was behind the counter hed have recognized her anywhere the tiny woman with a gnomes face almost swallowed up by silverframed glasses had essentially raised mia the devlins had been more interested in each other and traveling than in their daughter and lulu the former flower child had been hired to tend her because lulu was ringing up a customers purchases he had a moment to look around the store the ceiling was pricked with lights for a starry effect and made the prospect of browsing through the books a festive one a cozy seating area was arranged in front of a fireplace with a hearth scrubbed and polished used as a haven for more spring flowers the scent of them sweetened the air as did the pipes and flutes playing softly on the speaker system glossy blue shelves held books an impressive array he reflected as he wandered through and as eclectic as he would have expected of the proprietor no one would ever accuse mia of having a onetrack mind his lips quirked as he saw that other shelves held ritual candles tarot cards runes statues of faeries wizards dragons an attractive arrangement of another of mias interests he thought hed have expected nothing else there either he plucked a tumbling stone of rose quartz from a bowl rubbed it between his fingers for luck though he knew better before he could replace it he felt a blast of frigid air smiling easily he turned to face lulu always knew youd come back bad pennies always turn up this was his first barrier the dragon at the gate hello lu dont you hellolu me sam logan she sniffed skimmed her gaze over him sniffed a second time you buying that or do i call the sheriff and have you hauled in for shoplifting he laid the stone back in the bowl how is zack ask him yourself i dont have time to waste on you though he had her by a foot in height she stepped forward jabbed her finger at him and made him feel twelve years old again what the hell do you want to see home to see mia why dont you do everybody a favor and go back to where youve been gallivanting these past years new york city paris and oolala weve all done fine without you taking up space on the sisters apparently he gave the store another casual look he wasnt offended a dragon in his mind was meant to be devoted to its princess in his memory lulu had always been up to the job nice place i hear the cafés particularly good and that zacks new wife runs it your hearings just fine so listen up go on and get not offended no but his eyes turned edgy the green in them deepening i came to see mia shes busy ill tell her you stopped by no you wont he said quietly but shell know in any case even as he spoke he heard the sound of heels on wood it could have been a dozen women descending the curving steps in high heels but he knew as his heart stumbled in his chest he stepped around the bookshelves and saw her just as she made the last turn and the look that one look at her sliced him into a thousand pieces the princess he thought had become the queen shed always been the most beautiful creature hed ever seen the transition from girl to woman had only added polished layers to that beauty her hair was as he remembered it a long tumble of flaming curls around a face of rose and cream that skin he remembered was as soft as dew her nose was small and straight her mouth wide and full and he remembered perfectly remembered the texture and flavor her eyes were smokegray almondshaped and watched him now with a studied coolness she smiled and that too was cool as she walked toward him her dress a dull gold clung to her curves showed off long long legs the heels she wore were the same tone and made her look like something glowing with heat but he felt no warmth from her as she arched a brow and looked at him in turn well its sam logan isnt it welcome back her voice was deeper just a few degrees deeper than it had been once upon a time sultrier smokier silkier it seemed to wind its way into his belly even as he puzzled over her polite smile and detached welcome thanks deliberately he matched her tone its good to be back you look amazing we do what we can she tossed back her hair there were citrine stones at her ears the details of her down to the rings on her fingers the subtle scent that surrounded her etched themselves into his mind for an instant he tried to read hers but found the language foreign and frustrating i like your bookstore he said careful to keep his voice casual or what ive seen of it well well have to give you the grand tour lulu you have customers i know what ive got lulu muttered its a workday isnt it you dont have time to go showing this one around the place lulu mia merely angled her head a quiet warning ive always got a few minutes for an old friend come upstairs sam see the café she started back up her hand trailing along the rail you may have heard that a mutual friend of ours zack todd was married last winter nells not only a close friend of mine but shes a spectacular cook as well sam paused at the top of the stairs it annoyed him that he had to get his bearings seek his balance the scent of her was turning him inside out the second floor was just as welcoming as the first with the added enticement of a bustling café on one end and all the wonderful aromas of spices coffee rich chocolate that wafted from it the display glass sparkled in front of a dazzling selection of baked goods and salads fragrant smoke streamed from an enormous kettle where even now a pretty blonde ladled out soup for a waiting customer windows on the far wall let in glimpses of the sea its terrific that at least he could say without qualification just terrific mia you must be very proud of what youve done here why wouldnt i be there was a bite a quick nasty nip in the tone that had him looking back at her but she only smiled again gestured with an elegant hand that sparkled with rings hungry more than id counted on a glimpse of that bite snapped for an instant in those smokegray depths before she turned and led the way to the counter nell i have a man with an appetite then hes come to the right place nell grinned her dimples fluttering her blue eyes friendly when they met sams our soup of the day is chicken curry special salad is shrimp diablo and the sandwich of the day is grilled pork and tomato on olive loaf plus our regular fare she added tapping the counter menu with our vegetarian offerings zacks wife sam thought it was one thing to realize that his oldest friend had taken the plunge and another to see the reason why it gave him yet one more jolt quite a selection we like to think so you cant make a bad choice when nells prepared it mia told him ill just leave you in her capable hands for the moment i do have work oh nell i should have introduced you this is an old friend of zacks sam logan enjoy your lunch she said then walked away sam watched surprise race over nells pretty face then every bit of warmth drain away what can i get you just coffee for now black hows zack hes very well thank you sam drummed his fingers on his thigh another guard at the gate he thought and no less formidable than the dragon for all the soft looks and ripley i heard she got married just last month shes very well and very happy nells mouth formed a firm unwelcoming line as she set his coffee in a togo cup on the counter no charge im sure mia doesnt want or need your money they serve a very nice lunch at the magick inn as im sure you know yes i know a pretty kitten and very sharp claws sam mused do you think mia needs your protection mrs todd i think mia can handle anything she smiled now thin as a blade absolutely anything sam picked up his coffee so do i he agreed then wandered off in the direction mia had gone the bastard once she was behind the closed door of her office mia let out a splinter of the rage even that had books and knickknacks on her shelves rattling and jumping that he would have the nerve the insensitivity the stupidity to waltz into her store to stand there and smile at her as if he expected her to shout for joy and jump into his arms and to look baffled when she hadnt bastard she clenched her fists and a thin crack snaked across the glass of her window shed known the moment hed walked in just as shed known the instant hed come onto the island it had washed over her flooded into her as shed sat at her desk completing a stock order pain shock joy fury all so intense all so immediate shed been dizzy from them one stunning emotion slamming into another leaving her weak and trembling and shed known he was back eleven years hed walked away from her leaving her hurting and helpless and hopeless it still shamed her to remember the quivering mass of confusion and grief shed been for weeks after hed gone but shed rebuilt her life on the ashes of the dreams that sam had burned beneath her shed found her focus and a kind of steady contentment now he was back she could only thank the fates that her foreknowledge had given her time to compose herself how humiliating it would have been if shed seen him before shed had a chance to prepare herself and how satisfying it had been to see that flicker of surprise and puzzlement cross his face at her cool and casual greeting she was stronger now she reminded herself she was no longer the girl who had laid her heart bleeding and broken at his feet and there were more many more important things in her life now than a man love she thought could be such a lie she had no place and no tolerance for lies she had her home her business her friends she had her circle again and that circle had a purpose that was enough to sustain her at the knock on the door she blocked her feelings her thoughts again then slid onto the chair behind her desk yes come in she was scanning the data on her monitor when sam stepped inside she glanced over absently with just a hint of a frown in her eyes nothing on the menu to tempt you i settled for this he lifted the coffee then pried off the top and set it on her desk nells very loyal loyaltys a necessary quality in a friend to my mind he made some sound of agreement then sipped the coffee she also makes superior coffee a necessary quality in a café chef she tapped her fingers on the desk in a gesture of restrained impatience sam im sorry i dont want to be rude youre more than welcome to enjoy the café the store but i have work he studied her for one long moment but that slightly annoyed expression on her face didnt waver i wont keep you then why dont you just give me the keys and ill go off and settle in baffled she shook her head keys to the cottage your cottage my cottage why on earth would i give you the keys to the yellow cottage because delighted to have finally broken through that polite shield he drew papers out of his pocket we have a lease he set the papers on her desk leaning back when she snatched them up to read celtic circles one of my companies he explained as she scowled at the names and henry downings one of my attorneys he leased the cottage for me her hand wanted to tremble more it wanted to strike deliberately she laid it palm down on the desk why i have attorneys do all manner of things for me sam said with a shrug added to that i didnt think you would rent it to me but i did think was sure that once a business deal had been made youd keep your end she drew in a long breath i meant why do you need the cottage you have an entire hotel at your disposal i dont choose to live in a hotel nor to live where i work i want my privacy and my downtime i wont get either if i stay at the hotel would you have rented it to me mia if i hadnt gone through the lawyer her lips curved now sharply of course but id have bumped up the monthly rent considerably he laughed and more on balance than hed been since that first sight of her drank more coffee a deals a deal and maybe it was meant to be since my parents sold our house to ripleys new husband i cant set up housekeeping there things usually happen the way theyre supposed to happen things happen was all she said she opened a drawer took out a set of keys its small and its on the rustic side but im sure youll make do with it while youre on the island she set the keys on the desk on top of his copy of the lease im sure i will why dont you have dinner with me tonight we can catch up no thank you he hadnt meant to ask not so soon it irked him that the words had escaped some other time then he rose pocketed the keys the lease its good to see you again mia before she could evade it he laid his hand over hers on the desk something sparked visibly the air sizzled with it ah was all he said and tightened his grip take your hand off me she kept her voice low spoke slowly while looking directly into his eyes you have no right to touch me it was never about rights with us and all about need her hand wanted to tremble sheer will kept it steady there is no us now and i no longer need you it hurt a bright swift pain twisted in his heart but you do and i need you theres more to be considered than old bruised feelings bruised feelings she repeated the phrase as if it were a new language i see be that as it may you will not touch me without my permission you dont have it were going to have to talk that implies we have something to say to each other she allowed some of the anger to surface and coated it with disdain right at this moment i dont have anything to say to you i want you to leave you have the lease you have the keys you have the cottage that was clever of you sam you always were clever even as a boy but this is my office my store my island she nearly said but bit it back in time and i dont have time for you when his grip loosened she slid her hand free the air cleared lets not spoil your visit with a scene i hope youll like the cottage if you have any problems with it let me know i will enjoy it and let you know he turned to the door opened it oh mia this isnt a visit im here to stay he saw with vicious pleasure her cheeks go pale just before he shut the door he cursed himself for that and for bungling the first steps his mood remained foul as he stalked downstairs and out of the store under lulus steely stare he turned away from the docks where hed parked away from the cottage where he would live for a while and headed toward the police station he could only hope that zack todd now sheriff todd would be in by god sam thought hed like one person one goddamn person to welcome him home and mean it if he couldnt count on zack for that he was in a very sorry state he hunched his shoulders against the brisk spring breeze no longer appreciating it shed brushed him off like a fly like a gnat not with a slash of temper but with irritation that snap of connection between them meant something he had to believe that but if anyone he knew could hold the line against fate could press her will against it it was mia stubborn prideful witch he thought then sighed the fact that she was exactly that had always been part of her appeal for him pride and power were hard to resist unless he missed his guess she had more of both now than shed had at nineteen that meant he had his work cut out for him on a number of levels he hissed out a breath and shoved open the door to the station house the man who sat with his feet on the desk and a phone at his ear hadnt changed much hed filled out here fined down there his hair was still unruly still sunstreaked brown his eyes were the same sharp pure green and they widened as they studied sams face hey let me get back to you ill have the paperwork faxed over by end of day yeah right i have to go zack swung his feet from desk to floor as he hung up the phone then he unfolded himself and stared grinning at sam son of a bitch its mister new york city so look whos john law zack crossed the small office area in three strides on battered hightops and caught sam in a bear hug more than relief rippled through sam for here was welcome and the uncomplicated affection and bonedeep bond that had sprung from childhood the years between the boy and the man fell away its good to see you he managed right back at you zack eased away took stock pure pleasure flashed in his grin well you didnt get fat and bald from sitting behind a desk sam shot a look at zacks cluttered work area neither did you sheriff yeah so remember whos in charge and keep your nose clean on my island what the hell are you doing here want some coffee if youre calling whats in that pot coffee ill pass thanks and ive got business here longterm business zack pursed his lips as he poured muddy coffee into a mug the hotel for one thing i bought my parents out its mine now bought them zack shrugged eased a hip onto the corner of the desk my family never did run like yours sam said dryly its a business one that my father lost interest in i havent how are your parents dandy you just missed them they came in for ripleys wedding and stayed nearly a month i almost thought theyd decided to move back permanently but then they packed up their winnebago and headed up to nova scotia im sorry i wont get to see them ive heard rips not the only one who got married yeah zack lifted his hand where his wedding ring glinted id hoped you would make it back for the wedding i wish i could have that was a real regret one of many im happy for you zack i mean that i know it youll be happier when you meet her oh i met your wife sams smile thinned from the smell of that crap youre drinking she makes better coffee than you ripley made it whatever im just grateful your wife didnt pour hers over my head why would she oh zack puffed out his cheeks oh well then mia he rubbed a hand over his chin nell and mia and ripley the fact is he broke off as the door swung open ripley todd booke vibrating from the brim of her ball cap to the toes of her scarred boots glowered at sam her eyes the same green as her brothers shot arrows of resentment better late than never she announced as she started forward ive been waiting for this for eleven years zack lunged toward her caught her around the waist as she swung out she had he had reason to know a keen right cross hold on he ordered just hold the hell on hasnt mellowed has she sam commented he tucked his hands in his pockets if she was going to plant a fist in his face hed just as soon she get it over with not a bit zack hefted her off her feet while she cursed at him her cap fell off and her long dark hair tumbled over her furious face sam why dont you give me a few minutes here ripley cut it out he ordered youre wearing a badge remember then ill take it off before i punch him she blew her hair out of her eyes and they scorched the air between her and sam he deserves it maybe i do sam agreed but not from you mias too much of a damn lady to bust your chops im not he smiled now i always liked that about you im renting the yellow cottage he told zack and watched ripleys mouth drop open in shock come on by when you have time well have a beer he decided the shock was complete when she didnt try to kick him as he walked to the door he stepped outside again took another long look at the village hed had a welcome from a friend even if three women had formed a tight circle of resentment against him for better or for worse he thought he was home two the road to hell sam decided was paved with intentions and they didnt have to be good hed intended to stride back into mias life face her fury her tears her bitterness she was entitled to all of those and he would be the last to deny it he would have accepted her rage her curses her accusations hed intended to give her the opportunity to vent every drop of resentment she had harbored for him and of course hed intended then to sweep them aside and win her over a done deal in his calculations in a matter of hours at best days at worst theyd been linked since childhood what was eleven years compared to a bond of blood and heart and power but he hadnt intended to face her cool indifference oh she was angry with him he thought as he parked in front of the cottage but overlying the anger was a thick icy shield chipping through that would take more than smiles explanations promises even apologies lulu had blasted him nell had slapped at him and ripley had bared her teeth mia had done none of those things but her response had leveled him as none of the others had or could it stung to have her look at him with a kind of studied disdain particularly since seeing her again had stirred all the memories inside him churning them with fresh spurts of lust longing love he had loved her obsessively outrageously and that had been the root or one of the many tangled roots of the problem as he turned it over in his mind he tapped his fingers idly on the steering wheel he refused to believe she didnt still care for him there had been too much between them too much of them for there to be nothing left and if thered been nothing that spark that one instant of connection when their hands had touched wouldnt have happened he was going to hold on to that sam thought as his hands tightened and released on the wheel whatever else came down he was holding on to that one spark a determined man could build one hell of a blaze from one good spark winning her back doing what must be done facing what must be faced would be a challenge his lips quirked hed always enjoyed one he would have to do more than chip through mias ice hed have to get past the dragon and lulu was no pushover and hed have to deal with the women who flanked mia nell todd with her quiet disapproval and ripley with her infamous temper when a man had to wage a battle against four women that man had best have a plan and very thick skin or he would be ground to dust in a heartbeat hed work on it sam swung out of the car rounded back to the trunk there was time not as much as he might have liked under the circumstances but there was time he hefted two suitcases out of the trunk started up the walk then stopped and took his first real look at what would be his home for the next weeks well it was charming he realized neither the photographs hed studied nor his memory had done the cottage justice it had been white once as he recalled and a bit rundown the yellow paint warmed it and the flower beds just sprouting with spring cheered it that would be mias doing he imagined shed always had exquisite taste and clear vision she had always known precisely what she wanted another tangled root for him the cottage was quaint tiny and private on a pretty corner lot that bled into a small wood and was close enough to the water that the rumble of the sea played through the greening trees it had the advantage of quiet solitude and the convenience of being an easy walk from the village an excellent investment sam thought mia would have known that too the clever girl he mused as he continued up the walk had become a clever woman he set his suitcases on the stoop and dug out the house keys the first thing that struck him when he stepped inside was the warmth of welcome the smooth open hand of it come in and make this home the room seemed to say there were no lingering sensations or energy spurts from previous tenants that would be mias doing as well he was sure shed always been a thorough witch leaving his suitcases by the door he took himself on a quick tour the living room was sparsely but prettily furnished and split logs had already been laid in the hearth the floors gleamed and thin lacy curtains framed the windows a female ambience he thought but he could live with that there were two bedrooms one cozy the other well he only needed one the bath scrubbed and cheery was also a narrow box designed to give a tall man with long limbs considerable grief the kitchen at the back of the house would more than do for his needs he didnt cook and didnt intend to begin he opened the back door to find more flower beds an herb garden already thriving and a tidy patch of lawn that slid right into the spring woods he could hear the sea and the wind and if he listened carefully the hum of a car heading to the village birdsong and the playful yap of a dog he was sam realized alone with the realization some of the tension that had gathered in his shoulders eased he hadnt understood just how much he craved solitude it wasnt a commodity hed been able to claim in great quantities over the last couple of years nor was it something hed actively sought in the daytoday scheme of things hed had goals to achieve and points to prove and such ambitions didnt allow for the luxury of solitude he hadnt understood that he needed to find that serenity of aloneness again almost as much as he needed to find mia once he had had both whenever he wanted them and once he had cast them both aside now the island hed run from so fast as a young man was going to give them back to him he would have enjoyed walking through the woods or down to the beach or driving he thought to his old house and seeing his bluffs his cove the cave where he and mia he shook that idea and those memories away it wasnt the time for sentiment there were practical matters to be dealt with phones faxes computers the little bedroom would have to suit up as a secondary office though he planned to base his work at the hotel he needed supplies and he knew that as soon as he made his way around the village buying them word of his return would spread like fire through dry kindling he would see what he would see turning from the door he went back inside to unpack and set his place to rights wellmeaning friends mia thought were a blessing and a curse at the moment two of hers were crammed into her office i think you should kick his ass ripley announced of course i thought that ten years ago eleven mia corrected silently eleven years but whos counting that would make him too important nell stuck her nose in the air shes better off ignoring him you dont ignore a blood leech ripley bared her teeth you rip it off and stomp it into a quivering pulp what a pretty image at her desk mia leaned back studied her two friends i have no intention of kicking sams ass or of ignoring him hes taken a sixmonths lease on the cottage which makes me his landlord you could cut off his hot water ripley suggested mias lips twitched how perfectly childish but however satisfying it might be ive no intention of pulling silly pranks either if i did id cut off his water altogether why stop at hot but she continued as ripley gave a hoot of laughter he is my tenant and that means hes entitled to everything thats spelled out in the lease its business and nothing more why the hell is he renting anyplace on the sisters for six months ripley wondered obviously hes here to take more personal charge of the magick inn hed always loved it mia mused or so shed thought yet hed walked away from it just as hed walked away from her were both adults both business owners both islanders and though its a small world here i imagine the two of us can manage to run our enterprises live our lives and coexist with a minimum of fuss ripley snorted if you believe that youre delusional i wont let him into my life again mias voice took on an edge and i wont let my life be upset because hes here i always knew hed come back before ripley could speak again nell shot her a warning glance youre right of course and with the season coming on youll both be too busy to get in each others way why dont you come to dinner tonight im trying out a new recipe and i could use the feedback youll get that from zack no need to pamper me or soothe me little sister why dont we all go out and get drunk and bitch about men in general ripley perked up thats always fun as appealing as that sounds ill pass i have a number of things to do at home if i can get my work done here she wants us to clear out ripley told nell i get that nell sighed it was hard she thought to want so badly to help and not know how all right but if theres anything you need or want i know im fine and im going to stay that way she scooted them out then sat just sat with her hands in her lap it was selfdefeating to tell herself she would work or to pretend she could move through this particular day as if it were any other day she was entitled to rage and to weep to spit at fate and beat her fists on the face of destiny but she would do none of those things those weak and useless things she would however go home she got to her feet gathered her purse and the light jacket shed brought and as she passed her window she saw him he stepped out of a sleek black ferrari his coat a dark swirl around him he always did like shiny toys she thought hed changed out of his jeans into a dark suit and tamed his hair though the breeze was already playing with it as her fingers once had he carried a briefcase and strode toward the magick inn like a man who knew precisely where he was going and what he meant to do then he turned lifting his gaze unerringly to where she stood in the window his eyes locked on hers and she felt the jolt the punch of heat that would once have melted her knees but this time she stood straight and without a quiver when enough time had passed for pride she stepped away from the window and out of his sight home soothed her it always had practically the big rambling stone house on the cliff was too much for one woman but it was she knew perfect for her even when shed been a child the house had been more hers than it had been her parents shed never minded the echoes the occasional drafts or the sheer volume of time it took to maintain a house of its size and age her ancestors had built it and now it was hers alone shed changed little on the inside since the house had come into her care the furnishings here and there a few of the colors some basic modernization of the kitchen and baths but the feel of the house was as it had always been for her embracing warm waiting there had been a time when shed imagined herself raising a family there god shed wanted children sams children but over the years she had accepted what was and what wasnt and had made a nest of contentment at times she thought of the gardens as her children she had created them taking the time to plant to nurture to discipline and they brought her joy and when she needed more than the gentle pleasure they provided she had the passion and drama of her cliffs the secrets and shadows of her forests she had mia told herself all she needed but tonight she didnt wander out to fuss with her flowers or walk to face the sea from her cliffs she didnt stroll into her forest instead she went directly upstairs climbing until she was closed inside her tower room here had been refuge and discovery when she was a child here she had never felt alone unless alone was what she needed to feel here she had learned and had disciplined the beams of her own power the walls were rounded the windows tall narrow and arched the lateafternoon sun streamed through them in pale gold to pool on the dark aged wood of the floor shelves curved along one wall and on them were many of the tools of her trade pots of herbs jars of crystals spell books that had belonged to those whod come before her and the ones that shed written herself an old cabinet held other objects there was a wand shed made herself from maple that she had harvested on samhain when she turned sixteen a broom her best chalice her oldest anthame and a ball of pale blue crystal candles and oils and incense a scrying mirror all this and more carefully organized she gathered what she needed then slipped out of her dress she preferred whenever possible to work skyclad and so she cast the circle calling on her element fire for energy the candles she lighted with a breath were blue for calm for wisdom for protection she had performed this ritual before several times in the past decade whenever she felt her heart weaken or her purpose waver she admitted that if she hadnt done so she would have known sam was coming back to the sisters before hed arrived so the years of relative peace had their price she would block him again block her thoughts and feelings from him and his from her they would not touch each other on any level my heart and mind are mine to keep she began lighting incense sprinkling herbs on still water when i wake and when i sleep what once i gave with love and free will i take back to me and hold calm and still then lovers now strangers without joined destiny as i will so mote it be with her cupped palms lifted she waited for the cool flow of serenity the stream of confidence that would indicate her ritual was complete as she watched the cup of herbscattered water began to shiver water lapped against the rim in quiet teasing waves she fisted her hands fought back her own temper focusing her energy she punched magic against magic my circle is closed to all but me your tricks are foolish and bore me do not enter whats mine again without invitation at the flick of her fingers the lights from the candles streamed up lancing to the ceiling smoke from them billowed spread and blanketed the surface of the water even then she couldnt find her calm or get a clean grasp of her temper he would dare test his power against hers and in her own home so he hadnt changed she decided samuel logan had always been an arrogant witch and his element she thought hating herself when the first tear escaped was water in her circle behind the haze of smoke she lay down and wept bitterly the island grapevine spread the news fast by the next morning the hot topic of sam logan had outdistanced every other tendril of gossip conflicting reports had him selling the magick inn to mainland developers expanding it into some fancy resort firing the staff or giving everyone a raise one thing everyone could agree on was that it was very very interesting that he was renting mia devlins little cottage there was no consensus on what it meant only that it was a puzzler islanders hoping to gather more nuggets found reasons to drop into café book or stroll into the lobby of the hotel nobody had enough gumption to ask sam or mia directly but there was plenty of watching and hoping for some excitement it had been a long slow winter still handsome as sin and twice as deadly hester birmingham confided this information to gladys macey as she bagged gladyss weekly supply of groceries at island market strolled in here big as life and twice as bold and said hello to me like wed just seen each other a week ago what did he buy gladys questioned coffee milk dry cereal whole wheat bread and stick butter some fruit we got bananas on special but he passed them up and paid dear for fresh strawberries bought himself some fancy cheese and fancy crackers and some bottled water oh and some orange juice in a carton not planning on doing any cooking or cleaning for himself from the sound of it confidentially she leaned closer to hester i ran into hank from the liquor store he says sam logan breezed in and bought up five hundred dollars worth of wine some beer and a bottle of single malt scotch five hundred hesters voice lowered to a hiss you think he picked up a drinking problem in new york wasnt the number of bottles but the price gladys hissed back two bottles of french champagne and two of that fancy red wine youknowwho favors who gladys rolled her eyes mia devlin heavens sake hester who do you think i heard she kicked him out of the bookstore no such thing he walked in and out again under his own steam i know that for a fact because lisa bigelow was in the café having lunch with her cousin from portland when he was there lisa ran into my daughterinlaw at the pump n go and told her the whole story well hester liked the first story better do you think mia will put a whammy on him hester birmingham you know mia doesnt do whammies what a thing to say then she laughed but it sure will be interesting seeing what she does do i think ill go put these groceries away then go buy myself a new paperback novel and a cup of coffee you call me if anything develops gladys winked as she rolled her loaded cart away you can take that to the bank sam was well aware that tongues were wagging hed have been disappointed if they hadnt just as hed expected to read trepidation resentment and puzzlement when he called a morning meeting with all department heads at the hotel some of the trepidation eased when it became clear that a mass firing was not on the agenda and some of the resentment increased when it became clear that sam intended not only to take an active role in the running of the hotel but to make some changes as well in season we run at near capacity off season however our occupancy rate drops sharply often dipping to under thirty percent the sales manager shifted in his seat business is slow onisland in the winter months always has been whats always been doesnt apply sam said coolly the goal for now is to increase the guest rate to sixtyfive percent off season within the year well do that by offering more appealing packages to conventions as well as weekend and weekly getaway packages ill have memos regarding my ideas in those areas on your desk by end of week next he continued flipping through his notes a number of the rooms require renovation and redressing well begin next week with the third floor he glanced at his reservations manager youll make the necessary adjustments without waiting for acknowledgment he flipped another page weve had a steady decline in our breakfast and lunch business over the last ten months data indicate that café book is nipping off our usual business in those areas sir a brunette cleared her throat adjusted the darkframed glasses on her face yes im sorry your name stella farley im the restaurant manager if i can speak frankly mr logan were never going to be able to compete with the café and nell todd if i could she broke off when he lifted a finger i dont care for the word never she took a deep breath im sorry but ive been here the last ten months and you havent there was a deep silence like a unified holding of breath after a beat sam nodded point taken and just what have you learned in the last ten months ms farley that if we want to bring back business and generate more of it during the breakfast and lunch hours we should counterprogram the café offers casual and casual gourmet a relaxed atmosphere and well fabulous food we need to offer an alternative elegance formality romance an upscale atmosphere for a business meal or a special date i sent your father a report and a proposal last fall but youre not dealing with my father now it was said so flatly so smoothly none of the resentment showed get a copy on my desk by this afternoon yes sir he paused if anyone else has run ideas or proposals by my father over the last year they should copy me by end of week i want to make it clear that i own this hotel now own and run while my word will be final i expect input from my department heads ill have memos to all of you over the next several days and expect your responses to same within fortyeight hours of receipt thank you he watched them file out and heard the mumbling start before the door was closed one woman remained behind in her seat another brunette she wore a simple navy suit and practical pumps she was nearing sixty had worked at the inn for more than forty years she slipped off her glasses lowered her steno pad and folded her hands will that be all mr logan sam lifted an eyebrow you used to call me sam you didnt used to be my boss mrs farley his eyes cleared was that your daughter stella jesus dont swear in the office she said primly sorry it just didnt connect congratulations he added she was the only one with guts or brains enough to say anything worthwhile i raised her to stand up for herself theyre scared of you she told him boss or not she decided shed known him since he was a baby if her daughter could speak her mind so could she most of the people who were in this room havent ever so much as seen a logan for better or worse this hotels been run by proxy for a decade there was just enough acid in her voice to let him know her opinion was worse now you drop in out of nowhere and stir things up you always were one for stirring things up its my hotel and it needs stirring up i wont disagree the logans havent taken enough interest in this place my father youre not your father she reminded him no point in using him as an excuse when you just finished making sure to get that point across yourself that rap on the knuckles made him nod all right then well say im here now i intend to take plenty of interest and make no excuses good she opened her steno pad again welcome back thank you so he got to his feet wandered to the window lets get started the flower arrangements he began he put in a fourteenhour day eating what passed for lunch at his desk because he wanted to keep his business local he met with an island contractor personally and went over his renovation requirements he instructed his assistant to order updated equipment for his office then set up a meeting with the head of island tours he reran figures reviewed proposals refined and solidified random ideas he knew just how much it would cost in hard capital and in manhours to implement his plans but he was in for the long haul not everyone would think so he admitted when he came to the surface and rubbed the stiffness out of the back of his neck mia wouldnt he was grateful hed had so much on his plate through the day it had helped keep thoughts of her at bay but he thought of her now and remembered how he had felt the shimmer of her power flutter around the edges of his mind the day before hed pressed back at it poked through it momentarily and had seen her clearly kneeling in her tower room her body washed by pale gold light her hair a fiery fall to her shoulders her birthmark the tiny pentagram high on her thigh had shimmered he had no doubt it had been that momentary jolt of desire that had allowed her to snap the link between them so quickly so easily no matter it had been wrong of him to intrude on her the way he had rude and wrong and hed been sorry for it almost as soon as hed done it he would have to apologize for it of course there were rules of conduct that neither intimacy nor animosity could excuse breaking no time like the present he decided he culled the most pressing paperwork and tucked it in his briefcase hed speak to mia then grab some takeout and finish his work at home over a meal unless he could convince her to have dinner with him as a peace offering then work could wait he walked out of the hotel just as mia stepped out of the bookstore across the street they stood where they were a moment each obviously caught off guard then she swiveled on her heel and walked toward a spiffy little convertible he had to dash across the street to catch her before she slipped into it mia a minute go to hell you can send me there after i apologize he snagged the car door shed swung open and closed it again i was completely in the wrong i have no excuse for that kind of discourtesy being surprised didnt mean being mollified i dont recall you ever being so quick with an apology before she gave a little shrug fine accepted go away give me five minutes no five minutes mia ive been cooped up all day and i could use a walk and some fresh air she wouldnt struggle with him for the car door it would be and look to the people who were trying to pretend they werent watching undignified no ones stopping you theres a great deal of air around here give me a chance to explain a casual walk on the beach he said quietly if you blow me off youre just going to give them more to talk about and me more to wonder about a friendly conversation in public doesnt hurt either of us all right she dropped her car keys in the pocket of her long gray dress five minutes she took a deliberate step away from him slid her hands into her pockets and jingled her keys as they walked along high street toward the beach was your first day productive it was a good start do you remember stella farley of course i see her quite often she belongs to the book club at the store mmm another reminder that shed been here while changes had taken place and he hadnt she has some ideas for getting back some of our lunch business that youve been stealing away really mia asked amused good luck she felt people watching them as they turned toward the seawall she stopped there sliding out of her shoes before stepping onto the sand ill carry them no thanks the sea was a warm blue deeper toward the horizon shells heaved up by the last high tide scattered the shore gulls circled wheeled cried i felt you he began yesterday i felt you and i reacted thats not an excuse its a reason ive already said accepted mia he reached out but his fingers only brushed her sleeve as she moved away i dont want you to touch me thats basic we were friends once she stopped to stare at him out of cold gray eyes were we you know we were we were more than lovers more than mates hed nearly said it wasnt just passion we cared about each other we shared thoughts now my thoughts are my own and i dont need any more friends lovers you never married she turned that staggering face on him and her expression was all female and smug if i wanted a lover or a husband id have one no question about it he murmured youre the most extraordinary creature i thought of you stop she warned stop now damn it ill say what i have to say i thought of you he dropped his briefcase grabbed her arms as some of the frustration broke through i thought of us whats happened in between doesnt erase what we were to each other you erased it now you have to live with it as i did its not just about us he tightened his grip he could feel her vibrating and knew she could strike out woman or witch at any moment you know that as well as i do there is no us do you think after all this time after all ive done all ive learned id let fate toy with me again i wont be used not by you not by a centuriesold curse a single bolt of white lightning speared out of the clear sky and blasted into the sand between his feet he didnt jerk back but it was a near thing his throat was dry but he nodded you always did have exquisite control remember that and remember this i am done with you not by a long shot you need me to break the spell are you really willing to risk everything everyone for pride pride her color drained and her body went still you arrogant jackass do you think this is pride you broke my heart the words the way her voice trembled had him dropping his hands more than broke it you crushed it into dust i loved you i would have gone anywhere done anything for you i mourned for you until i thought i would die from it mia shaken he reached up to touch her hair only to have his hand slapped aside but i didnt die sam i got over you and got on with my life i like who i am now and theres no going back for me if you came here thinking differently youre wasting your time you wont have me again and what you wont have what you tossed aside would have been the best thing in your life she walked away from him in long unhurried strides and left him alone to stare out at the sea knowing she was right three you did what zack stuck his head in the refrigerator and rummaged for a beer he knew that tone his wife didnt use it often which was why it was so effective he took a long time pulling out the beer and made sure his face was relaxed and composed when he looked back at her she stood in front of the stove where something wonderful was cooking she had a wooden spoon in her fist and her fists on her hips he thought she looked like an outraged and very sexy betty crocker but he figured it wouldnt be healthy to say so just at the moment i invited sam to dinner he smiled when he said it and twisted the top off the beer you know how i like to show off my beautiful wifes incredible cooking when she only slitted her eyes he took a deep gulp from the bottle problem you never mind company for dinner i dont mind company but i do mind sleazeballs nell sam might have been a little reckless as a kid but he was never sleazy and hes one of my oldest friends and he broke the heart of one of my friends and yours he left her flat and went off to new york to do godknowswhat for more than ten years then then she continued working up a fine rage he slithers back onisland and expects everybody to greet him with open arms she slapped the spoon on the counter i for one am not interested in tuning up the brass band for sam logan how about just one trumpet player you think this is a joke she swiveled on her heel and strode to the back door he managed to get there in time to brace a hand on the door no sorry nell he ran his hand over her cap of hair look im sorry about what happened between sam and mia i was sorry then and im sorry now the fact is i grew up with sam and we were friends good friends isnt were the operative word not for me and for zack it was just that simple mia matters to me and so does he i dont want to be put in the position of taking sides not in my own home more than that more than anything i dont want you and me at odds over it but i shouldnt have asked him to dinner without talking to you first ill go head him off she bit back a sigh but couldnt quite master the pout youre doing that to make me feel small and low he waited a beat did it work yes damn it she gave him a little shove get out of my way if were having company for dinner theres no point in burning it but he didnt move aside instead he took her hands and squeezed thanks dont thank me until ive gotten through the evening without giving him hives or warts gotcha how about i set the table how about you do you want candles yeah black ones she smirked as she walked over to check her wild rice to ward off negative energy zack heaved out a breath should be some evening sam brought a good wine and sunny yellow daffodils but she wasnt mollified she was polite brutally so and served the wine on the comfortable front porch with canapés that shed tossed together at the last minute sam wasnt sure if she meant that to be friendly or to illustrate that he would be admitted to her home in stages i hope you didnt go to any trouble sam told her nothing more tedious than unexpected guests no there isnt is there she replied sweetly but then again im sure youre not used to potluck so well all make do she swung back into the house and sam hissed out a breath he was sure now he was getting in but in painful stages this is going well mia means a lot to her for a lot of reasons sam merely nodded wandered to the rail of the front porch lucy zacks black lab rolled over to expose her belly for a rub batting her tail for a bit of charm crouching sam obliged her he knew the reasons for nells fierce loyalty to mia hed made it his business to know what happened on the island over the years he knew nell had been on the run when shed arrived on three sisters escaping an abusive husband she had faked her own death and he had to admire her guts for it and had changed her name and her appearance as she zigzagged across the country picking up jobs waitressing cooking hed seen the news reports on evan remington who was now serving time in a prison mental facility and he knew that mia had given nell a job running the bookstore café had given her a home and he suspected had taught her how to refine the gift hed recognized nell as one of the three the minute he saw her shes had a rough time your nell very rough she risked her life to save her life when she got here mia gave her a chance to dig in put down roots ive got to be grateful to mia for that too and more he added waiting until sam turned back youve heard about remington hollywood power broker wife beater psychopath he straightened and i know he took a slice out of you trying to get to nell yeah absently zack rubbed a hand over his shoulder where remington had stabbed him he tracked her here knocked her around before i got to her then he took me out temporarily shed run into the woods knowing hed come after her and probably not take the time to finish me off his face went grim at the memory when i took off after them ripley and mia were here they knew nell was in trouble yes mia would know the son of a bitch had a knife to her throat even now the memory had rage swimming into him hed have killed her maybe i couldve gotten a shot off maybe not but hed have killed her either way shes the one who took him out she gathered what was inside her what she is and with mia and ripley turned what he was back on him i watched it happen zack murmured there in the little wood by the cottage where youre staying now a circle of light out of nowhere then remington was on the ground screaming she has courage and faith she does zack agreed shes everything youre a lucky man though his own mind took a smart side step at the thought of a woman any woman who could be everything to a man her love for you is a tangible thing even when shes pissed sam said with a weak smile the way shes pissed now that youve invited judas to her table why did you do it why did you leave sam shook his head a lot of reasons some im still figuring out when i have them all of them ill tell mia youre expecting an awful lot of her sam studied the wine in his glass maybe i always did zack worked hard to keep the conversation light and friendly at dinner by his calculations he talked more during that hour at the table than he normally did in a week but every time he sent nell an imploring look she ignored it i can see why the cafés taken a bite out of our lunch trade sam said youre an artist in the kitchen mrs todd my biggest regret is that you didnt walk into the hotel instead of café book when you came onisland i went where i was meant to go do you believe in that in destiny absolutely she got to her feet to clear the table so do i absolutely he rose as well picked up his plate when nells back was turned he gave zack a little head signal make yourself scarce weighing his wifes ire against the sheer exhaustion of playing buffer zack pushed away from the table i need to round up lucy he said and using his dog as an excuse he hurried out nell sent a fulminating look at his retreating back why dont you go on with zack ill make a pot of fresh coffee in a minute absently sam reached down to pet the gray cat that had uncurled from under the table to stretch it hissed at him ill just give you a hand he said after barely saving his hand from a nasty swipe he saw nell give the cat hed heard her call diego a small approving nod i dont want a hand you dont want my hand sam corrected zacks the best friend i ever had rather than spare him a look nell opened the dishwasher and began loading you have an odd way of defining friendship however i define it its a fact he matters to both of us so for his sake i hope we can call a truce im not at war with you he glanced at the cat again it had plopped down beside its mistress to wash and watch sam narrowly youd like to be fine she slammed the dishwasher door turned id like to hang you by your toes for what you did to mia and while youre hanging by your toes id like to start a nice steady fire under you so youd roast slowly and in great pain and while you were roasting slowly and in great pain id like to i get the picture if you do you know just how useless it is for you to try to charm me did you make all the right choices the best choices the wisest choices when you were twenty she slapped on the hot water squirted soap under the stream i never deliberately hurt someone and if you had deliberately or otherwise how long would you expect to be punished for it damn it he swore as she ignored him then switched the water off himself she cursed right back lifted a hand to turn it on again infuriated he closed his hand over hers light shimmering blue sparked between their meshed fingers nell went very still as her anger slid under shock she left her hand in his as she shifted her body angling it until they were facetoface and she could look directly into his eyes why didnt anyone tell me she demanded i dont know he smiled as the light mellowed to a glow sister baffled now she shook her head there are only three who form the circle three who came from three but four elements yours is air and she who was lacked your courage mine is water you believe in destiny in the craft were connected and you cant change that no but she would have to think about it hard and long slowly she slid her hand from under his i dont have to like it or you you believe in fate in the craft but not in forgiveness i believe in forgiveness when its earned he stepped away jammed his hands in his pockets i came here tonight planning on charming you to scrape away a few layers of your resentment and dislike part of that was pride its tough having your oldest friends wife detest you he picked up the wine bottle poured some into the glass shed yet to clear part of that was strategy he drank i know very well that you and ripley stand in front of mia i wont see her hurt again and youre sure thats what ill do he brought his glass to the counter then i came into your home and felt what you and zack have together what youve made between you i sat at your table and you fed me though youd rather have hung me by my toes so instead of charming im charmed he glanced around the kitchen it had always been a warm and friendly room once hed been welcome there i admire you for what you made out of your life and i envy you your clear vision and your happy home zacks important to me he looked back at her as she said nothing its hard i imagine for you to buy that but its fact i dont intend to do anything that complicates his relationship with you ill go out the back while hes busy with his lucy nell dried her hands i havent made coffee yet he turned at the door just looked at her and she saw why mia had fallen for him not just the dangerous good looks but in his eyes she saw so much power so much pain im not forgiving you she said briskly but if zack considers you a friend you must have some redeeming qualities somewhere sit down were having trifle for dessert she had humbled him sam thought later as he walked back to the cottage the pretty blueeyed blonde whod been bitingly polite then brutally frank then cautiously understanding all in one evening had brought him to his knees it was rare for him to want to earn someones respect but he now wanted badly to earn nell todds he walked the beach as he had walked it as a boy restlessly and turned for home as he had as a boy without any sense of pleasure how could he explain that while he had loved the house on the bluff it had never been his place hed had no regrets when his father had sold it the cove the cave they had meant a great deal once but the house itself had just been wood and glass with so little warmth inside demands yes to be a logan to succeed to excel well hed learned to do all three but he wondered now what it had cost him he thought again of the spirit in the todd house hed always believed houses had spirits and theirs was warm affectionate marriage actually worked for some people he decided the commitment the unity and the promise not just for convenience or status but for heart that in his mind was a rare rare gift thered been little affection in his house oh no neglect no abuse no meanness his parents had been partners but never in his memory a couple and their marriage was as coldly efficient as any merger he could still remember being baffled fascinated and vaguely embarrassed when he was a boy by the open displays of affection between zacks parents he thought of them now traveling around in their house on wheels and reportedly having the time of their lives his parents would be appalled at the idea how much he wondered did who we came from form us did zacks staggeringly functional childhood predispose him to create his own functional family the luck of the draw or was it all in the end what we made of ourselves each choice leading to another choice he paused now looking out and watching the swath of white light sweep over the water mias lighthouse on mias cliffs how many times had he stood and studied that hopeful beam and thought of her wanted her he couldnt remember when it had started there were times when he thought hed been born wanting her and it had been terrifying that feeling that hed been swamped by some tide that had begun forming before his existence how many nights had he ached for her even when hed had her even when hed been inside her hed ached love for him had been a storm full of boundless pleasure and abject terror for her it had simply been standing on the edge of the beach he sent his thoughts winging over the black water toward the beam of light toward the cliffs the stone house toward her and the wall shed built around what was hers rejected them bounced them back at him you have to let me in he murmured sooner or later but he left it alone for now and continued to walk toward the cottage the solitude hed welcomed on his first day pressed down on him now and became loneliness he shook it off and instead of going into the house he moved into the woods until mia talked to him he would learn what he needed to learn see what he needed to see by other means the dark was deep with a scatter of stars and a thin sickle of moon but there were other ways to see he tuned himself to the night he could hear the babble of a little stream and knew that wildflowers were sleeping on its banks there was the rustle of a small animal in the brush and the plaintive call of an owl one would feed the other would perish he smelled earth and water and knew there would be rain before morning and he felt power he moved through the dark through the trees as confidently as a man walks down main street on a sunny afternoon power pulsed along his skin that awakening thrill of magic he saw where there was only ground scattered with fallen leaves where the circle had been cast the three were strong when linked he thought hed felt that same trickle of energy on the beach and had known that a circle of power had been cast there but this one had come first and so he would look here first it would be simpler if theyd just tell me he said aloud but probably not as satisfying so he lifted his hands with palms up like cups ready to be filled show me i call to the three once and ever a part of me i use as my mirror the night to bring what transpired to my sight show me how and why this circle was cast that i might begin to complete my task grant this vision unto me as i will so mote it be the night thinned and billowed like a blowing curtain parted fear like a rabbit in a trap hate sharp as ravaging teeth and love wrapped warm in courage he saw what zack had told him saw nell racing through the woods and her thoughts were clear to him fear and grief for zack a desperation not only to escape what pursued her but to save the man she loved sams hands fisted as he saw remington leap at her angle the knife at her throat emotions pounded at him there was mia in a black dress scattered with silver stars and ripley holding a gun zack bleeding his own weapon pointed the night was alive with madness and terror the magic began to hum it pulsed from nell who glowed as she rejected her fears it shimmered around mia whose eyes gleamed as silver as the stars she wore and slowly almost reluctantly it sparked from ripley when she lowered her gun and clasped mias hand and then the circle burned like blue fire the punch of it caught sam unprepared and pushed him a full two paces back before he regained himself but hed lost his hold on the vision and it wavered faded the circles unbroken he lifted his face watched clouds stream across the stars you have to let me in mia or this was for nothing late into the night without plan without design he reached out to her in dreams floating back in time to when love was fresh and sweet and everything she was seventeen and leggy with hair a tumble of fire and eyes as warm as summer fog her beauty struck him as always a fist in the heart she laughed as she waded in the cove she wore trim khaki shorts and a brightblue top that left her arms and an inch of her midriff bare he could smell her over the scents of salt and sea he could smell that heady taunting fragrance that was mia dont you want to swim she laughed again as she splashed up water sadeyed sam what are you brooding about today im not brooding he had been his parents were freezing him out because hed chosen to work onisland that summer in the hotel rather than in new york hed been wondering if he was making a mistake a terrible mistake by being so desperate to stay onisland because of mia because the idea of being away from her month after month was both tantalizing and unthinkable yet he had begun to think it to wonder about it more and more every time he left the three sisters to go back to the mainland and college hed begun to consider testing himself by making some excuse not to come back to the island back to her some weekend during the semester every time he left the mainland on the ferry they pulled him back the island and mia now he was refusing to take the escape hatch that had been tailormade for him he needed to think it over again reconsider but when mia had come along to his beach hed been too crowded with lust and longing to brood or to think about being anywhere but with her if youre not brooding prove it she walked backward in the water so that it lapped at her calves her knees those long white thighs come in and play too old for games im not she slid into the water skimmed through it like a mermaid and when she surfaced water raining from her hair her shirt clinging seductively to her breasts he thought hed go mad but i forgot youre nearly nineteen too dignified to splash around in the water she did a surface dive and streaked through the dark blue water of the cove when he grabbed her ankle she kicked and came up laughing her laughter as always bewitched him ill give you dignity he said and dunked her it was innocent sun and water the bright beginning of summer the slippery edge between childhood and the future it couldnt stay innocent they splashed warred swam as sleekly as dolphins then came together as they always did lips meeting first under the surface then clinging when they burst through into air need rose with them strong and urgent so that she trembled as she wrapped herself around him her lips warm and wet parted for his with a trust and acceptance that shook him to the bone mia knowing that he would die wanting her he pressed his face into the wet ropes of her hair we have to stop lets go for a walk even as he spoke his hands were moving over her he couldnt help himself i dreamed last night she said softly cradled in his arms she sighed of you its always of you and when i woke i knew it would be today she dipped her head back and he all but fell into those great gray eyes i want to be with you and no one else i want to give myself to you and no one else his blood pounded for her he tried to think of right and wrong of tomorrow but could only think of now you have to be sure sam she traced kisses over his face ive always been sure she slid away from him but only to take his hand it was she who led him out of the water and to the cave tucked into the bluff the cave was cool and dry high enough at its heart for him to stand upright he saw the blanket spread near the far wall and the candles scattered over the floor and looked at her i told you i knew this is our place watching him she reached for the tiny buttons running down the front of her shirt and he saw her fingers tremble youre cold a little he stepped to her and afraid her lips curved a little but i wont be either for long ill be careful with you she let her hands fall to her sides so that he could finish unbuttoning her shirt i know i love you sam he lowered his lips to hers as he peeled the cotton away i love you the little niggle of fear inside her vanished i know hed touched her before and been touched glorious frustrating caresses too often hurried now as they undressed each other the candles flickered into life as they lowered to the blanket a thin film seemed to coat the mouth of the cave closing them in their mouths met sweet and hot even as her pleasure began to rise she sensed him holding back his fingers sometimes unsteady skimmed over her as if he feared she would vanish i wont leave you she murmured then gasped when his mouth suddenly urgent found her breast she arched beneath him hands stroking body as fluid as the water that scented it when he looked at her her hair damp and tumbled on the blanket her eyes clouded with what he brought her he shuddered with power and made her fly she cried out a long fullthroated sound that rippled through him and made him feel invincible when she opened for him offering him her innocence he trembled through the rage of blood the pound of need he struggled to be gentle still he saw the flicker of shock only for a minute delirious he ran kisses over her face i promise only for a minute then he surrendered to the demands of his body and took her her hands fisted on the blanket and she bit back the first cry but almost as soon as the pain began warmth replaced it oh her breath shuddered out again on a sigh of course she turned her lips to the side of his neck of course and began to move under him she rose and took him deeper fell and drew him with her when warmth simmered to heat their bodies grew slick clinging they took each other when she lay wrapped in his arms half dreaming the candlelight burned gold this is where she found him sam traced his fingers over her shoulders he couldnt stop touching her the lazy sexual haze clouded his mind so he forgot all hed thought of on the beach hmm the one who was fire the one whos mine this is where she found her silkie in human form and fell in love while he slept how do you know she started to say shed always known but shook her head instead she took his pelt and hid it away so she could keep him for love it couldnt be wrong when it was for love basking in the afterglow sam nuzzled her neck he wanted to be here with her he wanted nothing no one else never would never could now the realization steadied rather than unnerved him nothings wrong when its for love but she couldnt keep him mia said quietly years later after theyd had children after shed lost her sisters her circle he found his pelt he couldnt stop what he did it was his nature once hed found his pelt nothing not even love could make him stay he left her went into the sea and forgot she existed forgot his home and his children it makes you sad to think of it he held her tighter dont be sad now dont leave me she buried her face against his shoulder dont ever leave me i think id die as she died alone and heartbroken i wont but something went cold inside him im right here look he shifted so that they faced the cave wall lifting a finger he laid it on the stone light sparked from his fingertip and etched words into rock she read the gaelic and her eyes misted my heart is your heart ever and always she lifted her own finger carved a celtic knot beneath the words a promise of unity she turned those swimming eyes up to his and mines yours alone in her house on the cliff mia turned her face into her pillow and murmured his name in her sleep four the rain a steady drumming splatter began before morning it rode on a kicky little wind that had the tender green leaves shivering and foamed the surf throughout the day it continued to blow and spit until the air was raw with damp the sea as unremittingly gray as the sky it showed no signs of abating by evening it was good for the flowers mia told herself as she stood at the window and stared at the unbroken dullness of the gloom the earth needed a good soaking and despite the chill there would be no frost to damage delicate buds the first fine day she would take off work and spend hours gardening an entire precious day with no company and no demands but her flowers that was the beauty and privilege of owning her own business the occasional privilege helped balance out the weight of responsibility of business and of magic she had a dozen things to do in the store that day it didnt matter that shed slept poorly tossed in her dreams or that her mood was so low shed wanted nothing so much as to bury herself under the blankets the fact that shed considered it even briefly had been sufficiently appalling to get her up and out then shed forgotten and she never forgot anything that nell and ripley were coming to the house at least they were a distraction something to keep her mind off her memories and dreams unwelcome intruders into the disciplined order of her life hed snuck into her dreams the bastard would you rather do this another time mia what frowning she looked up blinked by the goddess she wasnt even paying attention to her distraction no no sorry the rains making me edgy right ripley slouched in her chair hooked a leg over its arm there was a bowl of popcorn in her lap and she popped pieces in her mouth quickly carelessly like its a weather pattern that got under your skin saying nothing mia walked to the sofa curled up tucking her bare feet under the spread of her skirt she flicked a finger at the stone fireplace across the room the logs burst into snapping sizzling flame there thats better she plumped one of her velvet pillows as if she had no concern other than her own comfort now nell what did you want to talk to me about before we discuss our plans for the solstice get her ripley gestured with her wineglass and dumped a neat fall of popcorn in her mouth with her free hand sounds like the chairwoman for some ladies social club not so far off club coven but anytime you want to take charge deputy fife okay nell held up a hand for peace it seemed she was always calling for peace when mia and ripley spent more than ten minutes together there were times when she thought it would be simpler to just knock their heads together why dont we move beyond the insult portion of our program i wanted to say that i thought the first meeting of the cooking club went well mia steadied her temper nodded she leaned over contemplated the glossy purple grapes shed arranged on a pale green dish selected one it did it was a terrific idea nell i think well find it brings business into the store and the café we sold a dozen cookbooks that night and a dozen more since i was thinking after we give it a couple of months to see if interest holds we might want to plan a combination event with the book club maybe around christmas i know thats a long way off but but it never hurts to plan mia finished and nipping into a second grape leveled a smirk in ripleys direction there are a number of novels that have food playing a major role and some even have recipes we might suggest one for the book club then the cooking club could prepare the dishes everybody has fun and you sell books ripley pointed out which oddly enough is the primary function of café book now theres something else mia paused lifted an eyebrow at nell all right nervous nell pressed her lips together i know selling books is the primary function but well i had this idea a while ago ive been playing with it in my head trying to see if it would work or be worthwhile you may think its out of line but oh for heavens sake nell out of patience ripley shifted in her chair and set the bowl of popcorn aside she thinks you should expand the café ripley would you just let me tell it my way i would but i dont have a week to spare before i get home expand the café mia interrupted it already takes up nearly half the square feet on the second level yes the way things are now after shooting ripley a hot look nell turned back to mia but if you took out the windows on the east side added a terrace of oh say six feet by ten feet used atrium or sliding doors leading out to it youd have more room for seating and the benefit of alfresco seating in good weather because mia said nothing just lifted her glass from the table nell rushed on i could extend the menu here and there adding more entrée selections for a nice casual dinner during the summer evening hours of course youd have to take on more help and and i should mind my own business i didnt say that mia leaned back but it is a complicated idea theres zoning and building codes then theres cost and the ratio of profit projection against that cost the potential loss of business during that kind of remodel ive um looked into it a little with a quick sheepish smile nell pulled a stack of papers out of her satchel mia stared then sat back with a long laugh youve been busy little sister all right let me look it all over think about it its intriguing she murmured more seating entrée selections i imagine if successful it would nip into the hotels dinner business at least during the season at mias small satisfied smile nell felt a wave of guilt theres one more thing we had sam logan over for dinner she blurted out mias smile slipped away excuse me you had that rat bastard at your table ripley popped out of her chair you fed him a meal did you at least poison him while you were at it no i didnt poison him damn it i didnt invite him zack did theyre friends nell sent mia a look filled with misery and guilt i cant tell zack who he can or cant invite to the house just let booke try asking some traitorous son of a bitch to leach off us ripley bared her teeth as if she was ready to take a bite out of her new husband whether he had the thought or not zack always was stupid now just a minute hes been my brother longer than hes been your husband ripley shot back i can call him stupid especially when he is theres no point in this mia said quietly and drew both nells and ripleys attention no point in casting blame or in recriminations zacks entitled to choose his friends and to have them in his home thats nothing nell should feel guilty over whats between sam and me is between sam and me and it doesnt affect anyone else doesnt it nell shook her head why didnt anyone tell me he was one of us because hes not it all but exploded out of ripley sam logan isnt one of us i dont think nell was implying hes a girl mia said dryly or even an islander though of course since he was raised here hell always be considered an islander she waved her hand as if brushing that aside the fact that he has the gift has nothing to do with us youre sure of that nell demanded we are the three in the stone hearth flames rose and snapped we make the circle its for us to do what must be done just because some what was that lovely term of ripleys oh yes just because some rat bastard has magic doesnt change anything deliberately calm she stretched out her hand for another grape now about the solstice she wouldnt let it change anything she would do what had to be done alone or with her sisters but she wouldnt allow anyone into their circle or into her heart in the deepest part of night while the island slept she stood on her cliffs the cold rain poured and the black sea lashed at the jagged rocks as if it would in one night wear them to nubs all around her the irritable wind swirled snapping at her cloak until it billowed up like wings there was no light no relief from the black except the single circling blade from the white tower behind her it cut over her the cliffs the sea then left her alone in the dark again fly the canny voice whispered fly out and let go and it will all be over why do you fight the inevitable why would you live with the loneliness how many times she wondered had she heard that voice how many times had she come here testing herself against it even when her heart had been shattered shed come and had won she would never give in you wont beat me she felt the cold as the dirty fog slithered over ground and rock felt it like icy fingers wrapping around her ankles where it could tug and tempt ill never give up she raised her arms spread them wide and the wild whirling wind she called tore the fog to tatters whats mine i serve and protect and keep she lifted her face to the rain let it wash over her like tears whether i wake or whether i sleep to what i am i will be true in what i say in what i do magic poured into her and pulsed like a heart this vow i make and will not break i will meet my destiny as i will so mote it be with her eyes closed she fisted her hands as if she could beat against the night as if she could use them to rip through the veil that blinded her from what would come for her why dont i know why cant i feel why cant i do anything but feel something shivered on the air like warm hands brushing her cheeks it wasnt comfort she wanted or the urges to be patient so she turned from them from the cliffs and the sea her cloak whipped behind her as she ran toward the lights of home while mia wrapped herself in isolation cocooned in the house on the cliff lulu was propped in bed with her third glass of wine her latest true crime book diary of an american cannibal and a bag of cheeseandgarlic potato chips across the room the bedroom tv blasted out gunfire as mel gibson and danny glover kicked ass in lethal weapon it was for lulu her saturdaynight ritual her nightclothes consisted of ratty shorts a tshirt that announced it was better to be rich than stupid and a book light fastened to a ball cap she munched sipped divided her attention between the book and the video and considered herself in her own personal heaven rain drummed outside the windows of her colorful little saltbox and the breeze rattled the love beads that dangled in lieu of curtains content marginally tipsy she sprawled under the spread shed quilted from squares of madras paisley and tiedyed scraps you could take the child out of the sixties but you couldnt take the sixties out of this child she often thought the words on the page began to blur so she adjusted her glasses boosted herself up in bed a little more she just wanted to finish one more chapter and find out if the young prostitute was going to be stupid enough to get her throat slit and her internal organs gutted lulu was banking on it but her head dipped she jerked it back up blinked she could have sworn she heard someone whisper her name hearing things she thought in disgust getting old was gods big ripoff she polished off the glass of wine glanced toward the tv and there was mel his pretty face filling the screen his eyes brilliantly blue as they grinned at her hey lu hows it going she rubbed her eyes blinked rapidly but the image was still there what the hell thats what i say what the hell the image drew back far enough for her to see the gun its barrel looked to be the size of a cannon nobody wants to live forever right the explosion boomed out of the set flashed hot red light into the room the sharp pain in lulus chest had her crying out frantically pressing her hands between her breasts chips flew as she scrambled up looking for blood she found nothing but her own wildly beating heart on the screen mel and danny were arguing about police procedure shaken and feeling like an old fool lulu staggered to the window a little fresh air she thought clear her head mustve fallen asleep for a minute she decided as she pushed the rattling beads aside and shoved her window all the way up she shivered it was cold as winter colder she realized than it should have been and the mists swirling out of the ground had an odd tone to them like floating bruises all dull purples and sickly yellows she could see her calliope of flowers and the moonball rising up through them her rude little gargoyle who stuck his tongue out of a grinning mouth at passersby the rain sounded icy now and when she reached out the window cold sharp shards of it stabbed into her palm her glasses slid down as she jerked her hand back and when she shoved them back into place shed have sworn the gargoyle was closer to the house turned so that instead of his profile she could see threequarters of the homely face her chest began to hurt from the racing of her heart need new glasses she thought eyes are going as she stared frozen in shock the gargoyle swiveled to face her and bared long vicious teeth jesus h christ she could hear them actually hear the greedy snap of them as he inched through the fog toward the house toward the open window behind him the little fluteplaying frog shed bought the week before began to hop closer and the flute he held was now a long jaggededged knife nobody will care reeling she snapped her head around on tv a huge cartoon snake with mel gibsons handsome face leered at her nobody will give two good shits if youre dead youve got nobody do you lu no man no kid no family nobody to give a rats ass about you thats bull terror screamed through her as she saw that the gargoyle and his companion had come within a foot of the house while she was looking away teeth snapped a hungry sound and the knife swished through the thick fog like a deadly metronome thats just horseshit her shaking hands fumbled at the window her breath panting out in puffs as she fought to find a grip on the sash as she slammed it down she fell backward and hit the floor with a jar of her bones she lay there struggling to catch her breath struggling to find her nerve when she managed to get to her knees she crawled whimpering toward her sewing basket and grabbed two knitting needles as weapons but when she managed to find the courage to go back to the window the rain was falling warm and gentle the mists had cleared and the gargoyle homely and harmless squatted in its usual spot ready to insult the next visitor lulu stood in the bedroom while another firefight broke out on television she rubbed her hand over her clammy face that mustve been some bottle of chardonnay she said aloud but for the first time since shed moved into the little house she armed with her needles walked through it locking all the doors and windows a man however dedicated was entitled to some time off thats what sam told himself as he drove away from the village hed spent hours at his desk in meetings doing inspections reading reports if he didnt clear his mind it was going to fry and it was sunday the rain had finally blown out to sea leaving the island sparkling like a jewel getting out seeing what on this little clump of land had changed and what hadnt was as important to his business as ledgers and projections that sensibility he knew had skipped a generation in the logan family hed always been aware that his parents had viewed the twentyodd years theyd spent on three sisters as a kind of exile which he imagined was why theyd found excuses to leave it so often during that period and then to pull up stakes permanently when his grandfather had died it had never been home for them coming back had proved that to him just as it had proved the island was home for him one answer hed come back to find was clear to him now three sisters was his pleasure boats were skimming along the water motors humming or sails fat with wind it brought him a steadying kind of pleasure to see them buoys bobbed orange red white against the cool blue surface the land jutted or curved or tumbled out to meet the water he saw a family clamming and a young boy chasing gulls there were houses that hadnt been there when hed left and the time between came home to him as he noticed the weathered silver of cedar and the thick clumps of vegetation growth he thought mans and natures time didnt stand still not even on three sisters as he approached the north point of the island he turned onto a narrow shale road listened to his wheels crunch the last time hed driven this stretch hed had a jeep with its top off so the air had streamed over him and his radio had been going full blast he had to smile at himself as he realized that while he might be in a ferrari he had still put the top down and turned the stereo up to scream you can take the boy off the island he murmured then pulled off the side of the road opposite the bluffs and the house that rose from them the house hadnt changed he decided and wondered how long it would take the islanders to stop referring to it as the logan place two stories it rambled over the bluff jutting out shooting up as if on its own whim someone had recently painted its shutters a dark blue to contrast with the silvered wood the screened porch and the open decks offered stunning views of the cove and the sea the windows were wide the doors glass he remembered that his room had faced the water and how much time hed spent staring out at it how often its changing and unpredictable moods had reflected his own the sea had always spoken to him still the house didnt bring him any tug of sentiment or any lovely haze of nostalgia the islanders could call it the logan place for another decade but it had never been sams it was in his opinion a good property in a prime location that had been well maintained by its absentee owners he hoped the man who owned the land rover parked outside it felt hed gotten his moneys worth dr macallister booke sam thought now of the new york bookes a man with a brilliant mind and an unusual bent paranormal science fascinating he wondered if booke had felt like a round peg in the square hole of his family as he himself had sam got out of his car walked toward the bluff it wasnt the house that called him but the cove and the cave it pleased him more than hed expected to see a brightyellow sailboat tied to the dock below and it was a honey he mused studying its lines hed had a boat tied there too for as long as he could remember for that at least he felt the tug the soft haze sailing had been the single real interest that father and son had shared the best times hed had with thaddeus logan the only times there had ever been that click of kinship between them sam remembered had been when they were sailing theyd actually communicated connected during those hours on the water not just as two people who happened through circumstance to occupy places in the same family the same house but as father and son who shared a common interest it was good to remember that pretty isnt she i just got her last month sam turned and through the lenses of his shaded glasses watched the man who had spoken walk toward him dressed in faded jeans and a gray sweatshirt ragged at the hem he was tall with a strong lean face shadowed by a nights growth of beard dark blond hair blew in the frisky breeze and friendly brown eyes squinted against the flash of sunlight he had a tough disciplined build that sam could admit he hadnt expected from a scholarly spook hunter hed imagined a thin pale and nerdish bookworm instead he thought amused with himself he was getting indiana jones hows she handle in the rough sam asked oh like a charm they spent a few minutes thumbs tucked in front pockets admiring and talking about the boat im mac booke mac held out a hand sam logan thought so thanks for the house it wasnt mine but youre welcome come on inside have a beer he hadnt intended to socialize but the offer was so easy and unstudied that sam found himself heading toward the house with mac ripley around no shes on duty this afternoon did you want to see her about something absolutely not mac only laughed and after they climbed the steps to the main deck opened the door i guess that feelings going to be mutual for a while until it all settles in the deck led into the living room sam remembered it as being polished full of pastels and pale watercolors time hadnt stood still here either he mused the colors were bold and bright the furnishings tailored for comfort there were homey untidy piles of newspapers books shoes one of which a busy puppy was currently gnawing damn it mac leaped in tripped over the unmauled mate of the sneaker and made a grab for the other the pup was faster and with the shoe in his mouth he scrambled for cover mulder give me that sam angled his head as man and pup went into a little tugofwar the pup lost but didnt look put out by it mulder sam asked yeah you know xfiles guy ripley said she named him after me her little joke he heaved out a breath shes not going to think its a joke when she sees her shoe sam crouched and the pup thrilled at the prospect of company raced over to leap and lick pretty dog golden retriever yeah weve only had him three weeks hes smart and mostly housebroken but hell chew through rock if you dont watch him which i wasnt sighing mac scooped the pup up and went nose to nose you know whos going to take the heat for this dont you the puppy wriggled in delight and licked macs chin giving up on the lecture mac tucked mulder under his arm beers in the kitchen he led the way back got two bottles out of the fridge on the table sat a number of electronic devices one of which seemed to be gutted idly sam reached over to pick one up and set off a series of beeps and blinking red lights sorry no problem macs eyes narrowed a speculative look why dont we take these out on the deck unless you want to look around you know the old homestead and whatever no thanks anyway but as they started back out sam glanced toward the stairs imagined his room as it had been and himself watching the sea or watching for mia out the window from the second floor a new beep sounded equipment mac said easily and had to squelch the urge to dash upstairs and check readings ive got my lab set up in one of the extra bedrooms hmmm once outside mac set mulder down and he immediately bounded down the steps and began to sniff along the yard anyway mac took a swig of beer leaned on the rail ripley didnt mention that you were a witch sam opened his mouth closed it again then just shook his head what am i wearing a sign energy readings mac gestured toward the house and actually id wondered about it as ive done a lot of research on the island the families the bloodlines and so on did you practice in new york depends on your definition it wasnt often that sam found himself being studied like a science experiment or that he would have allowed it but something about mac appealed to him ive never neglected the craft but i dont advertise either makes sense so what do you think of the legend ive never considered it a legend its history and fact exactly delighted mac lifted his bottle in a kind of toast ive done a time line projecting the spin you might say of the cycle by my calculations we have until september sam interrupted no later than the equinox mac nodded slowly well bingo welcome home sam thanks he sipped his beer its good to be back are you going to be open to working with me itd be stupid to turn down the input of an expert ive read your books yeah you have an open and flexible mind someone else said that to me once mac thought of mia but was tactful enough not to mention her name can i ask you a personal question yes as long as i can tell you to mind your own business as an answer deal if you knew september was a kind of deadline why did you wait so long to come back sam turned his head looked out on the cove it wasnt my time this is now let me ask you one in your expert opinion with your research your calculations your projections am i necessary to the three sisters im still working on that i do know youre part of whats necessary to mias role in it the third step her acceptance of me when mac frowned drummed his fingers on the deck rail sam felt unease slither into his belly you dont agree her choice when it comes has to do with her own feelings accepting them and whats right for her that might mean accepting you or it might mean resolving her emotions by rejecting you without malice mac cleared his throat the last step has to do with love im fully aware of that it doesnt require her to it doesnt mean in my opinion that shell be obliged to love you now but that she accepts what she once felt and that it wasnt meant to well let you go without resentment and cherish what used to be anyway its a theory the hem of sams coat snapped in a stray gust of wind i dont like your theory i wouldnt like it either from where youre standing the third sister killed herself rather than face her lovers desertion her circle was broken and she was alone i know the goddamn story just hear me out even then she protected the island and her bloodline and the line of her sisters as far as she could with what she had left but she couldnt or wouldnt save herself couldnt or wouldnt live without the love of one man that was her weakness and her mistake it was direct enough to follow it was logical it was maddening and mias lived without me very well on one level mac agreed on another and in my opinion shes never resolved her feelings never forgiven you or accepted shell have to one way or the other and with a whole heart if she doesnt shell be vulnerable and as the protective spell weakens shell lose and if id stayed away the logical conclusion is you werent meant to stay away and the presence of more magic on the island well it cant hurt hed never thought it could but his conversation with mac had put doubts in his mind hed come back to the island with no questions about what needed to be and would be done he would win mia again and once things were as they had been between them the curse would be broken end of story end of story he thought now as he walked the beach by the cove because he hadnt wanted to look beyond it he wanted mia was ready for mia and that was that hed never once entertained the notion that her not wanting him not loving him might be the answer he looked toward the mouth of the cave maybe it was time to explore that possibility and face his ghosts as he walked toward the cave his heart beat too fast he stopped waiting until hed controlled it then ducked into the caves shadows for a moment it was filled with sound their voices her laughter the sighs of lovers and of weeping shed come here to cry for him knowing it feeling it sliced him with sharp stabs of guilt he willed them clear then stood in the silence with only the backdrop of the surf lapping at the shore when hed been a boy the cave had been aladdins or a bandits hideout or whatever he and zack and other friends had made it then hed no longer been a boy or not quite a boy and it had been mia his legs felt weak as he moved to the far wall knelt and saw the words hed carved for her she hadnt scored them out until that moment until a fist released its squeezing grip on his heart he hadnt realized hed been afraid she might that she could and if she could that her heart would be lost to him ever and always he reached out and light filled the words seemed to drip from them like tears of gold he felt in that light everything the boy had felt when hed carved them with magic and utter faith it rocked him staggered him that there had been so much bursting inside that boy that the man he was could still reel from it and ache for it the power was still there why would it be if it meant nothing was it only his will his wish that brought back to life what had been theyd loved here so wrapped up in each other that the world could have ended without them knowing or caring theyd shared bodies and hearts and magic he could see her now rising above him her hair like wildfire and her skin golden her arms lifted as she rode them both past reason or curled against him in sleep with her mouth curved in contentment or sitting close while they talked her face alight with excitement so full of plans so young was it his fate to let her go before he had her again to be forgiven then forgotten the idea stabbed at him left him shaken as he got to his feet unable to bear the press of memories any longer he turned away from them and walked out of the cave into the sunlight a flash like fire where she stood with her back to the sea five for a moment he could only look at her as old memories and old needs tangled with new time hadnt stood still for them she wasnt the coltish young girl who would splash headlong into the water with a dare the woman who watched him now with cool measuring eyes had a layer of polish and sophistication the girl had lacked the breeze had her hair dancing in fiery spirals that at least hadnt changed she waited with every appearance of calm as he walked to her but he neither saw nor felt any welcome i wondered how long it would take you to come here her voice was low as measured as her gaze i wasnt sure youd have the nerve it was difficult horribly to speak rationally when the emotions and images from the cave still churned inside him do you ever come back here why would i if i want to look at the ocean i can stand on my own cliffs if i want the beach its a short walk from my store theres nothing here to warrant the trip but youre here now curiosity her head tilted to the side the dark blue stones at her ears caught the light and glinted and did you satisfy your own i felt you in there felt us in there it surprised him when her lips curved almost affectionately sex has strong energy when its done correctly we never had a problem in that area as for me well a woman has a certain sentimental vision of the first time she gave herself to a man i can remember that particular event fondly even if i came to regret my choice of partner i never meant to he broke off swore to hurt me she finished liar youre right absolutely whatever came from this point on if he was indeed fated to lose her he could and would be honest about this one thing i did mean to hurt you and id say i did a damn good job of it well you surprise me at last she turned away because it hurt to look at him to see him stand there with his back to the shadowed mouth of the cave that had been theirs to feel the echoes of that boundless consuming love shed once felt for him a clear truth after all these years meaning to do something at twenty doesnt mean i cant and dont regret it now i dont want your regrets what the hell do you want mia she watched the water tease the shore in its endless flirtation she heard the edge in his voice knew it as a sign of a rising and reckless mood and it pleased her the more unsettled he was the more she could feel in control a truth for a truth then she said i want you to suffer to pay and to go back to new york or to hell or wherever you choose so long as it isnt here she looked back over her shoulder at him and her smile was cold as winter it seems so little to ask really i mean to stay on three sisters she turned back to him he looked dramatic she thought romantic dark and broody full of anger and turmoil because of it she indulged herself and gave him yet another push for what to run a hotel your father managed to run it for years without being here im not my father the way he said it that small verbal explosion triggered more memories hed always had to prove himself to himself she thought the constant internal war of samuel logan she shrugged well in any case i imagine youll be bored with island life soon enough and escape as you did before trapped i believe was your term you felt trapped here so its just a matter of waiting you out youll have a long wait he warned he hooked his hands in his pockets lets get something straight so we can avoid going around the same loop again and again i have roots here just as you do the fact that you spent your twenties onisland and i didnt doesnt change the fact that we both come from the same place we both have businesses here and beyond that we have a purpose one that goes back centuries what happens on and to three sisters matters to me as much as it matters to you an interesting speech from someone who walked away so casually there was nothing casual about it he began but she had already turned her back on him was already striding toward the bluff let her go his mind ordered just let her go if this is fate it cant be beaten shouldnt be for the good of the whole fought against the hell with that the words ground between his teeth as he went after her he grabbed her arm spun her around so quickly their bodies collided there was nothing casual about it he repeated nothing impulsive nothing careless is that how you justify it she tossed back is that how you make it right you left because it suited you and you come back because it suits you and because youre here why not see if you can stir up some old flames ive been pretty restrained in that area he yanked his sunglasses off threw them on the ground his gaze was burning blistering green up till now he crushed his mouth to hers let himself take let the storm of emotions that had shadowed him since he left the cave break over both of them if he was to be damned hed be damned for taking what he wanted not for letting it go the unique flavor of her seared through him sizzling the nerves smoking the senses his arms tightened so that her long lean body was molded to his and against his heart her heart kicked and galloped until the paces matched exactly the scent of her darker than he remembered and somehow forbidding slithered into him twining through his system until it was tied in knots the memories of the girl the reality of the woman both blurred together and became one became mia he said her name once his lips moving against hers then she broke free her breathing was as uneven as his and her eyes were huge dark unreadable he waited to be cursed and counted it worth the price of that one taste of heaven but she moved to him in one quick stride locking her arms around his neck pressing her body to his she took from him as he had taken from her her mouth was a fever and the ache of it throbbed through her he was the only man whod ever brought her pain and the only man whod ever brought her true pleasure both edges of that keen sword stabbed and still she took she had pushed him plucked at the ragged threads of his temper with one underlying purpose this just this whatever the risks whatever the price shed had to know she remembered the taste of him the texture the way it felt when his hands slid up from her waist to fist in her hair she relived all of that now and experienced the new he nipped her bottom lip just one quick bite before his tongue slicked over the same spot to soothe and to entice she changed the angle of the kiss daring him to follow to circle the slippery rim of that well of need someone trembled she wasnt sure who but it was enough to remind her that a misstep could lead to a tumble and the fall was long she drew back then away as the reverberations of that mating of mouths tossed her emotions so she knew he was still the only one who could meet and match her passions his voice was hoarse and far from steady when he spoke that proves something it helped somehow knowing he was as undone as she proves what sam that we still have heat between us she waved her hand and a duet of clear blue flames danced on her palm fire is easily lit she curled her fingers opened them again and her palm was empty easily extinguished not so easily he took her hand felt the pump of energy and knew she felt it too not so easily mia wanting you with my body means so very little she drew her hand from his looked toward the cave it makes me sad to be here to remember how much more we both expected of each other and ourselves once dont you believe in fresh starts he reached out to touch her hair weve both changed why not take the time to get to know each other again you just want to get me into bed oh yeah that goes without saying she laughed surprising them both more honesty soon ill be speechless id seduce you eventually but seductions overrated she interrupted im not a jittery virgin if i decide to sleep with you then ill sleep with you he blew out a breath well then it so happens i have an entire hotel at my disposal if is the key word she said mildly on the occasion if becomes when ill let you know ill stay available to give himself a moment to steady he bent down to pick up his sunglasses but what i was going to say was that while id seduce you eventually ill settle for a friendly dinner im not interested in dating you she turned to walk back up the bluff to the road and he fell into step beside her a civilized meal intelligent conversation that chance to see who we are if you dont like calling it a date we can call it a meeting of two of the islands prominent business owners semantics dont change reality she stopped beside her car ill think about it good he opened the car door for her but blocked her from getting in mia stay with me he wanted to say ive missed you what he shook his head stepped back drive safe she went straight home ruthlessly keeping her mind turned off as she changed into gardening clothes her large black cat isis ribboned between her legs as she headed outside in her greenhouse she babied and fussed over her seedlings selected flats to set out in the sun to help them harden off before planting later in the month she gathered tools and set to work prepping soil her daffodils were already up and dancing and the hyacinths perfumed the air warm weather was beginning to tease her tulips open and soon she imagined theyd be parading in their candy colors she had manipulated him into kissing her mia admitted as she turned the earth once a woman knew a mans buttons she didnt forget where to push shed wanted him to hold her shed wanted to feel his mouth on hers it wasnt a crime or a sin or even a mistake she thought now shed had to know and now she did there was still a charge between them she couldnt claim it surprised her between the last kiss and this no man had truly moved her thered been a time when shed wondered if that part of her had simply died off but the years had coated the wound and she had recognized even appreciated her own sexuality there had been others interesting men amusing men attractive men but none who tripped that switch inside her opened her to that rush of feeling shed learned to be content without it until now and now what she wondered studying the wisteria just greening that scrambled over one of her arbors now she wanted and had tested and believed needed to believe that she could take her pleasure on her own terms and protect her heart she was human wasnt she and entitled to basic human needs this time she would be careful she would be calculating and in control better always to face a dilemma headon than to turn your back on what wouldnt be ignored her wind chimes jingled and the tune struck her as faintly mocking she glanced over to where isis lay sprawled in the sun watching her and what would happen if i let him drive this train mia demanded i wouldnt be sure of the destination would i but if i choose the track i choose the station the cat made a sound between a purr and a growl so you say mia muttered i know exactly what im doing and i believe i will have dinner with him here on my turf she stabbed her garden spade into the soil when im damn good and ready isis rose stuck her tail meaningfully in the air then stalked over to watch the fish swim in gold flashes in the lily pond for the next few days mia had too much to do to think about critical cats or having dinner with sam or potentially taking him to her bed lulu was distracted and cranky crankier than normal mia corrected theyd squabbled twice over petty bookstore business which forced mia to admit she was a bit cranky herself in any case nells expansion proposal had lighted a fire under her and provided her with an outlet for the energy that had pumped through her since the moment on the bluff with sam she met with an architect with a contractor with her banker and spent several hours running figures it didnt please her that the contractor she wanted had already committed the bulk of his time over the next few months to sam and his renovation of guest rooms at the magick inn but she tried to take it philosophically sam had damn it gotten there first both the renovation and her expansion she reminded herself were good for the island as the weather continued warm she spent her free time in the gardens at home and in the beds shed planted behind the bookstore hey ripley wandered to the back garden of the store from the road looks nice she commented scanning yes it does mia continued to plant the moons been warm and yellow all week we wont have another frost ripley pursed her lips do you make that stuff up im setting in my cosmos arent i whatever that means macs got this itch to plant some stuff around the house hes been researching the soil and the local flora and blah blah i told him he should just ask you hes welcome to hes going to be coming into the village sometime soon to interview lulu for his books and stuff he can catch you then all right i had the weirdest dream about lu the other night something to do with mel gibson and frogs mia paused looked up again frogs not your lily pad variety a big spooky frog ripley furrowed her brow but could bring the dream back only in vague and disjointed pieces something about the stupid gargoyle thing of hers too weird she said again lulu might be interested if mel was naked yeah well anyway ripley stuck her hands in her pockets shifted her feet anyway i guess you know logan came over to the house a few days ago yes mia said a mental charm as she set a plant its natural hed want to see the house again maybe so but that doesnt mean mac should let him inside and give him a damn beer believe me i skinned him over that one ripley theres no reason mac shouldve been rude and no way his nature would allow him to be yeah yeah which was she thought just where her argument with him had ended up but i dont have to like it hes got this whole mumbo about sams place in the destiny deal and your step toward holding the circle intact mias stomach clutched but her hands remained steady as she selected another plant ive never considered macs theories or opinions mumbo you dont live with him but on a sigh ripley crouched down beside mia there was a time not so long before when such a gesture would have come hard to her it still took her a moment to find what she wanted to say and how she wanted to say it okay macs stupendously smart and hes thorough and nine times out of ten hes right which is really irritating in the daytoday course of things youre crazy about him mia murmured well sure sexiest geek on the planet and all mine but even the amazing dr booke has to miss sometime i just want to say i dont figure sam logan has to have anything to do with anything succinct and sentimental well why the hell should he ripley lifted her hands let them fall in frustration you two had a thing when you were practically kids still and it cut you up when he ended it but youve been handling the way he came back going about your business and pretty much keeping your distance youve blown him off and lightning hasnt shot out of the sky im going to sleep with him so i say chances are hes irrelevant to your part of the what what ripleys mouth dropped open as she goggled sweet jesus christ even as mias lips twitched ripley leaped to her feet and headed into a fullblown rant what are you thinking have you lost your mind sleep with him youre going to give the guy sex as a reward for dumping you all amusement fled carefully tugging off her gloves mia got slowly to her feet im thinking im an adult and capable of making my own decisions that im a single healthy thirtyyearold woman who is free to have a physical relationship with a single healthy man its not a man its logan perhaps you could shout just a little louder i dont believe mrs bigelow across the street heard you clearly ripley set her teeth rocked back on her heels i gave you too much credit i see that i figured youd kick his ass one way or the other then dust your hands off and walk away i dont know why i thought you had it in you you never did what does that mean just what i said you want to cozy up with sam go right ahead dont look for me to pick up the pieces when he breaks you again mia bent to set down her garden trowel even a controlled and civilized woman had to take care when she had a weapon in her hand you neednt worry ive had experience in that area with you you cut me off every bit as coldly as completely as he did cut yourself off for ten years from the gift we share and all its joys and responsibilities yet i still manage to join hands with you when its necessary i didnt have a choice convenient isnt it how when one devastates another its always because there wasnt a choice i couldnt help you you couldve been there i needed you to be there mia said quietly and turned to go i couldnt ripley took her arm wrapped her fingers tight its his goddamn fault when he left you all you did was bleed and i what ripley dropped her hand i dont want to get into all this you kicked in the door deputy have the guts to step through it fine great she paced away paced back temper still stained her cheeks but her eyes were bleak you walked around like a zombie for weeks barely functioning like somebody who hadnt quite recovered and never would from some horrible illness it probably came from having my heart ripped out i know it because i felt it too fisting a hand ripley tapped it on her chest i felt what you felt i couldnt sleep i couldnt eat i could barely get out of bed most days it was like dying from the inside out if youre talking about complete empathy ive never mia stammered i dont know what you call it ripley snapped i experienced physically what you experienced and i couldnt stand it i wanted to do something wanted you to do something pay him back make him hurt and the longer it went on the more angry i got if i was mad it didnt hurt as much i couldnt think past the fury she drew a breath i was standing outside behind the house zack had just come in from a sail minutes before and all this rage just rose up i thought about what i wanted to do what i could do it was inside me to do it i pulled lightning out of the sky a black bolt and it struck the boat where zack had just been a few minutes earlier and i might have killed him i couldnt control it ripley shaken appalled mia reached out to touch her arm it must have terrified you a few giant steps beyond terrified i wish youd talked to me i couldve helped mia you couldnt even help yourself sighing as the weight slid off her shoulders ripley shook her head and i couldnt take the chance of hurting someone i couldnt handle the i dont know the intimacy of my link with you i knew if i told you youd talk me out of giving up the craft i saw only one way out and that was to pull back from you from all of it before i did something i couldnt take back i was furious with you mia countered yeah ripley sniffled but she was only marginally embarrassed i got mad back and it got easier maybe more comfortable for me to be at odds with you than it had been to be your friend maybe it got easier for me too it was difficult to admit after all the years when casting blame had helped soothe the hurt sam was gone but you were still here needling you whenever possible was some small satisfaction you were really good at it well with a little laugh mia brushed back her hair just one of my little gifts i always loved you even when i called you nasty names tears threatened a stone that had been in her heart for so long dissolved in an instant she took the two steps that separated them slid her arms around ripleys waist and held on held tight okay mias voice caught ripley patted her back okay ive missed you so much so much i know me too she let out an unsteady breath then blinked when she saw nell standing just outside the door crying silently sorry i came out in the middle of that and well by the time id decided whether i should mediate or just slip back inside i was caught up she handed tissues all around id apologize for eavesdropping but im just so happy what a trio ripley sniffled now im going to finish my rounds with red eyes its embarrassing for heavens sake do a glamour and get rid of them mia finished wiping her eyes then closed them murmured a chant when she opened them again they were sparkling and clear always the showoff ripley muttered i still cant do it that quickly nell began do you think if i lets not get into a damn coven here ripley waved a hand since youre here nell i need some weight get this mias going to shag sam you have such a way with words mia said it never fails to impress me the point is whatever you call it its a mistake ripley gave nell a little poke on the arm tell her its none of my business copout ripley stated with a sneer to spare you from the insults and from biting your own tongue ill ask for your opinion mia raised her eyebrows if you have one on the subject my opinion is its your decision and if nell continued over ripleys snort youre considering going to bed with him then youre still attracted enough for it to be an issue you dont do things on impulse or recklessly it seems to me that until you either get sam out of your system or resolve your feelings youll be conflicted and unsettled thank you now im not quite finished nell told mia then cleared her throat physical intimacy will resolve only one level of your conflict and probably the easiest one what happens after will depend on whether you open yourself or close yourself thatll be your decision too im considering it finishing up old business until i do i cant know clearly what step it is im meant to take then just look ripley said impatiently you were always a whiz with visions do you think i havent tried some of the pentup frustration snapped out i cant see my own i see her standing on the cliffs with the storm raging the fog creeping i feel her strength and her despair and in that instant before she jumps she seems to reach out to me i cant tell if its to pass that last link to me or to pull me over with her her eyes blurred and the air thickened then im alone and i feel the dark pressing in close tight and so cold it seems the night should crack from it i know if i can get to the forest to the clearing and the heart of the island well make the circle and that dark will break apart once and for all but i dont know how to get there you will nell took her hand she was alone you arent and never will be we havent come this far to lose now ripley took her other hand no mia drew strength from the circle she needed it for even there in the sunlight with her sisters beside her she felt alone in the dark six amist blanketed the island as thin and luminous as the skin of a pearl trees and rocks rose up from it humps and towers in a soft white sea mia left the house early on the slope of her lawn she stood for a moment absorbing the serenity the stillness that was the sisters on a lovely spring morning her spread of forsythia was a golden fan of color through the morning fog her daffodils a band of sunny trumpets she could smell her hyacinths damp and sweet it seemed to her that the earth was waiting to awaken to throw off all memories of winter and burst into life she could appreciate the sleepy before as much as she would the beauty of what was to come she opened her car her satchel of paperwork on the seat beside her and started down the long and curving road to the village there were several routine chores to deal with before the store opened she enjoyed that too the relative quiet the repetition the freshening of stock as much as she did the business hours with customers breezing in and out lingering browsing and of course buying she loved being surrounded by books uncarting them shelving them designing displays she loved the smell and the texture and the look of them and the surprises uncovered when she flipped one open at random and saw the play of words on paper the bookstore was more than a business to her it was a deep and steady love but she never forgot it was a business one she ran efficiently and profitably shed come from money and as a result had never had to work for a living shed had to work for her own gratification her own sense of ethics her financial base had allowed her to choose the course of her career and establish a business that reflected her interests those ethics and her own skills effort and shrewdness had made the business flourish she was grateful and always would be for the devlin money but it was to her mind much more exciting and satisfying to make her own and to risk her own that was precisely what she would be doing by following through with nells idea expanding the café would change things as much as mia trusted and respected tradition and continuity she was also a proponent of change as long as the change was smart and this one she thought as she wound her way through the mist could be expanding the café could mean tucking in a more appealing and roomier event area her monthly book club was popular on the island and the new cooking club already showed potential the trick would be to make the best use of space and still maintain the intimacy the store was known for but since nell had planted the seed in her mind the idea had taken hold mia could see exactly what she wanted and how it would be when it came to café book she knew precisely what she was doing too bad she wasnt quite as confident at the moment about the rest of her life it was as if a curtain had been lowered dead center of her vision she could see peripherally but straight ahead was blocked it worried her more than she was willing to admit behind the curtain were choices she understood that but how could she make the right one if she didnt know the options waiting for her one of the choices was sam logan but to what extent did she trust her instincts there weighing them with logic and past history balancing them against a primal sexual attraction that tended to cloud logic a misstep with him could crush her a second time she might not survive it whole more the wrong choice could doom the island she loved and was sworn to protect once another woman had chosen death rather than bear the pain of loneliness and heartbreak she had flung herself into the sea after the lover who had deserted her and had woven the last threads of the web about three sisters hadnt she herself by choosing to live to find contentment even to flourish already countered that act nell had chosen courage and ripley true justice and so their circle held and she had chosen life perhaps the curse had already been broken and the dark that hovered in wait around the island had already been banished even as the thought and the hope of it ran through her mind the mist boiled up from the roadbed a jagged lance of lightning crashed beside her car with an explosion of dirty red light and the stink of ozone in the center of the road an enormous black wolf snarled instinctively she slammed on the brakes jerked the wheel the car skidded spun giving her a dizzying view of rocks fog and the dull glint of the guardrail that stood between the narrow edge of road and the sheer drop to the sea fighting back the panic that gushed into her throat she yanked the wheel again the eyes of the wolf glowed like embers and its teeth were long on its muzzle was a white pentagram sliced through the black hide like a scar her mark and her heart slammed painfully against her ribs at the sight of it through the roar of blood in her head over the scream of her own tires she felt the cold of its breath on the back of her neck she heard the sly coaxing voice whispering whispering in her mind let go just let go and you wont be alone its so hard to be alone tears blurred her vision for a moment her arms went weak trembling as the urge to let it end nudged at her will in that moment she saw herself quite clearly flying over the edge of the cliff she bore down even as she struggled to control the car and pulled her power up from the gut go back to hell you son of a bitch as the wolf threw back its head to howl she spun the car forward punched the gas and drove through it she felt the shock not from impact but from the explosion of greed that pounded the air as her car rammed through the image the fog lifted and the mist thin and pearly in the strengthening sun sparkled over three sisters mia pulled over to the side of the road laid her forehead on the wheel and gave in to the shakes her own breathing was too loud in the closed car so she fumbled for the window control the cool damp air and the steady chant of the sea revived her still she closed her eyes made herself sit back until she began to calm again well i guess that answers my question about this being over and done she inhaled exhaled slowly until her chest no longer hitched with every breath then opening her eyes she scanned the road behind her in the rearview mirror her tires had left wild sinuous trails over the pavement trails she noted with one quick shudder that had veered perilously close to the edge the wolf was gone and the mist was already as sheer as gauze an obvious ploy she said aloud for herself and whatever listened black wolf red eyes obvious and clichéd and she thought very very effective but hed borne her mark the mark shed put on him when hed worn another form he hadnt been able to disguise it and that gave her some comfort muchneeded comfort she admitted for the ambush had very nearly succeeded she eased the car back on the road and her hands had almost stopped trembling by the time she parked her car in front of café book hed been waiting for her it had been easy enough to time his arrival at the hotel to match hers at the store she wasnt like clockwork sam mused as he strolled across the street but sometime between eightfortyfive and ninefifteen she parked her pretty little car and unlocked the store she wore one of her long thin dresses today the kind of dress that made a man want to offer thanks to the gods of spring it was a soft pale blue the color of quiet pools and skimmed fluid as water down her body she wore sexy highheeled sandals hardly more than a series of buffcolored straps and a long thin spike hed had no idea shoes could make the mouth water shed tied her hair back his only complaint about her appearance that morning he liked it best wild and loose but the binding did leave an intriguing spill of red down the center of her back hed like to lay his lips there beneath the spill of hair beneath the soft thin dress and onto the smooth skin at the center of her back good morning gorgeous she jerked when he spoke and turned away from the door his opening grin faded instantly and his eyes went dark at the shock still mirrored in hers what is it what happened i dont know what youre talking about damn it her hands were going to shake again you startled me she angled her body enough to hide the tremor in her hand as she unlocked the door sorry sam no time for a neighborly chat i have work dont pull that on me he moved through the door with her before she could attempt to shut it and lock it in his face i know you no you dont her voice wanted to rise and she refused to allow it as casually as possible she set her satchel on the front counter you dont know me i know when youre upset christ mia youre shaking your hands are like ice he said as he snatched one and held it between his own tell me what happened its nothing shed thought she was calm shed thought she was steady again but her legs wanted to give pride made her lock them stiff damn it let me go he nearly did no he decided moving closer i did that once lets try something new he scooped her off her feet what the hell do you think youre doing youre cold and shaking you need to sit down put on a little weight havent you she sent him one withering look oh really it looks good on you he carried her to the sofa set her down he pulled the bright throw off the back and tucked it around her now tell me dont sit on the she bit off a sigh because hed already lowered himself to the coffee table facing her i see you never have figured out the difference between a table and a chair theyre both in the furniture family there youve got some color coming back good thing i came along to annoy you just my lucky day he took her hand again warming it in his what scared you baby dont call me that he had only used that term she remembered when he was being particularly sweet she let her head rest back against the cushions its just i had a near miss on the drive down a dog jumped out in the road the roads were damp with the mist and i skidded his grip tightened on hers i dont think so why would i lie i dont know he held on until she stopped trying to pull her hand free but somethings off i imagine i could find out for myself if i took a drive up the coast road dont fear grabbed her by the throat so that the single word was thin and urgent dont she repeated with more control it isnt for you but at this point i cant be sure it wont take what it can get let go of my hand and ill tell you tell me he countered knowing the value of the link and ill let go of your hand all right she managed after a vicious internal struggle your way this time she told him sparing none of the details but keeping her tone even almost conversational even so she saw his expression change why arent you wearing protection he demanded i am she lifted the trio of crystals dangling from a starshaped pendant it wasnt enough hes strong hes had three centuries to gather his forces nurse his powers even so he couldnt cause me real harm he can only play tricks this trick mightve caused you to have an accident you were probably driving too fast please youll force me to pull out the old pot calling the kettle i didnt nearly drive off a cliff he pushed to his feet paced away the terrifying image of mia doing exactly that he hadnt anticipated this kind of direct frontal attack on her and he thought neither had she confidence in their own powers he realized had blindsided them youd have taken extra precautions with your home i protect whats mine you neglected your car he said tossing a look over his shoulder and having the satisfaction of seeing her flush i certainly did not neglect it i have the standard charms standard isnt enough as youve just discovered her teeth clenched at being told how to conduct herself but she nodded point taken meanwhile id prefer to give him back some of his own rather than constantly taking the defense she got to her feet this isnt for you isnt about you no point in wasting time arguing that point as we both know im part of it youre not one of the three no im not he stepped back to her but im of the three my blood and your blood mia spring from the same pool my power and your power feed from the same source it links us however much you might prefer otherwise you need me with you to finish this what i need isnt yet clear he lifted a hand grazing a knuckle over the line of her jaw an old gesture and what you want wanting you sexually isnt life and death sam its scratching a vague itch vague amusement brightened his face as his hand slid around to cup the back of her neck vague she repeated and let his mouth come to hers let it rub teasingly and entice slight i was thinking more he danced the fingers of his free hand up and down her spine constant chronic nibbling on her he eased her closer she kept her gaze on him her arms at her sides desires only a hunger youre right lets eat he ravished her mouth shifting so swiftly from gentle warmth to raging heat that she had no choice but to plunge with him her hands gripped his hips squeezed then ran roughly up his back to hook like talons over his shoulders if he would push her to the brink she thought she would push him harder and further she let her head fall back not a gesture of surrender but one of demand take more if you dare when he dared she purred in pleasure her scent seemed to pour over him into him until his belly ached and his head spun in one desperate move he dragged her closer and prepared to fall with her onto the couch the front door opened the cheerful jingle of bells might as well have been sirens go rent a damn room lulu snapped and let the door slam behind her it gave her dark satisfaction to watch the two of them spring apart or at least crawl into the backseat of a car if youre going to act like a couple of horny teenagers she slapped her enormous purse on the counter me ive got a business to run around here good point sam slipped an arm possessively around mias waist well just take a walk across the street it was another old gesture mia remembered once she would have hooked her arm around him in turn and leaned her head against his shoulder now she simply stepped away thats a charming offer really but ill just take a rain check the business that lulu so helpfully pointed out needs to be run is mine and were opening in less than an hour she said after a glance at her watch then well make it fast another delightful offer isnt that sweet lu its not every day a woman gets an invitation for a quick roll before operating hours adorable lulu said sourly she felt sour and preferred blaming it on sam rather than on not being able to sleep well since her saturdaynight hallucination but be that as it may mia patted sams cheek absently then started to turn away he took her chin in a firm grip youre playing me he said softly you want to make this a game then i should warn you i dont always play by the rules now neither do i she heard the back door open close ah theres nell youll have to excuse me sam i have work as im sure you do she nudged his hand away then walked over to meet nell as she came in ill take that up mia scooped the first box of baked goods out of nells arms smells fabulous she sailed up the stairs with the scent of cinnamon rolls floating behind her um nell cleared her throat walking into the tension had been like walking into a wall hello sam nell well ive got more she managed then escaped out the back again in case you havent noticed lulu said were not open for business so get he could still taste mia with his mood hot and ripe for trouble he walked to the counter and leaned over close to lulus scowl i dont give a damn if you approve or disapprove you wont keep me away from her you did a good job of that yourself these past years now im back and were all just going to have to deal with it he strode to the door yanked it open if you want to play guard dog theres something a hell of a lot more dangerous than me you should be snapping at lulu watched him stalk across the street she wasnt sure there was anything more dangerous to mia than sam logan no family the wineandjunkfoodinduced hallucination had been wrong about that she thought she had family she had a child lulu glanced up the stairs where mia had gone she had a child she thought again he canceled his first meeting a man had priorities he drove up the coast road through sheer will he held his temper and his speed in check but he could do nothing about the shock and horror that careened through him when he saw the skid marks inches he thought as he got out of his car on rubbery legs just inches more and shed have been into the guardrail the right speed the right angles and her little car would have toppled right over it and down the unforgiving face of the cliff he followed the pattern scanning the road scenting the air for anything that lingered he knew she liked to drive fast but shed never been reckless to go into a spin such as the one indicated by the tire marks smeared over the pavement shed have had to be doing ninety unless shed had help cold fingers ran over his spine because he was certain now that was what had happened something had shoved that spin along pushing her toward the edge if she hadnt been strong enough smart enough fast enough she might not have come out of it whole he studied the roadbed where a black scar marred it like an old festering burn it oozed like oily blood as he watched and as he watched he felt the dark energy that emanated from it crawl over the air mia had been more shaken than either of them had realized he thought to have left this going back to his car he popped the trunk selected what he needed with his tools in hand he took a long look up and down the road it was deserted a plus he thought as what he needed to do would take a little time he circled the scar three times with sea salt and the ooze smoked where it spilled into the ring with his power cold and clear inside him he used a birch wand for cleansing as he sprinkled both bay and cloves for protection the scar bubbled and hissed and began slowly to shrink no one who passes now need fear you can do no more harm here dark back to dark as light breeds light safe passage here by day and night he crouched as the scar closed in on itself i will guard what is dear to me he whispered as i will so mote it be he returned to his car and drove over the shadow of the scar toward mias house hed needed to see it and had resisted but he couldnt afford to wait for her invitation now it was so much what it had been he thought as he studied the gorgeous ramble and spears of stone and so much more more mia he realized as he again got out of his car the flowers the budded shrubs and great trees the gargoyles and faeries the breeze stirred wind chimes and strings of crystal into constant music the white tower of the lighthouse stood like an ancient sentinel guarding both island and house and shed planted purple pansies at its feet he followed the winding path of steppingstones around the side of the house the sea beating on the rocks drew both his mind and his heart toward the cliffs and made him remember how many times hed stood on them with her or come upon her standing there alone but as he walked he glanced around then stopped staggered her gardens were a world arches and arbors slopes and flows stone paths softened by moss spreading through the cracks meandered through rivers and floods of flowers some were tender with spring some already reigned not just blooms he realized but the green there were so many tones and textures of it that each spill or shimmer of pink or white yellow or blue against it added a wonder there were pools of water the glint of copper from a sundial the charm of a dancing faerie twirling in the shrubbery he could see benches tucked here and there some in sun some in shade inviting visitors to sit to enjoy he couldnt imagine what it would be like when the young plants burst into full summer bloom when the vines finished their climb up the arbors couldnt conceive of the color and shape the perfume unable to resist he wandered along some of the stone paths trying to imagine how she had done it how she had turned what had been a pretty if pedestrian garden a stretch of manicured lawn and the single formal terrace he remembered into a celebration and he wished foolishly that he could sit and watch while she tended one of her beds the house had always been beautiful he thought now and she had always loved it but he remembered it as somewhat staid and very formidable she had made it a place of pleasure and beauty warmth and welcome and standing in the midst of mias personal eden with the fragile scents the trill of birds the thunder of the surf he understood what she had created and what he had never found home he had had the luxurious the adequate the tasteful and the efficient he had looked for but had never found his place until now a hell of a note isnt it he murmured to realize she had hers and mine all along since he didnt know what to do about it he went back to his car to finish what hed come to do he would add his own charms of protection to mias and make her and hers doubly safe hed just finished when he spotted the islands patrol car coming up the road watching it he dropped a small silk bag of crystals back into his coat pocket his initial pleasure at the prospect of seeing zack flipped over to irritation when ripley got out of the car well well isnt this interesting simmering and delighted to be so she tucked her hands in her back pockets and swaggered toward him the bill of her cap was angled low over dark glasses but he didnt need to see the whole of her face to know it was hard as stone here i am on routine island patrol and what do i find but a nefarious character and find him skulking around on private property smiling fiercely she unhooked her cuffs from her belt sam eyed them eyed her not that i dont have a soft spot for a little bondage now and again rip but youre a married woman when her lips peeled back to show her teeth he shrugged okay bad joke but so are those the law isnt a joke hotshot youre trespassing and i imagine i could make an attempted daylight b and e stick the cuffs jingled in her hand either way trying is just going to make my day i didnt go in the damn house hed just been considering it and if you think youre going to arrest and cuff me for trespassing goody i can add resisting cut me some slack why the hell should i i didnt come up here to poke around though he had poked a bit im just as concerned about mia as you are too bad being a lying sack of shit isnt against the law how about this for truth he leaned over until they were nose to nose i dont give a rats ass what you think of or about me im going to make damn sure this house and the woman who lives in it are protected especially after what nearly happened to her this morning and if you think youre going to get those fucking cuffs on me sweetheart youd better step back and think again its not your job to protect this house and if i want these cuffs on you city boy youll be flat on the ground eating dirt while i secure them what the hell do you mean after what happened this morning he started to spit something back at her but then his gaze narrowed in speculation mia didnt tell you she tells you every damn thing always has ripleys color came up a little i havent seen her today what happened then the color drained away again as she gripped his wrist is she hurt no no his temper ebbed leaving only frustration he raked his fingers through his hair but she couldve been nearly was he relayed the story appreciating when ripley swore impressively and stalked around the front yard as if looking for something handy to kick it reminded him why hed always liked her i didnt see any skid marks i vanished them after i cleansed the area he explained i thought it would upset her to see them again god knows it bothered me yeah well her voice dropped to a mutter youre right excuse me i dont believe i caught that i said youre right dont milk it you took care of things here yeah just added a layer over what shes done shes stronger than she was he said half to himself and shes thorough obviously not thorough enough im going to talk to mac about it he has all sorts of ideas yeah hes full of them sam said sourly then shrugged his shoulders when ripley scowled at him i liked him so congratulations and best wishes on your marriage and all of that gee thanks that was so heartwarming that made him smile maybe its just hard for me to imagine letitrip cozied up in connubial bliss shut up that was high school i liked you in high school because he had he tried again im glad you and mac bought the house its a great spot yeah we think so no hard feelings your old man sold it out from under you it was never mine she opened her mouth shut it again for a moment hed been the lost and restless boy she remembered and had cared for you messed her up sam seriously messed her up he stared at the cliffs that rose over the sea and spilled down to it i know it then i messed her up puzzled he looked back at ripleys face i dont understand you she didnt tell me about this morning because were just getting back on even ground again after a long time i dumped her just as hard as you did so im thinking she drew a breath im thinking i dont have any right to take shots at you when part of its just to ease my own conscience you knocked the ground out from under her but i didnt stick around to help break her fall you want to tell me why you didnt stick she sent him a hard level look you want to tell me why you didnt he shook his head no why dont we start dealing with now im part of this and im sticking this time around fair enough she agreed i say we can use all the help we can get from whatever the source im going to do whatever i can to convince mia to let me back into her life ill wish you luck at his surprised glance she smirked but until i make up my mind about you pal i wont say whether thats good luck or bad reasonable he held out a hand and after a moments hesitation she took it heat shimmered and sparked figures she said in a dour voice connections he gave her hand a friendly squeeze before releasing it what can you do ill let you know when i figure it out i have to finish my patrol she waited a beat inclined her head after you she jerked a thumb at his car and keep that phallic symbol on wheels under the speed limit oh absolutely officer friendly he sauntered back to his car one more thing lets not mention my little visit here to mia shell just get pissy about me questioning her skills ripley snorted as she climbed into her own car she had to give sam credit for one thing he still knew his woman seven she wouldnt tell mia but ripley didnt consider that her discretion was required to extend to mac she was pretty sure there was some loophole in the confidentiality law that applied to spouses the way she looked at it if you loved someone enough to promise them a lifetime you got to tell them all your stuff and listen to all of theirs it was a side benefit and balanced out having to share closet space though they lived together slept together woke together they met for lunch a few times a week at café book the few times a week mac wasnt so buried in his work that he remembered what time it was the lunch date she decided was as long as she could hold out before she spilled her news she itched to relay the story to nell but after a complex internal debate she decided nell cut too close to mia and didnt come under the dispensation rule mac would have to do so she continued as she plowed through a grilled tuna and avocado salad he stood there all handsome and brooding it was still cool and misty so he had on this long dark coat and it was all you know billowy perfect torturedhero look so hes like that on her front lawn with that big old house behind him and the mists just burning off until i made him leave he vanished the remnants on the road it wasnt easy to get a word in when ripley was on a roll but mac had carved out one salient point yeah poof it can be a pretty intense spell depending on the you know quality and complexity of the evil and stuff she jerked a shoulder and grabbed her coffee but i didnt see a trace of it and i stopped and took a good look on the way back just in case hed missed something had he nope not even a stray vibe left which means he swept it clean i wish hed talked to me first mac complained i couldve gotten some onsite readings and taken a sample for lab tests she sat back shook her head at him oh yeah just what i want my guy to have his fingers in some evil black ooze its what i do mac sulked about it for a minute then decided he might as well take a drive out and see if some of his more sensitive equipment could pick up anything so lets backtrack a minute he continued he told you that mia told him shed seen a large black wolf with the pentagram mark on his muzzle thats the manifestation black wolf red eyes big fangs her mark on it had to be a hell of an image to shake the queen of weird an image is just the point mac said not an actual wolf no living creature was possessed this time out could have something to do with her branding it last winter but it was still potent enough to send her into a skid thats interesting and a bad one from the way sam was shaken up ill tell you what else is interesting she leaned forward hunching over what was left of her lunch and lowering her voice the guy sweeping up behind her standing there looking at her place like some contemporary version of heathcliff looking over the moors for catherine good one hey i read anyway him standing there emotions all swirling and trying to act all cool and casual about it thats interesting from what you told me they had a very intense relationship had ripley confirmed i could see him being all moony if shed dumped him way back when but hes the one who pulled stakes doesnt mean he got over her guys dont carry torches for a frigging decade smiling mac rubbed his hand over the back of hers id carry one for you get out but she turned her hand over linked her fingers with his anyway he doesnt want her to know he went out there he says shed be ticked if she knew hed backed up her charms and she would but if you ask me theres another layer he doesnt want her to know hes stuck on her itd be funny if it wasnt so complicated and if there wasnt so much at stake whatever was between them is between them or isnt plays into what happens next ive got some theories youve always got some theories he smiled inched forward we need to have a meeting all parties i figured like his her voice was a whisper now to the casual observer it might have appeared they were flirting or plotting an insurrection lets have it at zacks nellll cook were scraping the bottom of the leftover barrel at home good thinking how do we handle how much we know and who told us what who doesnt want somebody else to know we know jesus i understand that she grinned at him it must be love well if it isnt bill and coo mia stepped up to the table ran an affectionate hand over macs shoulder dont the two of you look adorable yeah were thinking about entering a contest ripley eased back studied mias face she had to give the woman credit nothing showed but bonedeep beauty so whats up with you oh this and that mia left her hand on macs shoulder something about him always comforted her actually there is something i need to speak with you about and nell a shadow of worry crossed her face as she glanced back at the café counter itll have to wait a bit though mia decided shes pretty tied up with customers at the moment ripley considered how to play it then went with instinct if this is about your dances with wolves i know about it it was a tossup she thought who looked more stunned mia or mac but at least mia didnt kick her under the table she shifted which gave her the opportunity to kick mac back as she reached toward a neighboring table and dragged over a third chair sit down a minute i think i will struggling to settle mia slid into the chair folded her hands i didnt realize you and sam were such confidants oh can it ripley pushed what was left of her lunch aside i ran into him out on the coast road which was true ripley thought mias house was on the damn coast road he cleaned up the little mess you left behind the she trailed off paled my god how could she have been so careless she hadnt so much as thought of the smear of power that might have stained that section of the island give yourself a break mac said gently you had to have been badly shaken it doesnt matter it was my responsibility you dont get it professor casually ripley broke off a piece of the éclair mac had picked out for dessert ms perfect here isnt allowed to make mistakes like the rest of us lesser beings i shouldve cleaned the area mia repeated and gave ripley a genuine jolt of concern when she didnt snap back well you didnt he did and alls well anyway while i was ragging on him and threatening to haul him in on some trumpedup charges just to brighten my morning he filled me in ive filled mac in so you just have to bring nell up to speed when shes off her shift yes all right mia rubbed at the vague pounding in her temple she couldnt remember the last time shed had a headache and her stomach was queasy shed have to take the time to balance her chakras so she could think clearly i would like to go over it with you in more detail mac i tend to believe it was nothing but a scare tactic but i dont want to shrug it off and miss something critical youre right and as it happens ripley and i were just saying we should have a meeting why dont we see if we can get together at nell and zacks tonight at dinnertime ripley chimed in and made mia smile yes why waste time or an opportunity for a free meal ill speak to nell mia got to her feet then looked down at ripley i intended to tell you about it myself i just needed to clear my head first i dont want you to think i was keeping secrets its past time for that between us ripley suffered a pang of guilt over sam but sucked it in a deal was a deal dont sweat it besides it gave me a chance to needle the pretty boy thats something then ill see you later when she walked toward nell and was out of earshot mac leaned forward again youre good deputy really good did you doubt it now ive got to make tracks and get to sam let him know what i told her and what i didnt before she gets to him and everythings screwed ill do it he shoved his éclair in front of her as he rose i want to talk to him anyway i need to document all of this hey good deal she plucked up the pastry and you get to buy lunch always a catch she muttered with her mouth full mac had only been able to wheedle an hour out of lulu and that was just as well now he thought he still had to drive back home meet up with ripley again and drive back for the newly arranged dinner meeting at the todds but for now he had his tape recorder and notebook and had primed lulu with a box of godiva really appreciate this lulu yeah yeah she drank coffee black with the candy she was giving wine a little rest i told you i dont much like this interview crap reminds me of being hauled in by the cops for protesting what were you protesting she sent him a pitying look come on it was the sixties what wasnt i protesting it was a good place to start he decided you lived in a commune right for a while she shrugged might as well get it done i flopped here or there slept in parks on beaches whatever was handy saw a lot of the country youre not going to see if youre in the family minivan and stopping at the holiday inn i bet howd you end up here on three sisters heading east lulu he pleaded okay dont give me that puppydog look she made herself more comfortable on the sofa i hit the road when i was about sixteen didnt get along with my family she leaned over plucked out another chocolate any particular reason for that you name it my old man had a narrow mind and a hard hand and my mother danced to his tune and played with the ladies auxiliary couldnt stand it i lit out first chance i got and id been such a pain in their asses they didnt go to much trouble to find me he found the offhanded way she spoke of her parents disinterest sad and telling but knowing lulu the slightest inkling of sympathy would earn him a kick in the teeth where were you going anywhere that wasnt there ended up in san francisco for a while gave my virginity in a nice marijuana haze to a sweetfaced boy named bobby she smiled at that as despite the years and the circumstance it was a nice memory i made love beads sold them for food listened to a lot of music solved all the worlds problems smoked a lot of joints dropped a little acid cruised around new mexico and nevada with a guy named spike can you beat that on his harley at sixteen mightve been seventeen by then you only get to be sixteen for a year liked being a gypsy as i had itchy feet she wiggled her toes in her ancient birkenstocks i planted them now and then the commune in colorado for one i learned to plant a garden how to cook what i planted learned how to knit there too but behind her lenses her eyes sharpened you want the weird stuff right not the hippietrippie memoirs ill take what i can get i had dreams not like goals she added didnt have an ambition to my name back then but i had dreams of this place the sisters the house on the cliff and a woman with long red hair mac had been sketching lulus face on his notepad but now he stopped and looked up mia no because it reminded her of the old days lulu lighted a cone of vanilla incense shed cry in the dreams and tell me i had to tend her children mac made a quick notation there had been a nurse and the one called earth had left the children with her before leaping from the cliffs reincarnation he scribbled a link within the circle whenever i had the dream i just had to move again just had to leave where i was and move on long story short i ended up in boston broke but i didnt mind being broke back then somebody always knew somebody who had a pad you could crash in one day this girl who called herself buttercup jesus said how we should all take the ferry over to three sisters island she liked to think she was a witch but as i remember she was the daughter of some rich lawyer whose money she was pissing away in college she could pay the freight to get us all over and back with daddys allowance money i went along because hey free ride they made the roundtrip i stayed why mac asked her she didnt answer for a moment despite her relationship with mia with ripley and nell and the island itself lulu didnt talk much about her own brushes with magic it always made her feel a little silly but mac was watching her in that quiet way he had and she was damn fond of him i knew it was my place as soon as i saw it coming up out of the water i was high lulu continued we all were buttercup was a moron but she always had prime weed i saw the island like it was in crystal everything so vivid and clear maybe it was the pot but it was the most beautiful thing id ever seen i looked up and saw the house on the cliffs and i thought well shit there it is thats where im supposed to be i walked away from buttercup and the rest as soon as we hit the docks and never gave them another thought wonder what the hell ever happened to her you went to work for mias grandmother not right away i wasnt looking for gainful employment too establishment for me she took off her glasses to polish the lenses i camped out in the woods a while ate berries or what id liberated from peoples vegetable gardens i think i was going through a vegetarian stage she mused with a little frown of concentration it was interesting to look back and see herself young careless smooth didnt last long born a carnivore die a carnivore so one day i was hiking and this woman came by in a fancy car stopped she leaned out looked me up and down i guess she was on the shy side of sixty but when youre figuring thirtys the end of it all thats really old she stopped laughed now as she put her glasses on what the hell im having a glass of wine want one no thanks ive got driving to do youre a real straight arrow arent you mac she headed off to the kitchen shouting back i never was much to look at and after camping a couple weeks idve been a little ripe had long hair then wore it in braids what was i thinking the woman she was old to me but she was a looker dark red hair all done up lady suit on like shed just come from teatime she had dark dark eyes and when they latched on to mine i swear i heard waves crashing on rock storms i felt the wind blow over me though the day was hot and still i heard a baby crying wineglass in hand lulu clumped back in dropped back on the colorful wellsprung sofa she told me to get in just like that and i did just like that never thought about it twice mrs devlin she had power just like her granddaughter does i didnt know what it was then i just knew it was she took me to the house on the cliffs i loved her lulu allowed sentiment to fill her throat along with the wine i respected her and i admired her she was more family to me than my own blood theyd never given much of a damn about me and id gotten used to that but she taught me passed on her love of reading trusted me made me work for my keep goddamn she expected you to pull weight i cleaned that bigass house so many times i couldve done it in my sleep you didnt know she was a witch lulu considered it wasnt something she had given a great deal of thought to it was kind of gradual i think she saw to that so itd be a natural thing for me to accept maybe it was easier seeing as how i was into all that hippiemetaphysicalnatureisourmother business when did you learn about the legend that was a gradual thing too its part of the sisters so you hear this read that working for mrs devlin i became part of the island before i realized it then by the time mia came along it was natural for you to accept power in her if i had to analyze it id say mrs devlin saw to that too she knew the way things would be before they were when mia was born her son and his wife moved into the house i figured out pretty soon theyd done it so theyd have themselves a couple of livein sitters selfish twits she paused took a deep gulp of wine the night they brought her they went down to the hotel to have dinner and mrs devlin took me into the nursery mia was a beautiful baby redheaded brighteyed long arms and legs mrs devlin she picked her up out of the crib cuddled her for a minute then she held her out to me scared me boneless it wasnt just that id never held a baby before or that this one looked like something made of precious glass it was that i knew i knew she was giving her to me and nothing would ever be the same for me again you ever want something so bad you could taste it but the idea of taking that first sip makes your belly jump yeah he set his notebook aside now and just listened yeah i have it was just like that we stood there her holding mia out me with my arms crossed over my chest with my heart beating like a hammer inside it and a storm came up out of nowhere just like in my dreams wind whipping the windows lightning flashing it was the first and last time i saw her cry take her she said to me she needs love and care and a firm hand they wont give it to her they cant and when im gone shell only have you i told her i didnt know how to take care of a baby and she smiled at me and just kept holding mia out mia started to squirm and fuss shake her fists and before i knew it i was taking her mrs devlin stepped back shes yours now ill never forget that shes yours now and youre hers and she left me to rock mia to sleep lulu sniffled wines making me sloppy touched mac leaned over closed a hand over hers me too sheriff zachariah todd emptied the dishwasher one of the few tasks he was allowed to attempt in his own kitchen okay let me see if i got this straight mia told sam what happened out on the coast road this morning ripley who didnt know what happened found sam up at mias house and he told her ripley but she promised she wouldnt tell mia hed been there so she told mia when mia was going to tell her jesus about what happened that she and that would be ripley ran into sam on the road when he was cleansing the area youre doing great nell encouraged as zack took a breath and she checked on the progress of her lasagna dont throw me off the track then mac told sam what ripley had told mia while mia was telling you what happened this morning then ripley told you the rest of it which you told me for reasons that escape me because i love you zack right he pressed a fingertip dead center of his forehead i think ill just keep my mouth shut altogether no way to wedge my foot in there that way never a bad choice she heard lucys sudden and joyful barking someones here you go take the tray on the third shelf im experimenting with canapés for the rodgerss wedding im catering next month put them up where lucy cant get them she called as he started out then glanced down at diego men and dogs she said and clucked her tongue you have to watch them every minute and because she did nell took the time to shift all the utensils zack had put away into their proper slots before she grabbed a bottle of wine and went out to greet her guests mac and ripley had brought the puppy along which sent lucy into spasms of delight and terror and had a miffed diego stalking upstairs to sulk mia arrived with a bouquet of freshly clipped daffodils and helped herself relax by sitting on the floor playing tugtherope with mulder i think of getting a dog now and then she laughed as mulder lost his toothy grip on the rope and went tumbling ears over tail then i think about my gardens she snatched the puppy up holding him high youd just love digging up all my flowers wouldnt you not to mention chewing on your shoes ripley said sourly of course youve got a hundred pair to spare shoes are a form of selfexpression shoes are to walk in mia drew the puppy down rubbed noses what does she know thats how sam saw her when he came to the door sitting on the floor laughing while a fat yellow puppy licked her cheeks his gut clenched and his throat snapped shut she looked so carelessly happy with her skirts spread out on the rug her hair tumbling down her back and her eyes bright with pleasure there in that outrageously beautiful woman was the shimmer of the girl hed left behind then lucy barked mulder leaped and mia stopped laughing as her gaze snapped to the doorway lucy zack called to the dog then grabbed her collar as he opened the screen door for sam no jumping he ordered as lucys muscles bunched for a joyful leap either of you he said it under his breath a blind man could have seen that hungry look on sams face shes all right sam skimmed a hand over lucys head and she collapsed onto her back he passed the wine hed brought to zack before crouching down to rub her exposed belly the puppy gamboled over wanting his share what are you doing here mia demanded sam lifted his eyebrows at her tone but before he could respond mac stepped in i asked him to come mac nearly flinched at mias quick accusing stare were all part of this and everyone here has something to contribute we need to cooperate with each other mia youre right of course the carefree woman was gone in her place was one with a cool voice and a polished smile so rude of me sam i apologize this has been our little club for some time now and i wasnt expecting a new member no problem he picked up the rope mulder dropped hopefully at his feet dinner will just be a few more minutes smoothly nell moved into the tense air can i get you a glass of wine sam love one thanks does your little club have any initiation rite i should know about just the little business where we shave all the hair off your head and body mia sipped her own wine but that can wait until after dinner i think ill wash up before she could get to her feet sam was on his a hand held down to her whether it was a test or a peace offering mia blocked herself so that when she took his hand it was nothing more than palm meeting palm thanks she knew the house as well as she knew her own but headed up the stairs rather than using the more convenient powder room on the first floor more distance she thought more solitude she slipped inside shut the door leaned back against it it was ridiculous absurd for the man to affect her the way he did it was all right or nearly so when she was prepared but when she saw him at those odd moments those moments when too much of her was already open he just filled her up she wanted to blame him for it but it was foolish and foolhardy to keep picking at an old wound what was done was done she stepped to the sink studied her face in the mirror she looked tired a little pale and drawn well it had been a difficult day and the shell at least was simple to mend she washed her hands then ran water in the sink bending she scooped it cool and fresh onto her face in the normal scheme of things she enjoyed using cosmetics the pencils and tubes and brushes were amusing and there was something reassuringly female about using them but for now this was simpler and certainly quicker she dabbed her face dry weaving the glamour spell then she looked critically in the mirror again much better she decided she looked rested with the subtle bloom of healthy color in her cheeks more color not quite so subtle slicked her mouth then with a sigh for her own vanity she traced a fingertip over the curve of her eyelid as a woman might use eyeshadow and a brush to define them the contour deepened satisfied she gave herself another moment to smooth out her emotions and went back down to join the others a closeknit group sam thought as he ate nell todds truly amazing lasagna the body language the looks the halffinished thoughts one would complete for another all told him these were five people whod bonded like glue by his time line nell had been on the island slightly less than a year and mac only since the past winter yet theyd been absorbed in a way that made them all very much a single unit a common enemy was part of the answer but he saw more here than what he perceived as a kind of wartime intimacy there was something in the way mia warmed when she spoke to or listened to mac the amused affection on her face it was love he saw there not the sort that sprang from passion but something deep and true he saw byplay like that all around the table nell scooped up a second helping for mac before hed asked for one zack tore off a hunk of bread and passed it to mia while he continued to hold a heated debate with his sister on the pitching depth of the red sox nell and mia exchanged looks in an unspoken joke that had them both chuckling and all of it all the ease made it clear to sam that building a bridge over his years away would take more than time and proximity i think my father and yours played in the same foursome for some charity golf tournament mac commented just last month in palm springs or palm beach or something with a palm in it really sam had never been interested in his fathers pseudo charity events and it had been years since hed had to bow to the pressure of participating in any of them i met your parents at various functions in new york yeah same circles more or less sam agreed i dont recall meeting you at any of those various functions mac only grinned well there you are so do you play golf now sam smiled no do you macs pretty much a spaz ripley put in if he tried to tee off hed probably slice his big toe into the woods sad but true mac agreed last week he tripped going down the deck steps six stitches the dog tripped me mac said in his own defense and it was only four stitches which you couldve avoided if youd come to me instead of going to the clinic she rags on me every time i get a bump or a bruise which is daily on our honeymoon were not getting into that the flush started creeping up macs neck when we were using taking a shower as an excuse to have some hot steamy sex cut it out mac spread his hand over ripleys face and gave it a nudge and that towel bar was not properly installed he ripped it right out of the wall in the throes she batted her lashes at him my hero anyway mac said on a long breath seeing as youre in the hotel business sam you might want to make sure your towel bars are secure ill make a note particularly if the two of you decide to take a weekend at the magick inn well if nell and zack make a reservation ripley continued youd better check the stability of the bathroom sinks they knocked the one upstairs out of alignment when ripley nell hissed it horrified do you have to tell her everything zack demanded not anymore ignoring ripleys laughter nell pushed to her feet ill get dessert i had no idea bathrooms had become such erogenous zones mia commented as she rose to clear her plate ill be happy to show you mine sam said and was given a shrug as she strolled into the kitchen she didnt eat she only pretended to sam kept his voice low shes tense mac added theres no point in my being here if it closes her off the world doesnt revolve around you ripley snagged her glass and drank rip zacks voice was a quiet warning lets just see how it goes from here with a nod sam picked up his own plate she trusts you he said to mac yes she does maybe that balances things out sam had nerves of his own when they settled back in the living room what he was had never been an issue for him it simply was but neither was his gift something he discussed he joined no coven and though only four out of the six there were hereditary witches it was very much a kind of coven we all know the legend mac began the historian sam thought the scientist the detail man with the facile mind during the salem witch trials the three who were known as fire earth and air conjured what became three sisters island as a haven against persecution while innocents were hunted and murdered ripley added the soldier sam idly stroked the cat who had deigned to join him on the sofa a woman with grit the earth they couldnt have stopped it or if theyd tried zack said others might have died and here sam decided was reason and authority change one angle of destiny change all mac nodded continued the one called air fell in love married a merchant who took her back to the mainland bore his children kept his home but he could never accept what she was he abused her and ultimately killed her she blamed herself i think for not being what he wanted for not staying true to herself and choosing poorly nell the nurturer sam thought when she spoke the cat stretched under his hand as if agreeing she was the air she saved her children sent them back to her sisters but the circle was diminished weakened and the horror of it the fury of it mac went on festered in the one known as earth until she surrendered to the anger the rage and the need for revenge she was wrong ripley said now i understand what she felt why she felt it but she was wrong and she paid using her power to kill the one whod killed her sister destroyed her and came back threefold she lost her husband a man she loved was never able to see her children again and shattered what was left of the circle there was one left mias voice was clear her gaze level one left to hold it intellect pride and passion was it any wonder that she stirred him sam thought she was the fire despair can crush even the strongest nell laid a hand on mias but even alone even heartbroken she wove a web of protection three hundred years strong she made certain her children were taken care of mac thought of lulu which brings us to now he frowned into his coffee a still unbroken circle youre worried ill fail when my time comes nell faced her demons and ripley hers in what seemed an idle gesture mia stroked mulder with the side of her foot of the three of us my knowledge and practice of the craft is the most extensive agreed but she lifted a brow at mac but i wonder if on the other side of the scale what youll have to deal with is more well insidious nell had evan remington a man he was a piece of shit ripley corrected be that as it may he was human she had to find the courage to face him to defeat him and embrace her gift im not saying any of that was a walk on the beach but it was pretty tangible if youre following me a man with a knife sam spoke for the first time since mac had begun and drew everyones attention a sociopath psychopath whatever the term might be for that kind of evil in the woods in the dark of the moon no not a walk on the beach it took great courage deep faith and a formidable power to do what nell did but it was an evil whose face she knew exactly mac beamed as if sam were a prized student in ripleys case in ripleys case ripley repeated i had to accept a power id rejected and walk the line when part of me wanted to cross it emotional turmoil sam agreed it can affect the tone of power in the same way it can affect the tone of your voice the tone of your actions the gift doesnt protect us from flaws or mistakes that kind of turmoil was tailored toward you and nells was turned toward her as a potent weapon with he broke off glanced at mac no keep going mac waved a hand its good to hear it from someone elses point of view all right the force that was unleashed centuries ago used remington as a conduit and fed itself into the reporter who followed nells crosscountry route to the sisters youve kept up mia said quietly yeah ive kept up holding the line power against power without crossing that line isnt a simple matter it requires conviction compassion strength even so in the end ripley like nell faced a man whatever was inside him he was flesh and blood it looks like sam and i have circled around to the same theory then why the hell dont you punch through to the point of it and stop circling ripley complained okay since sam gestured the goahead mac took over what came at mia today wasnt flesh and blood not a living thing but a manifestation that tells me a couple of things maybe just maybe because the circles intact because twice now its been defeated its powers diminished it cant possess but can only deceive or it hordes its strength waiting for its time and its place yes mac nodded at sam waiting for the right circumstance there isnt that much time when you measure by three centuries left on either side its going to keep pushing trying to weaken the circle and mia most specifically undermining the bedrock of your power itll use your fears doubts any weaknesses that trickle through the chinks tailored to you he added with a nod to sam thats just exactly right itll try to prey on you as it did on her three centuries ago through her loneliness and loss her despair at the thought of living without the people she loved and needed most im aware of that mia acknowledged but im not lonely and ive lost nothing my circle holds yes but i dont believe the circle can be considered complete and whole until your step is taken since this was tricky ground mac took his time until then theres a vulnerability and thats where the pressure will be the greatest it only needed to break nell and it failed to seduce ripley and it failed with you it needs to cause my death mia finished calmly yes i know ive always known when she started to leave nell held on to her dont worry so little sister mia pressed her cheek to nells hair i know how to protect myself i know i just wish youd stay i know how stupid that sounds but i wish youd stay with one of us until this is really over i need my cliffs ill be fine i promise she gave nell one last squeeze blessed be shed lingered longer than the others hoping to avoid any more conversation but when she stepped outside she saw sam leaning against her car i walked over how about a lift back its a pleasant night for a short walk give me a lift mia he took her wrist as she started to move past him i want to talk to you for a minute anyway alone i suppose i owe you a favor do you she circled the car slipped in behind the wheel she waited until shed started the car for cleaning up my mess on the coast road this morning she said as she eased into a uturn ripley told me she ran into you thank you youre welcome well that didnt hurt too much now what did you want to talk to me about i wondered about you and mac theres something there really deliberately she took her attention away from the road long enough to bat her lashes do you think im trying to tempt my sisters husband into a wild illicit affair if you were hed already be there she laughed what a lovely compliment even if youre wrong hes sweetly madly in love with his wife but youre right about one thing there is something between us youve always been good at picking up atmosphere and emotion what is it were cousins cousins it happens that the granddaughter of the first sister married a macallister macs mothers side of the family ah sam did his best to stretch out his legs in the little car so hes of the blood that explains a number of things i felt a connection the minute i met him but couldnt pin him down just as i felt one for nell even when she wanted to drop me into a dark pit and leave me there to rot i like your friends well im so relieved dont snipe at me mia i meant it because she knew it was true she sighed im tired it always make me cross theyre worried about you how youll handle things i know im sorry about it im not worried he paused when she pulled up in front of the cottage ive never known anyone witch or woman more vital than you you wont give in no i wont but i wont say i dont appreciate the confidence particularly after a long difficult day good night sam come inside no come inside mia he slipped a hand through her hair to rub the back of her neck and be with me id like to be with someone tonight she continued to be comforted and soothed to be touched and taken so i wont why because it wouldnt make me happy good night sam he could have pressed they both knew it but some of her glamour had slipped and he saw fatigue breaking through to haunt her face good night he climbed out watched her drive away and kept her in his mind until he knew she was safely inside the house on the cliffs eight it was all a matter of strategy in business sam thought in relationships and sometimes in just surviving the day he checked the progress on the rehab and was pleased that the work was proceeding on schedule he knew something about building and design there had been a time years before when hed considered breaking with logan enterprises and building his own hotel hed taken some extra college courses in architecture and design and had even spent a summer working as a laborer on a construction crew that had given him some practical knowledge an elementary skill and a healthy respect for manual labor but his plans to build his own had faded as every design he attempted or imagined turned into a mirror image of the magick inn why replicate what already was once hed realized he wanted the hotel the rest was a matter of patience canniness and careful strategy it had been important not to let his father know that the magick inn was the single family asset he coveted it would have come to sam through inheritance in any case but had thaddeus logan realized it had become a kind of holy grail to his son he would have felt obliged to nudge it out of reach thereby pressuring his son and heir to take more personal interest in other areas of the family empire the carrot would have dangled at the end of a very long very thorny stick during his fathers lifetime it was sam knew how his father operated he was not a man who rewarded he was one who withheld a philosophy that garnered results and never concerned itself with affection despite that sam hadnt been willing to perch like a vulture on a tree branch waiting for his own father to die before he claimed what he wanted for nearly six years he had held his desire for the hotel close to the vest hed worked hed learned and whenever hed managed to carve out room he had implemented some of his own ideas establishing a few profitable offshoots to logan enterprises in the end it had come down to deflecting his fathers attention waiting him out then broaching the deal at the right moment and meeting the cost historically the logans were staunch believers in the adage that nothing comes free unless sam thought it was their own trust funds so he had paid fair market value for his fathers share of the hotel sam didnt count the cost not when he had what he wanted he was going to try not to count the cost with mia he intended to be patient within reason he would of course be canny but he had yet he was forced to admit to outline a clearcut strategy his direct approach honey im home hadnt worked and why hed been brainless enough to think it would was currently beyond him lets kiss and make up hadnt done much better she wasnt freezing him out at every opportunity but neither was she softening he wanted her safe he wanted his island secure and he wanted her back the idea that he might not be able to have all three didnt sit well with him but the fact was that the responsibility of cleaning up a disaster three hundred years in the making was in their laps and it couldnt be ignored mac hadnt mentioned his theory in the meeting at the todds the other night but sam imagined he had discussed it or would with mia in private in the end rejecting him might be her answer might be the answer but going down without a fight went against nature so strategy he thought and scanned the parlor area of the currently empty suite where the walls had been newly papered in pale green moiré silk and the woodwork sanded down to its natural oak and varnished golden thinking he wandered through the bedroom and to a doorway where a second bedroom had been sacrificed to expand the bath and the master closet space the fixtures had yet to be installed but hed selected the generous jet tub himself the ripple glass on the multihead shower unit the curving ribbon of counters hed used warm colors a lot of polished granite and copper luxurious amenities in oldfashioned apothecary jars a blend of tradition comfort and efficiency just the sort of thing he mused that appealed to mia business steady profit and exquisite service he smiled to himself as he took his cell phone out of his pocket then just as quickly replaced it a personal call wasnt the way to conduct some business discussions he headed down to his office to tell his assistant to get ms devlin on the phone he puzzled her the boy shed thought she knew so well had become a man full of unexpected turns and missing pieces a business dinner mia mused when she hung up the phone at her convenience she frowned at the receiver shed just replaced and hed sounded as if he meant it very cool very professional a business meeting over dinner at the hotel to discuss a proposal he hoped would be of benefit to both of their establishments just what did the man have up his sleeve sheer curiosity had pushed her to agree to the meeting though she was wily enough not to be available the same night she graciously agreed to rearrange her schedule to fit him in the following evening it wouldnt hurt to see if there was anything she should be ready for she took a ball of crystal from her shelf and set it at the center of her desk with her hands cupped around it she focused her mind gathered her power the glass began to warm mists swam inside it shimmering with a light that seemed to come from deep within the globe visions swirled into the mists and into her eyes she saw herself as she had been young so young lying naked in the cave wrapped only in sams arms not yesterday she whispered but tomorrow clear the future from the past so i can see what may be her garden lush with summer under a bright white moon as she looked the air in her office was perfumed with the vanilla scent of heliotrope the spice of dianthus she wore white a long flow of it to echo the moon he stood with her in that ocean of flowers and held out a hand in his palm he held a star a slice of colored light that beat like a pulse he was smiling when he tossed it high when a shower of light and color exploded over their heads as it streamed down she felt the thrill the utter joy that the woman inside that ball of glass felt it swelled inside her own heart like a song and in a flash she was alone on the cliffs while a storm screamed lightning struck around her burning arrows of it her island was enveloped by a fetid fog the chill of it reached out to where she stood in her quiet office and iced her bones out of the dark the black wolf leaped his jaws were still snapping at her throat as they fell toward the raging sea enough she passed a hand over the globe and it was only a pretty glass ball she replaced it and sat her hands were steady her breathing even she had always known that looking into what might come could mean seeing her own death or worse the death of a loved one it was the price that power demanded the craft didnt ask for blood but still it squeezed the heart to a throbbing bruise at times so she thought which would it be for her love or death or by taking the first would she ensure the second she would see shed learned much in thirty years as a witch mia thought as she turned back to her computer back to the work of the day and one thing she knew you did what you could to protect to respect taking the joys and the sorrows then in the end you accepted your destiny i thought you said it wasnt a date mia secured the back of her earring its not a date its a business dinner lulu sniffed loudly if its a business dinner whatre you doing wearing that dress mia picked up her second earring let it dangle in her fingers a moment because i like this dress shed known it was a mistake to bring the change of clothes to work rather than going home but this saved time and energy besides there was nothing wrong with the little very little black dress woman puts on a dress like that because she wants a man to think about whats under it mia merely fluttered her lashes do tell and dont you get smart with me i can still give you a good whap when you need one lu im not ten anymore if you ask me youre showing less sense than you had when you were a longsuffering sigh wouldnt work pointing out that she hadnt asked would only lead to an argument since it was impossible to ignore the scowling woman jammed in the bathroom with her mia tried another angle she turned ive finished my homework and cleaned my room please can i go out and play lulus lips twitched but she managed to get them back into a thin flat line quickly enough never had to nag you to clean your room i used to worry because you were too damn neat for a kid you dont have to nag me about this either because i know how to handle sam logan you figure squeezing yourself into that dress and showing half your boobs is handling him mia glanced down her boobs in her opinion were nicely even elegantly displayed as were her legs clear up to midthigh oh yes indeed are you wearing underwear oh for gods sake mia yanked the black jacket off the padded hanger i asked you a question searching for patience mia put on the jacket its hem grazed an inch above the bottom of the skirt turning the sexy little dress into a sexy little suit i find that an odd question coming from a former flower child you probably didnt even own any underwear from to did so i had a very pretty pair of tiedyed panties for special occasions undone mia leaned back on the seat and chuckled oh lu what an image that creates in my feverish little brain just what sort of special occasion called for tiedyed panties dont change the subject and answer the question well i dont own anything quite that festive but im wearing underwear after a fashion so if im in an accident im safe im not worried about an accident im worried about on purpose straightening mia leaned down cupped lulus homely face in her hands she hadnt had to search for patience after all she realized shed only had to remember love you dont have to worry at all i promise my job is to worry lulu muttered then take a break im going to have a lovely dinner find out just what business it is sams cooking up and enjoy the side benefit of driving him crazy youve still got a thing for him i never had a thing for him i loved him lulus shoulders drooped oh honey she lifted a hand fussed with mias hair i wish hed stayed in goddamn new york city well he didnt i dont know if what im feeling now is just left over from what i felt then or if its because of now or all the years between shouldnt i find out being you you have to but i wish youd kick his ass first mia turned slipped on a hammeredgold necklace that dripped a slim column of pearls between her breasts if this dress doesnt kick his ass i dont know what will lulu curled her lip angled her head maybe youre not so stupid i learned from the best mia colored her lips in murderous red shook back her wild cloud of hair turned so how do i look like a maneater perfect mia thought she timed it perfectly as well at precisely seven she strolled into the lobby of the magick inn the young desk clerk glanced over goggled then dropped the sheaf of papers in his hand pleased she shot him a killer smile then breezed into sorcery the hotels main dining room there was a moment of surprise as she scanned the room and saw the changes sam had been busy she realized and felt an unwilling tug of pride the standard white tablecloths had been replaced by rich midnightblue ones the china on them a moonbright contrast the old clear glass vases had been removed and now brass and copper pots rioting with white lilies formed ribbons of glint and fragrance the crystal glassware had a heavy almost medieval look each table was graced with a small copper cauldron candlelight flickered through cutouts in the shapes of stars and crescent moons for the first time in her memory the room reflected and honored its name impressed approving she stepped in and experienced a fast hard jolt there on the wall was a lifesize painting of three women the three sisters backed by the forest and the night sky looked down at her from a frame of ornate antique gold they were robed in white and the folds of those robes the tendrils of their hair seemed to move in an unseen wind she saw nells blue eyes ripleys green ones and her own face like it sam said from behind her she swallowed so that her voice would be clear its stunning i had it commissioned nearly a year ago it just arrived today its beautiful work the models there were no models the artist worked from my descriptions from my dreams i see she turned to face him he or she is very talented she a wiccan artist living in soho i think she captured he trailed off as he shifted his gaze from the portrait to mia every thought in his head scattered in pure primal lust you look amazing thank you i like very much what youve done with the restaurant its a start he started to take her arm then realized his palms had gone damp im having new lighting designed something in brass more lanternlike and i want well why dont we sit before i bore you with all my plans on the contrary but she let him guide her to an intimate corner booth where she noted a bottle of champagne was already chilling she slid in then deliberately slipped out of her jacket she watched his eyes blur but to his credit his gaze stayed primarily on her face warm in here she said then nodded to the waiter when he poured her champagne what are we drinking to sam sat picked up his own glass one question before we get to that are you trying to kill me no just kick your ass done i dont think a womans made my hands sweat since well since you now if i can just get some of the blood back into my head when she laughed he tapped his glass to hers to mutual business do we have any thats what this is about first regarding dinner i preordered i think i remember your taste if that doesnt suit you ill get you a menu smooth she thought very smooth the man had learned how and when to polish over all those dangerous edges when it suited him i dont mind the occasional surprise she sat back let her gaze drift around the room business is good it is and i intend for it to get better the firstfloor renovations should be complete in another two weeks the new presidential suite rocks so i hear your contractor is my contractor so i hear when do you plan to start your expansion soon she glanced at the variety of appetizers placed on the table by silent waiters she sampled a bit of lobster paté i hope to keep the inconvenience to my customers at a minimum still during the main part of the work i imagine youll pick up some of my lunch crowd she paused for a beat temporarily improvements to your business only benefit mine and vice versa i can agree to that why not exploit it i want to stock some localinterest books maybe some current bestsellers in the luxury suites a discreet card or bookmark could advertise your store and she waited for the catch you get a lot of daytrippers again using the localinterest angle what if they bought a particular book youve selected a book on the islands history whatever a purchase of that book gives them a chance to win a free weekends stay at the hotel they fill out a form with their name and address we pull a ticket once a month during the season and somebody gets lucky and we have all those names on our mailing list he topped off their champagne i knew youd follow me you sell books i get a few more tourists into the hotel and we both add to our potential customer base vacations he continued selecting a delicate crab puff hotels beach reading then theres business travel same deal im working on pulling in more conventions i get them in and part of the welcome package is a discount coupon for café book which gets them into your place across the street which if they fill out the prize form gets them back into your place on a weekend vacation bullseye she considered as fresh fieldgreens salads were served the cost to each of us is negligible some paperwork its simple enough in fact much too simple to warrant a business dinner to discuss it theres more ive noticed you dont as a rule do author events one or two a year local interest again she shrugged her shoulders sisters and café book are well off the beaten path for book tours and standard book signings publishers dont send authors to remote islands off the new england coast and most authors arent going to pay to come here and work we can change that he had her interest now she accepted the bread hed buttered for her unaware that hed been nudging food on her since shed sat down can we i made a number of contacts in new york ive still got some buttons to push but im working on convincing a few key people that sending a touring author to three sisters would be well worth the time and money particularly since the magick inn will offer a generous corporate rate and firstclass accommodations then theres the convenience of having a classy independent bookstore right across the street what you have to do is put together a proposal detailing just how café book would host an author how youd pull in the warm bodies and have books moving out the door we pull it off once just once and others will be hopping on the ferry she felt the quick twist of excitement at the idea but weighed it from all angles filling a room a few times a year at a corporate rate will hardly made a difference to you maybe im just trying to help my neighbor so to speak then you should know your neighbor isnt gullible or naive no shes just the most beautiful woman ive ever known thank you now whats the point in these ideas for the hotel okay so much for charm he leaned toward her there are a lot of publishers with a lot of authors with a lot of books to hype thats one two publishers have sales conferences if i snag the interest of one publisher because of a successful author event its going to add to the weight im putting on to cop a major conference i get that im going to get in a lot of repeat business he lifted his water glass so will you if you can handle an author event i know how to host a signing she ate without thinking because her mind was already on the details if you can push those buttons for say july or august even into september the first time around ill get plenty of warm bodies give me a novel a mystery a romance a thriller and well sell a hundred minimum on the event day and half that many during the followup week write the proposal youll have it tomorrow by the close of the workday good he ate some salad how would you like john grisham enjoying herself enjoying him she picked up her glass again dont toy with me smart guy he doesnt tour his books come out in february not the summer and even you arent that good okay just testing how about caroline trump mias lips pursed shes very good ive read her first three books solid romantic thrillers her publishers been building her well and theyre moving her into hardcover this summer a july release she considered studying sams face can you get me caroline trump get me the proposal she sat back again i misjudged you i imagined you used business as an excuse to get me in here i figured youd have some little scheme to spring off a seduction attempt but nothing really viable if i hadnt had something viable id have settled for a scheme to get you here he brushed his fingers over the back of her hand even if it only meant i could look at you for an hour and i thought she continued that sometime during the conversation youd remind me that you had a number of rooms upstairs and why didnt we make use of one i thought about it he remembered what shed said to him as theyd sat in her car outside of the yellow cottage but it wouldnt make you happy her breath caught for an instant oh i wish i knew if that was sincere or just fucking clever mia no i dont know whats between us i cant see it and ive tried to why is it that even knowing better we can fool ourselves into believing wed be all right if we just knew what happens next i dont know i cant see it either when she looked at him he nearly sighed i was never as good as you at clearing away the now to see the whatifs but i had to try she looked to the portrait of the sisters the only thing set in stone is yesterday i can promise you i have no intention of letting what they began be destroyed this is my home everything that matters to me is on this island im more than i was when you left less than i will be when im done that i do know do you think being with me diminishes that if i did i wouldnt be sitting here now her lips curved as their entrées were served i was going to sleep with you christ he pounded a fist on his heart medic her laugh was low and intimate i imagine before were done i will but since were being so friendly ill tell you frankly i want you to suffer first believe me he said with feeling and reached for his water glass lets go back to business before i whimper and lose the respect of my restaurant staff all right tell me about your other plans for the hotel i want it to matter i want people who stay here to take away an experience i spent six months in europe a few years ago touring and studying and dissecting the smaller hotels its about service first but overall its about the details color schemes the thread count on the sheets can you reach the phone without getting out of bed can i get a damn sandwich at two in the morning or get this spot cleaned off my tie before my afternoon meeting how thick are the towels mia commented how firm is the mattress and so on inroom faxes and internet access for the business traveler complimentary champagne and roses for the honeymooners a staff that clues in and greets guests by name and fresh flowers fresh linens fresh fruit im going to hire a maître detage to butler the luxury suites well well and every guest on arrival will have an amenity delivered from a fruit plate and sparkling water to champagne and caviar depending on the price level of the room every room will be rehabbed before were done and every one will be personalized and unique im naming them so guests will stay in the rose room or the trinity suite and so forth thats a nice touch she told him more personal exactly we already have a data bank but well put it to better use for repeat guests that way we can do our best to put them back in a favorite room well bump up the level of their amenities with recurring visits maintain a file on their preferences and in the health club he trailed off what nothing but she couldnt help smiling at him go on no he laughed a little i get caught up you know what you want and how you intend to go about it its very attractive it took me a long time to get there you always knew maybe i did but wants and intentions change and sometimes they circle back around he laid his hand on hers and then she gently slid hers free and sometimes they just change he went back to work after shed left the restaurant but he couldnt concentrate he went home but he couldnt settle being with her was both torture and pleasure watching the expressions cross her face when she became interested enough not to close herself off from him pure fascination wanting her was like a drug in his bloodstream in the end he changed and walked into the dark woods he went unerringly to the circle where he could feel the shimmer of her magic rise up and merge with nells with ripleys preparing himself he stepped into its center and let their power and his own wash over him like water what is mine i add to yours with power shared the link endures the light grew spreading around the ring as strong as the sun to win your heart ill face the fire and all that the fates conspire by earth and air by fire and water i will stand by the sisters daughter yet i wait for her to come to me that we might make our destiny he breathed deep spread his arms tonight while the moonlight streams she is safe within her dreams here to me i call out of the night that which feeds on pain and blight know i join the sisters three and dare to show yourself to me the earth trembled and the wind whipped but the fire that ringed the circle ran straight and true toward the night sky and outside the circle a dark mist fed along the ground and coalesced into a wolf with a pentagramshaped scar on its snout so sam thought lets understand each other to him who seeks her life to take within this ring this vow i make by all the power that lives in me from your hand she will be free i will crush you into dust by all means fair or foul or just sam watched while the wolf paced around the circle snarling do you think i fear you youre nothing but smoke and stink sam waved a hand and the light around the circle lowered in challenge he stepped clear of the protection power to power he murmured while the air outside the circle swirled filthy and foul sam watched the wolf gather the ripple and bunch of muscle it leaped for his throat the weight of it was a shock as was the quick sharp pain in his shoulder where claws dug using both muscle and magic he flung the wolf aside then yanked the ritual knife out of his belt lets finish it he said between his teeth this time when the wolf charged he pivoted and raked the knife over its side there was a sound more scream than howl black blood dripped onto the ground sizzling into it like hot oil and wolf and mist vanished sam studied the fresh scar on the earth then the blackened tip of his blade absently he ran a hand over his shoulder where his shirt and flesh had been ripped so theyd both bled but only one had screamed and fled round one goes to me he murmured then prepared to cleanse the ground nine by ten the next morning mia was already polishing up her proposal for an author event shed worked off considerable sexual frustration the night before by diving straight into the project and sticking with it until after midnight then shed sprinkled ginger and marigold over the rough draft for success in business ventures with rosemary under her pillow to aid in a restful sleep shed tuned out the nagging need she had always been good at channeling her energies at focusing them on the task that needed attention after her initial mourning period for sam that strength of will had gotten her through college into business into life it had for years kept her moving forward with matters both practical and pleasurable when she was fully aware that the web of protection around her home was thinning yet despite that will shed dreamed of sam and of being with him then of being with him now the physical ache of it had her tossing until she was tangled in the sheets she dreamed of the marked wolf stalking through the woods howling from its perch on her cliffs and once shed heard it scream in pain and rage and in sleep she called sams name like a chant still she had slept and she woke to a brilliant sunrise that promised a perfect day she tended her flowers first while the sky shimmered with the reds and golds of dawn she paid her respects to the elements that gave her the beauty of her gardens and the gift of her power she brewed a cup of mint tea for money and luck and drank it while standing on her cliffs with the sea raging against the rocks below she felt closest to her ancestor there and could always sense the iron core of strength as well as the bitter rending loneliness sometimes when shed been very young shed stood here looking out to sea and hoping to see the sleek head of a silkie bobbing in the waves once shed believed in happilyeverafter and had woven the tale in her head of how the one who was called fires lover had come back for her and how their spirits had found each other loved each other ever and always she no longer believed that and was sorry for it but shed learned and learned well that there were some losses that sliced you to bits shattered the spirit into dust and still you went on you remade yourself mended your spirit you lived if not happily ever after then contentedly enough it had been on those cliffs that she had sworn an oath to protect what had been entrusted to her she had been eight full of pride in what she was and every year since on the nights of the summer and winter solstices she stood on those cliffs and renewed that vow but this morning mia stood on the cliffs and simply gave thanks for the beauty of the day then went in to dress for work she didnt shudder when she drove the curves of the cliff road but she watched at her desk she read over her proposal searching for mistakes any detail she might have overlooked her brow furrowed at the knock on her door though she ignored it deliberately ripley strode in im busy come back later somethings up never one to stand on ceremony or to be put off by a less than warm welcome ripley came in dropped into a chair that annoyed mia enough to have her looking up she saw nell in the doorway nell isnt it your day off do you think idve dragged her in here on her day off ripley said before nell could answer if it wasnt important all right with sincere regret mia set her work aside come in close the door did you have a vision ripley grimaced i try not to and no this has nothing to do with woowoo stuff not directly anyway i heard mac talking on the phone this morning trying not to let me hear him talking on the phone ripley i really cant meddle in your domestic disputes during working hours he was talking to sam well that woke you up she commented its hardly surprising that theyd have a conversation mia picked up her proposal frowned at the bullet points then gave up and set it down again all right what were they talking about i dont know exactly but something mac was really interested he even walked outside with the phone casuallike but i know it was because he didnt want me to hear him how do you know it was sam because i heard him say ill come by the cottage this morning well why cant you just get to the point im getting to it so he scoots me out to work trying not to make it obvious hes railroading me along kiss kiss pat pat shove shove but i go because im thinking ill just run by the cottage myself once im on patrol but first i check in at the station house and zacks on the phone and he stops talking in the middle of a sentence when i walk in then says hello to me using my name really definitely her scowl deepened at the memory so i know hes talking to either mac or sam then he starts giving me all this grunt work to do crap jobs thatll keep me tied to the station house for two or three hours says hes got to do stuff i wait until im sure hes gone then i drive by the cottage and what do you think i see i hope mia said youre about to tell me and put an end to this playbyplay the patrol car and macs rover ripley announced i grabbed nell and now im grabbing you because im telling you theyre not playing poker or watching dirty movies in there no theyre putting something together without us mia agreed too manly for the little women if they are nell said zacks going to be very sorry lets just go find out shall we mia yanked her car keys out of her desk ill tell lulu ive got to go out and ill be right behind you mac hunkered down on the ground ran his portable scanner positive energy all the way he muttered any negativity has been thoroughly cleansed next time call me first i could really use a sample it was a little late for science experiments sam told him never too late for science can you sketch the manifestation i cant sketch a stick figure it was the same image mia described the black wolf massive size with the mark of the pentagram it was smart to brand him when they had him down on the beach last winter mac sat back on his haunches makes id simple and its diminished his power sam rolled his shoulders sure as hell wasnt any pussycat last night he sucked the extra punch out of something probably you bet you were pissed huh the fucker tried to drive mia off a cliff what do you think i think the emotional turmoil we discussed the other night is a primary element of the equation if youd i think zack interrupted sam should get that shoulder looked at then we should stop jerking off with theories and go after this bastard if it can hurt sam it can hurt somebody else im not having it run loose on my island youre not going to be able to track it down and shoot it like a rabid dog mac told him i can sure as hell try it wont go after anyone whos not connected sam frowned at the unscarred ground hed spent most of the night thinking it through fact is i dont think it can no exactly mac straightened this entity needs to feed off the power and the emotions of those of us who are tied to the original circle a lot of islanders have ties to the original circle however diluted zack pointed out yes but it doesnt want them or need them hes right sam told zack it has only one focus one purpose now and it cant waste time or energy by scattering it its magic is limited but its canny it fed on ripleys emotions before this time it fed on mine it wont happen again oh yeah youve always been a real eventempered sort zack muttered you wanted it to go for you it worked sam pointed out the thing is i didnt hurt it that bad it shouldve come at me again another charge and i couldve gotten it into the circle i couldve held it there its not for you mac said simply fuck that im not standing back while it waits for a chance to go for mias throat thats what it wants thats what i felt from it itll have to get through me first and thats not going to happen she can make whatever the hell choice shes going to make but in the meantime im going to rip its goddamn heart out see zack said after a beat real eventempered kiss ass okay okay mac stepped between them patted the tensed shoulders of each man for peace lets just keep our heads isnt this sweet mias voice dripped honey the boys are out playing in the woods shit zack muttered after one look at his wifes angry eyes busted ripley hooked her thumbs in her belt tapped her fingers on her pockets and strode forward and got up in macs face lucy you got some spaining to do no point in hassling them i asked them to come oh well get to you ripley promised sam but theres a natural pecking order here mia stepped forward and felt the ripples of power what happened here you might as well spill it zack advised sam take my word for it ive dealt with these three more than you have lets go inside and mia simply slapped a hand on sams chest before he could move past her what happened here she repeated i took a walk in the woods her gaze shifted rested briefly on the ground you used the circle it was there part of her resented that hed been able to use what was hers what belonged to the three it tightened the connection made his link to her to nell and ripley unarguable all right she said calmly enough what happened i ran into your demon wolf from hell you she held up a hand more to stop herself than to keep sam silent because her first reaction was gutwrenching fear she willed it aside not away that was beyond her and made herself think and felt fury rise up and strangle fear you called him you came out here in the middle of the night alone and called him out like some swaggering gunslinger he hadnt known she still had that much temper in her or that it could as always trigger his own i like to think it was more gary cooperesque this is a joke to you a joke fury all but swallowed her whole you would dare call up whats mine you can stand between me and whats mine to do while i what shrink aside wringing my hands whatever it takes youre not my shield not my savior whats inside me isnt less than whats in you she shoved him back a step i wont tolerate your interference youre meddling because it makes you feel like a hero and take it easy mia even as zack spoke the keen edge of her gaze cut to him raked over his face recognizing a woman ready to bite out a mans heart zack merely held up both hands stepped aside sam he decided was on his own do you think i need your help she rounded on sam again drilling a finger into his chest stop jabbing at me do you think because i lack a penis im incapable of fighting for whats mine so you pull your idiotic manly display then call your idiot men friends so you can discuss how to protect the helpless women ive never seen her like his nell whispered and watched fascinated as mia shoved sam back another step doesnt happen often ripley spoke out of the corner of her mouth really cool when it does she glanced up as clouds black as a fresh bruise boiled into the sky overhead man she is supremely pissed i said stop jabbing at me sam curled his fingers around the fist she was currently slapping against his chest if youre finished with your snit careful he warned as thunder bellowed you arrogant stupid insulting ill show you a snit she used her free hand intending to shove him again and saw the wince of pain as she bumped his shoulder what have you done weve just covered that take off your shirt he worked up a leer well baby if you want to finish things that way ive got no problem with it but weve got an audience she solved the matter by reaching up and ripping his shirt open hey hed forgotten how fast she could move a mistake the claw marks on his shoulder were raw and angry with a little sound of distress nell started forward before ripley stopped her shell handle it you moved out of the circle fear shuddered back to twist painfully with temper you deliberately opened yourself to attack it was a test with sorely bruised dignity sam yanked what was left of his shirt back in place it worked she spun away from him and since zack was the closest he took her first swipe do you forget that it was nell who brought madness to its knees even when it held a knife to her throat no he spoke quietly its not something ill ever forget and you she rounded on mac you watched ripley wage her war against the dark and beat it back i know mac shoved the sensor her angry energy had fried into his pocket no one here underestimates what any of you are capable of dont you her eyes scorched each one of them in turn before she stepped back to stand with nell and ripley we are the three she threw up her hands and light bright as fire shot from her fingertips and the power here is beyond you she turned on her heel and strode away well mac blew out a breath wow real scientific ace ripley tucked her hands into her pockets and nodded at sam you got her stirred up so youd better find a way to smooth it out if youre stupid enough to do what you did last night then youre stupid enough to go after her when shes shooting live ammo i guess youre right shed nearly reached the edge of the woods when he caught up to her just wait a damn minute sam reached for her arm then hissed as the electric shock stung his fingers cut it out dont touch me im going to do a hell of a lot more than touch you in a minute but he kept his hands to himself until shed reached her car she yanked the door open he slammed it shut taking off isnt going to solve anything youre right she tossed back her hair thats your usual solution pain kicked in his gut but he nodded and youve just recently demonstrated that youre so much smarter and more mature lets finish this out away from innocent bystanders lets take a drive you want to take a drive fine get in she pulled the door open again slid behind the wheel when he was beside her she eased onto the road she kept her speed down as she cut through the village and the minute she hit the coast road she let it rip she wanted speed and wind and the keen edge of danger all of those things would help carve away some of the anger and help her find her center again her tires squealed as she shot into turns and because she felt sam tense beside her she poured on more speed she whipped the wheel and the car shuddered as it clung to the road inches from the edge of the island he made some sound in his throat deliberately she sent him an icy look problem no not he thought if you considered driving at ninety on a road that curved off into nothing with a very pissedoff witch behind the wheel your idea of fun as the road climbed he kept his eyes trained on the stone house on the cliff it was at the moment his nirvana all he had to do was live to get there when she pulled into the drive he had to take a few deep breaths to get his lungs working again point taken he said and resisted wiping his damp hands on his jeans youre capable of handling yourself even when your control meters shaky thank you so much sarcasm dripped like acid as she stepped out of the car come inside she snapped it out that wound needs tending though he wasnt sure it was wise to put his flesh and blood in her hands at the moment he followed her up the walk the place looks great im not interested in small talk then dont say anything back he suggested he went inside with her the colors were rich the wood polished and the air alive with warm fragrant welcome shed made changes he noted subtle ones mia ones mixing elegance with charm exquisite taste with simplicity though she strode straight back toward the kitchen he took his time it might give both of them a chance to cool off shed kept the heavy carved furniture that had been passed down for generations but shed added plush sinkin textures there were rugs he didnt recognize but their age told him theyd been rolled up in some attic and had been unearthed when the house had come under mias control she used candles and flowers generously bowls of colored rocks chunks of glittering crystals and the canny little mystical figures shed always collected and books there were books in every room he passed when he stepped into the kitchen she was already taking jars out of a cupboard there were gleaming copper pots hanks of drying herbs in their delicate faded tones and scents the broom by her back door was very old the restaurantgrade range very new you had some work done in here he tapped his fingers against the surface of the dovegray counter yes sit down take off your shirt instead he walked to the windows looked out over her gardens its like an illustration out of a book of fairy tales i enjoy flowers sit down please we both have work to get back to and id like to see to this i did what i could with it last night it just has to heal she merely stood staring at him a jar the color of poppies in her hand all right all right maybe youll rip a bandage off your petticoat with little grace he shrugged out of his torn shirt and sat at her kitchen table the sight of those raw wounds knotted her stomach she hated seeing anything anyone in pain what did you use on it she bent down sniffed wrinkled her nose garlic obvious it did the trick hed have sawed his tongue in half before admitting the wound was throbbing like a bad tooth hardly be still open up she ordered ive no intention of hurting you until after ive healed you open he did what she asked and felt her magic slide inside him even as he felt her fingers coated with soothing balm slide over his abraded flesh he could see it the warm red of her energy taste it sharp and sweet like the first bite of a succulent plum the heavy scent of her of poppies clouded his senses drifting he heard her quiet chant without thinking he turned his head rubbed his cheek against her forearm i see you in my sleep i hear your voice inside my head as he slid along the silk of her power he spoke in gaelic the language of his blood i ache for you even when im with you always you when he felt her slipping out of him he struggled to hold on but she slid away and he was left blinking in confusion and swaying in the kitchen chair ssh her fingers were gentle as she stroked his hair take a moment as his mind cleared he fisted his hands on the table you took me under you had no right it wouldve been painful otherwise shed never been able to stand back from someones pain turning from him she capped her jars carefully gave herself time to settle easing his pain had brought on her own his gaelic words had bruised her heart and youre hardly one to throw rights in my face now i cant fully erase the wounds thats beyond my capabilities but theyll heal quickly enough now he angled his head to look at his shoulder he could barely see the marks and there was no discomfort the surprise of that had him studying her youve improved ive spent considerable time exploring and refining my gifts she replaced her jars then simply lowered her hands to the counter im so angry with you so i need the air she crossed to the door and walked outside she went to the pool watched the fish dart gold beneath the lily pads as she heard him come up behind her she cupped her elbows with her hands then be angry spit and swear it wont change a thing i have a part in this mia i am part of this whether you like it or not impulse and machismo have no part in this whether you like it or not if she thought he would apologize for what hed done she was going to have a long wait i saw an opportunity a possibility and i took a calculated risk she spun around again its my risk to take mine not yours so damn sure of everything youve always been so damn sure dont you ever consider there might be another way i dont question what i know here she pressed fists to her belly and what i know here and to her heart you cant take whats mine to do and if you could if i could i wouldnt permit it its my birthright and mine he countered if i had been able to end it last night mia it would be done she was more weary than angry now you know better you know she pushed at her hair wandered away down a garden path where spearing blades of iris fanned out waiting for the blooming time change one thing potentially change a thousand others move one piece of the whole indiscriminately and destroy the whole there are rules sam and reasons for them you were always better at rules than i was there was a sting of bitterness in the words and she could taste it even as he did how can you expect me to stand to the side do you think i cant see youre not sleeping or eating well i can feel you fighting off the fear and it rips at me shed turned back as he spoke how well she remembered that dark anger in him that restless passion it had drawn her to the boy and god help her it drew her to the man if i wasnt afraid id be stupid she pointed out im not stupid you cant go behind my back this way you cant challenge again what comes for me i want your word you cant have it lets try to be sensible no he took her arms yanked her against him lets try something else hot and nearly brutal his mouth took hers and it was like a branding shed pushed and scraped at his feelings even as shed eased his wound shed opened him tangled herself inside him only to leave him empty again now he needed something would take something back his arms pinned hers leaving her unable to struggle or accept leaving her helplessly trapped in a kiss that was all hunger little heart the thrill of that her own pleasure in it shocked and shamed her still she could have stopped him she needed only her mind for that but it was so crowded with him just as her body was crowded with need i cant stand it he tore his mouth from hers to race his lips over her face be with me or damn me but do it now she lifted her head until their eyes met and if i told you to go to take your hands off me and go he ran his hand up her back into her hair fisted it there dont shed thought she wanted him to suffer now that she could see he was she couldnt bear it for either of them then come inside and well be with each other ten they made it to the kitchen before they dived at each other pressed against the back door she let her system rage under his hands oh to be touched again stroked by hard hands so foreign and familiar the wild and wicked freedom of it gushed into her flooded away questions worries doubts to be wanted like this again devoured by desperation to have her own needs matched by equally insatiable ones she pulled his tattered shirt aside and filled her own hands with hot smooth flesh she bit at him craving the taste fueling herself on it she whispered halfcrazed demands as they stumbled out of the kitchen something fell a musical tinkle of glass as they bumped a table in the hall little shards of what had been a crystal faeries wings were crushed to glittery dust under his feet she couldnt breathe couldnt think her lips skimmed over the wounds on his shoulder neither of them noticed when the marks faded away touch me dont stop touching me hed have cheerfully died first he filled his hands with her curves slender lines felt his own primitive thrill when she quivered against him his blood surged a primal beat when her breath caught then released on a moan he slid his hands up her legs groaning at the glorious length of them at the heat that gathered around the witch mark that rode high on her thigh with no thought of finesse he tugged impatiently at the thin barrier of silk i have to and plunged his fingers into her oh god sweet god his face was buried in her hair when she erupted again again again savagery took over so that he fixed his teeth on her throat driving her while her body bucked and shuddered impossibly hot wonderfully wet gloriously soft he found her mouth again swallowed her sobbing breaths they dragged each other up the stairs with fast and urgent fingers he fumbled with tore at the tiny buttons that ranged down the back of her dress snapped threads exposed flesh i need to see you to see you the dress slithered to the floor and was left behind at the top of the steps he started to pull her to the right no no nearly sobbing with desperation she dragged at the button of his jeans this way now she circled him to the left shivering when he snapped open the clasp of her bra when he filled his hands with her breasts soon his mouth hot and hungry replaced his hands let me just let me half mad with her he pulled her arms over her head feasted mia let her head fall back and relished the helpless and heavy sensation of being ravished alive she was so brutally alive even as her heart raged against his greedy mouth her body wept for more when he gripped her hips her arms locked around him in taut possessive ropes the bed was steps away but it might have been miles his eyes pure green burned into the dark smoke of hers for an instant it seemed the world went still yes she said yes then he drove himself into her they took each other where they stood and took hard and fast the race through pleasure toward bliss stole breath and reason as they mated with a kind of willful violence her nails scored his back his fingers dug bruises on her skin and still they pushed each other for more their mouths met a wild and frenzied feeding and their bodies plunged relentlessly the climax raked her like claws one long swipe that sliced through her system and laid her bare helpless against it she surrendered and felt him plunge after her sweaty weak quivering they held each other up they swayed there slick bruised flesh to flesh lowering his forehead to hers sam struggled to draw in air his body felt as if it had fallen off a mountain and landed in a pool of hot melted gold im a little dizzy she managed me too lets see if we can get to the bed they stumbled through the haze and fell on mias ancient fourposter together lying flat on their backs they both stared dazed at the ceiling it wasnt he realized precisely the sexual reunion hed envisioned for them his fantasy had involved seduction sophistication and a great deal more finesse on his part i was in a little bit of a hurry he told her no problem you know the weight i mentioned youd put on hmmm the sound was a low warning it really works for me he shifted his hand just enough to skim the side of her breast i mean it really works you filled out a bit yourself he let himself float studied the mural on her ceiling in the night sky stars glowed and faeries flew you moved your bedroom yes good thing i didnt follow the impulse to climb up the trellis the other night because the image brought her back to nights hed done just that she sighed it had been a long time a very long time since her body had felt so loose so used it made her want to curl up like a cat and purr she would have done so once with him once they would have turned to each other and tangled together would have slept like kittens after a romp those days were over she thought but as romps went theyd done very very well i have to get back to work she said so do i they turned their heads looked at each other and grinned do you know the beauty of owning your own business she asked him yeah he rolled over until his mouth hovered a breath from hers nobody can dock our pay but that didnt mean you got off scotfree when mia strolled back into the bookstore lulu took one look at her and knew you did it with him lulu hissing mia scanned the area for customers if you think its not going to show and people arent going to gab about it then sex gave you instant brain damage be that as it may im not going to stand here and discuss it at the cash register with her head high she started toward the stairs and was immediately waylaid by gladys macey hello there mia dont you look pretty today hello mrs macey mia angled her head to read the titles of the books gladys had picked up youll have to let me know what you think of that one she tapped a finger against a current bestseller i havent read it yet ill be sure to do that i heard you had dinner over at the hotel gladys beamed into mias face sam logans making some changes over there im told the food as good as ever yes i enjoyed it then mia looked over her shoulder at lulu considering lulus voice and gladyss ears there was no doubt the opening comment had been heard and digested would you like to know if sam and i had sex she asked pleasantly now honey gladys gave mia a motherly pat dont get all dandered up besides its hard to look at you and not see right off youve got a nice healthy glow about you hes a handsome boy troublemaker lulu muttered under her breath and proved that gladyss ears were well tuned oh now lu that boy never caused any more trouble than any of the others around here and less than some the others didnt come sniffing around my girl well they certainly did gladys shook her head calling back to lulu as if mia was invisible or deaf there wasnt a boy on the island who didnt sniff around her fact is sam was the only one who had her sniffing back i always thought they made a pretty couple excuse me mia held up a finger id like to remind both of you that the boy and the girl who did the sniffing are now fullgrown adults but you still make a pretty couple gladys insisted giving up mia leaned over brushed her lips over gladyss cheek you have a sweet heart and a wagging tongue she thought as she walked up to her office word would spread like a rash over the island that sam logan and mia devlin were at it again since she didnt know how she felt about that but could do nothing to circumvent it mia put the matter in a corner of her mind and went back to work on her proposal by four ignoring the stares she sailed across the street and into the hotel where she dropped the envelope containing her proposal at the lobby desk with a request that it be delivered to mr logan as soon as possible then she sailed out again to make up for the time shed lost she closed herself in the stockroom and concentrated on business she organized rearranged and put together a list of inventory that needed replenishing the solstice always brought a flood of tourists to the island it paid to be ready for them armed with the stock list she rose then quickly sat again as a wave of dizziness swamped her foolish she berated herself careless shed had nothing but a half a muffin all day she got to her feet thinking shed pick up a bowl of soup in the café and an image swam into her brain evan remington stood by a barred window smiling and his eyes were as empty as a dolls but he turned his head slowly so slowly and those eyes began to glow red and filled with something that wasnt human she had to force herself not to run to pull her calm around her like a cloak as the image faded she left her work behind i have an errand she told lulu as she breezed out of the store ill be back when i can going and coming lulu muttered mia walked straight down to the station house pausing when she had to exchange a word with an acquaintance the streets she noted were already full of tourists they strolled and shopped cruised the island looking for the perfect picnic spot a new vista they would crowd into the restaurants at night or go back to their rental houses to cook up fish brought fresh from the docks shops were running springintosummer sales and the pizza parlor was offering two free toppings with the purchase of a second large pie she watched pete stubens drive past in his pickup with his beloved dog riding shotgun ripleys young cousin dennis flashed by on the opposite sidewalk hanging ten on his skateboard his red sox jersey flapped like a flag it was all so normal she thought so easy and right and real she was going to do everything in her power to keep it that way zack was at his desk when she walked in and immediately sprang to his feet now mia he began im not here to pin your ears back thats a relief nell already took care of that to prove it he rubbed them i would like to say we werent going behind your backs we were just looking into a situation its my job to deal with trouble on the island we can debate that later can you check on evan remington check on make sure hes where hes supposed to be what the progress of his treatment is the prognosis his recent behavioral patterns he started to ask her why but the look on her face told him to answer first then ask questions first i can tell you hes still locked up and hes going to stay that way i make it my business to call a couple of contacts of mine every week he angled his head i assume you dont consider that little chore out of my scope dont get snotty can you get progress reports i dont have access to his medical records if thats what you mean id need a warrant and cause to request one whats the problem hes still part of this padded cell or not zack was around the desk in two strides and had his hand wrapped firm on mias arm is he a threat to nell no what was it like to be loved so utterly she wondered once shed thought she knew not directly not like before but hes being used i wonder if he knows it it was essential to find out wheres ripley out doing her job his grip tightened is she in trouble zack both nell and ripley have done what they were meant to do but i need to talk to them would you tell them both to come up to the house tonight by seven if they can now zacks grip lightened to a caress and ran up to her shoulder youre in trouble no her voice was clear and calm im in control she believed it absolutely just as she understood the value of that faith and that sense of self doubts questions fears would only diminish power when she needed it most the vision had come unbidden and with some physical distress she wouldnt take such a thing lightly she prepared carefully it was not a time for rash behavior or showmanship though she often appreciated the flash and the flare it seemed now that much of what had happened that day had been meant to prepare her her purging of temper that morning the fasting and yes the sex ridding the body of frustration and celebrating one of its more joyful purposes would only aid her in what was to come the herbs and oils for her ritual bath were chosen with deliberation rose for psychic power and divination carnation for protection iris for wisdom that she might understand what was shown to her by the light of candles inscribed for her quest she immersed herself washing body and hair cleansing her mind using creams shed made herself she coated her skin before slipping into a long loose robe of white she selected her charms and pendant carefully dendritic agate for protection in travel amethyst to sharpen her third eye she hung malachite from her ears for vision questing she gathered her tools her divination wand with moonstone at the tip incense and candles bowls and sea salt knowing that she might need it she selected a tonic for restorative energy then she went into her garden to gather peace and wait for her sisters they came together and found her sitting on a stone bench beside a bed of nodding columbine i need your help she said ill tell you on the way to the clearing they were barely into the forest the light dimming with dusk when ripley stopped you shouldnt be the one to do this a flight leaves you too open too vulnerable which is why i need my circle mia countered i should do it nell touched mias arm evans most directly connected to me which is exactly why you shouldnt do it ripley argued the connections too close ive already done this once so i should do it again you flew without preparation without protection and you were harmed reminding herself that there was patience in reason mia continued to walk the vision came to me unbidden this is for me to do and im fully prepared you dont have enough control as yet she said to ripley and you little sister not enough experience even disregarding both those facts this is for me we all know it so lets not waste any more time i dont like it ripley said especially after what happened to sam last night unlike some men i dont have to prove my heroism my body stays within the circle she set her bag down in the clearing and began to cast the circle nell lit the candles she was calm because calm was needed tell me what to do if something goes wrong nothing will mia assured her if if then you pull me back she looked up and saw the glow in the trees as the moon began its rise well begin she disrobed standing in the arms of the young night in nothing but crystals holding out her hands for her sisters she began the chant that would free her consciousness from the shell of her body and let her fly open window open door i seek to see i seek to soar over sea and into sky my spirit lifts my senses fly it is within my gift of power to command this airy hour and to ask that what i see bring no harm to them or me as i will so mote it be there was a slow and lovely sense of weightlessness of lifting out of the shell that held the spirit bound to the earth she floated free of it a bird rising on the wing and for a moment only allowed herself to embrace the glory of it such a gift was golden but she knew the ribbons that tethered her to the earth could be carelessly snapped even for the thrill of flight she wouldnt trade her reality she beamed over the sea where the starlight was reflected like bits of sparkling glass scattered on black velvet from deep within its depths came whale song and the music carried her to the far shore the buzz of traffic conversations within houses the scent of trees and of dinners cooking all swirled below her as life drove forward she heard the outraged cry of a newborn pushed into life and the last sigh of the dying the quick soft brush as souls passed on their way she kept the light of them around her and sought the dark he had such hate in him the breadth of it was infinite and layered and not she realized as she drew closer all his own what was in evan remington was a rancid mix one that offended the senses but she could see as she watched the orderlies the guards the doctors move through the facility where remington was imprisoned that none of them caught the underlying stench she let the thoughts the voices of the others bleed away and focused on remington and what used him he was in his room for the night a cell far removed from the plush surroundings hed once commanded she saw he had changed considerably from the night in the woods when nell had defeated him his hair was thinner his face rounder with the jowls beginning to sag beneath deep sharp lines of dissipation no longer handsome no longer smooth his face had begun to mirror what hed hidden inside him for so many years he wore loose orange coveralls and paced his cell like a soldier on sentry duty they cant keep me here they cant keep me here i have work im going to miss my plane where is that bitch he spun away from his cell door and his pale eyes searched the small space his mouth folded down as if in mild annoyance shes late again ill have to punish her she leaves me no choice someone from outside shouted at him to shut the fuck up but he continued to pace continued to rant cant she see i have business i have responsibilities shes not going to get away with it who the hell does she think she is whores every one of them whores suddenly like a puppet on a string his head jerked up and his eyes were madness slicked thin over hate madness began to glow red dont you know i see you whorebitch ill kill you before its done the blast of power slammed into her a fist in the belly she felt herself waver then bore down youre pathetic you use a madman to horde your power i need only myself your death will be slow and painful ill keep you alive long enough so that you see it all destroyed weve already beaten you twice she sensed the next whip of energy and deflected it but it took all of her strength and she felt her link shudder as remingtons head changed into that of a snapping wolf and the third times the charm she finished and pulled herself back she poured back into her body staggered and might have fallen if nell and ripley hadnt supported her are you hurt at the urgency in nells voice mia struggled to settle again mia no im not hurt you were gone too damn long ripley told her just long enough so you say still gripping mias hand ripley jerked her head weve got company as the visions cleared out of her mind mia saw sam standing just outside the circle he wore black the long coat swirling in the night air finish it and close the circle his voice was brisk businesslike before you collapse i know what to do she reached for the tonic nell was already pouring into a cup because she was not yet steady she took the cup with both hands and she drank until she no longer felt as if her body was a mist ready to be swept away by the wind close the circle sam demanded or i come in regardless ignoring him now she offered thanks for a safe flight and with her sisters closed the circle it continues to use remington she slipped into her robe and belted it though her skin felt as thin as fragile as the silk more like a vessel than a source but still some of both it fills him up with hatred of women of female power then uses the mix to feed its own energy its potent but not without vulnerability she reached down for her bag and when she straightened swayed thats enough in one motion sam swept her into his arms she needs to sleep this off i know what to do for her hes right ripley put a hand on nells shoulder as sam carried mia out of the clearing he knows what she needs mias head spun infuriating her i just need to get my balance i cant get it unless im on my feet there was a time you werent so twitchy about needing help i wouldnt be twitchy if i needed help and i dont need you to she bit off the words im sorry and youre right boy you must be shaky she let her head rest on his shoulder im queazy i know baby well fix it hows the headache its not bad really id have come back sturdier but i had to come back fast damn it sam this dizziness is gray began to swim at the edges of her vision its not passing off im going under thats all right go ahead for once she did exactly as he suggested and didnt argue when she went limp in his arms he continued to carry her toward the house he would curse her later he told himself when she could fight back for now he took her inside and up to her bed knowing she had to sleep long and deep didnt make it any easier for sam to see her so pale so still in the shadowy light of her bedroom he knew what could be done and tending to her at least helped keep his mind on the practical he knew what protective oils and creams shed used he could smell them on her skin after he laid her in bed he gathered the proper incense and candles to bolster what shed already used she always had been an organized soul he thought as he checked the shelves and cupboards in her tower room for the supplies he needed even here she had flowers clay pots of violets and books he scanned the books selected one on healing spells and charms in case he needed to refresh his memory in her kitchen he found the herbs he needed and though it had been some time since hed practiced any kitchen magic he steeped a pot of rue tea to aid her in spiritual cleansing she was deeply asleep when he returned he lighted the candles and incense then sitting beside her slid his mind into hers mia you need to drink then you can rest he trailed his fingers over her cheeks then brushed his mouth over her mouth her eyes opened but the gray was blurred she was limp as water as he lifted her head and put the cup to her lips now you drink and heal in sleep dreams will take you far and deep through the night and into the light he brushed the hair from her face as he eased her down again do you want me to come with you no im alone here youre not he lifted her hand to his lips as her eyes closed again ill wait for you she let go of him and slid into dreams she saw herself a child sitting in the rose garden her parents had neglected butterflies fluttered in the palms of her upturned hands as if her fingers were petals she and ripley so young and eager lighting the beltane fire in the clearing sprawled on the floor in front of the fire while lulu sat in a chair knitting walking on the beach with sam on a hot close summer night and the beat beat beat of her heart as he drew her up drew her in the world standing still holding its breath in that magical instant before their first kiss the feel of tears the hot flood of them as theyd gushed out of her shattered heart hed walked away so carelessly left her broken and grieving as she stood by a pretty pool of early spring violets im not coming back with that one statement hed broken her to pieces dreams floated in and out and she with them she saw herself standing in her summer garden teaching nell how to stir the air she felt the joy of clasping hands at last with both of her sisters in a circle of unity and power she saw the soft colors and sweetness of nells wedding the bright promise of ripleys she watched as they began yet another circle without her as was meant to be and she was alone fate moves us and then we choose she stood on the cliffs now with the one who was called fire mia turned looked into the face so like her own i regret no choice ive made mia said nor did i nor can i now to die for love is a poor choice the one called fire lifted her brows and there was an innate arrogance in the gesture in the night wind her hair streamed like flames yet it was mine if i had chosen differently daughter perhaps you would not be here now would not be what you are so i have no regrets will you say the same at the end of your time i cherish my gift and bring no harm i live my life and live it well as did i she spread her arms we hold this place but the time grows short see she gestured to where the fog boiled along the edge of the rocks it craves most what it cannot have and what it cannot have will in the end defeat it what is there to do that i havent done mia demanded whats left for me everything with that last word she vanished and mia was alone lulu was alone sleeping deeply under her hodgepodge quilt floating on dreams unaware of the dark mists gathering outside her house rising up to slither around her windows and through the cracks she stirred she shivered when that cold mist slid over her snuck under the covers to crawl over her skin with a little sound of protest she burrowed deeper under the quilt but found no warmth she heard the baby crying long wails of misery in a mothers automatic response she tossed the covers aside rose in the dark and started out of the bedroom okay okay im coming in the dream she walked sleepily down the long corridor of the house on the cliff she felt the smooth wood under her feet and not the rough grass of her own yard as she left her house moving through the thickening fog her eyes were open but she saw the door to the babys room and not the street where she walked the quiet houses she passed she didnt see or sense the black wolf stalking behind her she reached out opened the door that wasnt there as she trudged around the corner toward the beach the crib was empty and the babys wails became screams of terror mia she ran hurling herself across high street which was a maze of corridors in her mind where are you she ran breath heaving fear rising as she pounded on locked doors and raced toward the sound of the babys cries she fell scoring her hands on the sand of the beach and feeling her fingers dig into thick carpet she was weeping calling for her baby as she pushed herself to her feet swayed then raced on in the dream she flew down the main staircase and out into the black night then plunged into the sea the surf knocked her back knocked her down but in a blind fury to find and protect her child she fought her way up again pushed her way through the waves even as the water closed over her head her eyes were open and the babys screams pounded in her ears there was a great weight on her chest and the sharp taste of vomit in her throat she gagged heaved again shes breathing its okay lulu take it easy her eyes burned refused to focus through the haze over them she made out zacks face water dripped from his hair and onto her cheeks what the hell is this she demanded and her voice came out in a croak that hurt her throat oh god lulu nell knelt on the sand beside her grabbed her hand and pressed it to her own cheek thank god shes still in shock ripley nudged her brother aside and spread a blanket over lulu shock my ass lulu managed to sit up coughed violently enough that she considered passing out but she bore down and stared at the faces surrounding her nell was weeping openly and mac soaking wet crouched beside her ripley sat on the sand now and with her brothers help arranged the blanket over lulus shoulders wheres mia she demanded shes at home shes with sam nell told her shes safe okay lulu began to draw slow and careful breaths what the hell am i doing out here soaking wet in the middle of the night good question zack considered a moment then decided flat truth was best nell woke up and knew you were in trouble so did i ripley added id barely fallen asleep when i heard you shouting in my head for mia then the vision hit like a freight train she glanced at nell then i saw you walking out of your house saw the fog closing in and the black dog nell murmured and waited for ripley to nod stalking you i was afraid we wouldnt get to you in time lulu held up a hand a moment trying to clear her head i walked into the water for christs sake it lured you there mac replied do you know how i had a dream thats all a nightmare walked in my sleep lets get her home and warm nell said but ripley shook her head not yet you damn near drowned in your sleep her tone turned sharp and angry so dont pull the stubborn crap on me if nell and i hadnt linked in wed have found you dead in the morning washed up in the fucking tide because ripleys voice broke she clenched her teeth and spoke through them my brother and my man pulled you out and zack pumped the life back into you dont you dare brush this off stop it now stop that crying shaken lulu gave ripleys arm a little shake i just had a bad spell thats all nothing more than that to it it lured you here mac repeated thats just bull but she started to shiver again from a cold inside her bones why would this thing want to hurt me ive got no power it hurts you mac said it hurts mia youre a part of her lu so youre part of this what wouldve happened to the island to the children the sisters left behind if they hadnt had the nurse to tend them and we shouldve taken that into account before it was stupid not to careless we wont be careless anymore nell wrapped her arm around lulus shoulders shes cold we need to get her home she let herself be carried let herself be pampered even tucked into bed she felt her age and then some but she wasnt done yet i dont want mia to know about this what ripley jammed her fists onto her hips a neardeath experience rattle your brain think about what your man said back on the beach hurt me hurt her if shes worried about me shes distracted with her glasses back in place she turned to mac and saw him clearly she needs all her strength all her wits to finish this have i got that right she needs to be strong but then why muck her up there was nothing nothing more vital than mias wellbeing how do we know this didnt happen tonight just to make her upset and worried about me so shes vulnerable whats dones done and telling her doesnt change it she could help protect you nell put in i can take care of myself the minute the statement was out she caught zacks lifted eyebrows and huffed out a breath been doing it for longer than any of youve been alive added to that ive got me a big strong sheriff a smart scientist and a couple of witches looking out for me she may be right about this ripley thought of how pale how fragile mia had been when shed come back from the flight lets at least agree to keep it to ourselves until telling mia has a purpose nell and i can put protection around the house you go right ahead lulu invited i can set up a sensor mac put in so if theres any energy change youd be alerted sounds like a plan lulu firmed her jaw mias the target nothing and no ones going to use me to hurt her thats a promise eleven the candles burned low and the air was full of fragrance and soft light when she woke she felt him there almost before she felt herself the warmth of his hand over hers the weight of his worry for an instant only the years vanished and her heart was light with love what shed felt once what she felt now collided and dissolved before she could hold either here drink this as he had hours before he lifted her head held a cup to her lips but this time she sniffed speculatively before she sipped hyssop good choice how do you feel well enough better id say than you there was no need for you to sit up all night the cat that had curled beside her now slithered under her hand for stroking what time is it sunrise sam rose now began to extinguish the candles you only had about nine hours you could probably use more no she sat up shook back her hair im awake and starving he glanced back she sat in the old bed her face flushed with sleep the black cat in her lap he wanted to slide into bed with her just to hold just to rest just to be ill fix you something youll cook breakfast i can manage eggs and toast he answered as he stalked out of the room cranky mia said to isis the cat swished her tail then leaped off the bed to trot out after sam he brewed coffee first in hopes that a strong shot of caffeine would clear his head and improve his mood he didnt question the fact that his tender feelings his steady concern of the night had jumped straight to annoyance the minute shed awakened and looked at him a man needed some defense while the coffeemaker grumbled he turned on the cold water tap in the sink and dunked his head under the flow and rapped his head smartly against the faucet when the cat brushed up against his legs he saw stars swore then smacked the water off and came up dripping when mia walked in he was standing glaring at the cat with water running down his face she picked up a fresh dish towel and passed it to him youre welcome to use the shower if youd like to do more than soak your head after exchanging a decidedly female glance with the cat mia opened the door to let her out rather than trust himself to speak sam wrenched open the refrigerator took out a carton of eggs mia reached down to get a skillet out of a cupboard then held out a hand why dont i take care of this i said id fix some damn eggs so ill fix some damn eggs all right complacently she set the skillet on a burner before moving over to get down two mugs she poured trying to keep her lips from twitching while sam slammed around her kitchen but the first sip of coffee made her eyes water god well this is strong enough to go ten rounds with the champ sam slapped an egg on the side of a bowl any other complaints no she decided to be broadminded and not mention the bits of shell that had gone into the bowl along with the egg sipping delicately she wandered to the back door again and opened it to the morning air its going to rain barefoot her white robe billowing she stepped outside to look at her garden and leave sam to brood wind chimes tinkled as she wound along the paths there were always surprises a new bloom just opened a bud just hazed with color the blend of continuity and change was one of the great appeals of the garden for her she glanced back toward the kitchen the boy shed loved was now the man fixing her breakfast continuity and change she thought with a sigh she supposed under it all that was one of sam logans great appeals for her and because she remembered hed held her hand while she slept she broke off a tightly budded peony curving her hand over it she encouraged the bud to unfurl and free its soft fragrant pink petals brushing it against her cheek she went back to the house he was at the stove looking wonderfully out of his element his legs were spread and the spatula held like a weapon in his hand he was burning the eggs foolishly moved she crossed to him and gently turned off the flame she kissed his cheek handed him the flower thank you for watching over me youre welcome he turned away to reach for plates then simply laid his forehead against the glass doors of her cupboard damn it mia damn it why didnt you tell me what you were going to do why didnt you call me ive gotten out of the habit of calling you he straightened a mix of anger and hurt enveloping him i dont say that to hurt you she spread her hands i dont it simply is im used to doing things my way and on my own fine fine but it wasnt he rattled plates as he dragged them out of the cupboard when its you its just being who you are and doing what you do but when its me im going behind your back she opened her mouth then was forced to close it again and clear her throat you have a point she walked by him to get jam out of the refrigerator however what you did on your own was step into my territory risk bodily harm then call out the troops your territory isnt exclusive and you risked bodily harm thats a matter of debate i didnt do this behind your back not deliberately in hindsight ill admit your presence in the circle would have been valuable she set the toast stonecold and crisp at the edges on the table youre a better witch than you are a cook youre a hell of a lot cockier than you used to be he countered and you always were cocky confident she corrected you were cocky a fine distinction he sat with her scooping half the eggs onto his plate half on hers the peony lay pretty and pink between them he took his first bite these are terrible she sampled tasting scorched egg and bits of shell yes yes they are when he grinned at her she laughed and went right on eating he took her up on the shower and ran the spray hot to ease muscles stiff from the nights vigil he supposed theyd called a truce a moratorium of sorts over lousy eggs and cold toast maybe he thought theyd taken a tentative step toward being friends again hed missed that part of them too the easy silences the shared laughter hed known when she was sad often before she knew it herself hed felt the thousand little pinpricks of her hurt whenever her parents had blithely benevolently ignored the child theyd made between them even before he and she had become lovers theyd been a part of each other and how could he explain to her that it had been the link the absolute and unquestioned link in the chain of their destinies that had driven him to break the tie she didnt ask and he didnt say he thought that was for the best at least for now at least until they were friends again the muscles in his belly contracted when she stepped in behind him slipped her arms around him pressed her wet body against his back i thought you might share she nipped playfully at his shoulder this time they were fated to reverse the process lovers first he turned and fisting his hands in her hair dragged her with him under the pounding spray you have the water too hot she told him turning her head as his mouth rubbed along the side of her throat i needed hot she picked up a bottle squirted some of the pale green liquid over both their heads wait what is that girl stuff amused she reached up to lather it in his hair god shed always loved his hair so black and thick and untamed wet it fell nearly to his shoulders a dark rain of silk my own blend the rosemary promotes hair growth not that you need it and smells good even for manly men he worked it into her hair as well sniffed at it its not just rosemary not just some calendula linden flowers nasturtium girl stuff suds slid down their bodies slicking them it works on you so do you she said when his mouth covered hers again steam fragrant with herbs and flowers rose as they washed each other teased each other slippery hands over slippery skin aroused in slow beats that savored each moment each touch and taste long lazy strokes coaxed the pulses to quicken and low lingering moans to mix with the sound of drumming water her mouth was wet and warm and with restless nips and nibbles grew eager under his she deepened the kiss as her body rubbed and rocked against his invitation demand delight and every breath he took was full of her scent as the air turned sultry he turned her so that he could trace kisses over her back so that he could mold and cup her breasts his thumbs scraped her nipples tortured the hard points while her back arched in pleasure when his hands skimmed lower she reached back hooking her arms around his neck and holding on to him when he sent her flying now she turned to him fill me now he slid into her achingly slow and she felt herself open and give she gripped his shoulders while the water sluiced over them tuned her body to his long silky strokes so that pleasure was a low sustained beat everything she was focused on the need to prolong to hold this moment like a jewel shining and rich her blood pulsed seemed to sing under her skin until the beauty of it wept inside her she crested an endless warm wave and her mouth pressed to his as she rode it they ended up on the bed again flat on their backs we never seem to make it here for the first round sam managed be that as it may round two will have to be postponed on account of working for a living yeah ive got an eleven oclock meeting she stirred enough to twist for a look at the clock youve got some time yet why dont you stay get a little sleep huh she rose raked her fingers through her damp hair ill set the alarm for ten he grunted again and didnt move a muscle nor had he moved when thirty minutes later she was groomed and dressed for the day obligingly she set the alarm clock tugged the sheet over him then just stood looking at him how did it happen youve ended up sleeping in my bed again she wondered aloud does it make me weak stupid or just human with no answer she left him sleeping nell pounced the minute she walked in the door youre all right i was worried im fine dont look any the worse for wear lulu commented after a careful study all the tension balled in her stomach loosened and smoothed out i told lu nell explained and struggled with the hitch in her conscience she wasnt being as forthcoming with mia as she was about her i thought i should of course is the coffee up im desperate for a decent cup and to economize time and effort well go upstairs and have some while i save the two of you the trouble of poking at me about what happened you were so pale nell went up the steps first ripley and i were about to pull you back when you came on your own but you were as white as a sheet guarding her province nell hurried behind the counter to pour the coffee you were gone for nearly an hour an hour mia was surprised i didnt realize it didnt seem like his powers crafty she said quietly he blocked my sense of time i wasnt prepared to stay so long which explains why i was so weak when i came back she took the coffee nell offered sipped considered it wont do to forget that a second time you look a little peaked lu arent you well up late watching a charles bronson marathon lulu lied glibly and behind the counter nell flushed with guilt that logan boy took good care of you yes lulu that logan boy took good care of me you sound like youre catching a cold the surefire way to distract her girl lulu knew was to poke at her i didnt see his fancy car in front of the cottage this morning because its still parked in my driveway he sat up all night with me then fixed me a nearly inedible breakfast this morning after which i seduced him in the shower as a result im feeling very rested very serene and just a little hungry nell how about one of those apple muffins he sold his condo in new york city lulu stated and had the satisfaction of seeing mia blink really i keep my ear to the ground signed the papers on it just yesterday got a bunch of stuff going into storage doesnt sound like hes planning on going back there anytime soon no it doesnt she couldnt think about that mia told herself not just now and as fascinating as that is weve more immediate concerns than where sam stores his living room furniture smart money says he sells it hmm in any case mia continued we have to decide what to do if anything about evan remington i dont think the authorities would sanction a coven of witches attempting a casting out on an inmate she nibbled her muffin as she considered and to be honest i dont think it would work not the way it did with harding last winter harding was a pawn unaware and largely unwilling remington isnt unwilling and my sense is that he knows he not only accepts but revels in what comes into him he welcomes it i could get in to see him nell waited for mia to look back at her he would agree to that i might be able to reach him you couldnt mia reached out to squeeze nells hand youre part of his catalyst more important zack would have my head and rightly so if i encouraged you to try another facetoface encounter between you and remington is too dangerous under any circumstances but it might be harmful for the baby i wouldnt try to nells eyes went wide how did you know about the baby i took a home pregnancy test at dawn she pressed a hand to her belly im going to the doctor this afternoon to back it up i havent even told zack i want to be sure first be sure i felt it when i took your hand joy swam into mias heart over her face new life oh nell i knew the night when i conceived i knew i felt a light inside tears spilled over i was afraid to believe it to get my hopes up were having a baby she pressed her hands to her cheeks spun in a circle were having a baby i have to tell zack go tell him now right now we can handle things here until you get back cant we lu lu mia turned saw lulu digging a tissue out of her pocket got allergies lulu announced in a strangled voice go on she waved a hand at nell go tell your man hes going to be a daddy a daddy nell danced around the counter threw her arms around lulus neck then around mias oh i cant wait to see his face oh oh and ripleys i wont be long ill be back she raced for the stairs then spun around with her face glowing im having a baby youd think no one ever managed to get knocked up before after a last sniff lulu stuffed the tissue back in her pocket guess ill have to knit some booties a blanket she shrugged somebody has to step in and play grandma mia slid her arm around lulus waist rested her cheek on the older womans hair lets sit down a minute and have a good cry yeah lulu dragged the tissue back out good idea nothing mia was determined was going to smear this window of joy not a threehundredyear curse not the inconvenience and confusion brought on by the early stages of expansion and most certainly not her own prickles of envy whatever had to be done nell would have these thrilling days of happiness and discovery because of the hammering and the blocked view from what had been the café windows the lunch crowd had dwindled down to the adventurous ones and the diehards to mias way of thinking the timing couldnt have been better the smaller crowds allowed nell a few more hours off a week and the luxury of being distracted by the solstice the bulk of the job would be done and if the café wasnt yet picture perfect her customers would be able to dine alfresco on her new little terrace from the sidewalk outside the bookstore mia measured the progress the cantilevered overhang would when all was said and done blend well with the rest of her building she intended to hang baskets of flowers from either end shed already ordered the curving ironwork for the banister and had selected the slate for the terrace floor she could visualize it completed decked with café tables pots of summer flowers and paying customers coming right along zack stopped beside her better than i could have hoped well try it out during solstice week and be a hundred percent by the july fourth holiday she let out a deep satisfied breath how are you sheriff daddy couldnt be better its been the best year of my life youll be a good father im going to work hard to be you will she agreed but the core of it will just be there do you remember when we were kids and i used to come to your house sure if you werent there with rip she was up at your place i always loved coming there watching your family sometimes id pretend they were mine she leaned into him when he stroked her hair just wondering what it would be like to have that kind of focus i suppose from my parents that interest and amusement and pride all those things that were so much a part of your house i guess they were oh zack sometimes id see your mother look over at you or ripley and just grin i could hear her thinking just look at those kids arent they great and theyre mine your parents didnt just tend you didnt just love you they enjoyed you we were lucky we enjoyed them right back i know lulu gave me that so much of that so did my grandmother when she was alive so i understood what it was and because i did my parents innate disinterest in me was such a puzzle in some ways it still is well because he thought she needed it he pressed a kiss to her hair there were times growing up when id think you were lucky because you could get away with more than i could you just had lu running herd on you and i had two people she did the work of two people mia said dryly two sneaky people she would always let me run right to the end of the tether then when i thought id get away with it shed yank me right back shes still running herd on you dont i know it anyway to circle back to where we were before this ramble turned around to be about me i wanted to say youre going to be a terrific father you come by it naturally theres nothing i wont do to protect nell and the baby i need to ask you straight out if anything the three of you plan to do can hurt the baby no she framed his face with her hands no i promise you and ill give you my word my vow that ill protect her child your child as i would my own okay then now im going to ask you one more thing you trust me zack i already do no he curled his fingers around her wrists surprising her with the sudden intensity you trust me to do my job and that job is to protect the people on my island you trust me to care about you to stand for you the same way i would my sister you trust me to help you when it comes time to finish this you trust me enough for that for all of that she told him and more i love you sam stepped onto the curb in time to hear her say it and hearing it he felt a twinge in his gut not in jealousy he knew better but in envy that another man could draw such absolute trust and warmth from her that another man could hear that quiet and heartfelt declaration even as a friend it took all his willpower to work up a sneer greedy son of a bitch sam punched zack lightly on the shoulder havent you already got a woman seems i do still zack leaned down kissed mia on the mouth in fact i think ill go on up and see what shes up to nice kissing you ms devlin nice kissing you sheriff todd looks like i have to do better than nice to work off some of the frustration sam spun her around caught her up and gave her a long sizzling kiss that had a trio of women across the street breaking out in applause well mia caught her breath and tried to uncurl her toes i suppose that was a few levels above nice but then you always were competitive take an hour off with me and ill show you some competition thats such an interesting offer but she put a hand on his chest and eased back were just a little pressed with the remodeling ive already used up my break kissing the sheriff why dont you serve me lunch i thought id scope out your menu your patronage is appreciated the violetandherb salad is getting raves today she walked to the door and opened it im not eating flowers im sure nell has something suitably manly to offer you like a raw meaty bone phones for you lulu called out as mia started up the stairs ill take it in my office she glanced back at sam you know the way to the café he did indeed he settled on the cajun chicken sandwich and an iced coffee and watched the workmen it had been to his benefit as much as mias for him to spring the crew for a few weeks his season was underway and the guest rooms already rehabbed were fully occupied after the fourth he intended to put the workers on half days so as not to disturb his guests during the earlymorning or earlyevening hours that would take them into september and by september he thought hed know what to do with the rest of his life she wasnt letting him get any closer she welcomed him into her bed but wouldnt sleep in his she would talk about work about the island about magic but shed made it clear that an entire decade of their lives was offlimits once or twice hed tried to bring up his time in new york but shed simply closed down or walked away though they were both aware that everyone on the island knew they were lovers she wouldnt go out with him she hadnt had dinner with him in public since that first business meeting his suggestions that they take an evening on the mainland and have dinner or go to the theater had been brushed away the underlying message came through clear enough she was telling him she would sleep with him enjoy him but they werent a couple brooding over his sandwich he wondered how many men would celebrate finding themselves in his position he had an extraordinarily beautiful woman who was willing to share sex with him and expected indeed permitted little else no strings no expectations no promises and he wanted more that he admitted had been the root of the problem from the beginning hed wanted more but hed been too young too stupid too stubborn to see that the more was all mia when she sat down across from him he found his heart was in his throat and ready to spill out mia i got caroline trump she snatched his iced coffee drank deep i just got off the phone with her publicist i have her for the second saturday in july you shouldve heard how cool and professional i was on the phone shed never have guessed i was turning cartwheels in that dress ha ha sam she reached over to take his hands i know your influence is largely responsible for this im grateful i want you to know how much i appreciate you putting in a good word for the store that part was easy now dont screw up i wont i already designed the ad in anticipation i have to talk to nell about food she started to spring up then hesitated so do you have any plans for the solstice he met her gaze kept his voice as casual as hers though they both knew she was offering to take another step one that was for her a big one no no formal plans you do now twelve mia closed and locked the door behind the last straggle of customers then leaned back against it and looked at lulu long day i thought that last group was going to make camp in here lulu shut down the cash register for the night then zipped the cash bag you want to take this moola home or should i make a night deposit how much moola because they both enjoyed it lulu unzipped the bag pulled out the stack of bills and flipped her thumb over the ends lots of cash customers today god bless them every one ill do the deposit credit card receipts right here rolling her shoulders mia crossed over scanned the stack business is good solstice week sucks them right in i had two teenagers in here today summer girls wanted to know if they could see the witch and get some love potion amused mia leaned on the counter and what did you tell them i told them sure and how well the beauty potion worked for me that sent them scurrying well they have to learn not to look for life cures in a pretty bottle of potion you put out some fancy jars full of colored water during solstice week and customers would trip over themselves to buy them mias magic mix for love beauty and prosperity terrifying thought mia angled her head in all these years lu youve never once asked me for a spell or a charm for luck love fast money why is that i get on well enough on my own lulu hauled her enormous purse from behind the counter besides dont think i dont know you look out for me anyway better start looking out for yourself what an odd thing to say i always look out for myself sure youve got your house and you live well live the way you see fit to live youve got your looks and youre healthy got more shoes than a vegas chorus line shoes separate us from the lower mammals yeah yeah you just like having men look at your legs mia trailed a hand through her hair well naturally anyway lulu focused in she knew her girl and she knew when that girl was trying to distract her you run things pretty much as you want to got good friends and youve made this place into something you can be proud of we made it mia corrected well i didnt sit on my hands but this is your place lulu gave a decisive nod that took in the entire store and it shines lu touched mia brushed lulus arm as she came around the counter it means a lot to me that youd think that say that its fact and theres another fact one that worries me some nights youre not happy of course i am no youre not and worse you dont think youre ever going to be not deepdowninthegut happy you want to give me a spell you fix that thats all i have to say now im going to go put my feet up and watch my video of die hard i like seeing bruce willis kick ass with no comeback mia simply stood there while lulu strode through the store and out the back unsettled now she took the cash and receipts and wandered through the store it did shine she thought she had put a great deal of energy and imagination to use here financial resources and intellect long hard hours and eclectic taste and nearly seven years of her life it made her happy she insisted as she walked up the stairs it challenged and fulfilled her that was enough shed made it be enough maybe she had once assumed she would have a different kind of life a life that included a man who loved her and the children they made together but that had been a young girls fantasy and she had put away such dreams just because she didnt have those things didnt mean they were missing she thought as she went into her office to fill out the deposit slips it only meant shed taken another path ended up at a different destination inthegut happy she mused and sighed how many people were when it came right down to it wasnt it just as important to be satisfied fulfilled successful and wasnt it essential to any level of happiness to feel in control of your life she heard as clearly as fingernails scraping against glass the dark pressing against her windows she looked outside the sky was still glowing with the light of a summer evening but the dark was there just at the edges trying to find a crack a chink in her will you wont use me to destroy she said it clearly so her voice carried through the empty store whatever else i do in my life i wont be used you are not welcome here and there at her desk with the days receipts and paperwork neatly stacked she spread her arms palms up and called the light it shimmered in her hands like gilded pools then flowed out in golden rivers as it spilled from her the dark slithered back pleased she gathered what she needed to make the deposits before she left the store she detoured to her new terrace the doorwalls had been installed that day and she unlocked the glass slid it open stepped out into the evening the ironwork railing was exactly as shed wanted fussy and female she laid her hands on it gave it a quick testing shake and was satisfied at its unyielding strength beauty she thought never had to be weak from her vantage point she could see the curve of beach the roll of the sea and the first sword of white from her lighthouse as dusk faded toward night the dark that crept in now was benign full of hope below her high street was still busy tourists were out for strolls wandering into the ice cream parlor for a treat the air was so clear she could hear bits of conversation and the shouts and squeals of young people on the beach as the first stars glimmered to life she felt her throat go tight with a longing that she refused to recognize and couldnt resolve if you had a trellis id climb up she looked down and there he was dark and handsome and just a little dangerous was it any wonder the girl shed been had fallen so pathetically in love with sam logan climbing up into business establishments after hours is discouraged on the island ive got pull with the local authorities so id risk it but why dont you come down come out and play mia its a hell of a night there had been a time when she would have run to him because she remembered just how easy it had been for her to forget everything and anything but him she simply leaned out over the railing i have an errand to do and another long day tomorrow im going by the bank then home how can anyone so beautiful be so stuffy hey he grabbed the arm of one of three men walking by then pointed up isnt she spectacular im trying to hit on her but shes not cooperating why dont you give the guy a break one of the men called to her only to be elbowed aside by one of his companions the hell with him give me a break he laid a hand dramatically on his heart i think im in love hey red hey yourself lets us get married and move to trinidad wheres the ring she demanded i dont move to trinidad unless i have a big fat diamond on my finger hey the man jabbed one of his friends lend me ten thousand dollars so i can buy a big fat diamond and move to trinidad with red if i had ten k id move to trinidad with her now see what youve done sam chuckled destroying friendships inciting riots youd better come down here and go with me before my new pals and i have to beat the crap out of each other amused she laughed stepped back and shut the doors he waited for her when hed seen her standing on the terrace hed been staggered shed looked so enchanting and so sad heartbreaking hed have done anything in his power to lift that quiet sorrow and anything nearly anything to reach past that thin shield she kept between them he wanted to see what was in her mind in her heart maybe the key at least for one precious evening was to keep things simple he stood on the sidewalk when she came out and locked the front door behind her she wore a slim dress that flowed around her ankles and was scattered with tiny yellow rosebuds her shoes were a series of slender crisscrossing straps and a high wedged platform he found the thin chain of gold around her left ankle ridiculously sexy she turned hitched the strap of her bag onto her shoulder then scanned the sidewalk where did your friends go i bribed them with free drinks at the coven he jerked his head toward the hotel ah replaced by a cold beer want to go to trinidad no he took her hand want an ice cream cone she shook her head i have to go to the bank make a night deposit which ill point out isnt being stuffy but responsible uhhuh ill walk with you what are you doing in the village she asked as they started toward the bank working late not particularly i went home about an hour ago i was restless he shrugged his shoulders came back and he thought had timed it exactly as hed planned just as shed be closing he glanced over studied a small group of people on the opposite side of the street they were decked in flowing robes and weighed down with silver chains and crystal pendants amateurs he commented theyre harmless we could call up a storm turn the street into a meadow give them a real thrill stop it she drew out her key for the deposit slot see stuffy he heaved a sigh its painful to see such a bright hope turn into a rule book really efficiently she made her deposit tucked her copy of the transaction into her cash bag i dont recall you ever so much as looking at a rule book when they look like you i study them in depth his moods she thought were many and varied tonights seemed to be foolish she could do with some foolishness and as the group of wouldbe witches approached a window box filled with struggling dahlias she gave a graceful turn of her hand the flowers sprang up like jewels full and bright and the crowd goes wild sam acknowledged the reaction across the street the shouts the gasps nice touch stuffy my butt ill take that ice cream now he bought her a frothy swirl of orange and cream and talked her into enjoying it during a walk on the beach the moon was nearly full it would be fat and round by the weekend and the solstice and a full moon on the solstice meant bounty and promise and the rites of fertility that lead to harvest last year i went to ireland for the solstice he told her theres a small stone dance there in county cork its more intimate than stonehenge the sky stays light until nearly ten and when it begins to fade toward the end of the longest day the stones sing she said nothing but paused to look out to sea over it she thought thousands of miles away was another island and the stone circle where he had been a year ago she had been here where she always was a solitary witch a solitary celebration youve never gone he said never gone over to ireland no theres magic there mia deep in the soil bright in the air she continued to walk theres magic everywhere i found a cove on the rocky western coast and a cave nearly hidden by the tumble of the rocks and i knew it was where hed gone when he left her here he waited until mia stopped again turned to him three thousand miles across the atlantic hed been pulled back by his own blood i knew how it felt to be pulled that way is that why you go to ireland youre drawn by your blood its why i go there and why i came back here when youve done what you need to do id like to take you to show you she licked delicately at her ice cream i dont need to be taken anywhere id like to go with you you learn fast dont you mia said i may go one day she shrugged and wandered closer to the surf well see if i want company i will say though you were right about one thing its a hell of a night she threw back her head drank in the stars and sea air take off your dress she kept her head back excuse me lets go swimming she nipped into the cone i realize it may seem fussy to a sophisticated urbanite like yourself but there are laws against nude swimming on the public beach in our little world laws that would be the same as rules right he scanned the beach they werent alone but there was hardly a crowd dont tell me youre shy circumspect she corrected okay well preserve your dignity he spread his hands and conjured a bubble around them we see out but nobody sees in its just you and me in here stepping to her he reached around slowly lowered the zipper in the back of her dress he could see her thinking considering as she finished off the cone a moonlight swims a nice way to cap off the evening havent forgotten how to swim have you hardly she slipped out of her shoes then let the dress slither down she wore nothing but amber beads and a glitter of rings turning she strolled into the surf then dived into the dark sea she swam strong cutting cleanly through the breakers and reveling in the sensation of streaking through the water as unencumbered as a mermaid until her spirit began to hum with pure joy she hadnt realized how much shed needed this freedom fun and foolishness she circled a buoy listening to its hollow clang then rolled over to float lazily on her back under a bejeweled sky the water lapped gently over her breasts as he swam to her you ever beat ripley in a swim race no much to my regret mia trailed her fingers through the water putting her in waters like putting a bullet in the air i used to watch the two of you in the inlet over at the todds id be hanging out with zack and pretending not to notice you really i never noticed you it didnt surprise her to find her head underwater shed expected it and because she had she turned like an eel in the water and jerked him under by the ankles she surfaced slicked back her hair you always were a sucker for that move it got your hands on me so whos the sucker he treaded water in circles around her his hair black and glossy as a seal i remember the first time i maneuvered you into wrestling with me wet you had on this blue number cut so high up on the hips that i speculated your legs went clean up to your ears that sexy pentagram birthmark like gold on your thigh driving me nuts you were fifteen i remember the suit i dont recall being maneuvered you were cooling off with rip in the water zack was fooling around with his boat at the dock hed just gotten that boat fast little fourteenfooter she remembered that well enough remembered perfectly how her heart had slammed into her ribs when sam long and tanned a summer gold had sauntered out onto the dock wearing nothing but cutoffs and a teenage smirk there were a number of times i swam with ripley in the inlet while zack tinkered with his boat and you came along this particular day sam continued i bided my time fiddling on the boat with zack plotting out my moves i got him to take a break and in we went that meant a lot of splashing which meant you and ripley had to bitch about being splashed and doing so you fell right into my clever hands like sam mia began to tread and circle shed always enjoyed him in these playful moods theyd been rare in his youth she imagined they were rare still i believe you have delusions of grandeur in your faulty memory memorys clear as a bell on this one i egged zack into challenging rip to a race which left the two of us bobbing around which meant naturally i could challenge you to a race oh yes i do seem to recall something of that sort perfectly she remembered perfectly the nervy thrill of floating in the water with him of having him focus on her with those seatoned eyes and the longing that had swept through her like a summer storm of course i held back paced myself so it was close so i beat you by only a stroke held back she dipped back her head studied the stars please oh yeah i knew what i was doing you said it was a tie and i said id crushed you when you got huffy i dunked you when i protested your bad call you dunked me she corrected you retaliated as id anticipated by locking your arms around my knees and hauling me under whereby i could engage you in the sort of battle that allowed me at last to get my hands on your excellent young ass it was a moment for me then you giggled she made a derisive sound ive never giggled in my life oh yeah you did you giggled and squirmed and wriggled around until i was so worked up i thought id explode she let her feet come up and floated again foolish foolish boy when you wrestle naked with a female shes bound to discover just where your brain cells have gathered you were fifteen what did you know now she smirked enough to wriggle and squirm until i obtained a satisfactory result you did it on purpose of course then ripley and i discussed it in some detail that better be a lie he reached across the water grabbed a handful of her hair we were both fascinated and amused and if it soothes your ego ill finish this walk down memory lane by telling you i had hot disturbing and imaginative dreams for a week afterward he tugged at her hair until their bodies bumped then he skimmed his hand over the wet white slope of her breast so did i he trailed a fingertip down her torso back up again mia mmm i bet i can still make you giggle before she could evade he nipped her by the waist and turned her facedown in the water taken by surprise she flailed for a moment then rolled when his fingers moved unerringly up her ribs stop it her hair was in her face saltwater in her eyes giggle he insisted tickling ruthlessly and squirm and wriggle you idiot she couldnt see or catch her breath despite her struggles the helpless and foolish laughter escaped it rolled out of her and over the waves as she slapped at him and tried to wiggle free she managed to get a grip on his hair and yank while trying to shove her own out of her face but he only rolled them over and over into the waves until she was dizzy disoriented and brutally aroused damn octopus his hands were everywhere youve got a hell of a squirm and it still works only this time he gripped her hips why just dream and plunged into her he went home with her and they ate bowls of cold pasta like ravenous children with hunger unabated they fell into bed and fed off each other tangled with him she slipped into sleep and into dreams of floating in a dark sea as peacefully as the moon sailed the night sky she drifted on her own pleasure the water cool the air sweet in the distance the shadows and shapes of her island rose out of the sea it slept with only the beam from the cliff light guarding it from the dark the music of the waves lulled her until she too slept and the stars erupted into bolts of lightning stabbing down at the shadows and shapes of her island around her the sea began to thrash and heave pulling her helplessly away from home she fought striking out with hard desperate strokes toward the fog that had begun to build a dirty wall at the shore waves swamped her spun her into that breathless black slapped her back dragged her under roaring filled the night and the screams that followed it ripped at her heart with what strength she had left she reached for the fire inside her but she was too late to beat the dark she watched the island fall into the sea even as she wept it pulled her down with it she woke curled away from sam drawn into a tight ball and clinging to the edge of the bed trembling she rose walked to the window to soothe herself with the view of her garden of the steady beam of the island light would it come to that would she do everything that could be done and have it still not be enough through the night she heard the long triumphant howl of a wolf knowing that it wanted her to cower she stepped out onto her little balcony i am fire she said it softly and whats in me will one day purge you mia she turned and saw sam sitting up in bed yes im here what is it nothing she came back in but left the doors open to the night just restless come back to bed he held out a hand let me help you sleep all right she slid in beside him turned her body to his invitation but he only drew her close stroked her hair close your eyes let your mind go let it go for one night im not let it go he repeated and stroking her hair he charmed her into a deep and dreamless sleep thirteen this mia said as the sun broke the sky in the east with an arrow of fire is for us the midsummer sabbat the celebration of the earths coming bounty the warmth of the air and the full power of the sun we are the three yeah yeah ripley yawned hugely and if we can get on with this i might be able to get home and catch another hours sleep your reverence is as always inspiring youll remember i voted against standing around up here at dawn since its sunday both of you can go back to bed im on duty all day ripley nell managed to make her voice mild and patient its the solstice celebrating the longest day should begin when the day begins im here arent i ripley scowled at nell youre awfully bright and chipper for a pregnant woman why arent you flat out with morning sickness ive never felt better in my life or looked happier mia said well celebrate fertility today the earths and yours the first balefire has burned since sunset the dawn fire is for you to light she lifted a circlet shed woven from lavender and set it on nells head youre the first of us to carry life and to take what we are to the next generation blessed be little sister she kissed nells cheeks then stepped back okay that gets me misty ripley moved up kissed nell in turn then linked her hand with mias nell lifted her arms and let the power ripple into her from dawn until the day is done this fire we make glows bright as the sun as light grows strong across the sky i call the flames from air to fly burn no flesh no feather nor tree as i will so mote it be fire spewed up from the ground bright as gold mia lifted another circlet from the white cloth on the ground set it on ripleys head though she rolled her eyes for form ripley lifted her arms the power was warm and welcome in the earth we sow our seed that she may grant us what we need across her breast the dawn brings light all through this day to shortest night we celebrate her fertility as i will so mote it be wildflowers sprang up through the earth to ring the circle before mia could reach for the third circlet ripley picked it up and kissed her just to make it official she said and settled the flowers on mias hair thanks she in turn lifted her arms power was like breath today the sun holds its full power its strength and light grow hour by hour its bright fire warms the air and earth its cycle sustains us birth to death to birth i celebrate the fire in me as i will so mote it be from her fingertips beams shot to the sun and from the sun to her until the circle in the clearing shimmered with the birth of the day she lowered her arms joined hands with nell with ripley he watches she told them and he waits why dont we do something about it ripley demanded the three of us are here and like both of you keep hammering home its the solstice thats a lot of punch it isnt the time to mia broke off when nell squeezed her hand mia a show of force of solidarity and strength why not make a point our circle is whole a point mia thought perhaps the unbroken circle was the point at least for the moment she could feel through the link nells determination ripleys passion well then lets not be subtle she gathered herself and the pooled strength of her sisters we are the three and of the blood ripley began moving like her sisters in a ring within the ring from us the force and light will flood with might that strikes the waiting dark nells voice rose to echo on the air an arrow of light toward what bears our mark here we stand so you can see with hands still joined mia lifted her arms and beware the wrath of the sisters three light spewed up from the center of the circle like a funnel whirling roaring as it geysered up like the arrow nell had called it shot out of the circle out of the clearing and into the shadows of the summer trees from those shadows came a single furious howl then there was only the quiet breeze and the musical call of crystals hanging from branches so he slinks away mia remarked that felt good ripley rolled her shoulders it did it felt positive letting out a long breath nell looked around the clearing it felt right then it was right today he cant touch us or ours whatever came after mia thought they had made a stand they had made their point she lifted her face to the sun its a beautiful day she intended to spend it in her garden away from the crowds that would pack into the village and the traffic that would stream along the roads she intended to spend it on simple things the tasks that gave her pleasure a day without worry she thought a clean and clear day with all shadows brushed away like dust with a broom she gathered the herbs and flowers shed selected for her midsummer harvest with a bolline the curved whitehandled knife she saved for that purpose alone the scents and shapes and textures never failed to delight her the variety of their uses never failed to satisfy some she would dry by hanging them in her kitchen some in her tower room she would make charms from some potions from others from soaps to creams to healing balms and divination aids and some would simply be sprinkled into sauces and salads for flavor or mixed into a potpourri to scent the air just before twelve she stopped to light the noon balefire she set it on her cliffs like a beacon and stood for a time watching the sea and the pleasure boats that skimmed over it now and then she saw the glint of binoculars and knew she was watched as she watched there the summer people would say up on the cliffs shes supposed to be a witch such attention would once have caused her to be hunted and hanged now mia thought the possibility of magic brought people to the island and into her store so the wheel ran she mused a circle spinning she went back to her garden when her herbs were tied and hung she used the sun to brew a small pot of chamomile tea she had it iced with a hint of fresh mint when sam stepped onto her path traffics a bitch he said midsummer and mabon draw the most tourists she poured the tea into a glass tourists who are interested in such things she added did you light your balefire this morning near your circle in my woods your woods he corrected when she arched her eyebrows absently he reached down to pet isis who had come to rub against his legs he noted the new collar and the charm hanging from it a pentagram carved on one side a sun wheel on the other new for the midsummer blessing she cut a slice of bread from a fresh loaf drizzled it with honey and offered it to him i made more than the faeries need he took a bite but she noticed that his restless gaze roamed her garden it was rich and ripe with summer the tall spires dancing in the breeze the mobs of color tumbling over the ground he watched a hummingbird flash by then drink from the long purple bells of foxglove roses red as passion climbed up the trellis to her old bedroom window as he had once climbed risking flesh and bone to reach her the scent of summer roses could still make his heart ache now he sat with her in the sun and dappled shade of her garden adults with more weighing on them than the girl and boy could have imagined she wore a sleeveless dress green as the lush leaves that surrounded them and her face beautiful and calm told him nothing where are we mia in my midsummer garden having tea with bread and honey its a lovely day for it she lifted her cup but judging from your mood perhaps i should have served wine he rose paced away he would she knew tell her what was on his mind soon enough whether or not she wanted to hear it only a few nights before hed been lighthearted and playful enough to coax her into a swim but today there was a cloud around him hed always been a moody creature my father called me this morning he told her ah ah sam repeated and managed to make the syllable a bite hes displeased with my performance thats a direct quote im putting too much time and money into the hotel here its your hotel i pointed that out my hotel my time and my money sam rammed his hands into his pockets i mightve saved my breath im told im making rash and dangerous financial and career decisions hes pissed off that ive sold my place in new york annoyed that ive budgeted so much for the rehab at the hotel and irked that i sent a proxy rather than attending the june board meeting personally because she felt for him mia rose and rubbed his stiff shoulders im sorry its difficult ramming up against parental disapproval it doesnt matter how old we are it stings when they dont understand us the magick inn is our first and oldest asset hes figured out that i finessed it from him now its like a bone he wants to drag back from me and youre just as determined to keep your teeth in it he shot a furious look over his shoulder damn right hed have sold it to strangers years ago if he hadnt been legally bound to keep it in the family he sold it to me happily enough but now hes realized i intend to make something of it so hes irritated its a thorn in his side so am i sam for a moment she pressed her cheek against his back and for a moment she was sixteen again and comforting her unhappy moody love sometimes you just have to take a step away and accept what is what is he agreed turning to her he never could neither he nor my mother ever accepted what i am it was something not to be discussed as if i had some sort of embarrassing condition furious as much because of letting himself be sucked in again as by the facts themselves he strode down the path through an arbor where morning glory vines were busily tangling its in his blood as much as mine he saw her start to speak then stop herself what just say it all right then its not the same for him you respect what you have you celebrate it for him its a well a pesky inherited trait hes not alone in that and because of it you have more are more than he can ever have or be hes ashamed of it and me yes her heart wrung with pity i know it hurts you it always has you cant change what he thinks or feels you can only change what you feel is that how you handle your family it took her a moment and that was a jolt to realize he meant her parents and not lulu or ripley and nell i used to envy you on some level just the fact that your parents worked up the interest and energy to push at you even if it meant pushing you in the wrong direction we never argued here she turned back to study the house she loved they never noticed if i was angry my rebellions were completely wasted on them there came a point when i had to accept that their disinterest wasnt personal oh for christs sake she nearly laughed at his impatient explosion it was healthier and more practical and certainly more comfortable all around what was the point of breaking my heart over it when they wouldnt have noticed or if they had it would have baffled them theyre not bad people just careless parents im who i am because they were what they were thats enough for me you always were sensible he replied i could never figure out whether i admired that or found it annoying i still cant you always were moody she sat on the bench by the arbor and the same goes still its a shame the call put a blight on your holiday ill get over it he slipped his hands into his pockets again fingering the tumbling stones hed forgotten he carried he expects me back in new york within the month to resume my proper place in the company her world tilted she gripped the edge of the bench to balance herself then forced herself to her feet forced shut that piece of her heart shed allowed to be touched by his pain i see when will you leave what im not going back mia i told you i was here to stay i meant it no matter what you think with a careless shrug she turned to start back to the house damn it mia he grabbed her arm pulled her back watch your step she said it coldly are you just waiting for me to pack up and go he demanded is that where we are im not waiting for anything what do i have to do to get us past this you can start by letting go of my arm letting go is just what you expect to prove her wrong he took her other arm so they were facing each other in the dappled shade of the path so you wont let me touch you not where it matters most youll take me to your bed but you wont come to mine you wont so much as sit and have a meal with me in a public place unless its under the guise of business you wont let me talk about the years without you and you wont share magic with me when we make love because you dont trust me to stay why should i why should i do any of those things i prefer my bed i dont choose to date im not interested in your life offisland and to share magic during the physical act of love is a level of intimacy im not willing to explore with you she shoved his hands aside and stepped back ive given you cooperation in business some friendly companionship and sex this is what suits me if it doesnt suit you find someone else to play with this isnt a goddamn game her voice was sharp oh isnt it he stepped toward her and she held up her hands light spitting red shot between them be careful he merely held up his own hands and a wash of searing blue water struck the light until there was nothing but the sizzle of vapor between them was i ever no and you always wanted too much maybe i did the problem was i didnt know what i wanted you always did it was always so fucking clear to you mia what you needed what you wanted there were times when your vision choked me stunned she dropped her hands to her side choked you how can you say that to me i loved you without questions without doubts it was as if you could see the rest of our lives in this pretty box you had it all lined up for me just the way my parents did her cheeks paled thats a cruel thing to say and youve said enough she hurried back down the path its not enough until im done running away from it doesnt change anything youre the one who ran she whirled back and the pain of it crashed through all the years and struck her with a fresh blow it changed everything i couldnt be what you wanted i couldnt give you what you were so sure was meant to be you looked ahead ten years twenty and i couldnt see the next day so its my fault you left i couldnt be here for gods sake mia we were hardly more than children and you were talking marriage babies youd lie beside me when my head was so full of you i couldnt think and talk about how wed buy a little cottage by the woods and he trailed off it seemed to strike both of them at once the little yellow cottage by the woods where she hadnt come since hed moved in young girls in love she said and her voice trembled dream about marriage and babies and pretty cottages you werent dreaming he walked to her table again sat and dragged his fingers through his hair it was destiny for you when i was with you i believed it i could see it too and at that point it smothered me you never said it wasnt what you wanted i didnt know how and every time i tried id look at you all that confidence that utter faith that this was the way it would be then id go home and id see my parents and what marriage meant id think of yours and what family meant it was hollow and airless the idea of the two of us moving in that direction seemed insane i couldnt talk to you about it i didnt know how to talk to you about it so instead you left i left when i started college it was like being torn in two the part that wanted to be there the part that wanted to be here be with you i thought about you constantly he looked at her now he would say to the woman what hed never been able to say to the girl when id come home on weekends or breaks id be half sick until id see you waiting on the docks that whole first year was like a blur then you stopped coming home every weekend she remembered you made excuses for why you needed to stay on the mainland to study to go to a lecture it was a test i could go without seeing you for two weeks then a month stop thinking about you for an hour then a day it got easier to convince myself that staying away from you and the island was the only way i was going to escape being trapped into that box i didnt want to get married i didnt want to start a family or be in love with one girl my entire life or root myself on a little island when id never really seen the world i got a taste of the world in college the people i met there the things i learned i wanted more well you got more and the lids been off the box for a number of years were in different places now with different goals he met her eyes i came back for you that was your mistake you still want more sam but this time i dont if youd told me this eleven years ago i would have tried to understand i would have tried to give you the time and the room you needed or id have tried to let you go without bitterness i dont know if i would have succeeded but i know i loved you enough that i would have tried but youre not the center of my life any longer you havent been for some time im not going away or giving up those are your decisions ignoring the headache brewing she gathered up the tea things i enjoy having you for a lover ill regret having to end that but i will if you insist on pressing for a different dynamic in our relationship i think ill get that wine after all she carried the dishes inside rinsed them the headache was going to plague her so she took a tonic before selecting a bottle of wine taking out the proper glasses she didnt allow herself to think couldnt allow herself to feel since there was no going back no crisscrossing over paths that were already long overgrown the only direction was forward but when she stepped outside he was gone though her stomach fluttered once she sat at the table in her midsummer garden and toasted her independence and the wine was bitter on her tongue he sent her flowers at the bookstore the next day simple and cheerful zinnias which in the language of flowers meant he was thinking of her she doubted he knew the charming meaning of a bouquet of zinnias but puzzled over them nonetheless as she selected a suitable vase it wasnt like him to send flowers she mused even when theyd been madly in love hed rarely thought to make such romantic gestures the card was explanation enough she supposed it read im sorry sam when she found herself smiling over the flowers instead of getting on with her work she carried the vase downstairs and set it on the table by the fireplace arent those sweet and cheerful gladys macey slipped up beside her to coo over the bouquet from your garden no actually they were a gift nothing perks a woman up more than getting flowers unless its getting something sparkly gladys added with a wink she slid a discreet glance over to mias left hand but not discreet enough ive found that a woman who buys herself something sparkly ends up with something that suits her own taste not the same though gladys gave mias arm a quick squeeze carl bought me a pair of earrings on my last birthday ugly as homemade sin no question about it but i feel good every time i put them on i was just on my way up to the café to see how our nells getting on shes getting on beautifully when she tells you she thinks shes started to show just go along with her it makes her happy will do i just preordered caroline trumps new book were all excited about her coming here ive been delegated by the book club to ask if she would agree to doing a book discussion just before the official signing ill see if i can set it up just let us know were going to give her a real three sisters welcome im counting on it mia made the call to new york herself once the wheels were set in motion she checked her book orders called her distributor to nag about a delay in a selection of note cards then picked up the newest batch of email orders as lulu was busy mia filled them herself slipping in the notice that signed copies of trumps book would be available then she carted them down to the post office she ran into mac as she came out again hello handsome just the woman i was looking for smiling she slid her arm through his thats what they all say are you on your way to the café to meet ripley for lunch i was on my way to the bookstore to talk to you he glanced down noted that she was wearing heels no point asking you to take a walk on the beach with me shoes come off youll ruin your stockings im not wearing any oh he flushed a bit delighting her well lets walk then if youve got a few minutes i always have a few minutes for attractive men hows your book going fits and starts when its finished i expect café book to host your first signing nonfiction books with academic bents on paranormal science dont exactly draw in the crowds for book signings they will at café book she retorted they crossed the street winding through the pedestrian traffic families returning from the beach their skin pink their eyes blurry from the sunlight trudged into town for lunch or a cold drink others loaded with coolers umbrellas towels sunscreen walked toward the sand and surf mia slipped off her shoes by the time the solstice crowd thins out the fourth of july crowd will stream in were having a good summer on the sisters summers go fast youre thinking of september i know youre concerned but i have it under control when he didnt speak she tipped down her sunglasses and peered over the tops you dont think so he struggled with the guilt of keeping lulus incident from her weighing it against her peace of mind i think you can handle just about anything that gets tossed at you but but he laid a hand over the one shed curled around his arm you play by the rules not honoring the rules is what put us here agreed i care about you mia she leaned her head on his shoulder something about him made her want to cuddle i know you do you added to my life when you came into it what you and ripley have together adds to it i like sam she retreated lifting her head why shouldnt you look im not prying okay he corrected im prying but only for practical and scientific purposes bullshit she said laughing all right mostly for those purposes if i dont know where the two of you stand i cant weigh my theories and hypotheses i cant calculate what we might need to do then ill tell you were for the most part enjoying each other our relationship is primarily comfortable and largely superficial as far as im concerned its going to stay that way okay you dont approve its not for me to approve its for you to choose exactly love consuming and obsessive destroyed the last sister she refused to live without it i refuse to live with it if that was enough it would be over it will be over she promised him look mia there was a time when i believed it could be that simple and now you dont now i dont he confirmed i was up at your place this morning you said i could go up and take readings after the solstice and i went up took mulder with me so he could get some exercise to keep it simple ill say i started getting snags in the readings right at the edge of your front lawn positive and negative spikes like a he slammed the heels of his hands together to demonstrate one ramming against the other i got similar readings around the verge straight toward the cliffs on the other side of the lighthouse and into the forest i havent been lax in protection no you havent and its a damn good thing we followed the readings away from the clearing away from the heart my sensors started going wild and so did mulder he damn near snapped the leash theres a path of negative energy i could follow it the way it circled around like an animal might stalk prey i know its there mac i dont ignore it mia its gaining strength there were places along that path where everything was dead brush trees birds the pup stopped straining at the leash and just curled up crying i had to carry him and he didnt stop shaking until wed come out again we came out following that path at the north end of your cliffs have ripley do a cleansing spell on the puppy and on you if she doesnt remember the ritual mia mac grabbed her hand in a tight grip dont you understand what im saying it has you surrounded fourteen what did she say when you told her as sam paced his office mac lifted his hands that it has surrounded her all her life but is just being more blatant about it now yeah i can just hear her saying that when we were before i left the island we talked about it a couple of times shed read up on it more than i had at that point thats probably still true the woman can absorb a book before most of us get to chapter two she was so confident about it all good would overcome evil as long as good was strong and faithful shes both of those what i didnt tell her was that my readings picked up several different lets call them fingerprints on her side of the line im assuming theyd be yours just because she doesnt want my protection doesnt mean she isnt going to get it whatever youre doing keep it up sam wandered to the window looked out on the new terrace across the street she had taken in the tables shed put out for the weekend and the crew was setting the slate in place how did she look today spectacular you should see her when she uses real power then he glanced back at mac but i suppose you have late last winter a call to the four elements it took me half a day to come to my senses i wonder if she uses the wiccan equivalent of a dimmer switch on that face of hers for the everyday no the power punches it up as if it wasnt enough already beauty like that blinds a man muddles the brain ive asked myself if its that that pulls me to her i cant answer that i can now ive loved her all my life before i knew what love meant after i tried to redefine it its a nasty blow to finally understand that now when she doesnt love me or wont he turned back eased a hip onto the edge of his desk all right scientifically speaking or theoretically academically whatever you like is my being here no loving her now putting her at greater risk your feelings dont count as soon as he said it mac winced i didnt mean that the way it sounded i get it its her feelings that tip the scale one way or the other in that case im going to assume that trying to rekindle her feelings or change them wont hurt her if you think otherwise ill hold off on that until after september i cant tell you then im going with the gut if nothing else i intend to be as close to her as i can when it comes to the sticking point even the circle can use a guard dog he called her that night at home just as she was settling in with a book and a glass of wine i hope im not catching you at a bad time no mia pursed her lips as she studied the play of light and liquid in her glass thank you for the flowers theyre lovely im glad you liked them i am sorry we argued yesterday that i took my mood out on you accepted good then i hope youll have dinner with me we can call it a business meeting to discuss the details of carolines tour stop would tomorrow night suit your schedule so pleasant she thought so smooth that was when you had to watch him most carefully yes i suppose ill pick you up then say seventhirty theres no need i can easily walk across the street i had somewhere else in mind and you usually take the late afternoon and evening off on tuesdays no point in you changing your routine just for this ill pick you up well keep it casual shed nearly asked for specifics before she decided he wanted her to casuals just fine ill see you tomorrow she hung up went back to her book but found it hard to concentrate the day before she thought theyd raked up the past with all its wounds and bitterness had she trapped him by being so blindly in love so sure of her own feelings and so confident of his could he have been so selfish so cold that he had cast her aside rather than share his own mind and heart rather than give her a chance to understand how foolish and shortsighted of both of them she thought now still blame excuses reasons none of that changed what had happened none of it changed nor would she have it change who each of them had become it was best to bury it again and go on as they were cautious friends careless lovers with no plans to be more from his current attitude it seemed he agreed with her on that one point and yet after setting it aside mia said to her cat hes up to something on the other side of the village sam made a hurried second call nell its sam logan i have an emergency a confidential emergency it was a matter of sharpening the details to hone some of them he had to wait until mia left the store the next afternoon he also concluded that the only way to deal with lulu was to be direct inside café book he gestured her over to a display of cds a cd titled forest serenity was tucked in a slot labeled playing now which ones her favorite lulu adjusted her glasses why because id like to buy her favorite always ready for a sale lulu ran her tongue around her teeth you buy five you get the sixth half price i dont need half a dozen he broke off hissed okay ill buy six which ones are her favorites she likes them all or they wouldnt be in here its her store isnt it right he started to pluck some at random dont be in such a damn hurry she brushed his fingers aside when she gets in before me she tends to put one of these three on then ill take these three and these we sell books too i know you sell books im just what would you recommend she hosed him but sam decided it was money well spent or well enough it wasnt as if he couldnt use a hundreddollar coffee table book on renaissance art or this weeks top ten bestsellers or the six cds and the three audiotapes and the rest of it at least when lulu had rung him up shed laughed and meant it he left café book several hundred dollars poorer and with a great deal left to do in a short amount of time despite that he arrived at mias door at exactly seventhirty she was just as prompt and stepped out carrying a slim file notes she said on the event and copies of the flyer that went out the stores newsletter and the ad that will run for the next two weeks cant wait to see them he gestured toward his car want the top up no lets keep it down she noted hed meant casual he wore dark trousers and a blue tshirt once again she had to suppress the urge to ask him where they were going for dinner by the way he gave her a light kiss before he opened the car door for her you look wonderful all right she thought smooth and lightly flirtatious she could play that game i was just thinking the same thing about you she replied as she slid into the car its a lovely evening for a drive down the coast my thoughts exactly he walked around to the drivers side got behind the wheel music yes she settled back calculating how much time she would allow him to seduce her then lifted her eyebrows in surprise as flutes played on the speakers an odd choice for you she commented you were always more fond of rock particularly if it was loud enough to slam the eardrums no harm in changing the pace now and then exploring different avenues he lifted her hand kissed it broadening horizons but if youd prefer something else no this is fine and arent we accommodating she shifted her hair flying around her face the car handles well want to try it out maybe on the way back deciding against trying to puzzle him out for now she sat back to enjoy the rest of the ride and when he drove through the village without stopping she tensed up again she studied the yellow cottage when he parked in front odd i didnt realize youd turned this into a restaurant i believe thats a violation of your lease its temporary he got out and came around the car for her dont say anything yet again he lifted her hand brushed his lips over her knuckles if you decide youd rather go somewhere else well go somewhere else but give it a minute first still holding her hand he led her around the house rather than into it on the freshly mowed lawn a white cloth was spread it was surrounded by candles not yet lit and pillows in rich colors and fabrics beside it was a long basket overflowing with lilacs he lifted it for you she studied the flowers then his face lilacs are out of season tell me about it he said holding the basket out to her until she took it you always liked them yes ive always liked them what is all this sam i thought wed have a picnic a compromise between business and pleasure public and private a picnic you always liked them too he leaned forward to brush his lips over her cheek why dont we have a glass of wine and you can think about the idea to refuse would be both cold and ungracious and she admitted cowardly just because shed once imagined them happily married and having picnics on the lawn by their own little cottage was no reason to slap at him for trying to give her a pleasant evening id love some wine ill be right back with it she let out a little sigh when he was out of earshot and when the back door swung shut behind him she lifted the basket of lilacs and buried her face in them moments later she heard the music of harp and pipe drifting from the house with a shake of her head she sat down on one of the pillows put the basket of flowers beside her and waited for him to come back he brought not only wine but caviar some picnic he sat and in an almost absent gesture lit the candles sitting on the grass doesnt mean you cant eat well he poured the wine tapped his glass to hers slainte she nodded in acknowledgment of the irish toast youve been tending the little garden in my limited capacity did you plant it some of it and some is nells doing i can feel her in the house he heaped beluga on a toast point her joy in it he said and offered the caviar to mia joy is one of her greatest gifts when you look at her you dont see the horror shes been through its been an education to watch her finish discovering herself how do you mean with us it always was the knowing with nell it was finally unlocking a door then stepping through it and finding a room full of fascinating treasures the first magic i showed her was how to stir the air her face when she did it it was wonderful i never taught anyone i did attend a weekend seminar on wicca a few years ago though really she licked caviar off her thumb and how was that it was earnest i went on impulse and actually met a few interesting people some of them with power one of the lectures dealt with the salem trials and segued into three sisters island he helped himself to the caviar they had most of the facts but not the spirit not the heart this place he skimmed the woods listened to the beat of the sea it cant be summed up in a fiftyminute lecture he looked back at her will you stay ive never left no he brushed her hand with his for dinner she picked up another toast point yes he topped off her wine before he rose itll take me a minute ill give you a hand no its under control under control he thought as he went back to the kitchen thanks to nell not only had she prepared everything and delivered it but shed left him a detailed list of instructions one hed discovered that even the culinary retarded could follow blessing nell he managed to serve the tomato slices in oil and herbs and the cold lobster its lovely mia stretched out comfortably as she enjoyed the meal i had no idea you were such a whiz in the kitchen untapped talents he said and smoothly changed the subject im thinking of buying a boat are you john bigelow still makes wooden boats to order though he only does one or two a year now ill go see him do you do any sailing now occasionally but it was never a passion of mine i remember he touched her hair you preferred watching boats to being on one or being in the water rather than on it she glanced over as a group of teenagers raced by using the shortcut from one of the neighboring summer rentals to the beach mr bigelow rents boats too but if you want to try your hand again before you buy youre better off talking to drake at seafarer hes built up a very nice rental business drake birmingham i havent seen him since ive been back or stacey how are they theyre divorced she took the kids they had two and moved to boston drake remarried about six years ago connie ripley they have a little boy connie ripley sam flipped through mental images as he tried to place her big brunette with a lot of teeth that would be connie she was just ahead of me in school he recalled drake must be at least hes on the other side of fifty mia twirled her wineglass by the stem the age difference and the speculation about a blistering affair between them causing the marriage to break up was the hot topic onisland for a good six months she plucked up another bite of lobster nell really outdid herself the lobsters delicious he winced tagged do i lose points not at all by hiring three sisters catering you show wisdom and good taste now she crossed her legs picked up her file i love looking at you he traced a fingertip over her ankle any light any angle but just now when the suns going down and the candles are tossing light i love looking at you it fluttered in her blood the words the tone the look in his eyes as he shifted toward her lightly his hand cupped the back of her neck sweetly his lips rubbed against hers the flutter turned to a melting she breathed him in along with the scent of lilacs and candle wax and her head took one long lazy spin sorry he pressed a kiss to her forehead then eased back there are moments when i cant keep my hands off you lets see what youve got here what she had was a case of weak knees and dizzy confusion hed kissed her bones away one moment and was now briskly reviewing her file what is this about sam business and pleasure he said absently and skimmed his hand down her back before taking out her copy of the upcoming ad this is great did you design it settle down she ordered herself yes you should send a copy to her publicist done good ive already seen the flyer but i dont think i told you how effective it is thank you problem he asked nonchalantly she felt her teeth clench at his mild question irritated that she was irritated mia composed herself no i appreciate your input she took a deep breath i really do this is a big event for the store i want it done not just right but perfectly im sure carolines going to enjoy herself there was something some subtle something in the way he said the name you know her personally hmm yeah this is a nice touch having nell make a cake that reproduces the book jacket the flowers you may want to change them to pink roses i seem to recall she prefers those you seem to recall uhhuh i see here youre planning to have champagne and chocolate in her suite as a welcome gift from the store id suggest since the hotel would already provide this amenity that we add a couple of things and combine it from the hotel and the store mia tapped her fingers on her knee then made herself stop thats an excellent idea perhaps some candles a book on the island that sort of thing perfect he skimmed through the email and faxed correspondence between mia and the publicist nodded i cant see youve missed a trick so he laid the folder aside leaned toward her again when his mouth was a breath from hers she pressed a hand to his chest smiled id like to freshen up she got to her feet took her wine with her and walked into the house once in the kitchen she took a good look around it was admirably tidy but then she doubted if he used it except for brewing his first hit of coffee in the morning hed always been a cliché in the kitchen the man who could burn water she saw nells instruction sheet lying on the counter and softened she wandered into the living room pursing her lips in consideration when she spotted the coffee table book there were candles here as well and he used them it made her wonder what rituals and meditation techniques he practiced when he was alone like her hed always been a solitary witch there were no photographs but she hadnt expected them the pair of lovely watercolors on the wall was unexpected garden scenes she mused soft and serene it surprised her that he hadnt selected more dramatic and bold images other than the candles and paintings and the obviously new and unread book there was little of sam logan in the living area of the cottage he hadnt surrounded himself with the bits of comfort that were so essential to her no flowers or little pots of plants no bowls of colorful stones or glass since she had pried this far and she reminded herself she was both his lover and his landlord she didnt scruple to walk into his bedroom there was more of him here the scent the feel the old iron bed shed bought for the cottage was made up in an almost militarily efficient dark blue spread the floors were bare but there was a book on his nightstand a thriller that shed enjoyed herself marked with one of his business cards the single painting here was bold and dramatic an old stone altar rose out of rocky ground into a sky vivid with the triumphant red streaks of sunrise on his dresser was a large and lovely chunk of sodalite that she imagined he used for meditation his windows were open and she could smell the lavender shed planted herself because it made her yearn the simplicity the fragrance that almost ridiculously masculine sense of him she turned away from it in the tiny bathroom she freshened her lipstick dabbed the perfumed oil she had made herself on her throat her wrists since sam was priming her for a seduction she would accommodate him but not until she was home again on her own ground she could play toy and tease just as skillfully as he when she came back out hed already switched the dinner service for glass bowls filled with ripe red strawberries and rich whipped cream i wasnt sure if you wanted coffee or more wine wine a confident woman she thought could afford to be just a bit reckless night was sliding in she sat beside him letting her fingers dance through his hair before she reached for a berry i had no idea deliberately watching him she ran her tongue over the berry then nipped in that you were interested in renaissance art some circuit in his brain seemed to cross wires he could almost hear it fizzle what renaissance art she dipped her finger into the cream licked it off the book in your living room the oh he managed to tear his gaze away from her mouth yes its a fascinating period she waited until hed coated a berry with cream then leaned over playfully and took a bite of it mmm she purred and slid her tongue over her top lip do you prefer tintorettos depiction of the annunciation or ertes another circuit snapped both are brilliant oh absolutely except of course erte was a sculptor art deco and born centuries after the renaissance i assumed you were referring to giovanni erte an obscure and impoverished renaissance artist who died tragically of scurvy he was very unappreciated the laugh rolled out of her and tightened every muscle in his stomach oh that erte i stand corrected this time she nipped his bottom lip instead of a berry youre awfully cute arent you i paid through the nose for that book i imagine lulus still cackling about it he let her feed him a berry i went in to buy some music and came out with fifty pounds of books i like the music she lay back across the white cloth her head on an emeraldgreen pillow it relaxes me makes me think about floating in a warm river in a shady wood mmm my heads full of wine she stretched lazily so the thin fabric of her dress slithered over her curves i dont suppose ill be able to drive your sexy car tonight after all she waited for him to tell her she could drive it in the morning to ask her to come inside to stay with him and when he lay beside her traced a fingertip down her throat over the rise of her breasts she smiled we can take a walk let the sea air clear your head a bit he caught the flicker of surprise on her face just before he lowered his mouth to hers he nibbled nipped let his hands roam he felt her yield the softening of her body the quickening of her pulse to torment them both he trailed his fingers along her leg skimming them under her dress to the warm silky skin of her thigh circling the witch mark unless he slid a finger under the edge of her panties at the hip closed his teeth lightly lightly over her breast through the soft cotton of her dress youre not in the mood for a walk she felt more than reckless now and arched her hips in invitation no a walk isnt what im in the mood for then he bit just a little harder ill drive and when he rose held out a hand she gaped at him drive drive you home seeing her in speechless shock was he thought nearly as satisfying as no not even close to as satisfying he admitted but it was precisely the reaction hed hoped for he pulled her to her feet then bent down to pick up her file and her flowers dont want to forget these she recalculated on the drive home he assumed correctly she thought that she wouldnt stay with him at the cottage and hed decided also correctly that in order to complete the seduction he would need to maneuver her into her own bed and that mia thought as she leaned back to watch the stars was exactly where she wanted him since hed gone to so much trouble and it had been sweet of him she would let him persuade her once theyd had sex her mind and her body would be back on an even keel when they pulled up at her house she felt fully in control of the situation it was a lovely evening absolutely lovely the look she sent him was as warm as her voice as he walked with her to the door thanks again for the flowers youre welcome at the door with her wind chimes singing and the lamplight glowing against the windows he ran his hands up her arms down again come out with me again ill rent a boat and we can spend a lazy day on the water swim maybe he cupped her face in his hands tangled them in her hair as he kissed her going deeper when she made a quiet sound of pleasure when she pressed invitingly against him he reached behind her opened the door better go in he murmured against her mouth yes better nearly dizzy with need she stepped into the house and turning caressed his cheek he thought she looked like a siren ill call you with a hand that he considered admirably steady he pulled the door closed between them they had he thought as he walked to the car just had their first official date in eleven years and it had been a doozy fifteen sneaky bastard no one had managed to get her so churned up since well mia admitted no one had managed to get her so churned up since sam logan and he was better at it now then again she was better at banking her sexual urges than shed once been shed had lovers over the years but theyd been few and far between as time had passed she discovered that while she enjoyed the casual flirtation she very rarely felt satisfied or content after having a man in her bed so shed stopped at flirtations it was something she considered a practical rather than an emotional decision the energy and power she might have channeled into that area of physicality had gone instead into her craft there was no doubt in her mind that she was a better witch for the period of selfimposed celibacy there was no reason whatsoever why she couldnt apply the same habit now since sam hadnt been in her bed for more than two weeks it seemed the most logical choice in any case she was much too busy to worry about sam or sex or just why he wasnt following through on any of that maddening foreplay you didnt have to come back for this she said to nell as she rearranged the café tables i wanted to come back im as excited about the signing tomorrow as you are ill get the chair for that no you wont no lifting period as she set the chairs herself mia kicked the one ripley was slouched in you could get off your ass and help hey you dont pay me im just hanging out here so i dont have to hang out at home while this malebonding barbecue ritual is going on i hope to hell mac doesnt blow something up its a charcoal grill nell reminded her charcoal doesnt explode you dont know my guy like i know my guy between the three of them they should be able to get it going and grill some steaks the image of zack grilling burgers on their own deck flashed in nells mind and made her shudder but god help your poor kitchen least of my worries ripley crossed her feet at the ankles legs stretched out and watched in amusement as mia continued to change the table arrangement now that one there she jerked her thumb toward mia shes got plenty of worries see the line she gets between her eyebrows means shes feeling bitchy i dont have a line between my eyebrows and vanity had mia smoothing it out nor am i feeling bitchy slightly stressed perhaps which is why the barbecues such a good idea nell walked over to the display table and began to toy with a design for the featured authors book youll relax have an evening with friends and be clearheaded for tomorrow im glad sam thought of it hes always thinking mia concluded but ripley and nell could hear the underlying edge to her statement so how did you like the concert on the beach the other night ripley asked her it was fine and the moonlight sail after the fireworks on the fourth dandy see ripley nodded toward nell told you she was feeling bitchy i am not feeling bitchy mia set down a chair with an illtempered little slap are you looking for a fight nope im looking for a beer ripley replied and sauntered into the café kitchen to help herself its going to be a wonderful event mia ready to soothe nell continued to stack books itll be beautiful when you get the flowers in here tomorrow and the refreshments are completely under control wait until you see the cake im not worried about the flowers or the refreshments when you see how many customers start lining up youll feel better im not worried about the customers or not any more than i should be mia dropped into a chair for once ripley is right i am feeling bitchy is that a confession ripley asked as she came out with her beer oh shut up mia dragged her hands through her hair hes using sex or rather using the lack of sex to keep me edgy candlelight picnics moonlight sails long walks he sends flowers every couple of days but no sex mia leveled a look at ripley theres considerable foreplay mia snapped then he dumps me at my front door and walks off the next day i get flowers he calls every day and twice ive gone home and found a little gift at the front door a pot of rosemary trained in the shape of a heart a little pottery dragon when were out hes absolutely charming the bastard ripley slammed her hand on the table hangings too good for him hes using sex mia complained no hes not with a dreamy smile nell brushed a hand over mias hair sex has nothing to do with it hes using romance hes courting you he is not flowers candlelight long walks thoughtful little gifts nell ticked the list off on her fingers time and attention that spells courtship to me sam and i passed by the courtship stage a number of years ago and that courtship didnt include flowers and little gifts maybe hes trying to make up for that he doesnt have to make up for anything i dont want him making up for anything jittery she got to her feet walked over to shut the terrace doors he doesnt want the traditional package any more than i do now he just wants and that was the trouble mia realized she had no clear idea what he wanted this time around either hes got you scared ripley said quietly he doesnt he absolutely does not he never scared you before you always had your course plotted its still plotted i know what im doing i know where im going that hasnt changed even as she said it she felt a sly chill whisper over her skin mia there was both sympathy and patience in nells voice are you still in love with him do you think id risk letting him into my heart again that id risk that not knowing the cost steadier now mia crossed over to finish the display i know my responsibility to this island its people to my gift love for me is an absolute i couldnt survive it again and i have to survive to fulfill my destiny and if he is your destiny i thought that once i was wrong when the time comes the circle will hold at the house on the bluff three men watched the flames spurt from the charcoal grill with the same intense fascination as the cavemen watched their tribal fire going good zack commented and nodded at sam see i told you we could do it with good old yankee knowhow we didnt need any hocuspocus crap good old yankee knowhow sam drawled an entire bag of charcoal and a half gallon of lighter fluid i cant help it if his grills defective this is a brandnew grill mac protested this is its virgin run which is why it needs the hot flame has to be cured zack tipped back his beer mac looked on sadly as the inside of his shiny red grill blackened if this sucker melts ripleys going to kill me its goddamn cast iron zack gave it a little boot with his foot speaking of rip where the hell are they theyre on their way sam replied as zack frowned at him a little hocuspocus crap i like knowing where mia is since mister science here clued us in on those readings around her house ive been keeping tuned to her she finds out shell kick your ass zack pointed out she wont find out she doesnt see clearly when it comes to me she doesnt want to and its damn hard getting mia to do anything she doesnt want how are things you know going between you sam studied mac as he drank is that personal or professional interest i guess you could say its both fair enough i like the way things are going cant say i mind keeping her guessing shes a hell of a lot more complicated than she used to be and its interesting more than i figured getting to know all the twists and turns zack scratched his chin youre not going to start talking about mature relationships and exploring your inner couple or any of that shit are you shh here they come mac gestured toward the slash of headlights on the shell road lets act like we know what were doing lucy whod been sprawled over the deck leaped to attention and flew down the steps inches ahead of mulder pretty women zack said a couple of good dogs and some steaks damn good deal the steaks were charred the potatoes slightly underdone but appetites were keen enough they ate on the deck by the strong glow of candles and the backwash of light from the living room where music pumped out of the stereo when sam lifted a bottle of wine to fill mias nearly empty glass she shook her head laid her hand over the bowl no im driving and i need a clear mind for tomorrow ill come by in the morning give you a hand with the setup no need most of its done and we have plenty of time tomorrow i already have thirtyeight presold copies of the hardcover with orders still coming in and nearly that many of her backlist set aside shes going to be very busy tomorrow i imagine shell mia trailed off as she caught the look on nells face her body tensed and she rose half out of her chair nell the baby moved the expression of shock and astonishment turned to wonder i felt the baby a fluttering inside me she laughed pressed a hand to her belly so quick and strong zack she grabbed his hand pressed it against her our baby moved do you need to lie down no she leaped up tugged his hand i need to dance you need to dance yes dance with me she threw her arms around his neck well dance with jonah we dont know its a boy swamped with love zack wrapped his arms around her waist drew her up to her toes and held tight might just as easily be a girl then its rebecca uhoh theyre getting sappy before it rubbed off ripley got up pointed at mac youre dancing somebodys going to get hurt mac muttered sam watched the entertainment for a moment then laid a hand on mias we used to be good at this hmmm she was staring at nell her face wistful and so totally unguarded that seeing it was like a fist to his heart tears sparkled on her lashes what he saw in them was love and longing dancing holding her hand he stood we used to be good at it lets see if we still are following impulse he pulled her down the steps to the bluff then he spun her out to arms length whipped her back her arm hooked smoothly around his neck her body fit to his oh yeah he slid his hands down to her hips and began to sway with her were still good it had been a long time but she hadnt forgotten his moves his rhythm and she remembered as well the sheer pleasure of moving with him to music giving herself to it she kicked off her shoes sand flew under their feet as they turned dipped and spun dancing had always been a kind of joyful and somehow innocent mating ritual between them bursts of energy coordination anticipation she stopped hearing the music with only her ears she heard it in the quick pressure of his hand on her back the grip of his fingers on hers the whirl of her own body when he lifted her off her feet she threw her head back and laughed then she linked her arms around his neck for the first time in more than a decade in an embrace that was sheer and simple affection the applause and whistles exploding from the deck had her shifting her head leaving her cheek resting against his temple as she caught her breath told you they were showoffs ripley elbowed mac but she was grinning hey we dont have to take this abuse come on holding mias hand sam dashed down the beach steps so that mia had to run to keep up slow down youll break our necks ill catch you to prove it he hauled her up spun her in circles how about a swim no okay well dance instead he set her on her feet pulling her close and tight against him the slow seductive strains of sea of love flowed into the air over the beach thats an old one she remarked classic he corrected change of pace he buried his face in her hair as they circled in the sand her heart was a steady beat against his their legs brushed as she rose on her toes sliding with him until they formed one shadow in the moonlight he remembered so much that the shapes and sounds of all the memories whispered and blurred in his brain do they still have dances in the high school gym yes do kids still sneak outside to neck probably lets pretend he turned his head skimming his lips along her jaw before they met hers come back with me before she understood could think to resist she found herself spinning they were no longer dancing on the sand but wrapped together in the shadows of the high school gym while a crisp fall breeze blew the scents of aging leaves and blooming mums around them music pumped out of the building a rebel crash of drums and guitars her hands rushed over the cool worn leather of his jacket into the silky warmth of his hair his body was slimmer his mouth less skilled but oh how hers responded the torch of love burned blinding bright inside her she whispered his name mindlessly and offered everything it was the ache swelling inside her throbbing like a wound that snapped her back breath heaving she shoved him away damn you damn you that wasnt fair no im sorry his head was spinning for a moment he could still smell the crispness of autumn in the humid press of summer air no it wasnt fair i wasnt thinking dont walk away he pressed his fingers to his temples as she turned from him he hadnt planned it and would have found some way to stop the impulse that had taken them back into what theyd been how could he have known what it would be like to have her love him like that again to feel that absolute purity of emotion from her to know hed tossed it away and might never never have it again when he steadied himself she was standing at the edge of the water hugging herself and staring out at the night mia he went to her but didnt touch her one of them he was certain would break if he did i have no excuse no way to apologize for that kind of manipulation i can only tell you i didnt intend to do it you hurt me sam i know and myself he thought more than i could have realized time cant be erased and it shouldnt be she turned to him now her face pale against the night i dont want to go back to that girl or that boy i dont want to give up what ive made of myself i wouldnt change a thing of what youve made of yourself youre the most astonishing woman ive ever known words are easy no theyre not some of them have never been easy for me mia but when he reached out she turned away again then froze as she saw the pale blue light spilling out of the cave stop it you go too far he saw it too and did touch her now so she would feel and believe him im not doing it wait here he set her behind him then strode quickly toward the cave stopping only when he stood at the opening washed in the light he heard her step beside him but said nothing as they both looked inside the light in the cave was soft and blue the shadows deep and still as wells in that light were two people images carved like statues out of the light itself then they breathed the man was beautiful the sleek muscles of his long naked body gleamed with water his hair was glossy black spilling damp and straight over his shoulders as he stretched on his side in a deep sleep the woman was beautiful tall and slender in her dark cloak she stood looking down at him the hood was tossed back so the fiery curls of her hair tumbled free to her waist in her arms she held a pelt black as midnight and still wet from the sea when she turned mia saw what seemed to be her own face with the skin glowing as if a thousand candles were alight beneath it love the one who had been fire said is not always wise she walked toward them cradling the pelt like a child it has no conditions and no regrets she rubbed her cheek against the pelt as she stepped out of the cave time is shorter than you think mia lifted a hand a gesture of comfort and command mother the one who was fire stopped and her beauty shimmered when she smiled daughter i will not fail you it is not for me she traced her fingers along mias cheek and mia felt a line of warmth take care not to fail yourself youre more than i was she looked back into the cave you forget too often that he is in you as well hugging the pelt she turned back until her eyes met sams and me in you she walked away across the sand it watches in the dark and vanished like smoke the light in the cave winked out i can smell her mia cupped her hands in the air as if it were water and brought it to her face lavender and rosemary you saw her amulet he lifted the disk of silver and sunstone that mia wore on a linked chain this one the same way i looked at her face and saw this one he said lifting mias chin i have a lot to think about she started to step away but her gaze was drawn up as she watched an inky haze blurred the bright edges of the moon troubles coming she whispered seconds before they heard the growl fog spilled in from the sea crawled up the sand the wolf the pentagram a white flash against its black body waded into the mist and bared its teeth for the second time sam pushed mia behind him his body blocked hers like a shield go now get to the house i wont run from this she stepped to the side into clear view and watched the wolf track her with no time to wait for her circle she began the spell alone air that swirls and spins arise build to wind that screams and cries tremble earth beneath the sea walls of water build for me she speared her hands up through the gale that spewed around her her hair blew out wild ropes of red and at the shout of her voice the quiet waves of the cove boiled up higher higher with each crash the world roared rage and thrash and whirl for me air and earth and rising sea flames within my blood that churns i conjure from you a circle that burns now you that crawled out of the mire come if you dare and face my fire a ball of lightning hurled out of the sky blazing like a comet on its violent arc an instant before it crashed into the land she saw the black wolf curl itself back into the fog coward she called out riding wildly on the whip of her own power mia sams voice was rock steady can you turn it back i just did no baby the wave ah she studied the wall of water a full twenty feet high now and sweeping closer while the jaws of wind snapped vicious teeth she held out her arms targeted her energy down them like sighting down the barrel of a gun then flung it outward the wave collapsed into a shower of silver drops the cool rain of them washed to shore over her hair and skin as she twisted her fisted hand and gathered back the spinning wind the night was once more clear as glass the breeze playful as a faerie she threw back her head gulping in air while the heat of power streamed through her blood well yes that gave him a taste didnt it sam was still gripping her shoulder as he had been since shed stepped out from behind him how long have you been doing that spell actually that was the first time i put it all together i have to say she blew out a laughing breath it was better than sex hearing the shouts and running feet from above on the bluff she turned to reassure her friends are you sure youre all right mia grabbed one of nells stroking hands im fine well i could use a drink ripley popped open a beer turned to mia you no thanks she already felt wonderfully gloriously drunk some lemonade for the little mother ripley poured a glass sit down or something nell youre making me twitchy i think we should go down and see what theyre doing oh let them play with their toys restless ripley paced the deck mac and the other men had hauled equipment down to the beach even now she could hear the beeps and mechanical squeals that was a pretty big spell there glenda how did it feel mias lips curved slow and smug figured even linking last minute and adding a push i got a nice rush always leaves me wanting more though zacks going to get very lucky later nell laughed then immediately stopped herself how can we stand around here laughing about sex that was terrifying mia we couldnt get down to you your wind came up like a tornado a nice summer breeze wouldnt have done it and you did get to me i felt you with her hands braced on the rail she leaned out her face lifted to the sky it was like a thousand hearts beating inside me a thousand voices in my head and every cell every muscle every drop of blood was so alive when it looked at me she whirled back when it looked at me it was afraid maybe its finished nell said mia shook her head no not yet whethers its done or not ive got to say one thing ripley tipped back her beer i didnt know you had that much and ive known you all your life and seeing what i saw tonight ive got a better handle on why youve always been so picky and careful thats a lot of firepower to cart around is that a compliment its an observation with a warning tagged on wait for us next time okay she gathered up three more beers playtimes over lets go see what mac and his pals have come up with on the beach mac had sensors and monitors scattered cables strewed everywhere he sat on the ground hammering away at the keyboard of his laptop hauling the equipment down carting it to where mac wanted it had helped but sam needed to do something physical and sweaty to take the edge off look this is all really cool stuff but what the hell is it doing measuring triangulating documenting mac tapped more keys squinted behind his glasses at a near monitor wish id gotten to a damn camera best estimate on that waves twenty feet but thats just eyeballing it from up above twentys conservative sam said mildly and thats eyeballing it from down below um ah mac peered at the readout on his thermometer give me your best guess at ambient temperature at the center here during the climax of the event sam shot a look at zack who just shrugged ambient temperature jesus it got hot but was it a dry heat zack asked and made sam laugh makes a difference mac shoved up his glasses and frowned the ambients around the negative energy flow dip it gets cold in trying to reconstruct and calculate the ion clash and the dominant direction of force i need reasonable estimates of the ambients it got hot sam said again damn it im a witch not a meteorologist very funny now take that sensor and get me a reading where her fireball hit hey wow as one of his machines began to hum like a beehive he scrambled up barely missed snagging his foot on a cable he made a dash for it just as the women came down the beach steps oh shouldve known he nodded crouched down to get a better look at the readings im going to take a look at the cave nell informed mac i want to help if i can he grunted then crooked a finger at mia amused at him she strolled closer then stopped when he held up a hand whoa baby he said look at this just look its phenomenal are you doing any internal spells do you have anything working actively working in another area not at the moment why your readings are spiking theyre all over the place and all the way up the scale you always have a high level even at rest but this is a big surge hold on i want to measure your vital signs he took her blood pressure her body temperature her heart rate he was studying the readout on her brain wave patterns when the rest of the group gathered around them how do you do it macs voice was quiet now and sober mia leaned toward him mimicking his tone she pretended innocence do what mac the level of energy pumping around inside you right now would have most people bouncing off the walls but your vitals are well within normal range youve been sitting here calm as ice for ten minutes exquisite control now this has been a delightful and entertaining evening but i really have to go she rose one smooth movement of grace and brushed the sand from her skirts i have a busy day tomorrow why dont you stay here in the guest room you dont have to worry about me mac its not finished no its not finished but its done for tonight sixteen she didnt sleep nor had she expected to instead she put the bubbling energy to good use she worked on kitchen magic put together some pocket charms she polished furniture scrubbed floors then gave herself a manicure at dawn she was in the gardens selecting and clipping the flowers she wanted for store decoration when she arrived at café book at eight her energy level showed no signs of waning nell dependable as sunrise arrived at nine loaded with supplies you look incredible nell said as mia helped her transport boxes and containers i feel incredible its going to be a good day mia nell set the cake box on the refreshment table i trust you but its just not like you to be so casual about what happened last night that level of magic that scope was like having a dragon by the tail mia finished i take what happened very seriously i have to ride this wave little sister physically i really dont have a choice it doesnt mean im not aware or that im glib or that i dont know that whats coming is more potent yet a dragon by the tail nell thought more like a herd of them i saw what you were able to call last night i felt the edge of it whip through me just the edge and it was staggering now youre setting up for a book signing as if its the most important thing you have to do today it is she took one of nells apple fritters from a box cant seem to get enough to eat its a matter of routing the energy which i imagine you did very skillfully with zack last night she smiled a little as she bit into the pastry ive had a lot of practice finding ways other than sex to route mine you could serve canapés off my kitchen floor this morning i thought you and sam would leave together so did i thoughtfully mia licked sugar from her finger apparently he had other things to do after you left mac took readings from sam sam didnt like it zack had to insult him into it you know the way men do questioning the size and stamina of his penis basically and calling him mary ah yes mia chuckled and nibbled always effective sams readings were nearly as high as yours still ravenous mia contemplated another fritter really macs theory or one of them is that sam was at ground zero and absorbed some of the energy flying around now of course he wants to wait a few days and then get readings from sam for comparison his standard levels and so on mia gave in took the second pastry and told herself shed do an extra hour of yoga later sam wouldnt care for that no he didnt like it but my impression is hes going to cooperate macs very persuasive and he used you me any data are essential every scrap of information goes into the whole and helps dont get mad at this protect you mia brushed sugar from her fingertips admired the slick coral polish on her nails did i give anyone the impression last night that i needed protection theyre men nell said simply and restored mias good humor cant live with them cant turn them into jackasses with preparations at café book well under control mia went down to meet the ten oclock ferry she noted that pete stubenss dog had gotten off the leash again and was racing around the docks with the remains of some unfortunate and very dead fish hanging out of his mouth she spotted carl maceys boat at the dock and imagined that he and his crew would be unloading a fresher more appetizing catch she toyed with wandering over and asking him to set aside some of it for her there was little doubt that by the end of the day her appetite would be just as keen as it was now hi miz devlin dennis ripley skidded his bike to a halt inches in front of the open toes of mias pradas hi mister ripley the boy grinned as he always did growing like a weed mia thought and well into the ganglyarmsandawkwardelbows stage in a couple of years she mused hed be zipping along in some secondhand car instead of on his bike and the idea made her sigh my moms coming to your store today to see that writer lady im glad to hear it my aunt pat works at the hotel and she says theyve got a fancy room for her with a whirlpool tub and a tv set in the bathroom is that so she says writers make lots of money and live high on the hog i imagine some do like stephen king his books are cool maybe ill write a book and you can sell it in your store then well both get rich she pulled down the bill of his ball cap and made him laugh id rather play for the red sox though gotta go he shot off whistling for petes dog who raced after him mia turned to watch them and there stood sam neither spoke for a moment but the air seemed to snap hi miz devlin hi mister logan excuse me a minute he slid his arms around her gripped the back of her dress in a fist and crushed his mouth down on hers and the air seemed to sizzle i didnt get around to doing that last night today works her lips vibrated from the heat of him she shifted away a test of will with the energy bubbling inside her and watched the ferry chug its way toward the dock ferrys on time we need to talk about last night yes we need to talk about a number of things but not today tomorrow then we should both be a little less distracted is that a euphemism mia asked amusing herself and stepped forward as the ferry docked a black sedan eased down the gangplank steered to the side before the driver could walk around to open the door a pretty blonde popped out of the backseat she gave a laughing shout then rushed forward and all but jumped into sams arms the kiss was audible an extended mmmmm with a quick popping sound at the end god its good to see you how did you manage to get betterlooking i cant believe im here on your island just thinking about its gotten me through a week of book tour wars lets have another kiss oh yes lets mia thought dryly as she watched the exchange caroline trump was as attractive as her book jacket photo a swing of sunny blond hair curved around a pretty elfin face warmed by honeybrown eyes and dominated by a shapely pink mouth a mouth that mia noted was currently fused to sams she had the young perky build of a high school cheerleader though her bio put her at thirtysix the bio had neglected to mention that she and sam logan had been lovers tell me everything youve been up to caroline demanded i cant wait to see your hotel there has to be time for you to show me around this place its great the book signing will probably be a dud god knows why they schedule in these little holesinthewall so i can cut out early well go to the beach you still talk too much sam eased her back giving her shoulders a squeeze welcome to three sisters caroline this is mia devlin the owner of café book oops caroline turned her cheerful smile on mia i do talk too much just run on and on i didnt mean it about the signing she took mias hand pumped im just all wired up havent seen sexy here for over six months and ive had about a gallon of coffee already this morning i really appreciate you having me its our pleasure mia said in a voice so smooth it made sam wince she drew her hand free of carolines grip i hope the trip from the mainland was pleasant it was great i then ill just add my welcome to sams and let you go so you can settle in if theres anything you need you can reach me at café book sam she said with a regal nod and walked away oh ouch caroline rapped a fist against her forehead im such a moron brilliant authorbookseller relations dont worry about it sam told her he would lets get you settled at the hotel i think youre going to like your suite an hour later sam braved the sting of hellfire and walked into café book upstairs lulu called out as she busily rang up sales and shes on a tear he found her giving instructions to the parttime clerk at the auxiliary checkout counter she didnt look like a woman on a tear he thought but like a coolly efficient business owner taking care of details but then lulu knew her all too well she moved away to replenish stock that customers had already taken from her area display is our vip settling in yes shes changing im going back shortly to take her to lunch i hope our little signing doesnt interfere too much with the social aspects of your reunion can we take this somewhere a little more private im afraid not she turned beaming a professional smile as a woman took another book off the display be sure to fill out the form for our prize drawings well be pulling names throughout the event she told the woman as you can see she said to sam im too busy dealing with my pesky event in my little holeinthewall to chat with you she didnt mean to insult you mia not to my face in any case theres no need for you to explain your friend to me on any level i was going to suggest you join us for lunch he didnt flinch at the long slow stare she aimed at him give her a chance to smooth over the awkward first impression not only would it take more than lunch to manage that but i dont have the time or the inclination and i certainly dont intend to be part of any little ménage à trois however civilized okay he thought first things first caroline and i havent been involved in that way for a long time and i dont appreciate having to explain something like that in the middle of the damn store she nudged him aside so that she could speak to a group of tourists who were currently goggling good morning i hope youll be staying for our event this afternoon she picked up a book to show them miss trump will be here to discuss and sign her latest by the time she finished her pitch and had the customers browsing the paperback display he was gone dud my butt mia murmured im going to be so charming shes going to forget i ever had my foot in my mouth stop obsessing caroline i cant she poked at her cobb salad and itll hurt my feelings if youve forgotten that about me obsession is like breathing for me im going to win her over before im finished youll see eat your lunch im nervous she made me nervous god sam i couldnt stop babbling you always babble he nudged the coffee aside nudged up her salad bowl no i chatter babblings different shes the one isnt she the one what the one you were always hung up on with her head angled to the side caroline studied him i always knew there was the one even when we were together yes shes the one hows mike doing ah she wiggled her fingers so she could see the glint of her wedding ring it was still new and though it was the second shed worn she was determined that this one would stick hes great misses me when im on tour which is good for my ego im going to have to bring him back here for a vacation its wonderful and she added you changed the subject to distract me you dont want to talk about mia devlin you look wonderful caroline happy successful i really enjoyed your new book okay we wont talk about her youre really not coming back to new york no im not coming back well she glanced around the dining room youve got a hell of a place here she studied the portrait of the three women turned a questioning glance at sam but when he simply continued to eat she tossed her napkin on the table ive got to get over there and make her love me or im not going to be able to settle down i dont believe ive ever seen you settled down but he rose signaled to the waiter youve got time for a little walk around the village no lets just do it ill go over to sign stock now and look around later he led her through the lobby and out onto the sidewalk terrific building she said scanning café book she squared her shoulders sucked in a breath okay lets do it shes not going to claw you caroline he waited for a break in the traffic guided her across the street she wants this event to be successful as much as you do brother you dont know females caroline stepped inside blinked wow what a place dream bookstore and im everywhere jesus sam its packed i cant believe i called this place rinkydink you didnt your term was holeinthewall right right did i mention i was a moron yes i think you did lulu this is caroline trump glad to have you lulu bagged up a sale stuck out her hand ive been ringing up your books like they were going out of style i read the new one last week it had a good punch thanks i love the store she turned in a circle i want to live here oh look at those candles sam i need ten minutes when she dashed off he leaned back watching fondly as she whipped through the aisles it took fifteen minutes but he managed to head her upstairs well you made lulu like you he commented that was just a side benefit her stock is so smart not just the selection of books which is impressive but the sidelines too class all the way and look at this she stopped at the top of the stairs dazzled the crowd was already thick the café tables were packed as were the rows of chairs over the hum of conversation she heard mias smooth voice announce her name and the time of the event its a wonder she didnt kick me out caroline murmured there must be a hundred people up here since youre determined to feel lousy about it ill tell you she worked her butt off look just pass on what you think to your publicist getting other authors to café book will go a long way toward prying your foot out of your mouth consider it done okay here she comes caroline boosted up her smile and walked in mias direction you have the most incredible store and i want to know if theres anything i can do to make up for being a jerk dont give it another thought can i get you something to drink a bite to eat were very proud of our café got any hemlock mia put a hand on her shoulder oh it could be arranged why dont i settle for a diet coke and you can put me to work i have a number of presells if youd like to take care of them before the event it will give you more beach time ill show you into the stockroom set you up pam mia called to the woman waiting tables would you bring ms trump a diet coke well be in the stockroom sam if youre staying you might want to find a seat just this way ms trump caroline please ive done enough of these to know how much time and effort go into hosting a signing i want to thank you were thrilled to have you caroline followed mia into the stockroom shed also seen enough behindthescenes action in bookstores to recognize ruthless organization ive flapped the copies at title page mia began if thats not your preference ill change them caroline moistened her lips these are all presold yes fiftythree at last count those that require personalizing i was told youd personalize sure no problem theyre labeled with postits your publicist indicated this is the brand of pen just stop a second caroline dumped her briefcase sat down at a stool at the counter ive never sold over a hundred new titles at a signing youre about to break your record i see that just as i see you have the pen i like and that there were pink roses my favorite on the signing table wait till you see the cake cake caroline seemed flabbergasted you have cake you sent me bubble bath and candles and were at the ferry to meet me as i said were thrilled to have you not finished yet your store which is amazing by the way is full of people and an unbelievable number of them are holding my books and you hate me because i said something careless rude and stupid no i was annoyed with you because you said something careless rude and stupid but i dont hate you for it mia moved to the door to take the soft drink from pam and because i was once involved romantically with sam yes her tone pleasant mia offered the drink naturally i hate you for that and thats fair caroline sipped her soft drink but since sam and i havent been anything but friends for more than four years and im happily married she wiggled the fingers of her left hand and since hes hung up on you who happen to be beautiful smart younger than i am and who has those really fabulous shoes i get to hate you more mia considered her for a moment that seems entirely reasonable she handed caroline a pen ill open these for you four hours later mia was in her office tallying figures when the publisher called on monday for a followup on the event she was going to knock their socks off nell came in dropped into a chair and patted the belly she was sure had started to round that was great that was outstanding that was exhausting i noticed that even with free refreshments the café did a brisk business tell me about it nell yawned hugely did you want to do totals well wait until closing for those however i do have the totals for the trump books that sold during her appearance and they are new title including presolds two hundred and twelve paper backlist also including presolds three hundred and three no wonder she walked out of here looking shellshocked congratulations mia she was terrific wasnt she funny and warm during the book discussion i really liked her yes mia tapped a pen on the edge of her desk so did i she used to be involved with sam oh nell straightened in the chair oh after meeting her its easy to see why he was attracted shes very clever urban energetic im not jealous i didnt say a word im not jealous mia repeated i just wish i hadnt liked her quite so much why dont you come home with me well sit around talk about men and eat hot fudge sundaes ive already gone way over my sugar intake for the day which is probably why im still edgy you go on ive got to finish here then im going home to sleep for twelve hours if you change your mind i have homemade fudge sauce nell pushed herself to her feet you did an amazing job mia we did we did a stupendous job she turned back to her keyboard and worked until six sticking to practical tasks gave her mind the chance to circle and circle and consider and it gave her the opportunity to admit that the buzz still vibrating through her wasnt going to quiet on its own given the alternatives to select from she saw no reason not to choose the one that appealed most sam stripped down to cutoffs and considered the cartons of leftover takeout chinese in his refrigerator he was as he had been all day famished he thought he might order in a pizza or a side of beef to top off the egg rolls and pork fried rice he was relieved that caroline had turned down his invitation to dinner as fond as he was of her his brain just couldnt handle an evening of struggling to concentrate on conversation not after the day hed put in or the night before it hed swum for an hour hard after he helped zack haul all the equipment back to the house on the bluff then hed swung by the hotel on the way home and let himself into the health club hed worked out another hour doing what he could to burn off the edge hed done fifty laps in the hotel pool taken a frigid shower and hadnt slept all night after the signing hed taken caroline back to the hotel where shed claimed she was going to take a long bubble bath hed used the health club again worked up a heavy sweat showered spent an hour swimming and his system was still careening he disliked sleep inducements even of his own making but he thought after he ate that that was the only solution left the only practical solution he corrected the more satisfying one would be to find mia drag her off somewhere rip off her clothes and pump out the energy in wild crazy sex which would take him right back to square one of his plan to cement a bond with her outside of wild crazy sex he wasnt sure his overworked system could take either hed settle for pizza he closed the refrigerator and turned toward the phone and when he saw her at the back door his entire body clenched like a fist served him right he thought grimly for trying to tame his raging hormones by tuning her out for a few hours but his expression was as easy and pleasant as hers as he crossed to the door didnt expect to see you i thought youd be somewhere with your feet up and a drink in your hand i hope you dont mind me dropping by not at all he opened the screen door and willed himself to behave i brought you a present she held out a box prettily wrapped in dark blue foil and topped with an elaborate white bow from the owner of café book to the owner of the magick inn she came in making sure her body brushed his lightly as she passed and she felt the quick tremor a gift to thank you for your part in making today happen it was an enormous success for all involved caroline was nearly staggering by the time she got to her room it takes a lot to wear her out im sure youd know mia countered shes married were friends thats it touchy she clucked her tongue why dont you offer me a drink and have one yourself fine he got out a bottle of wine yanked out the stopper i had a damn life the last decade mia i assume you did too naturally would you like me to parade some of my lovers for you helpfully she took glasses out of the cupboard the searing look he shot her pleased her enormously hed be easier and more fun to seduce if his temper was up i dont want to hear about them and i didnt parade caroline no but you didnt tell me beforehand either it made it awkward and irritating but ive decided to forgive you well golly thanks now youre annoyed why dont i pour that and you can open your present well see if it puts you in a better mood rapping your head against the wall might put me in a better mood but youre much too civilized for that dont go to the bank on it but he pulled off the top of the box and pulled out a wind chime made of foolish brass frogs i found it whimsical which suits the cottage and apt as i had a lovely fantasy going about how i turned you into one of these for a few days she tapped a frog sent it dancing and singing against its brothers then picked up her wine its very unique whenever i see it ill think of you theres a hook just outside the kitchen why dont you hang it see how it looks there obliging her he stepped outside looped it over the empty hook you smell of the sea she told him trailing a fingertip down the center of his bare back ive been swimming did it help no i could she leaned against him nibbled at his shoulder why dont we help each other because then its all about sex whats wrong with sex she was clouding his senses womans magic he turned gripped her arms we used to have more i want more again were both old enough to know we dont get everything we want so we take what there is she spread her hands over his chest felt surprise when he stepped back you want me i want you why complicate it its always been complicated mia so we simplify i need a release from what happened last night so do you we need to talk about what happened last night youre a real fan of talking lately she tossed back her hair nell has this notion that youre courting me a muscle jumped in his cheek thats not a word id use id say dating ive been dating you in that case she crossed her arms slid the straps of her dress from her shoulders and let it slither to the floor weve dated long enough seventeen hed have sworn the world stopped for one rushing moment there was no sound no movement there was nothing but mia tall and curved and beautiful all alabaster and fire she wore only a slim silver chain that nestled a moonstone between her breasts and an anklet made up of tiny celtic knots above shoes that were no more than a trio of narrow straps and stiletto heels his mouth watered you want me her voice was a low feline purr your body aches as mine does your bloods as hot wanting you has always been the easy part she stepped to him then this should be a snap she ran her hands up his torso over his chest youre trembling easing closer she rubbed her lips over his shoulder over muscles that were tensed rockhard so am i his hands flexed fisted this is your answer i dont need an answer when i dont have a question she lifted her head until their eyes met i have needs just as you do desires hot and restless inside me as you do we can both take what we need and harm no one she leaned in nipped sharply at his bottom lip lets take a walk in the woods when he jerked her hard against him her face lit with triumph a quick laughing moan escaped when he swung her into his arms the moment of victory was hot and sweet here he said in this house in my bed needs bubbling inside her clouded her mind only for an instant but an instant was enough to have him striding through the kitchen before she struggled no not here it cant be all your way i wont be with you here the minute she hit the bed she rolled but he pinned her yes you will she fought him pure instinct had her bucking under him straining against his hold she could smell the lavender shed planted outside the window and the sweetness of it tore at her heart she hadnt come for sweetness nor for intimacy she had come for sex she gathered herself reached for composure and derision all youve proved is that you have superior strength yeah thats the breaks he said her voice might have been cold but the heat was pumping off her skin im not letting you go this time mia considering the mood were both in you fighting me is only going to make this better so fight me he yanked her arms over her head i dont want it easy and i dont want it fast he handcuffed her wrists and used his mouth on her she continued to struggle because he was right she could damn him for it but he was right the underlying threat of violence added a slippery thrill that fed the reckless need inside her she could hate herself for wanting that for the part of her that reveled in being overpowered undone taken but she couldnt deny it he ravished his mouth assaulting her body the little war had her skin springing with sweat and her senses tangling into one mass of molten pleasure her body twisted arched but he simply found new spots to torture and entice the energy that burned inside her whipped to flash point ripped a cry from her throat as he drove her to the first brutal climax with his mouth alone and that quick and glorious release only fueled a hunger for more he felt her body quake heard her breath catch beneath his lips her pulse beat like fury her flesh was damp and fragrant erotically hot and slick knowing that she fought them both only added to the vicious passion surging through his blood he rode it recklessly until they were both quivering when his mouth conquered hers the kiss was a kind of madness there was no thought no room for reason in a war of lips and tongues and teeth they fed on each other when he felt her fly a second time he released her hands to take more they branded each other rolling restlessly over the bed in a search for dominance and more pleasure the air went thick and the sun streaming through the windows turned to gilt she rose over him craving her he reared up clamping his mouth over her breast drawing her in like breath she lost herself in the frenzy of sensation gave herself to that feral need to take and be taken here there was only desperation and the one man who could make her feel it the glory of those animal urges the mindless wonder of being alive raced inside her time quickened then sprinted past her as the storm inside her broke yet again breathless still spinning she wrapped herself around him holding on as if for her life her heart quaked and threatened to break open she heard his harsh murmurs as his body slid over hers as his lips skittered over her face her throat she shook her head quick denial as the gaelic stroked her aching heart light warm and blue pulsed from him no dont he couldnt stop what theyd brought to each other sapped his control the need to complete the intimacy was raw and open in him a ghra a amhain my love my only the words tumbled out of him without design his power shimmered seeking its mate even as his body craved but when he brushed his lips over her cheek tasted tears he squeezed his eyes shut im sorry his breath ragged he buried his face in her hair just a minute give me a minute he fought for control to pull the magic back inside him whatever they were or had been to each other he had no right to force her to share that part of herself she felt him quiver as he struggled to pull it in it would hurt him she knew a deep and physical aching that came from denying the blood and starving the soul still he held her while he locked himself away held her while she listened to his breath tear out against the pain of it she couldnt bear it for either of them she lifted his head looked into his eyes and gave him her magic share with me she said drawing him down into the kiss share all her light was gilded red against his deepening blue the brilliant thrill flooded her swamped her as their powers entwined and merged and merged streamed inside them both she let herself fly on it rose to him as he filled her there was a rush like the wind a stream of sound like a hundred harpstrings plucked at once the air swelled all she was and all he was laid open the air shimmered light against light building to a radiant glow even as he moved in her long slow thrusts that savored the gift he took her hands linked fingers curled tight and sparks swirled from them to dance in the air as they climbed the light brightened building building toward a flash that burst like lightning and on that burst he met her mouth with his and flew with her he nuzzled at the curve of her shoulder rubbed his cheek to hers whispering soft and foolish endearments his power continued to whisper inside her as well her body felt unbearably soft and though her heart continued to pound she knew its beat was no longer for her alone what had she done shed stripped aside by her own will the last of her defenses she had given him all she was taken all he was she had let herself love him again stupid she thought stupid careless and dangerous even knowing it she could lie here with his weight pressing against her and want to gather him close and cling to the dreamy echoes of what theyd shared she had to get away clear her head of him and consider what to do next she lifted a hand to his shoulder intending to nudge him away but her fingers slid into his hair mia his voice was thick and sleepy allaina so soft so lovely stay with me tonight wake with me tomorrow her heart trembled but when she spoke her voice was brisk and even youre speaking gaelic hmm youre speaking in gaelic now she did give his shoulder a little nudge which means youre about to fall asleep on top of me no im not he braced himself on his elbows so he could gaze down at her you make my head spin he dropped a kiss on her forehead then the tip of her nose im glad you dropped by it was hard to resist the easy affection so am i but i have to go now uhuh idly toying with her hair he studied her face im afraid i cant allow that and if you try im going to have to get rough with you again you know you liked it please she pushed at him tried to slither free you really liked it leaning down he lightly bit her shoulder maybe under this limited set of circumstances i found it arousing i needed an outlet for the excess energy that last nights spell worked up in me tell me about it he caught her chin in his hand i mean that i want you to tell me about it but right now im starving arent you starving ive got leftover chinese takeout yummy but mia we need to talk talk isnt the usual activity when were lying naked in bed and youre still inside me there is that he slid his hands under her hips lifted them slid deeper into her tell me youll stay her breath caught im not i want to watch you climb again he kneaded her hips his thrusts slow and steady just let me watch you he left her no choice he exploited her weakness drained her will with a ruthless tenderness he watched her surrender to him to herself to the rise of sensation and when she crested one long wave it rippled through him and he lifted her wrapped her close stay with a sigh she rested her head on his shoulder i could eat they made quick work of the chinese then scavenged for more by the time they were digging into a box of dry cereal the edge was off sam took a last handful of puffed rice strong magic and good sex nothing like it to sharpen the appetite i had two muffins a sandwich cake and a bowl of rotini and that was before the sex give me that she took the box from him and dug in it was a potent spell now that weve very efficiently cleaned out my kitchen of all edible products lets take that walk in the woods its getting late sam yeah it is he took her hand and we both know it he glanced down at her bare feet since i dont see how you can walk anywhere in those shoes you had on maybe we should head to the beach instead of the woods easier on your feet im used to walking barefoot in the woods it was best she thought to deal with it as long as they were talking or eating or seducing each other she wouldnt have to think about loving him or what she would do about it you want me to explain the spell and im not sure i can i dont want the nuts and bolts he drew her across the lawn toward the shadows and the path but id like to know first how long youve known you had that kind of power im not sure i did not exactly felt she continued as if there was a switch inside waiting for me to flip it its not that simple no its not she could smell the trees and the sea and on such a night she thought you could smell the stars a cool brush along the senses ive worked on it studied practiced ive gathered myself you understand that i also understand that to pull that out the way you did the other night without any real preparation is beyond anything ive experienced ive been preparing all my life and in the last decade she thought its been my one and only love still i couldnt finish it it wasnt quite enough determination toughened her voice but i will finish it thats where you and i have a problem what you did was dangerous for you it didnt have to be the risk was minimal if youd told me what you could do what youd obviously planned to do given the opportunity i could have been prepared i could have helped but you dont want my help she said nothing as they passed the little stream where foxglove nodded on the banks its been a long time since i considered having your help ive been back for over two months mia and were gone over ten years i learned to do a great deal without you in that length of time without anyone she added as ripley cut herself off from me and what we shared during the same period ive taken what i was given and honed it built it thats right you have i wonder if you would have if id stayed she rounded on him her temper quicker than it might have been as the same thought had come to her is that a new rationalization a new reason for what you did no he met her fury with utter calm my reasons for leaving were completely selfish it doesnt seem to change the results youre stronger than you would have been should i thank you for it she angled her head maybe i should maybe its time for me to acknowledge that your leaving was the best thing for both of us i saw you as the beginning and end of my life and everything in between but you werent i lived without you and whether you stay or go ill continue to live to work to be i can enjoy you now without illusions its a nice bonus to share myself with someone who understands power and who expects nothing in return but pleasure for pleasure it rubbed at his temper as he supposed shed intended it to dont thank me too soon you wondered why id maneuvered you into dating i needed to show you and maybe to prove to myself that theres more than sex between us of course there is calm again she began to walk theres magic a shared history and though i didnt initially believe it a shared love of the island we have mutual friends we were friends once were friendly now she breathed in deeply how do people live without the sea close how do they breathe mia he touched the tips of her hair when we made love i didnt intend to ask you to share magic with me it wasnt calculated i know that though she stopped walking she kept her back to him why did you let me because you wouldve stopped it meant something to me that you wouldve stopped when i asked and i suppose because ive missed it sharing power excites and fulfills was there no one else in all these years youve no right to ask me that no i dont so instead ill tell you what you dont ask me there was no one but you never anyone but you in that way it doesnt matter if it doesnt he said taking her arm before she could move away then you should be able to listen i never got over you and if i was with another woman it was never the way it was between us every one of them deserved better than i could give i couldnt give them better because none of them were you theres no need for this she began i need it ive loved you all my life no spell no incantation no act of will has ever been able to change that for me her heart stumbled in her chest it took all of her strength to balance it again but you tried i tried with women with work with travel not loving you is beyond my power do you think sam that even if it were only my own heart at risk i could pour it into your hands again then just take mine im not doing anything else with it i cant i dont know how much of what i feel is an echo of what was how much mixed with that is anger more she said turning back to him i dont know how much of what you believe you feel is real everythings at stake now and clouded emotions are dangerous my emotions arent clouded they were for a long time now mine are and ive learned to step back from them i care about you the links too strong for that to be otherwise but i dont want to be in love with you again sam and thats my choice if you cant accept that then we need to stay away from each other i can accept that its your choice for now but im going to do everything i can to change your mind she threw up her hands in frustration by sending me flowers going on picnics those are frills trappings those are romance i dont want romance deal with it i was too young and stupid to give it to you once im older and smarter now there was a time when it was hard for me to tell you i loved you didnt come naturally off my tongue and it sure as hell wasnt a phrase that was bandied about in my house i dont want you to tell me you always said it first he saw the surprise on her face you never realized that did you i was never able to say it to you unless youd said it times change people change some people take longer than others i realize ive been waiting mia maneuvering again so youd say it first easier for me that way you used to make things too damn easy for me fortunately thats changed now i have to go its late yeah its late i love you mia i love you i dont mind saying it a few hundred times until you believe it it hurt to hear it a quick pinching pain she used that pain to keep her heart cool and her voice even you gave me words before sam we gave each other words they werent enough i cant give you what you want she ran down the path away from him wont give me he replied yet she didnt stop until she got to her car didnt go into the house for her shoes or think about them she thought only of driving away driving fast until her mind settled again she had let herself love him again or rather her heart had turned on her when shed been vulnerable but that was her problem and one she would deal with rationally reasonably if loving him were the right choice it wouldnt make her so unhappy if hearing him say he loved her was the solution how could it have been like a blow to the heart she would not become a victim of her own emotions not a second time she wouldnt throw herself mindlessly into love putting herself and everything that mattered to her at risk balance she told herself and clear thinking they were essential when one was contemplating a lifeanddeath decision maybe it was time to take a few days off regroup shed been spreading herself too thin she decided she needed to be with herself alone what the hell do you mean shes gone annoyed at being roused out of sleep before eightthirty on a sunday on the only day that week she could sleep in ripley scowled at the phone shes off the island a pulse was pounding in sams throat making speech almost painful where did she go i dont know christ she sat up in bed scrubbed her hand over her face im not even awake how do you know she went offisland maybe shes just out for a walk or a drive he knew sam thought because hed tuned in to her and the snapping of the connection had awakened him next time he thought grimly he wouldnt limit the link to the island i just know i was with her last night she didnt say anything about plans on the mainland well she doesnt keep me as her social secretary did you have a fight or something no we didnt have a fight what theyd had could never be boiled down to such an elemental word if you have any idea where shes gone i dont but the worry in his voice got through listen ask lulu mia wouldnt go anywhere without letting her know she probably just went over to do some shopping or something and scowling ripley held the phone out and listened to the dial tone well goodbye to you too he didnt bother with the phone this time but jumped in his car and drove to lulus he barely noticed that shed changed the paint from the pumpkin orange he remembered from his boyhood to a wild purple he knocked on the front door you got two seconds to tell me why you woke me up out of a dream where i was dancing with charles bronson and we were both naked otherwise im kicking your wheres mia he snapped he slapped a hand on the door before she could slam it in his face just tell me shes okay why shouldnt she be did she tell you where she was going if she did im not telling you she could sense his anger and his fear you try any hocuspocus on me and ill not only kick your ass ill mop the floor with it now back off disgusted with himself he stepped back when the door slammed he just sat on the porch steps and rested his head in his hands had he driven her away was it some kind of ugly joke fate continued to play on them that one of them would love so much that the other was compelled to flee it didnt matter he told himself not now all that mattered now was that she was safe when he heard the door open again he stayed where he was you dont have to tell me where she is what shes doing or why she left i just need to know that shes all right any reason you know of she shouldnt be i upset her last night with a sniff lulu marched over and gave him a quick boot with her bare foot i shouldve figured it what did you do i told her i loved her behind his back lulu pursed her lips what did she have to say to that that she didnt want to hear it basically shes a sensible woman lulu said then immediately felt nasty more nasty than she was comfortable with shes taking a few days off thats all on the mainland shopping getting pampered do her good to decompress if you ask me shes been working round the clock okay he rubbed his hands on the thighs of his jeans then turned to face her okay thanks did you tell her you loved her to mess with her head i told her i loved her because i do messing with her head was just a side benefit i dont know why the hell i always liked you sam was shocked you did if i hadnt id have peeled the skin off your face for putting hands on my baby well im up she said and buried both hands in her disordered mop of hair to scratch her head you might as well come in and have some coffee too intrigued to refuse he followed her into the kitchen i always wondered why you didnt live at the cliff house first off because i couldnt stand those pompous selfabsorbed devlins she dug coffee out of a canister shaped like a piglet didnt mind spending a few days there when they were off on one of their trips but when they were at home i needed a place of my own otherwise i might have smothered them both in their sleep when did they leave for good few months after you did after but she was nineteen just shy of her twentieth birthday they headed off to who the hell cares came back once or twice during that year for form if you ask me mia hit twentyone and that was over guess they figured their job was done they never did their job sam stated you did thats right shes been mine since her grandmother put her in my arms shes still mine she shot him a challenging look over her shoulder i know it im glad of it maybe youve got some sense in that pea brain of yours after all she poured water from a cherryred kettle into the coffeemaker anyway after they moved offisland mia asked if i didnt want to come up and live with her plenty of room but i like my place and she likes being up there on her own she studied him while the coffeemaker burped and grumbled you thinking of trying to convince her to let you move up there with her ah i hadnt thought quite that far ahead dont change much do you always dance back from the sticking point and what would the sticking point be that girl she said and drilled a finger into his chest my girl she wants marriage and she wants babies she wants a man she can share her whole life with thick and thin and not one who gets pale when the word marriage comes up in conversation like youre doing now marriage isnt the only serious commitment you think you can bullshit her with that or are you just bullshitting yourself a number of people make and keep a bond without a legal ceremony mia and i are hardly traditionalists lulus skewering stare made him feel like a teenager again bringing mia home after curfew but in any case i havent given the matter a great deal of thought at this point shes not even comfortable with me telling her im in love with her thats a real fine speech full of hot air but it sounded almost pretty whats so important about marriage he demanded youre divorced got me there amused she got out two cheerful yellow mugs funny thing about life you just cant get a guarantee with it you pays your money you takes your choice yeah depressed all over again sam took the mug ive certainly heard that one before eighteen shed intended to relax shop indulge in a day at a spa or salon shed intended to do as little thinking as possible for three days and three nights to focus on her own emotional and physical wellbeing she had not intended to take the time and effort to gain admittance into the federal facility where evan remington was being held but since she had done so she could rationalize the decision time was growing short if fate was leading her to remington she would follow the path she was in no real danger and there was the possibility however slight that something good could come out of the visit she didnt question the fact that she was able to set up a meeting with him with relatively little trouble there were powers at work that scoffed at the tangled red tape of bureaucracy and she was part of them she faced him across a wide counter split down the center by a barricade of thick reinforced glass mia picked up the phone that would link them as he did mr remington do you remember me whore he hissed yes i see you do and that the months youve spent in here havent improved your disposition ill be out soon is that what he tells you she leaned a little closer he lies a muscle began to twitch in his cheek ill be out soon he repeated and youll be dead weve beaten him twice and only a few nights ago he ran from me with his tail between his legs has he told you that i know whats going to happen ive seen it i know youll all die screaming can you see it for a moment she could reflected on the glass between them the dark boiling storm the rips of lightning the swirl of roaring wind as the sea opened like a hungry mouth and swallowed the island whole he shows you his desire but not reality ill have helen his voice went dreamy like a child repeating a rhyme shell crawl back to me shell pay for her deception her betrayal nells beyond you look at me at me she demanded she wouldnt allow even his thoughts to touch nell now theres only me to deal with hes using you evan as he would a puppet or a vicious little dog he uses your illness your anger hell destroy you with it i can help you hell fuck you before he kills you want a preview it happened fast pain ripped through her breasts as if claws had dug into her flesh a spear of ice jabbed with one hard thrust between her legs she didnt cry out though a scream of rage and horror spewed into her throat instead she drew her power down like armor punched it out like a fist remingtons head snapped back and his eyes went wide with shock he uses she said calmly you pay did you think threats and ploys would make me tremble i am of the three what works in me is beyond your scope i can help you i can save you from the horror he will bring you if youll trust me and help yourself i can close you off from him i can shield you so that he cant use or harm you why to save myself and what i love i would save you he inched closer to the glass she could hear his raspy breathing over the receiver for a moment true pity stirred in her mia devlin he licked his lips then they spread into a wide mad smile youll burn burn the witch he cackled even as the guard rushed over to restrain him ill watch while you die screaming though remington dropped the phone when the guard dragged him away she heard his wild laughter long after the door slammed and locked behind him the laughter she thought of the damned sam had a meeting with his accountant revenue was up but so were expenses and overhead the magick inn was operating in the red for the first time in thirty years but as sam saw it that would change hed booked two conventions for the fall and with the winter holiday package he was putting together he expected to recoup some of the loss over that historically slow reservation period until that time he could and would continue to plow his own money into the hotel if the hotel and the island went down in a matter of weeks it wouldnt be because of lack of faith on his part where the hell was she couldnt she have waited to go off on some shopping spree until after their lives their fates their futures were more secure how many pairs of shoes did the woman need for gods sake it was just an excuse to get away from him he thought hed told her he loved her and shed run like a rabbit things got a little bit sticky and instead of staying put and dealing with it shed bolted to the mainland and he stopped scowled down at his own halffinished signature on the correspondence in front of him moron he muttered i beg your pardon nothing he shook his head at his assistant and completed his signature check on the winter brochures mrs farley he told her as he signed the next letter i want to be certain that the corrections are made before the end of the month i want to meet with the head of sales tomorrow find me the time she flipped through his calendar youre free at eleven and at two eleven and send a memo to housekeeping re how long have you been married you want to know how long the housekeeping staff has been married no mrs farley how long have you been married thirtynine years last february thirtynine years how do you do it mrs farley laid her pad down took off her glasses i could say its a bit like alcoholism one day at a time i never thought of it like that marriage as an addiction certainly as a condition its also a job that requires attention and work cooperation and creativity that doesnt sound particularly romantic theres nothing more romantic than going through life with all of its spins with someone you love someone who loves and understands you someone wholl be there for the big bouquets children grandchildren a new house a wellearned promotion and for the weeds illness a burned dinner a bad day at work there are people who get used to taking care of the bouquets and the weeds alone i admire independence the world would be a stronger place if we were all capable of handling life on our own but being capable of it doesnt mean being unable to share and depend on someone else it shouldnt mean being unwilling to thats the romance i never saw my parents share much more than an affection for italian designers and a box at the opera thats a shame for them isnt it some people dont know how to give love or how to ask for it sometimes the answers no and sometimes it isnt the faint edge of irritation worked into her voice some people expect things to fall into their lap oh they might work a bit for it ill just shake this tree and if i shake it long enough that pretty red apple will plop right into my hand never occurs to them that they might have to climb the damn tree fall out a couple of times get some scrapes and bruises before they get to that apple because if the apples worth wanting its worth risking a broken neck on a huff she got to her feet i need to type up this memo he was so surprised when she strode out of his office and shut the door smartly he didnt call her back to tell her hed never dictated the memo look what happens when i have a conversation about marriage he thought aloud my assistant bites my head off and i know how to climb a damn tree ive climbed plenty of trees and right now he felt as if he were hanging by his fingertips from a very unstable branch and the prettiest apple was still just out of his reach he picked up a file intending to bury his frustrations in work and a light went on inside him mia was back on the sisters shed called lulu from the ferry and had gotten an update on bookstore business and on island news as shed asked lulu to come up to the house that evening to fill in the gaps there was no need to drop by work tomorrow was soon enough to face the pile of phone messages and the backlog generated over her threeday absence shed called ripley as well and nell since she thought the best way to pass on the details of her meeting with remington was during a civilized meal at her own house the following evening she needed to drop by island market for some supplies shed yet to call sam she would call him she wheeled her cart over to the produce section and stared at the arugula as soon as she figured out how to handle him and what had been said between them shed call him life ran more smoothly with a clearcut but flexible plan still shopping and sometimes mia realized as she turned and looked at sam fate wasnt content to hang back until the plan was formulated and refined i consider shopping a work in progress she selected lettuce contemplated the roma tomatoes its an odd time of day to see a businessman in the market im out of milk im quite sure you wont find it in produce im thinking about getting an apple a pretty red apple she continued to select items for a salad the plums look good today sometimes only one thing will do he let his fingers tangle in her hair did you enjoy your time away it was productive because he made her feel uneasy she wheeled into dairy i found a nice little wicca shop they had a wonderful selection of bell jars you can never have too many my sentiments she agreed and picked up a quart of milk thanks he took it from her tucked it under his arm why dont you have dinner with me tonight you can tell me about your trip he wasnt behaving the way shed anticipated there was no flare of temper over her abrupt departure no demands to know where shed been what shed been doing as a result she felt guilty and small damn clever of him actually lulus coming up tonight so that we can deal with some store business but im having a little dinner party tomorrow i was going to call you she put a small wheel of brie in her cart ive some things to discuss with everyone will seven oclock work for you sure he leaned in cupping her cheek with his free hand laying his lips on hers softly warmly lingering over the kiss until it shifted from the casual to something more suited to the dark i love you mia his fingers skimmed over her cheek before he stepped back see you tomorrow she stood where she was her hands vised on the handle of the cart as he strolled away with a quart of milk under his arm for years so many years of her life shed have given everything to have him look at her in the way hed just done to tell her he loved her in just that way now that he had why should it be so hard why should it make her want to weep lulu got behind the wheel of her battered and beloved orange vw bug since the night shed taken the unexpected swim shed felt safe solid secure she didnt know what charms ripley and nell had conjured up but they were working like well charms whatever you wanted to call the thing that was hovering over the island her girls were going to screw it to the wall still she felt better knowing mia was back onisland tucked into the cliff house getting back to her routine and though it had been a pill to swallow she felt more at ease about mia since she had sam fretting over her the boyd been an idiot she decided as she drove through the village with the classic sounds of pink floyd blasting through the speakers but hed been young shed done plenty of stupid things when she was young every one of them had led her here she supposed if she was going to be fair everything sam had done had led him right back to the sisters and mia not that she was finished giving him grief but she would dispense it in smaller doses now only one thing mattered and that was mias happiness if sam logan was the answer to that then he was going to damn well come up to the mark if she had to kick him up to it the idea made her grin wickedly as she started up the cliff road and was oblivious to the mist that rose and rolled behind her when the music turned to a hiss of static she glanced down at the radio slapped irritably at the little tape player installed under it damn it you better not eat the wall you cheap bastard the response a long deep howl through the speaker had her hands jerking on the wheel the car shuddered around her as the fog poured cold as death through her open windows yelping she hit the brakes first an automatic response as her vision was obscured instead of stopping the little car speeded up its cheerful rubber band pinging now a machine guns ratatat under her hands the wheel vibrated iced and began to spin on its own though it felt like a slick and frozen snake she gripped it hard and yanked the scream of the tires echoed her own as she caught a glimpse of the edge of the cliff in front of her the windshield became a starburst ice crackling over ice then the stars went black the spoon mia was using to stir sauce for the pasta shed made for lulu clattered out of her numb hand as it bounced to the floor the vision shrieked through her head all sound and fury her throat tightened as if a hand had squeezed it as she whirled away from the stove and ran she flew out of the house blind with panic racing to the road on foot from her hilltop view she saw the filthy mist spewing behind the little orange car on the road below and was running running when she saw the car spin out of control and toward the cliff no no no fear blanked her mind rolled sick in her stomach help me help me she chanted it over and over as she struggled to find her power through the sheer wall of terror all she had everything she was she gathered and heaved the magic inside her toward the car as it crashed into the guardrail and flipped like a toy tossed by a childs angry hand hold hold oh god she couldnt think blow air come wind a bridge to form hold her safe keep her from harm please please she chanted a net a bridge a steady wall keep her from that terrible fall panting her vision blurred with tears she ran the last yards to where the car teetered on the broken guardrail over the drop to the rocks below it will not have whats dear to me as i will so mote it be her voice broke as she reached the rail lulu the car balanced precariously on its roof seesawing on the crushed rail the wind shed conjured blew the hair back from her face as she climbed over the rail dont touch it small rocks and clumps of earth spilled off the unstable edge when she spun around at the shout sam leaped out of his car i dont know how long it can hold i feel it slipping inside me you can hold it he pushed his way through the wind climbed the rail until he too stood on the narrow edge focus you have to focus ill get her out no shes mine thats the point he spent a desperate moment to take mias arms shake her the car could go at any minute he knew and so could the edge where they stood exactly hold it youre the only one strong enough to do it step over the rail i wont lose her mia shouted or you her legs trembled as she climbed over the rail her hands shook as she lifted them and she saw the fog begin to rise again saw the dark shape of the wolf forming from it her body stilled fury spiked inside her and stabbed away the fear you wont have her the hand she flung out was rocksteady now she faced the wolf bore the weight of the magic she called on her shoulders you may have me thats up to fate but by all i am all i have you wont take her it snarled and started toward her it could take her life now she thought and so be it her magic would hold she risked a glance at sam and saw with inner horror that he was easing a bleeding and unconscious lulu out of the car and the car tipped and swayed with a last push she left herself open and defenseless shoving everything toward the cliffs and the wolf bunched to leap as he charged energy shot into her out from her it struck him like a lightning bolt with a furious howl he vanished into the fog didnt count on my sisters did you you bastard the wind sucked away the mist and she saw both ripley and nell spring out of their cars before she turned to run toward sam he had lulu in his arms the edge of the ground crumbled under his feet and sent him stumbling forward as a chunk of the ledge rained down to the sea mia reached out grabbed him as the car overbalanced and tumbled over the cliffs he was struggling back over the rail when the gas tank exploded shes alive he managed i know she kissed lulus white cheek laid a hand on her heart well take her to the clinic outside the emergency clinic where the air was quiet and the breeze balmy nell tended the cuts on mias feet got six million pair of shoes ripley stated while she paced restless as a cat and you run barefoot over broken glass yes silly isnt it she hadnt felt the glass slice into her feet when shed run to the wrecked car under nells gentle healing she felt no pain now you can fall apart ripleys tone gentled and she laid a hand on mias shoulder youre entitled i dont need to but thanks shes going to be all right mia did close her eyes for a moment waited until she felt steadier i looked at her injuries shell be unhappy and very pissed off about her car but shell be all right i never considered never thought she could be harmed this way used this way harm her harm you ripley said thats what mac she trailed off winced mac what do you mean despite nells protest mia got to her feet she caught a glimmer turned white as a sheet something happened before the beach furious she grabbed ripleys arms what happened dont blame her blame all of us nell rose ranged herself with ripley she didnt want you to know and we agreed know what sam asked as he walked up with a tray of takeout coffee how dare you keep anything to do with lulu from me she swung around to him ready to bite he didnt know nell interrupted we didnt tell him either ripley told them now said it all fast and watched mias pale cheeks bloom with ripe temper she mightve been killed i left her i left her and went to the mainland do you think id have done that if id known she was a target you had no right no right to exclude me from this im sorry nell lifted her hands let them fall we did what we thought was best we were wrong not so wrong youre going to have to deal with it mia sam added when she turned to him you nearly lost on the cliff road tonight because you divided your energy divided hell you dumped it out and all but left yourself empty do you think id give less than my life to protect her or anyone i loved no i dont he touched her cheek and when she jerked away he simply moved in and took her face firmly in his hands and neither does she isnt she entitled to think of you i cant talk about this now i need to be with her she stepped away walked to the door but stopped when she opened it thank you for what you did she said to sam ill never forget it later while mia sat beside lulus hospital bed ripley and nell slipped into the room for a time there was nothing but silence they want to keep her until tomorrow mia said at length because of the concussion she wasnt happy about it but shes weak enough that she couldnt put up much of a fight the arm she had to take a moment to steady her voice its a clean break shell be in a cast a few weeks but itll be fine mia nell began were so sorry no mia shook her head kept her eyes on lulus bruised face im calmer now and ive thought it through i understand what you did and why i dont agree were a circle and we must value and respect that and each other but i also know how stubborn and persuasive she is lulus eyelids fluttered and her voice was thin and raspy dont talk about me like im not here just be quiet mia ordered im not speaking to you but she took the hand lulu held out thank god youll have to buy a new car that mini monstrosity is finally dead im gonna find me another one just like it there couldnt be another one like it but if there was mia thought she would find it for her dont give these girls or their guys a hard time lulu mumbled she opened one of her blackened eyes closed it again because her vision was blurry did what i told them to do respected their elders im not angry with them just you mia pressed her lips to the back of lulus hand go on home she said to her sisters tell your husbands i wont be turning them into toads anytime in the near future well come back in the morning nell moved to the bed laid a kiss on lulus forehead i love you dont get sloppy just a few bumps too bad her voice a bit thick ripley leaned over the bedrail and kissed lulus cheek because i love you too even though youre really short and ugly with a weak cackle lulu freed her good hand from nells grasp and waved them off go away buncha chattering females when theyd gone lulu shifted in her bed pain mia asked cant get comfortable here rising mia trailed her fingers over lulus face down her casted arm she murmured softly as she stroked until lulu sighed bettern drugs feel floaty now brings back memories relieved mia sat again go to sleep now lu will you go home no point you sitting here watching me snore yes as soon as you sleep but she sat while lulu slept kept watch in the dim light and she was there keeping watch when lulu woke in the morning you didnt have to come early zack needs to bring the patrol car nell helped mia set the table and admired the lovely old china this time of year theres no telling if hell get called in for something and i wanted to see lulu it took guilt temper and threats to get her to agree to spend a couple of days in one of the guest rooms youd think i was putting her in prison she likes her own space nell said she can have it back when shes steadier nell brushed a hand over mias hair how are you im fine the long nights vigil had given her plenty of time to think to plan id hoped id get here early enough to give you a hand not that you need it she studied the dining room with its flowers and candles already in place the window were open wide to summer you can check my fricassee mia said as she draped an arm over nells shoulders the gesture the easy warmth of it erased any remnants of tension between them from the smell its perfect when they were in the kitchen nell removed the lid while mia poured two tall glasses of iced tea everythings perfect well the weathers not cooperating restless mia moved to the door pushed open the screen and breathed in the wind well have rain after sunset a pity we wont be able to have coffee in the garden still my morning glories have grown a foot in the last three days maybe the rain will tease out the blooms she turned back to find nell staring at her what oh mia i wish youd tell me what else is troubling you i hate seeing you look sad do i im not she stepped outside looked up at the sky id rather a storm than rain we havent had enough storms this summer its as if theyre building up and waiting for one big blow i want to stand on my cliffs and meet the lightning she reached back covered nells hand im not sad just unsettled what happened to lulu shook me on the most primal of levels and now something inside me is waiting building like those storms i know what i have to do what i will do but i cant see whats coming its frustrating for me to know and not to see maybe youre looking in the wrong place mia i know whats between you and sam i can feel it when im within ten feet of you when i fell in love with zack and was pulled in all those directions you were there for me why wont you let me do the same for you i depend on you to a point then you step back over this line and its only you who can cross it and you step over it more often since sam came back to the sisters then id have to say he has upset the balance upset your balance nell corrected and waited for mia to turn are you in love with him a part of me was born loving him i closed that part off i had no choice and thats the problem isnt it the not knowing if you should open it up again or keep it closed i made a mistake once and he left i cant afford to make a mistake again whether he stays or goes you dont believe hell stay its not a matter of believing its a matter of considering every possibility if i open myself to him again completely what happens if he does go i cant risk that not just for myself but for all of us love isnt a simple thing you know that its not a flower to be picked on a whim no its not a simple thing but believing you can control it mold its shape plot its direction that you have to do that thats a mistake i dont want to love him again her voice always so smooth so sure trembled i dont want it i put those dreams aside i dont need them now im afraid to take them out again saying nothing nell slipped her arms around mia drew her close im not who i was when i loved him neither of you is what you feel now matters most my feelings arent any clearer than my vision before it ends ill do whatever needs to be done she sighed im not used to having a shoulder to cry on the shoulders are there youre just not used to leaning maybe youre right she closed her eyes let herself focus on nell and the life glowing inside her i can see you little sister she murmured i can see you sitting in an old wooden rocker in a room soft with candleglow theres a baby at your breast and its hair is soft as down and bright as sunlight when i see you like that i have such hope such courage she drew back pressed a kiss to nells forehead your child will be safe that i know she heard the sound of her front door slamming that would be ripley mia said dryly not only doesnt she bother to knock but she cant resist slamming a door im going to take a tray up to lulu then i think well have drinks and appetizers in the garden while the weather holds as mia moved inside to greet her guests nell thought how typical it had been shed begun by offering comfort and mia had ended by giving comfort to her so then this joker says but officer i wasnt stealing the cooler full of beer i was just moving it ripley forked up more fricassee when i pointed out that that didnt explain how come he had budweiser on his breath and three empty beer cans lying beside him in the sand he said maybe somebody drank the beer while he was sleeping i guess somebody poured beer into him too because he was half trashed and it was only three in the afternoon howd you handle it zack asked her fined him for drinking in a restricted area and littering cut him a break on lifting the cooler since the guys hed lifted it from didnt want any hassles seeing as theyd had a cooler of beer in a restricted area to begin with imagine that sam shook his head drinking beer on the beach rules is rules ripley stated adamantly absolutely none of us ever snuck a sixpack onto the beach i recall somebody copping a bottle of his fathers best scotch zack grinned and how he generously shared it with his pals who proceeded to get toasted speak for yourself ripley wagged her fork one pull of that stuff was enough for me talk about foul such a girl her brother said that may be but im not the one who got creamed when we got home true enough i was eighteen zack recalled and mom still skinned my butt then she skinned mine the memory made sam wince jesus that woman could terrorize me no matter what you did she knew about it before youd finished doing it and if she didnt shed get it out of you shed just stare at your face and pick away until youd beg to confess thats how its going to be with my kids they wont have a prayer ripley slanted mac a smug look as he laid his hand over hers it flashed into mia fast and bright youre pregnant hey ripley lifted her water glass nells not the only one who can get knocked up a baby nell leaped out of her chair danced around the table to throw her arms around ripleys neck this is wonderful what a way to announce it ive been working on that story and segue since this afternoon how about that with a grin a mile wide and a voice that wasnt quite steady zack moved over to tug ripleys long ponytail im going to be an uncle youve got a couple of months to practice being a daddy first amid the jokes and congratulations mia rose she walked to ripley running her hands up and down ripleys arms as she too got to her feet then mia simply drew her in drew her close held her tight emotion flooded ripleys throat and she turned her face into mias hair there are two mia whispered two ripleys jaw dropped two it was all she could say as she pulled back you mean staggered she stared down at her flat belly man two what in the process of drinking the wine sam had poured into his glass for a toast mac smiled over at his wife gradually the shock on her face trickled through two twins weve got two in there i need to sit down you need to sit down right we need to sit down mac sat pulled her onto his lap two for one thats so cool theyll be safe i can see it mia leaned over kissed macs cheeks go on in the living room be comfortable ill bring coffee tea for the mothers ripley youll want to cut back on the caffeine somethings wrong sam commented when mia walked into the kitchen something more than lulus weighing on her she gets worked up about babies with her hand on her stomach ripley tried to imagine two its more than that ill give her a hand with the coffee when he stepped into the kitchen she was standing in the open back door watching the soft summer rain fall on her gardens i want to help you its no trouble he moved to her im not talking about the coffee i want to help you you have she took his hand gripped it hard for a moment you risked your life yesterday for someone i love you trusted me to hold you and her safe so you could help her i did the only thing that could be done the only thing you could do sam being you lets leave that i want to help with whats bothering you now you cant not now in any case this is my battle and now theres more at stake than ever everything that matters to me is inside this house tonight and its there out there wanting can you feel it she whispered just beyond my circle pressing shifting waiting yes i dont want you staying here alone when she started to move away he took her firmly by the shoulders turned her mia whatever you think or feel or want from me youre too smart to push aside the power i can add to yours are you certain that either of us could have saved lulu alone no she let out a breath no im not if you dont want me with you ill sleep in one of the guest rooms or the goddamn sofa youve got your dragon to guard you and a broken arm wouldnt stop her this isnt about me trying to get into your bed i know let me think about it we have other things to discuss tonight she could think all she liked he decided as she walked away to finish the coffee he was staying with her even if he had to sleep outside in his car she served coffee and slices of cream cake then she did something nell hadnt seen her do in the time theyd known each other mia drew the drapes and closed out the night it watches mias voice was calm as she walked the room lighting more candles or tries to my gesture was meant to be rude and dismissive a petty slap petty she continued as she sat and picked up her own coffee but satisfying i owe it more than a petty slap for harming lulu and she would give it more much more i have to say the timing of this is poor we should be celebrating ripley and macs news and we will she was like a queen sam thought a warrior queen addressing her troops he wasnt sure how he felt about the image but as he focused on her narrowed his vision on her his belly did a queasy roll where did you go mia when you left the island where did you go he saw from the quick race of surprise over her face that hed caught her off guard and because he had he reached through that narrow chink and pulled out more pulled out enough to have him pushing to his feet remington you went to see remington yes she sipped her coffee gathered her thoughts while the emotions in the room bulleted and careened around her oh thats fine thats just fine at the explosion from ripley mia looked over at her coolly youre the one whos always haranguing me about being cautious controlled about being prepared thats right and i was i wasnt careless or foolish and i am mia lifted her shoulders in an elegant little shrug id use the word reckless which you tend to be going to see him was a calculated risk one that needed to be taken you had the nerve to ream us last night for not coming clean about lulu then you keep this to yourself hardly mia said smoothly im telling you what i did and what happened freely you shouldnt have gone alone nells voice was quiet and all the more effective for it you had no right to go alone i disagree remingtons feelings toward you would have prevented any possible discussion ripleys temper would have very likely forced a confrontation then and there of the three of us im most able to deal with him and i have more need at this point to do so there are four of us sam reminded everyone there are fucking six of us hed said nothing to this point but now zack got to his feet youre going to start remembering there are six of us zack ordered mia i dont care if you can shoot lightning out of your goddamn fingertips there are six of us in this zack be quiet he snapped at nell and had her gaping at him you think because therere two of us in this room who cant whistle up the wind or pull down the moon or whatever the hell you call it were just going to sit on our hands ive got as much at stake as you do mia and im still the sheriff on three sisters i come from them the same as you do mac drew mias considering gaze to him i dont have what you have but ive spent most of my life studying it cutting us out this way is not only insulting its arrogant just one more way to prove you dont need anyone else she made herself look directly at sam that wasnt my intention im sorry if that was the result im sorry she repeated lifting her hands to encompass everyone in the room i wouldnt have gone to see him if i hadnt been certain i could deal with him at that time and under those circumstances never wrong are you sam shot out oh ive been wrong because the coffee lay bitter on her tongue she set the cup aside but i wasnt wrong about this he couldnt harm me she shut off the memory of claws and cold remington is being used and his hate his madness is a powerful tool there was a chance i could reach him that with his cooperation i could close him off shut down that source of energy hes a conduit she said looking to mac for verification shut off the valve so to speak and the power weakens its a valid theory screw theories what happened ripley demanded hes too far gone he believes the lies the promises and hes damned himself but thats a weakness that hunger to bring pain and misery the singularity of that purpose is innately flawed in the end itll destroy itself but i think we can and should move that process along after what happened yesterday we must move it along i wont take any chances with lulu and as long as it cant get to me it will try for her i think youre right about that mac put in your feelings for her would be seen as a weakness an achilles heel then we act sooner because its not a weakness its another weapon a preemptive strike sam suggested in a manner of speaking mia nodded an offensive move rather than defensive ive been thinking about it for some time i know without doubt now that his power builds over time there was more when i faced off with it yesterday why should we wait until september give him that much more time to gather strength against us with you and ripley and nell we have the four elements represented we have new life a new circle inside the old three children who carry the old blood waiting to be born thats powerful magic a banishing spell with full ritual the legend calls for something else he reminded her it calls for you to make a choice im aware of that im aware of all the interpretations all the nuances all the risks and sacrifices our circle isnt broken as theirs was our power isnt diminished as theirs was her voice went steely by hurting lulu it has only given me more reason to finish it by whatever means necessary my part comes when it comes and a banishing ritual would be a hell of a distraction and very possibly put an end to things mac youll need the full moon mac added his brow furrowing as he calculated that doesnt give you much time mia only smiled but it was fierce and it was cold weve had three hundred years nineteen what didnt you tell the others theres nothing more to tell mia sat at her dressing table brushing her hair she knew sam wouldnt go and there was no point arguing fruitless battles wasted energy she intended to conserve hers for when it mattered most if you thought a banishing spell would turn the tide youd have tried one before you werent here before ive been here since may and will there ever come a time when you dont throw that in my face youre right she set her brush aside rose to open the balcony doors to the sound of rain its annoying and repetitive of me and it was more effective before i forgave you have you mia the rain was warm wonderfully soft and still she longed for the storm ive spent some time looking back trying to see those two young people objectively the girl was so wrapped up in the boy and in her visions of what she wanted their life to be she couldnt see he wasnt ready it wasnt that she ignored it or overlooked it mia had searched her heart on that one point but that she really couldnt see it she assumed he loved as she loved wanted what she wanted and she never looked beyond that what happened to them was as much her fault as his no it wasnt all right maybe not quite as much hers because she was as honest as she knew how to be and he wasnt but she wasnt blameless she held too tight maybe maybe because she wasnt any more ready than he was she just wanted to be she was so lonely in her house on the cliff so desperately hungry for love mia you shouldnt interrupt when im forgiving you i dont intend to make a habit of it its so weak and so typical to blame ones parents for the flaws and the failures of a life and a woman of thirty should certainly have come around to making her own flaws and failures and triumphs she had thought about that too very long and very hard in her time away but for the sake of that young girl well point the finger she was young enough to deserve to assign the blame somewhere else she walked back to the dressing table absently opened a little cobalt pot dipped her fingers in and rubbed the cream over her hands they never loved me thats sad and thats painful but more they never cared that i loved them so what was i to do with all that love just burning inside me there was lulu thank the goddess but i had so much more to give and there you were poor sadlooking sam i heaped my love on you until you must have felt buried in it i wanted you to love me i needed it and you but not so i had us settled in a little cottage with three children and the faithful family dog she said it lightly though it cost her to dismiss that sweet and pretty image i cant blame you for that i can still blame you for the way you ended it so abrupt so harsh but even that you were very young ill regret for the rest of my life the way i ended it regret that the only way i thought i could save myself was to hurt you youth is often cruel i was i told you i was done with you and this place that i wouldnt be trapped anymore that i wasnt coming back i wasnt ever coming back you just looked at me with tears running down your face you so rarely cry it panicked me so i was only more cruel im sorry for it i believe you are id like to think that eventually we could put that part of our life where it belongs in the past i need to tell you why i waited so long to come back she retreated without moving a step thats the past too no i want you to know that when i said i wasnt coming back i meant it that need to be away to breathe some other air pushed me through those first years every time i thought of you waking or sleeping i slammed the door shut then one day i found myself standing in that cave on the west coast of ireland he wandered to her dressing table picked up her brush just turned it over and over in his hand everything i felt for you the joy of it the fear of it came rushing back into me but i wasnt a boy anymore and those feelings werent a boys he set her brush down looked at her and i knew i was coming back that was five years ago mia it left her shaken caused her to carefully control her thoughts her voice you took your time i wasnt coming back to you to this island the way id left thaddeus logans son that logan boy id carried that around like a goddamn chain around my neck and i was going to break it i needed to make something of myself for me and for you no let me finish he said when she started to speak you had all the dreams before all the goals all the answers now i had my own the hotel isnt just a piece of real estate to me i know that maybe you do he nodded maybe you would it was mine always part symbol part passion i needed to prove i was coming back here with more than a name and a birthright i started to come back countless times in the last five years and every time i did something stopped me i dont know if it was my own doing or a shove from fate but i do know that before this it wasnt my time you always had more than a name and a birthright but maybe you could never see it before that brings us to now now i need time to consider if the step i take is my own or a shove from fate youre welcome to sleep here i need to check on lulu then i want to spend some time up in the tower before i go to bed frustration pushed through him again had him balling his fists in his pockets im asking for a chance to prove to you that you can trust me again that you can love me again i want you to live with me be with me knowing that whatever else i might do or not do ill never deliberately hurt you again youre not giving me a lot of room i can promise you this after the full moon after the ritual that will change i dont want to be at odds with you we cant afford to be theres something else he took her arm as she started past him theres more i cant give it to you now her fingers itched to push his hand off her arm before he pushed too hard saw too much timing she thought would be an essential element she resisted and met his gaze levelly you want me to trust and believe in you then you have to trust and believe in me i will if youll promise me you wont do anything that could put you in jeopardy without your circle without me when it comes to the sticking point ill need my circle that includes you all right if that was all he would settle for it for now can i use your library help yourself when she was sure lulu was sleeping comfortably mia went up to the widows walk to stand outside in the soft rain she could see from that height everything that was hers and the dark that pressed against her borders breathing cold against her warmth so the steam rose up in fitful spurts almost absently she lifted a hand skyward let the power tremble up her arm she plucked a lightning bolt out of the night hurled it like a lance through a puff of steam then she spun away and slipped inside into her tower she cast the circle lighted candles and incense she would seek a vision but wanted no whisper of it to leak outside that ring what was in her heart and mind could be used against her and against those she loved she ate the herbs drank from the chalice and kneeling in the circle at the center of a pentagram she cleared her mind she opened her third eye the storm that she had sensed burst over the island and despite the gales of wind the land was blanketed in a thin gray fog the sea lashed at the base of her cliffs as she flew over them through the driving rain the strikes of lightning and over the fog that spread and thickened in the clearing at the heart of the sisters was her circle their hands were linked and hers with them the greedy fog licked and lapped at the edges of the ring but crept no further safe she thought as she knelt in her tower safe and strong she could feel the rumble of the earth below the rumble of the sky above and her own heartbeat where she knelt and where she saw herself they called in turn earth air water fire power was rich rising up streaking out though it tore at the fog those mists reknit themselves out of them stalked the wolf that bore her mark when it leaped she was alone on her cliffs she saw the red eyes burning she heard her own voice cry out despair and triumph as she wrapped her arms around it and took it with her off the cliffs as she fell she saw the moon full and white break through the storm and with the fire of stars shine over the island in her tower she knelt on the floor her eyes blurred with visions her heart pounding you give me this only to take it away is there a price for the gift after all you would have let the innocent be harmed the mother of my heart does it all come down to blood she slid to the floor curled in the circle for the first and last time in her life she cursed the gift shes holding something back sam paced the kitchen in the house where hed grown up i know it maybe she is mac pushed through the documents spread over the kitchen table theyd been his breakfast companion until sam had shown up something started bugging me last night but i cant put my finger on it ive been going through everything i have on three sisters the island the women the descendants ive read over my own ancestors journal i feel like im missing something some angle some what was the word mia used interpretation sam pushed the bag hed brought with him over the table you can add these to your research pile at least until she realizes i pulled them out of her library ive been meaning to get to these anyway carefully reverently mac took an old and scarred leather book out of the bag mia gave me the goahead to scour her books then well use that when she gets pissy about me hauling them over here im going to talk to zack sam jingled change in his pockets and paced again the todds have been on the island as long as anyone can remember and hes had his finger on the pulse of things all along maybe if i can think of the right questions hell have the right answers weve got just over a week until the full moon start cramming professor sam checked his watch ive got to get to work you come up with anything let me know mac grunted his assent already absorbed in the first book instead of going to his car sam followed the urge and walked down to the beach heading toward the cave there had always been something pulling him there even before mia as a little boy hed slipped away from his mother or his nanny and wandered there even if it had been only to curl up and sleep he could still remember the time he had been only three when the police had been called to search for him zacks father had rooted him out scooping him out of a dream where hed slept in the arms of a beautiful woman with red hair and gray eyes shed sung to him in gaelic a storysong about a handsome silkie who had loved a witch then had left her for the sea hed understood her words and the language of her song had become his own when he was older he and his friends had played inside the cave used it as a fort a submarine a den of thieves still hed often gone in alone sneaking out of the house after bedtime to stretch out on the floor make a fire with a thought and watch the flames play on the walls as hed grown from child to boy the woman had come to his dreams less often and less clearly but hed seen her in mia the two images had blurred in his mind until there had been only mia he stepped into the cave and could smell her no he corrected fascinated he could smell them both the soft herbal scent of the woman who had sung to him and the deeper richer scent of the woman he loved mother mia had called her the night theyd seen her carry the pelt from this place with the warmth of affection the formality of respect she had addressed the vision as though they had met many times before he supposed though shed never told him even when she had seemed to tell him everything that they had he crouched studying the smooth cave floor where he had seen the man curled in sleep you had my face he said aloud just as she had mias once i let myself believe that meant we werent supposed to be together it was one of my many excuses you left i left but i came back he shifted reading the words he had carved into the stone so long ago as he read he reached under his shirt to pull out the chain he wore his foot tapped against something and sent it clinking against the stone with one hand closed around the ring he wore on the chain he picked up its mate the smaller ring was badly tarnished but he could feel the carving that circled it the same celtic knot pattern that circled the one hed found in the cave on the west coast of ireland the same pattern as the design mia had etched under the promise hed carved in stone gently he closed his fingers over the ring and brought out a dimly remembered spell suited to housewives when he opened his hand again the little ring gleamed silver he studied it for a long time then slid it onto the chain with its mate in her office mia printed out email orders set them aside to fill then efficiently began on the paperwork generated during her brief absence shed used the backlog as a legitimate excuse to leave the house early though she recalled sam hadnt seemed eager to keep her around by nine shed made considerable progress and stopped to make her first phone call she needed to see her lawyer at the first opportunity and make a few adjustments to her will she told herself she wasnt being fatalistic just practical from her satchel she took some of the personal papers shed brought from home her partnership agreement with nell in three sisters catering was in order but she intended to leave ripley her share should anything happen she thought nell would appreciate that as the will stood now the bookstore went outright to lulu but shed decided to change that and designate a percentage to nell lulu she had no doubt would approve and she intended to start a small trust fund for her sisters children including the deed for the yellow cottage it was something she would do in any case she would leave her library to mac as he would make the best use of it for zack there was her star collection and her greatgrandfathers watch it was the sort of thing one left to a brother she would leave the house to sam she could trust him to preserve it to see that her garden was tended and to guard the heart of the island she put the papers in her bottom drawer locked it she didnt intend for any of these arrangements to be necessary anytime soon but she strongly believed in being prepared she gathered up the printouts took them downstairs to fill the orders and she got on with the day and her life something is just not right yeah ripley agreed there are too many people on the beach and half of them are idiots seriously ripley im really worried about mia we only have a couple of days before the full moon i know what day of the month it is look at that guy there on the mickey mouse towel frying like a fish in a pan bet hes from indiana or someplace and hasnt seen a beach before give me a minute here she marched across the sand nudged the brilliantly pink man with her toe nell waited shifting from foot to foot while ripley launched into her lecture pointed skyward leaned down and poked a finger in the mans shoulder as if testing doneness as she marched back the man dug out sunscreen and began slathering it on my public service for the week now about mia shes too calm shes breezing along like its business as usual she came to the book club meeting last night shes in there right now checking inventory were doing the biggest spell ive ever done in a matter of days and she just pats me on the head and tells me itll be fine shes always had ice water for blood whats new ripley all right all right with a huff of breath ripley marched along the seawall to finish her beach patrol im worried too satisfied and if i wasnt macs twitchy enough for both of us hes buried himself in research spends hours making notes he thinks mia has something going on that shes not telling us so do i that makes three of us i dont know what the hell were supposed to do about it zack and i have talked about it we could confront her all of us at one time what like an intervention come on you couldnt crack that woman with a sledgehammer i wish i didnt like that about her i had another idea i thought that between the two of us we could well if we were linked we could get through this shield shes thrown up and see what shes thinking youre talking about prying into her private thoughts against her express wishes yes forget i said it its rude and intrusive and sneaky yeah thats why i like it great idea i can take an hour she checked her watch right now your place is closer twenty minutes later ripley lay back on the floor of nells living room panting and sweating god she is such a bitch youve got to admire that its like trying to cut through concrete with a toothpick nell swiped her forearm over her brow it shouldnt be this hard she figured we might try it she was ready for us man she is good and shes got something to hide ripley wiped her damp palms on her slacks now im seriously worried lets tap sam we cant whatever shes protecting probably has to do with him it wouldnt be right ripley she loves him staring at the ceiling ripley tapped her fingers over her stomach if thats her choice she hasnt made her choice at least that shes letting on she loves him but as far as i can tell it isnt making her happy she never could be simple you know what i think i think shes going to go for it during the banishment spell a double whammy shes already made her decision nell she doesnt do anything spur of the moment ripley she said our babies would be safe thats right she never said she would be sam loosened his tie as he watched mac circle the outside of the cottage with one of his handheld gadgets every so often mac would detour crouch mutter he puts on a real show doesnt he at sams side ripley rocked back on her heels since macs big production hes been doing this check at our place and at lulus twice a day whats all this about rip sam had come straight from one meeting into what appeared to be another zack and nell were due any minute why are we doing whatever it is were going to be doing without mia this is macs deal ive only got pieces of it she cocked her head as mac started back toward them okay dr booke whats the story you keep this place tight he said to sam good job thanks doc now what the hell is this about lets wait for the others ive got to get some stuff out of the car is mia expecting you anytime soon i dont punch a time clock noting the easy humor that passed between his friends at the statement sam set his teeth look shell be on her way home shortly lulu who mustve passed stubbornness on to mia through osmosis has moved back to her own place i dont like mia being alone for long well get you off to play house ripley began then saw the icy temper on sams face hey hey easy sam were on the same team remember its hot out here with that sam turned and strode into the house edgy ripley said as he passed who isnt here come nell and zack lets get started within ten minutes sam found his little cottage taken over nell obviously anticipating the state of his supplies had brought cookies and a cooler of iced tea she managed to set it all up like a party even as mac spread his notes and books over the table nell would you sit down zack tugged her toward a chair get the kid off his feet for five minutes hey ive got double ripley boosted herself onto the kitchen counter snagged a cookie so ill start nell and i decided to do a little spying yesterday it wasnt spying it wouldve been ripley said if wed pulled it off but we couldnt mias totally blocked shes got herself locked up like a vault and you think this is news sam asked shes got something going on in that prissy brain of hers that she doesnt want anyone to know ripley continued its irritating but more its got us worried shes worked out what shes going to do i think youre right about that mac said to sam the other night when we were together she said something about knowing all the aspects the interpretations it got me thinking on the surface its pretty cut and dried her task lets call it deals with love love without boundaries we can take that to mean shes meant to love that way or to let go freely of an attachment that restricted her sorry he added weve been through this before yeah but what seems cut and dried rarely is the first sister her counterpart trapped the man she loved you take a silkies pelt you bind him to the land and to you they had a life together a family but his feelings for her were a result of magic not free will when he found his pelt he reverted left her he couldnt stay sam put in no argument now a possible interpretation is that mia is required to find a love without boundaries one that comes to her without qualification or magic that just is what it is im in love with her ive told her she has to believe you zack laid a hand on sams shoulder and either accept or let you go but thats not the only interpretation you need to follow along here mac picked up one of the old books opened it to a section he had marked this is a history of the island written in the early seventeen hundreds that used documents ive never seen if mia has those documents you didnt get them from the library she wouldnt keep them there worry clouded sams gaze shed probably have them in her tower id like to see them but for our purposes this is enough it goes into the legend in some detail mac continued im going to hit the highlights he adjusted his glasses skimmed down the yellowed page by magic it was formed by magic it will thrive or perish so the choices of the circle deem life or death one times three blood of their blood hand of their hand the three who live must face the dark each to her own and air must find her courage to turn from what would destroy her or to stand against it you did both mac said to nell when she will see herself give herself for what she loves the circle is unbroken so earth will seek her justice without blade or lance to shed no blood but her own in defense of what she is and all she loves ripley turned her hand palm up and studied the thin scar that slashed across it i guess we pulled that one off you had a choice mac turned to her more of a choice than wed realized and when her justice is meted with compassion the circle is unbroken thus fire must look into her heart open it and leave it bare to see love with no boundaries and offer for what she holds dear life when her heart is free the circle is unbroken the power of the three will join will hold four elements rise and end the dark sacrifice her life sam surged forward she can sacrifice her life hang on zack clamped his hands on sams shoulders is that how youre reading this mac you could interpret this that any one of them could have given her life for the others for us for courage for justice for love this book came out of mias library so its an option shes aware of the question is is it one she would consider yes pale now nell looked at ripley we all would have ripley nodded if she thinks its the only way but she wouldnt uneasy she pushed herself off the counter she would pit her power against anyone or anything its not enough sam fisted his hands as if he could clamp the fury and fear inside them not close to enough im not standing back while she considers dying to save a few square miles of dirt were going to put a stop to this you know better as her nerves built ripley yanked off her cap you cant stop whats been in motion for centuries i tried and it ran right over me your lifes not on the line is it if shed seen only anger she might have snapped back at him but she saw fear as well what do you say we both take it out on mia after this is done deal he gave her shoulders a squeeze then dropped his hands theres no point in confronting her about this we wont budge her dragging her bodily off the island wont change anything the last step has to be taken and its best that it be taken here its meant to be taken here with all of us center of power mac agreed her center her circle her powers the most refined and its the strongest but that leads me to conclude that whats going to come against her will build its power to match there are more of us now nell pointed out she reached out a hand for her husbands laid the other on her belly linked our energy is formidable there are other sources of power sam nodded as the idea formed we use them all of them his mind was clear his thoughts controlled when he walked into the house on the cliff mia wasnt the only one who could block he found her in the garden calmly sipping a glass of wine while a butterfly fluttered in the palm of her outstretched hand now thats a picture he said as he kissed the top of her head then sat across from her how was your day she said nothing for a moment studied his face sipped her wine what was inside her yearned under the steel of her will busy productive yours the same some kid stuck his head through the iron pickets on one of the balconies he took it pretty well but his mother screamed the roof off and wanted us to cut through as there was no way i was damaging a centuriesold rail i was about to flick him free with a quick spell the housekeeper beat me to it slathered his head with baby oil and popped him out like a cork she smiled and was obliging enough to hand him her wine for a sip but her eyes were watchful wary i imagine he enjoyed the entire thing sam i noticed some of my books are missing from the library mmm he held out a finger so the butterfly on her palm flew gracefully to him perched you said i could use the library where are the books he passed the wine and the butterfly back to her i spent some time looking through some of them thinking i might find some fresh angle on this whole business oh a chill shivered around her heart and never claimed to be a scholar he said with a shrug i mentioned it to mac in passing and he asked if he could borrow them i didnt think youd mind id prefer that the books stay in the house oh well ill get them back you know sitting out here with you like this feels perfect and every time i look at you my heart rolls over in my chest that feels perfect too i love you mia her lashes lowered i should do something about dinner when she rose he took her hand ill help you he kept his fingers linked with hers as he got to his feet theres no need for you to do all the work dont touch me she thought not yet not now im better in the kitchen by myself make room he suggested im not going anywhere twenty he had something on his mind mia was sure of it he was too damn pleasant attentive considerate if she hadnt known better she might have wondered if someone had put a goodnature spell on him as ridiculous as it was even to herself she preferred him with his edge on at least then she knew what to expect still she didnt have the time to dig below the surface couldnt risk him digging below hers and had she the time she couldnt spare the energy she was stockpiling power like bluechip stocks she was resolved she was prepared and she was as confident as she could manage when nerves trickled in she used them when doubts crept close she swept them aside on the day of the full moon she rose at dawn shed wanted almost painfully wanted to roll over into sam and his warmth just to have his arms come around her as they sometimes did in sleep theyd done nothing but sleep together in the most innocent sense since the night in the cottage he hadnt questioned her on this nor had he tried to seduce her the fact that she found his cooperation mildly insulting only caused her to become annoyed with herself it had been she who more than once had nearly turned to him in the night when her mind was soft with dreams and her body aching with needs but on this most vital of mornings she left him sleeping and stood on her cliffs here she gathered fire from the rising sun and strength from the crashing sea arms spread she drank power and gave thanks for the gift when she turned she saw him on the bedroom balcony watching her their gazes locked and held light sparked between them with her hair blowing in the wind she walked back to the house and ignored the blackedged fog crawling along the edges of her world she went to the bookstore for her own peace of mind it was something shed built through sweat and dreams despite her broken arm lulu was back to manning the counter since thered been no stopping her mia hadnt bother to argue and she had to admit the work and the visits from neighbors and friends seemed to keep lulu in good spirits still mia had hoped she would ease back to work rather than leaping because business was unusually brisk she didnt have the opportunity shed wanted to spend time with lulu to fuss over her without seeming to fuss but it seemed that every second person who lived on the island found a reason to stop in and spend time with her by noon the café was jammed and she couldnt pass by without someone calling her over for a word to escape long enough to catch her breath mia slipped into the kitchen snagged a bottle of water from the refrigerator hester birmingham just told me ben and jerrys ice cream is on special this week two of my favorite men nell responded as she built a grilled chicken and brie sandwich to go with the soup special she was pretty damn intense about it i thought shed burst into tears any minute some of us take our ice cream seriously why dont i get some we can make sundaes tonight after fine im glad youre not worried about tonight mia walked over to give nells back a quick rub you have everything you need tomorrow itll be over no shadows i believe that but you have to let me worry about you a little little sister mia rested her cheek on nells hair just for a moment i love you now im going to get out of here i still have things i need to do and all im getting accomplished here today is socializing ill see you tonight as she hurried out nell closed her eyes and prayed it wasnt mia discovered a simple matter to leave by the time she managed to get to her office retrieve the papers shed locked there and make her way downstairs an hour had been eaten up lulu two minutes she said gesturing to the back room im busy here two minutes mia repeated and went inside i dont have time to lollygag and i dont need another break with her face scrunched in disapproval lulu clomped into the room her cast was covered with colorful signatures and a few lewd illustrations ive got customers so i see im sorry i need to go home its the middle of the damn day might remind you im down to one arm instead of my usual six im sorry a well of emotion rose in her throat thickened her voice before she could swallow it again this was the woman whod been mother father friend the only constant in her life other than her own gift and more precious than magic you sick or something lulu demanded no no im fine we can close the store for the rest of the day i dont want you to overdo ill be damned if were closing if you want to play hooky go ahead im not a damned invalid and i know how to run the shop i know ill make it up to you damn right you will ill take an afternoon off next week and you can stay in the trenches thats a deal thanks careful of the broken arm mia hugged her then unable to help herself pressed her face into lulus hair thank you if id known youd get so worked up about it id have taken two afternoons off go on if youre going i love you lu im going she hitched her satchel on her shoulder and rushing out didnt see the tears swim into lulus eyes or hear her sniff them back and when she was sure mia wouldnt hear she whispered blessed be baby girl everything in order mrs farley it is sam nodded i appreciate your help im going to have to leave matters in your capable hands sir sam she amended you were an interesting boy and a good one all in all youre a better man i words failed him thank you i have to get home have a good evening its going to be one for the books he predicted as he walked out of his office there were things he needed at the cottage tools of his own that he hadnt taken to mias he packed them his oldest athame and ritual sword the old jar where he kept his sea salt he changed into a dark shirt and jeans deciding to take the black robe with him rather than driving in it he wrapped a favored wand in silk all of this he placed in a carved wooden box that had been in his family for generations rather than an amulet or pendant he wore the two silver rings on a chain before he walked to his car he stopped to look back at the house and the woods that ran beside it his protection would hold he refused to believe otherwise he could feel the simmer of his own power as he crossed the edge of his charm and stepped clear of it into the street the force struck him a full body blow that lifted him off his feet sent him flying back his body slammed into the ground and a thousand black stars spun inside his head itll take you an hour to set up all this equipment ripley complained as mac loaded the last of it into the back of his land rover no it wont you always say that i probably wont need it all but im not taking any chances this promises to be one of the biggest paranormal events in recorded history there he slammed the cargo door ready ive been ready lets get he watched stupefied as her eyes rolled back in her head and her hands clawed at her own throat while she choked for breath nell waited while zack put the bag holding her tools in the car this is going to work she told him mias been working toward this all her life doesnt hurt to have backup no and sams idea wasnt just brilliant it speaks to the purpose of the island as well he hefted the cooler holding the ice cream and the makings for sundaes i believe that but it gives me some trouble knowing remingtons gone catatonic my contact said it was like pulling a switch he just went blank hes being used i can feel sorry for him opening himself to what will without question destroy him whats in him wants you nell no she touched zacks arm the man whod once been her husband and her terror held no more fear for her whats in him now wants everything and mia most of all she started to turn to the car door then with a shocked cry doubled over what is it nell cramps god the baby hold on just hold on he swept her into his arms fighting against panic as he saw the pain on her face ill get you to the doctor its going to be okay no no no pressing her face into his shoulder she struggled against both pain and terror wait just wait not for a second he yanked open the door would have set her inside but she clung like a burr its not real its not real mia said the baby would be safe she was sure of it this is not real she dug down found the power beneath the fear its an illusion to keep us away to keep us from making the circle she let out a long shaky breath and when she looked at zack again her skin glowed its a lie she said we have to get to mia she went to her cliffs first stood with her robe white as the moon that had yet to rise billowing she could feel the dark pressing its edge icecold bladesharp she watched calm as the fog rolled in over the sea and began foot by foot to spread over the island however fiercely shed guarded her thoughts it understood one point tonight was the battle for all so mote it be she murmured and turning away walked into the long shadows and dying light of the forest the fog closed around her cold and full of whispers it made her want to run she could feel it horrid little fingers tickling along her skin a kind of tease she heard the long low howl of a wolf and the sound was almost a laugh panic leaked through her shield of will as the fog crept hideously beneath the skirt of her robe on a sound of disgust she slapped at it driving it back from the path though she knew she scattered some of her carefully hoarded energy in doing so her pulse raging she walked to the clearing to the heart to wait for her circle it would not be so easy she thought and pulled her emotions back she imagined them bright and dark coalescing into one narrow beam buried in her heart not so easy to harm what she loved to use that love to destroy she would protect and she would win nell came first running through the woods with zack to throw her arms around mia youre all right yes gently mia drew nell back what happened it tried to stop us mia its very close i know she took both of nells hands gripped tight you and yours wont be harmed we need to start the suns nearly set she released nell opened her arms and the candles she had set around the clearing burst into light it wants the dark she said then turned as ripley stepped into the clearing the son of a bitch thought he could scare me away she laid down her bag of tools as mac hauled in the first load of his equipment its time we showed the bastard who hes dealing with i could use a hand with some of my stuff mac said you dont have much time mia told him time enough sam walked in hefting one of macs monitors and his own carved box mia crossed to him touched a fingertip to the corner of his mouth youre bleeding sucker punched me he wiped at the blood with the back of his hand i owe him one then lets fight ripley reached into her bag and drew out her ritual sword for the first time in days mia laughed and meant it you never change this place is sacred it is the heart circle within circle within circle protects all from cold and dark here where stood the sisters three i will meet my destiny as she spoke she walked the edges of the clearing her bare feet inches from the bubbling fog once this circle has been cast the bond we form will ever last thats not the opening for the banishing ritual sam said but she ignored him and continued the setting sun gives me its fire and the moon will rise higher and higher she picked up a jar and spread a ring of sea salt around the husbands of her sisters one is three and three is one through our blood the web was spun what is dark and wears my mark will bear it for eternity as i will so mote it be she lifted her arms and called the thunder cast the next circle she said and looked at sam i know what im doing so do i mac studied his gauges as the circle was cast as far as i can follow this by casting this outer circle around the clearing by herself shes focusing the negative force on her even when shes linked with the others shes the target sam called that one zack replied thats right she circled us with the sea salt as a second defense her plan is for us to stay inside the protective ring whatever happens in a pigs eye zack stated you got that right too powers building he could feel it around the circle light shimmered deep gold with the tips of blades each scribed their symbols in the ground the first chant rose with the moon air and earth and fire and water mother to son and son to daughter through our blood we claim the right to call the power from the night under the light of the moon of mead we ask to be given what we need we seek the light we seek the sight nell lifted her arms from air i come of air i call i bring the wind to rise and fall to sweep away what seeks to harm i bring to bear all magic all charm i am air and she is me as i will so mote it be and while the wind rose up to roar ripley lifted her arms from earth i come of earth i entreat quake and quiver below my feet the dark whats mine will swallow and none his fall will follow i am earth and she is me as i will so mote it be the earth trembled from water i come sam spread his arms high of water i cry pour from the sea flood from the sky to wash clean this isle of light and protect it from the hound of night i am water and he is me as i will so mote it be as the rain lashed them mia threw back her head from fire i come of fire i yearn spark and flame and cleanly burn to purge this beast who hunts for blood and from him shield what i have loved i am fire and she is me as i will so mote it be lightning flamed across the sky spewed up from the ground it roared in the air and sparked like diamonds on the rain the storm broke like a fury spinning a whirlwind out from the clearing and through the forest my equipment cant measure it mac called out over the explosions of thunder i cant get a clear reading beside him zack drew his weapon you dont need one its howling the wolf and its getting closer within the circle the four linked hands with the moon beaming like a beacon through the storm mia drew nells hand over to sams and made them three twice the three have stopped your breath i alone am left to test tonight i stand and challenge you come from the dark and do what you will do my fate within my own hands rests which one of us will meet our death you have come to your last hour come and face this witchs power she stepped through the fire of her own making and out of the circle the black wolf formed out of the fog and snarled at the edge of the clearing even as she moved forward sam lifted his ritual sword a wild blue light speared from the tip as he spun out using his body to shield hers no a trickle of panic cut through her fierce control and the light around the clearing wavered this isnt yours youre mine ill go to hell with him before he hurts you get back in the circle she stared at him and even as the wolf took the first testing step into the clearing her panic receded her power built from the heart and spread through her i wont lose she said quietly i cant with her destiny bright in her mind she ran from the clearing with the wolf leaping after her it would end where she chose to end it of that she was certain she flew through the woods the heat of her body cutting through the icy fog that covered ground and path and stung the swirling air what pursued her screamed with greed she knew every twist of the path every rise of the earth and ran through the stormwracked night an arrow with the target already in sight she broke out of the woods and raced unerringly for the cliffs rising slick and black from the stinking mist gathering she hurled power behind her to gain the time she needed and heard the cry of pain and outrage and felt beneath it the sly pleasure she was beyond her circle separated and alone and standing now on the cliffs where the one who was fire had made her last choice behind her was the roaring sea below her the unforgiving rocks trapped she heard the whisper in her head stand and be ripped to pieces step back step off and escape breathless from the run and what was building inside her she inched back wind snatched at the wet hem of her robe and the slippery rocks beneath her trembled and shook the island was coated with fog smothered with its weight but that shed anticipated she saw one clear circle at the edge of the village where the light beamed like a thousand candles that she hadnt anticipated nor the rush of energy that streamed from it and into her like love she wrapped it close shielded it with her own power and watched the wolf climb slowly up the cliffs stalk me she thought yes come closer ive waited for this all my life it bared its teeth and rose like a man on its hind legs fear me for i am your death i bring you pain a black bolt spilled out of the sky and scorched the rock at her feet she inched back and saw the triumph gleam in those red eyes im not done she said coolly and hurled a stream of fire at him it was what sam saw when he tore out of the trees mia standing on the edge of the cliff her white robe shining like silver her hair flying in the wind while the monstrous black form rose over her fire burst around them and smoke spewed thick out of the turbulent sky spears of light fell like flaming rain his cry was more of fury than fear as with his sword sizzling like lightning he charged the cliffs now she thought and whirled on the rocks as if she stood in a ballroom on this night i rejoice and make my choice he chooses me and i choose him she flung out her arms baring her heart this light no force has power to dim my heart is his and his for me and this is our joined destiny my death id give for theirs to spare she shouted her voice like thunder as the others spilled out of the woods for those i love all would i dare three hundred years to end this strife by these words i choose love she clamped her hand over sams as he leaped up beside her i choose life the wolf form shuddered into a man the faces of him legion shifted and melted into each other her mark scored them all you save this place but not yourself his breath spewed out rotted and foul youll go with me it leaped and sams sword bright as water swung out her mark and my mark as it cleaved the form spilled into a mist that slithered over the rocks like snakes bullies never play fair mia said as the mist hissed and spit and crawled toward her feet power a steady stream of white burned in her its for me to finish then finish it sam told her she tossed aside all shields opened all locks the power that had pulsed inside her burst free so that she stood aflame under the ravaged sky by all i am by all ill be i hurl the darkness back at thee with courage justice hand and heart i finish what my blood did start now you taste the fear most dire as you face my righteous fire she stretched out her arm and in her cupped fingers a ball of flame formed your fate is wrought by the sisters three as we will so mote it be for lulu she thought and for all the other innocents she hurled the ball into the mists they burned writhing burned as they spilled over the edge of the cliffs and fell howling into the sea drown in hell sams voice echoed die in the dark burn eternally with my womans mark your force is crushed by this vast sea as we will mia said turning to him so mote it be he stepped back drew her with him come away from the edge mia but its a lovely view she laughed a fullthroated joyous sound and lifted her face to the sky where stars burst out of the clouds the moon sailed a white ship on a calm sea god what a feeling youll have questions she said i need a minute first with nell and ripley go ahead she walked down the cliffs and into the arms of her sisters later she left the others in her kitchen and went out into the garden with sam it may be hard for you to understand why i didnt share everything i intended with you with all of you it wasnt arrogance it was the words clogged in her throat when he spun her into his arms held her crushed against him necessary she managed just dont talk for a minute just mia he buried his face in her hair rocking chanting soft words wild words in gaelic then just as abruptly he yanked her away gave her one hard shake necessary my ass necessary to rip the heart out of my chest do you know what it was like to see you standing on the edge of that cliff with that thing coming at you yes she framed his face in her hands yes it was the only way sam the only way i knew to be sure to end it without harm to anyone answer me one question look straight at me when you answer it would you have sacrificed yourself no when his eyes narrowed she kept hers level risking ones life is different from sacrificing it did i risk it yes i did clearheadedly because im a practical woman with a healthy appreciation for life i risked it for the only real mother ive ever known for this place and the people on it for them she said gesturing toward the house for the children to come from them for you for us but i intended to live and as you can see i did you planned to leave the circle that way you planned to take it to the cliffs alone it was meant to end there id prepared in every way i knew how considered every possibility and still i missed one that you didnt when i looked down from the cliffs and saw that circle of light sam swamped with love she leaned into him when i felt that strength that love and faith sweeping up and into me it was the greatest gift who knows what would have happened without it you did that by asking for help when i didnt think of it islanders stick together spread the word to a few people and word spreads to a few more she finished and they gathered around the cottage and in the woods tonight all those hearts and minds turned toward me she pressed her hands between her breasts where that song still sang strong magic you have to understand she continued easing back i couldnt tell you any of you i couldnt allow myself to open even that much take the chance that what was in my own mind and heart would be read by what we were going to fight i had to wait until everything was in place im working on that mia but this wasnt your fight it was ours i wasnt sure of that i wanted to be but i wasnt sure until you stepped out of the circle in front of me and what you felt for me telling me you love me paled with feeling it burst out of you in that one moment i knew youd come after me i knew then without question that we had to finish it together i need to tell you she shook her head stepped away from him until she was sure the words would be there i loved you once so much but my love was twined around my own needs and wants and wishes a girls love that has borders when you were gone i made myself lock that love away i couldnt survive with it alive inside me then you came back she turned to him it hurt to look at you as i said im a practical woman and i dislike pain i dealt with that i wanted you but i didnt have to unlock that love to have you so i thought she brushed his hair from his forehead so i wished but the lock wouldnt hold and that love spilled out it was different than it had been but i didnt see didnt want to see because looking hurt again every time you told me you loved me it was a knife in my heart mia no ill finish the night we sat out here in the garden with the butterfly before you came id been trying to settle my mind once and for all to reason it all out to prepare myself you sat and you smiled at me and everything inside me shifted as if it had only been waiting for that one moment that one look when you told me you loved me it didnt hurt it didnt hurt at all do you know how it made me feel no he skimmed his knuckles over her cheek tell me happy downinthegut happy sam she ran her hands down his arms couldnt stop touching him what i felt for you then and now and always will isnt a girls love it bloomed out of that but its new it doesnt need fantasies or wishes if you go im not if you go again what i feel for you wont change or be locked away i had to know that without a shadow of doubt ill cherish it and what we made together i know you love me and thats enough do you think id leave you now thats not the point flying on her own heart she stepped back turned in a circle the point is i love you enough to let you go that i wont wonder or worry or look at you with that shadow on my heart i love you enough to be with you to live with you with no regrets no conditions come here will you right here he said pointing in front of him she nodded and walked to him close enough do you see these he lifted the chain so that the rings were in her line of vision what are they theyre beautiful she reached out to touch and her breath caught at the warmth and the light that pulsed from them their rings she whispered hers and his i found his in that cave i told you about in ireland and hers just a matter of days ago here in our cave can you see whats carved on them and inside them she traced her finger over the celtic symbols and read as her heart began to thud the gaelic inside the circles he slid the chain over his head took the smaller ring off this is yours all the power that still surged inside her seemed to pause as if a million breaths were held why are you giving it to me because he couldnt keep the promise but i will i want to make it to you i want you to make it to me now and again when you marry me and every day after that i want to say it to you every time one of our children is born her gaze flew up to his children i had a vision he began and brushed the first tear away with his fingertip as it spilled down her cheek you were working in the garden in the very early spring the leaves were just a green haze and the sun was soft and yellow when i came out to you you stood up you were so beautiful mia more beautiful than ive ever seen you you were full with our child i put my hand on you over it and felt it move felt that life wed made just surge so impatient to be born i had no idea he took her face in his hands no idea what that would mean no idea that i could want so much everything i saw and felt in that one slice of time make a life with me mia our life and what comes from it i thought the magic was done for the night yes she pressed her lips to his cheek yes and to the other to everything she said laughing now as her lips found his he circled her once then took her right hand thats the wrong finger she told him you cant wear it on the left until were married lets be a little traditional and since we are though i think people whove been in love all their lives should have a very short engagement he opened his hand and where her tear had lain was a slice of light grinning at her he tossed it high and stars fountained from it raining down like little sparks of flame a symbol he said plucking one of the lights from the air a promise ill give you the stars mia turning his hand over he offered her a circle ringed with diamonds clear as water bright as fire ill take them and you oh and you sam she held out her hand absorbing the thrill as he slipped the pledge onto her finger and there it glittered what magic well make lets start now laughing with her he lifted her off her feet and danced her around a garden bursting with flowers and their stars shimmered brilliant against the dark
