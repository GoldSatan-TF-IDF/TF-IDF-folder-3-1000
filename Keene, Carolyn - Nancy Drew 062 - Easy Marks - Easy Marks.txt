chapter one nancy drew studied the heavyset balding man seated behind his wide mahogany desk harrison lane was president of peoples federal bank one of the largest banks in the river heights area as he spoke his voice confident and selfimportant nancy knew one thing for certain he was lying as a trustee of brewster academy im very concerned that this scandal not become public he droned on thats why ive asked you here today ive heard of your detective work and i want you to find out who is running this transcriptchanging racket and stop it before the schools reputation is damaged beyond repair nancys blue eyes focused on the mans wedding ring which hed begun twisting his hazel eyes also gave him away as not telling the whole truth they were darting around his office not focusing on any one thing as a successful amateur detective nancy had learned to trust her instincts about people and lanes body language the darting eyes and fidgeting movements was practically shouting to her that he was insincere at the very least he was withholding an important piece of information nancy uncrossed her long legs and leaned forward in her chair i dont want to be rude mr lane she broke in but i dont think youre being entirely straight with me is there something youre not telling me lanes eyes widened in surprise this was obviously the last thing hed expected to hear im afraid youll have to be satisfied with the information i can give you ms drew he sputtered pulling her bag onto her shoulder nancy stood up and headed for the door im sorry mr lane i just cant work that way without all the facts id be wasting my time goodbye and good luck with the case nancy had already opened the door when he called wait youre right i havent been completely candid with you she closed the door and turned back to him now maybe she could find out what was really going on the real reason im so worried about this is that well it involves my daughter sally lane went on in a lowered voice he stopped fiddling with his ring and gazed squarely at nancy yesterday i discovered that she paid one thousand dollars to have her marks from last year electronically altered on the schools computer our culprit is getting money from these kids i was making a deposit to her college fund and i saw that a thousand dollars had been withdrawn he explained when i went to use my bank card i noticed that it wasnt in its usual spot in my wallet sally and my wife are the only ones who would have the opportunity to take the card withdraw the money and then return the card to my wallet i confronted sally and she admitted she had used the money to pay someone to change her grades on the schools computer naturally as her father and as a trustee of brewster im alarmed of course nancy told him do you know who she paid she swears she doesnt know said lane shaking his head nancy raised a skeptical eyebrow i know it sounds unbelievable he went on it has something to do with an unsigned message on a computer something like that maybe youd better get the story from her maybe i should nancy agreed nancy turned up the collar of her denim jacket as she went down the wide front steps of the bank heading for her blue mustang in the banks parking lot it was late september and all around her the maples rustled in brilliant shades of red orange and yellow soon nancy was steering her car away from downtown river heights as she followed the directions harrison lane had given her she noticed that the houses became larger the lawns more perfectly kept she pulled onto evergreen road and stopped in front of a huge white clapboard house with a long glassedin porch on the left nancy walked to the door and rang the bell she half expected a maid to answer but instead a tall blond girl wearing a black miniskirt pulled open the door she had the same hazel eyes as harrison lane hi im sally and you must be nancy drew daddy called to say you were coming the girl said in a high breathy voice come on in thanks nancy said smiling politely she followed sally through an elegantly furnished living room and out onto the glassedin porch welltended tropical plants grew in pots all around them so what do you need to know sally asked as they settled down on a flowered couch why dont you just tell me the whole story from the beginning nancy suggested sally nodded i dont know if daddy told you this but im not exactly a brain in school daddy has this dream of sending me to washburn university thats where he and mom went anyway with my grades theres no way ill ever be accepted there so when i found this message in my email i couldnt say no in your what nancy asked confused email sally repeated my computer mailbox brewster has this awesome new computer system everybody in school has their own email box we can send messages back and forth and get school notices and homework assignments you name it i can even access it from here with my personal computer but during the day i just use the terminals at school i see nancy said so this message turned up in your computer mailbox offering to alter your grades for a thousand dollars she surmised remembering what sallys father had told her sally nodded thats right it was last tuesday a week ago nancys eyebrows drew together in a slight frown as she said i dont get it how did you know it wasnt a joke because whoever sent it already knew everything there was to know about my transcript sally replied my gradepoint average term by term ever since ninth grade my psat scores even the marks i got in particular courses how could he know that much unless he had a way of breaking into the school records and if he could do that i figured he could probably change the records too hmm id like to see that message said nancy is it still in your email are you crazy sally scoffed laughing bitterly and take the chance that someone might see it i copied down what i needed to know then i deleted the whole file too bad thought nancy now there was no way to examine the message for clues sally might have overlooked how did you pass on the money she asked aloud was that in the message too sure all i had to do was deposit it in the persons account i used the quickdeposit box at daddys bank simple nancy sat up straighter what about your copy of the deposit slip she asked you didnt throw that away did you i dont think so sally said slowly its probably still in my jacket pocket she jumped up and ran out of the room reappearing soon after with the pink carbon in her hands one thirtyfour dash fiftytwo seventytwo nine she read from the paper thats the account number as sally spoke nancy pulled a small notebook from her bag flipped it open to a fresh page and copied down the number then she jotted down some of the information sally had just given her it was certainly a lucky break that the account was at sallys fathers bank harrison lane could help her trace the owner of the account when nancy looked up from her notebook sally was staring at her a troubled look in her eyes you must think im a real creep huh she said nancy wasnt sure how to respond im sure youre sorry for what you did she began but sally cut her off come here she said pulling nancy back through the living room and into a study blackandwhite photographs hung on all the study walls dad on the washburn football team sally said pointing to one of the pictures and heres dad graduating from washburn mom graduating from washburn mom and dad at the washburn university senior formal ever since i was little all i ever heard was someday when you go to washburn i just couldnt let my parents down tears brimmed in sallys large eyes hey said nancy sympathetically im not here to judge you im here to figure this thing out quickly sally brushed away a tear i hope you find out whos doing this i bet im not the only one whos been approached if theres anything i can do to help just tell me well there is something said nancy you mentioned that you can get your email from brewster on your home computer would you show me how it works sally nodded sure come on the computers in my room nancy followed sally upstairs to her bedroom a yellow floral spread and matching canopy adorned the bed in the middle of the room over by the window was a computer desk with a pc on top of it nancy watched as sally turned on her computer plugged the telephone into the modem dialed the brewster academy number and finally logged onto the schools system theres another message in my box sally told her stiffening thats funny i checked my email when i left school today and there werent any messages this must have come in after three see what it says nancy urged her sally tapped a couple of keys and the screen cleared then lines of writing began to scroll upward from the bottom nancy leaned over sallys shoulder to read them your record has been corrected keep your mouth shut about this what goes up can come down and little girls who play with fire sometimes get burned chapter two thats a threat sally cried a small quiver in her highpitched voice this person is turning out to be a major creep thats for sure agreed nancy frowning she did some quick mental arithmetic if more students were involved each paying a thousand dollars then a lot of money was at stake no wonder the grade changer was so nasty he wanted to make sure no one threatened his operation would you print that out for me nancy asked sure sally hit the print screen button on her keyboard the printer began to chatter and a moment later sally tore off the page and handed it to nancy hmm nancy said as she studied the paper what are these numbers across the top i recognize todays date but what are the rest sally glanced at the page thats the time of transmission and see this the refers to the email facility and is my box number and that iw is the senders password the first two letters are usually initials i dont know anyone with those initials though nancy made notes next to each number as sally explained how could i find out which terminal this was sent from she asked im not sure ill ask around and see if anyone knows sally volunteered good nancy said you were right that this message was sent after school hours it says here do you know which parts of the school stay open after three sally shook her head not really im not big on afterschool activities some of the classrooms must be open though she said there are all sorts of clubs and meetings after three still gazing at the paper nancy went to sit on the edge of sallys bed to think after a moment she looked back up at the blonde and said okay heres what were going to do first im going to try to trace the bank account number if were lucky that information will lead us right to the gradechanger and the case will be wrapped up if that doesnt work she continued ill have to go undercover at brewster wow said sally in an admiring tone sounds like a great plan lets just hope it works nancy told her in the meantime i need you to try to find out if there are other kids whove been contacted by this anonymous gradehiker try not to be obvious about it though whoever it is could be dangerous if he senses youre trying to find out his identity sally nodded you can count on me nancy smiled at her good she flipped her notebook shut and tucked it in her purse then stood up thats about it except for one last thing is there anyone you suspect sally ran a hand through her blond hair well there is one person but she began hesitantly but what but hes a real sweet guy sally replied the only reason i thought of him is that hes a computer whiz his names victor paredes if anyone could break into that computer it would be him hes a senior nancy nodded making a mental note of the name the two girls went downstairs just as harrison lane was coming in the front door after greeting him nancy made arrangements with him to check out the account number then after saying goodbye to sally and her father she left twenty minutes later as she pulled into her driveway nancy saw hannah gruen the drews longtime housekeeper rushing out the door whats the matter hannah nancy called from her car nothing dear said hannah smiling warmly im spending the evening with a friend thats all oh here comes my taxi now hannah waved and headed down the driveway toward the cab that had pulled up dinners warming in the oven hannah called over her shoulder eat it before it gets dried out bye hannah nancy told her have fun going inside nancy saw that there was mail on the low table in the entrance hall most of it was for her father but nancy felt her heart skip a beat when she came to a letter with familiar handwriting a letter from ned a tingle ran through her as she took it up to her room to read it ned nickerson nancys boyfriend was away at emerson college this was the first letter shed received from him since hed returned to school from summer break it wasnt a very long letter just news about classes and his friends but the part at the end about how much he missed her made nancy resolve to visit him soon she settled back against the pillows on her bed to write him back by the time she was done her father had come home and it was time for dinner over baked chicken with chestnut stuffing nancy told her father about her case carson drew had a respected law practice in river heights and was often a help to her im not sure if other kids are involved or if sally was singled out and what makes it especially tricky is that changing a grade in a computer file doesnt leave any trace she concluded spooning a second serving of stuffing onto her plate you cant examine a floppy disk for erasure marks or analyze how old the ink is the way you can with something on paper her father smiled a distinguishedlooking man in his forties he had dark hair that was flecked with gray at the temples dont i know it a few years ago people were talking about the paperless office that computers were supposed to create but i probably use more paper in my practice now than i did before we computerized we print out every version of every document we draft so that if any problems come up we can pull the file and put our finger on the exact bug im surprised that brewster academy doesnt do something of the sort as well maybe they do nancy said but i dont know about it i hope i dont wind up having to go over a ton of paperwork to check which grades have been changed she added sighing but if thats what it takes ill do it id rather catch this hacker by checking the banks information hacker carson drew repeated what a funny word that is i remember the first time i heard it it was six or seven years ago a highschool girl here in river heights managed to figure out how to monkey with the billing on the telephone companys computer uhoh i think i see whats coming nancy guessed she had a boyfriend in tokyo right her father smiled not exactly but you arent far from wrong at summer camp she had gotten to be very close friends with her counselor who was also from river heights but in september the counselor went off to college on the west coast the girl was having some emotional problems i gather she got into the habit of calling her former counselor two or three times a week and talking to her for an hour or more at a time sounds like a pretty expensive habit nancy remarked she scooped up the last of the chicken with her fork and popped it into her mouth eventually it was carson replied but for several months she managed to ah hack the telephone company computer and erase the calls from her parents bills apparently she was very clever about it too the telephone company had quite a job catching up with her and when they did nancy asked her father leaned back in his chair her parents asked me to step in and deal with the telephone company i talked them into settling for the amount they were owed on the calls plus a detailed explanation from the girl of how she had broken into their system and altered the bills they needed that even more than the money you see otherwise someone else might have come along and found the same weak point in their security i understand their computer experts were very impressed by the girls skills so she didnt end up with a police record or anything like that nancy said with a laugh she was lucky to have you for a lawyer she stood up and collected the plates from the table hannah left fruit salad in the fridge want some i think ill pass her father stacked the serving dishes and followed nancy into the kitchen with them whatever happened to the girl nancy asked did she go on to be a computer crook or a computer genius genius i think her father answered laughing i remember hearing that she started her own computer company right here in town nancy paused with a plate in midair between the sink and the dishwasher an idea had occurred to her you know i might need to consult someone like her if i get in over my head in terms of computer knowhow whats the womans name cant tell you sorry honey replied her father as they stacked the dishwasher together thats privileged clientlawyer info dad nancy moaned i can just go to the library and look it up in a newspaper carson drew grinned i was able to keep the story out of the papers you could try but it wouldnt do much good youre a great lawyer dad nancy told him laughing too good there was a teasing glint in his eyes as he said i am arent i nancy checked her watch as she approached the front door of peoples federal bank ten minutes to nine the bank wasnt open yet but nancy saw through the heavy glass doors that harrison lane had spotted her holding a large ring of keys he opened the door from the inside and let her in i have some information for you lane said in a low voice behind him tellers and bank officials were getting ready to start the day some of them glanced at nancy with mild curiosity but returned to their business right away that account you asked about its in the name of i wynn i wynn nancy repeated breaking into a laugh get it i win you lose she explained when she saw lanes questioning look its obviously a fake name dont you think lane shook his head its real we checked it against the social security number the person gave suddenly nancy remembered the initials in sallys messagesenders password iw can i speak with the bank official who opened the account certainly lane ushered her over to one of the customer service desks to the left of the long tellers counter a slender africanamerican woman in her thirties sat behind the desk she smiled at nancy as harrison lane introduced nancy and explained what she wanted mrs tillman here opened the account ill let her tell you the rest said lane leaving them do you remember what i wynn looked like nancy asked as she settled into the chair beside the desk i certainly do it was about ten days ago she was a strangelooking little thing she nancy interrupted mrs tillman nodded oh yes a darkhaired girl about your age maybe a little younger her skin was very pale and her hair was jet black it looked dyed perhaps it was a wig and you say she was small nancy prompted yes very petite and nervous but you know i figured she was just a kid its easy to be nervous in a big bank like this her information checked out at first anyway what do you mean mrs tillman opened the desks file drawer and flipped through the manila folders pulling one out nancy could see the name i wynn written across the top well like this for instance mrs tillman told her the previous bank reference she gave was for a savings and loan company in texas there is such a place but it folded a few months ago after consulting the file again mrs tillman added she used her brewster academy student id for signature verification nancy nodded do you have an address for i wynn she asked mrs tillman punched some numbers into the computer terminal on her desk fourteen twentyone sycamore she read off the amber writing on the screen she opened the account with one hundred dollars ninetyfive of it was withdrawn from a machine two days later a few days after that a thousand dollars was deposited in cash that was all withdrawn the day after that nancy looked over mrs tillmans shoulder to check the dates the thousand dollars had been deposited the previous tuesday exactly when sally said shed made her deposit there were three other similar deposits and withdrawals it seemed as if sally was not the only student the gradechanger had contacted were all these transactions done at a cash machine nancy wanted to know two different cash machines one located at archer avenue the other at ivy avenue mrs tillman confirmed both those branches were quite close to brewster avenue where brewster academy was located nancy noted thanks very much she told mrs tillman ten minutes later nancy turned her car onto sycamore street and began looking for number the neighborhood was rundown and deserted most of the houses were faded and sagging as if they were simply waiting for a good excuse to collapse scraps of paper and debris littered the branches of the scraggly bushes lining the cracked sidewalk there were only a few cars parked along the curb but nancy had a feeling that few if any people actually lived there she parked in front of the address mrs tillman had given then took a long look at the place if the other houses on the block were neglected this one looked flatout abandoned she was tempted to leave still it was possible that the house held some clue to the identity of i wynn she had to check it out after taking a flashlight from the glove compartment she got out of her car and walked up to the front door to ring the bell no one answered nancys blue eyes focused on the doors heavy padlock maybe shed find an easier way in around back before going she grabbed the padlock and gave it a yank to make sure that it was locked to her surprise the screws that held the hasp to the doorframe pulled right out of the rotted wood the door swung slowly in as if inviting her to enter glancing over her shoulder to reassure herself that the street was deserted nancy took a quick step inside and pushed the door closed behind her then rumbling with the switch on her flashlight she started forward in the gloomy hallway suddenly with a loud crack the floor under her feet gave way nancy let out a gasp as she felt herself falling through space chapter three instinctively nancy flung her arms out to the side she let out a cry of pain as her hands and forearms slammed against the floorboards an instant later her arms felt as if they were about to snap in two and the splintery edges of the broken boards were digging painfully into them through the denim of her jacket her legs flailed uselessly below her but the worst pain was in her shoulders nancy felt as if her weight were about to pull her arms from their sockets gritting her teeth she moved her legs carefully in every direction groping for anything that might give her extra support but there was nothing if her arms slipped she was bound to fall okay drew think what if you let yourself down and hang full length by your arms then drop to the basement below she glanced nervously down into the murky darkness imagining the jumble of sharpedged pieces of machinery or nailstudded boards she might land on no the only sensible way out was upward nancy tried using her arms to push herself up out of the hole but after half a minute she gave up she didnt have enough leverage looks as if ill have to come up with plan b she thought taking a deep breath she let it out slowly and began to pull her right knee up toward the floor her aching arms felt as if they couldnt hold on much longer but soon the toes on nancys right foot were touching the underside of the floorboards with one last effort she turned her foot to one side and pulled it toward her it just barely cleared the far edge of the hole with a loud sigh of relief nancy extended her leg onto the floor and let it take some of the strain off her arms and shoulders she rested that way for a few moments then pulled her other leg up and rolled cautiously to one side if there was one weak spot in the floorboards there might be others just above her head a little daylight filtered in through the dusty windows on either side of the front door nancy spotted her flashlight in a corner next to the door she crawled over and retrieved it then got carefully to her feet beyond the yawning hole the floor of the hall was thick with dust a few pieces of old furniture kept the place from being completely empty nancy decided it was too dangerous to investigate the house shed have to find out about i wynn some other way nancy squinted in the sunlight as she stepped out onto the rickety front porch for the first time she noticed a small nameplate on the side of the doorframe opposite the bell on it the name ignatz wynn was written in small shaky handwriting ignatz huh thought nancy that was hardly a girls name what was the story here she checked the mailbox that was nailed to the porch railing and discovered a letter it was from the peoples federal bank a bank statement from the look of it it had been mailed only a few days earlier nancy put it back into the box there was no need to read it shed already seen the transaction records of the account a movement in the house across the street caught her eye someone had parted the venetian blinds and was peering at her through the slats in the next instant the person was gone crossing the street nancy knocked on the door of the house no one answered so she rapped harder slowly the door opened just enough for nancy to see a short grayhaired woman in a worn housedress what the old woman snapped gazing up at nancy suspiciously excuse me but i was wondering if you could tell me something about mr wynn nancy asked the womans blue eyes narrowed who wants to know im his niece nancy told her mentally crossing her fingers the womans face softened a bit and she opened the front door wider well i hate to tell you this honey but your uncle iggy passed on he just lay down one night and didnt wake up it was a peaceful death i guess nancys mouth fell open you mean hes dead that was news has anyone i mean anyone else in his family been by she inquired after a moment i didnt know he had any family the woman told her i saw a woman come by one day and a man the next but i dont know who they were was the woman small nancy asked that would be my cousin marie she added quickly this was someone else then she was kind of fat the man was on the tall side i didnt get a good look at them i mind my own business nancy smiled to herself at this last remark do you know whats going to happen to the house she asked the old woman snorted with laughter sure i do the government is taking over ownership iggy owed so much on back taxes that the state owns that house for sure they were trying to blast him out of there for years but he wouldnt go bless that stubborn old wino he wasnt budging nancy nodded how long ago did uh uncle iggy die she asked after thinking a moment the woman replied two weeks ago it was in the paper and all just a single line crammed in with all the other unimportant dead folks lines wasnt like they put his picture in or anything that would explain it murmured nancy thinking out loud explain what asked the woman raising an eyebrow huh oh nothing thank you very much for talking to me nancy said hastily ive got to be going the woman nodded and shut the door nancys mind was racing as she headed back to her car and slipped behind the wheel the real i wynn didnt have anything to do with this scam she realized the culprit must have picked the name from the obituary column it was perfect ignatz wynn had no relatives according to the woman across the street and his house was empty how had the culprit learned wynns social security number though that was a mystery for now nancy drummed her fingers against the steering wheel as she pondered another question who were the man and woman they could be in on the gradechanging scheme or they could be real estate people or officials from the state the only thing she knew for sure was that neither of them was the petite girl who had opened the account as i wynn starting up the engine nancy headed for home the muscles in her arms were throbbing she was sure she had some cuts and bruises that should be taken care of too she let out a sigh this case wasnt going to be as easy to solve as she had hoped her culprit was very clever time to go undercover she decided it looked as if she wasnt going to visit ned at emerson this weekend by four oclock that afternoon nancy had taken a long hot bath and rubbed ointment on the scratches on her arms still wrapped in her bathrobe she picked up the phone on her bedside table and called sally lane at home after saying hello she asked can you think of a believable reason for me to be hanging around the school asking questions after a brief pause sallys highpitched voice came back over the line what about the new tutoring program that could work one of the tutors just dropped out and theyre looking for a replacement thatd be perfect said nancy the kids who need tutoring are likely to be the same ones whod want their grades changed do you think your father can get me into the program no problem ill talk to him tonight okay call me back when youve spoken to him thanks for your help sally nancy told her and remember dont talk about this with anyone my lips are sealed sally assured her the next morning nancy parked her mustang in a visitors slot in the brewster academy parking lot and got out she smoothed her red black and white plaid skirt and straightened the collar of her white blouse then retrieved her attaché case from the back seat she wasnt sure what a tutor might wear but she hoped she looked the part brewster academy was a twostory gray stone building with slatecolored shingles and two massive chimneys on either side of the roof it looked as if it had escaped from a print of a new england town the school was beautiful but that didnt change the fact that something very ugly was going on there one of the front doors opened and harrison lane stepped out on the top step hed called her the night before to tell her that everything was set and shed brought him up to date on what shed learned about i wynn now spotting nancy he waved there you are he said as she walked up to him ive been waiting for you i just had a word with walter friedbinder our new headmaster hes arranged everything lane led her inside and down an echoing hallway to a door with administration painted in gold on the frosted glass pane in its upper half inside was a small anteroom with a desk a waiting area and a couple of file cabinets through a doorway to one side nancy caught a glimpse of an elaboratelooking computer setup the woman at the desk raised her head and said please go right in mr lane the headmaster is expecting you nancy noted her nameplate ms arletti nancy had been expecting the headmaster to be a grayhaired man perhaps with a trim mustache but walter friedbinder was young and athletic looking with shortcropped reddish hair and intense blue eyes he sprang up from his desk as they entered his office welcome to brewster academy ms drew he said offering his hand its nice to have you with us thank you and please call me nancy she said but maybe id better use the name nancy stevens around here my name has been in the papers and it might be best if no one knows im a detective of course said friedbinder the smile fading from his face i hope you can help us as im sure harrison told you this is my first year at brewster i accepted the position as headmaster because i admire brewsters progressive educational system the thought that the school might be ruined by a scandal makes me sick ill do what i can mr friedbinder nancy told him his smile returned please call me walter we try to keep things informal around here he returned to his desk and picked up a file folder i think youll find whatever you need to know about the tutoring program in here he said handing it to nancy now why dont we go next door and ill introduce you to my assistant head phyllis hathaway she can take you down to the learning lab and get you settled in ive got to be off lane told them checking his watch just as they left the headmasters office the door across the anteroom swung open an attractive woman with dark hair pulled back in a french braid came out she was about thirty years old and stylishly dressed in a black linen dress why hello lane said its been a long time how are you the woman gave him a surprised look then smiled politely and said only fine there was an awkward pause then the banker said well goodbye everyone and left walter urged nancy across the room phyllis he said this is nancy stevens who is joining the tutorial program i said youd help get her squared away nancy was glad that hed remembered to use her alias the fewer people who knew her true identity the better hi nancy the woman said im phyllis hathaway come into my office ill tell you a little about the program then we can go down to check out the classroom where youll be working have you done much of this sort of work before walter rushed to answer before nancy could reply nancy has excellent qualifications he said his voice harsh and impatient phylliss expression hardened im sure she does she said in a clipped tone that clearly said mind your own business the headmasters face reddened but he didnt say anything more instead after another awkward pause he said well ill leave you to it nancy if you need anything just let me know he disappeared into his office and nancy followed phyllis into hers i hope that didnt make you uncomfortable the woman said apologetically after they were seated ive been at brewster for a number of years ever since i finished college out in california but mr friedbinder is new to the place were still learning to work with each other i guess were experiencing whats called a personality conflict that happens i suppose nancy murmured she glanced around the office half of phylliss desk was taken up by the highpowered computer work station nancy had glimpsed before the bookcase behind phylliss chair seemed to be filled mostly with software manuals and books on computer programming ive heard that the school has a very advanced computer system nancy remarked phyllis beamed it certainly does the most powerful of any high school in the state were very proud of it and im especially proud because i was able to help design it im sure youll enjoy using the system too once you get the hang of it now heres what we hope to accomplish with the new tutoring program as phyllis spoke nancy realized that this case was going to be a challenge in more ways than one in addition to unmasking the gradechanger she was going to have to help students with their english history and social sciences it sounded as if she was going to have to do a lot of homework herself thats the plan in a nutshell phyllis concluded now why dont i give you a quick tour of the place they were getting to their feet when the telephone rang excuse me a moment phyllis said reaching for the receiver nancy stepped just outside phylliss office and waited she was reading her notes and thinking over her approach to the investigation when suddenly a phrase caught her attention too dangerous phyllis was telling the caller listen dana i dont like him any more than you do id love to see the conceited nitwit squirm but im not sure i want to go any further with this yes okay maybe i am getting cold feet but this could really hurt brewster i know i know the financial rewards are compelling and i really do need the money lets just take it more slowly this plan has the potential to end in disaster chapter four nancy edged away from the office door she didnt want phyllis to guess that shed overheard any of her conversation it looked as if nancy had another suspect phyllis had a motive apparently she needed money though nancy didnt know why and who was it she wanted to see squirm maybe friedbinder considering their strained relationship a gradechanging scam would accomplish both things phyllis had the opportunity too who would have better access to the schools computer than she there was only one catch phyllis was tall and elegant even in a disguise she wouldnt fit the description of the petite i wynn or of the woman whod been seen at i wynns sycamore avenue address but maybe that was where this dana person came in sorry to keep you waiting phyllis said coming out into the anteroom now let me show you the learning lab nancy and phyllis took the stairs up to the second floor using a key phyllis unlocked the door and ushered nancy into a small room with a teachers desk four student desks and a folding table that held a telephone computer terminal and a small printer once in a while you may have to share this room with mickey randolph hes the other tutor phyllis told nancy his specialty is science and math unfortunately hes out of town for the next few days though a relative passed away im sorry to hear that nancy said in more ways than one she added to herself randolph might have information that would help her yes well here is some background on each of your students phyllis continued handing nancy a manila folder she took from the teachers desk a schedule was taped to the top of the folder let me give you a password so that you can use the computer too phyllis found a scrap of paper on a desk and wrote out a code ns four fortyfour nancy read when phyllis handed her the paper what does that stand for nancy stevens four hundred and fortyfourth password replied phyllis ill load it into the system when i get back to my office youll be able to use it right away thanks said nancy as phyllis left she sat back down in a students seat and thought sally lanes message had been sent by iw four fortythree was the last password entered into the system before nancys that could mean that the gradechanger was someone who hadnt been at the school a long time or it might mean that the person had two passwords and had assigned himself or herself the i wynn password without the schools knowledge yet phyllis was aware of the number of the last assigned password it must be in her records did she know who was using it was phyllis herself using it nancys thoughts were interrupted when her first student arrived he was a tall awkward boy named dan i dont see why we have to learn this stuff dan mumbled as nancy opened the history book these geeks are dead man nancy could see that she had her work cut out for her her next two students werent much easier one was a girl with short red hair who needed help in english apparently she had never bothered learning much spelling or grammar because she had spellcheck and grammarcheck on her home computer the other one was a girl who was failing history she admitted to nancy that shed been caught writing her reports from miniseries on tv to each of the three students nancy asked the same leading question wouldnt it be great if you could somehow change your old grades now that youre going to start doing better she asked it casually with a smile but her blue eyes scrutinized their faces for any trace of reaction all three students agreed it would be wonderful but nancy didnt note any signs of guilt or nervousness nancy glanced at the name of her fourth and final student before lunch victor paredes he was the guy sally had named as the computer whiz she recalled apparently he needed tutoring in english there was a tap on the open door nancy looked up and saw a guy standing there grinning at her he was very goodlooking tall and broad shouldered with light brown almost amber eyes and dark brown hair hi teach he said hi stu she retorted come on in nancy looked over the sheet that detailed what he was supposed to work on then got down to it victor was very quick but it was obvious he had never bothered to spend more than two minutes on english grammar before now that he was bothering he caught on easily if any of my teachers were as pretty as you maybe i would have paid more attention to this stuff said victor gazing into nancys eyes with lines like that im surprised you didnt get better grades nancy laughed trying to deflect his flirtation at the end of one of the exercises nancy said now that wasnt hard was it its too bad you cant go back and change last years grade in english now that you know how to do the work who says you cant victor replied i could if i wanted to nancy started then caught herself and said lightly dont be ridiculous your grades are in your permanent file sure said victor flashing her a dazzling grin and my permanent file is in the school computer along with everybody elses nancy fought to keep cool as she said yes i know but you need special access codes to get to them dont you otherwise people would go around giving themselves whatever grades they wanted she held her breath and waited to hear what he would say there are ways to access those codes victor replied youd have to be really smart to figure out how but i could nancy laughed youre not big on modesty are you pink spots bloomed on victors cheeks well i dont want you thinking im dumb just because i bombed out in english he told her i mean being smart is sort of attractive isnt it and i want you to see my good side again nancy tried to ignore his flirting though she couldnt help being charmed by it a little too you mean youve figured out how to get into the locked files in the school computer she asked trying to get the conversation back on track thats pretty amazing if its true its true all right here ill prove it to you he went over to the terminal and turned it on lets see what would light a fire under the honchos in the big office hey i know nancy looked over his shoulder his fingers were moving over the keyboard too quickly for her to follow but on the screen she saw a demand for a password then a directory of files apparently victor had somehow figured out how to get past the security codes and break into the system the glowing cursor moved down the list of files and stopped at one named headmastbio victor pressed a couple of keys the screen cleared then filled up with walter friedbinders biography now what should we do with him victor started typing again every now and then he gave a little snort of amusement finally he turned on the printer printed out the document and handed it to nancy she started reading walter twinkletoes friedbinder the new headmaster of brewster academy has one of the largest collections of soda bottle caps in the united states he has earned degrees in both fahrenheit and celsius and is a founding member of river heightss flat earth society dr friedbinders research into looseleaf notebooks and the effects of heating them in oil led to his famous discovery of the friedbinder nancy laughed victor what have you done she cried trying unsuccessfully to scold him this is terrible he pretended to be hurt i thought it was pretty good for the spur of the moment but but what if somebody sent this out without noticing the changes you made mr friedbinder would probably fire them no problem nancy turning to the keyboard he entered a couple of commands there ive restored the original version ill show you the printer began chattering again when it stopped victor ripped off the page and handed it to nancy scanning it quickly she saw it was a straightforward unaltered press release about walter friedbinder she folded the two pages and put them in her shoulder bag very impressive can you really get into any file in the school computer she asked even stuff like student records just about victor boasted figuring out the access codes is my hobby the same way some guys customize cars or play video games or collect weird road signs nancy shook her head arent you running a big risk though changing peoples grades is really asking for trouble wait a minute he said holding up a hand i never said i was changing grades just that it wouldnt be that hard to do he pointed toward the file folder on the desk if i was into changing grades do you think id still have that d from last years english class on my record thats a point nancy conceded she was about to ask victor more questions but the bell in the hallway started to ring wow i cant believe its lunchtime already victor turned off the terminal and gathered his books at the door he looked back thanks for the english lesson he said i actually understood some of it hey could i interest you in getting a burger after school with me i mean my treat nancy thought quickly victor might well be behind the gradechanging scheme even if he wasnt he seemed to know more about the computer system than anyone else around okay all right ill meet you in the parking lot around three he flashed her a quick grin and then he was gone nancy found herself smiling she couldnt help liking victor so far in the past shed learned the hard way that well even bad guys could have charming smiles all the students were probably down in the lunchroom by now this would be a good time to check out some of the other classrooms nancy shut the door to the learning lab behind her checking each classroom she made her way down the secondfloor hallway half the school was on the first lunch shift so many of the classrooms were empty nancy was looking for rooms with computers places where the mysterious email message might have been sent from and also a place where the hacker if it turned out to be a student could sit undisturbed to work his or her grade changes suddenly she stopped alone in a classroom with three computers was a short petite girl with shoulderlength dark hair held back with a headband she sat working on one of the computers when nancys shoe scuffed the floor the girl jumped and turned around anxiously oh you scared me she cried seeing nancy in the doorway the girl wore an oversize purple sweatshirt over loosefitting corduroy pants her surprised expression quickly changed to one of annoyance as she asked are you looking for something just checking out the building nancy told her she introduced herself as nancy stevens and explained that she was the new tutor at brewster as nancy spoke the girl hit a few computer buttons and closed out the file shed been working on was she finished nancy wondered or was she hiding what she had been writing catching up on homework nancy asked pleasantly not quite the girl said curtly my names randi peters im the editor of the academician she was clearly impressed with her title im working on an article for the paper hey how about being interviewed nancy blinked had her cover been blown already interview me she said cautiously about what about the tutoring program of course randi said i havent done a story on it yet i think its a natural dont you sure nancy agreed quickly it was perfect only nancy hoped she would be the one getting useful information but i dont have my schedule on me i dont know when ill be free ill have to call you randi smiled okay see you soon then nancy said goodbye and returned to the learning lab for her afternoon tutorials after her last student she met victor in the parking lot and followed his battered old green sedan to the roost a hangout a few blocks from brewster academy the place was just beginning to fill up nancy nodded to sally lane who was sitting with friends in a nearby booth with a quick tilt of her chin sally quietly acknowledged the greeting nancy looked around admiring the dozens of highschool pennants hanging from the ceiling and the motorcycle fixed high on the back wall theres a table over there victor said pointing to the far side of the room great said nancy ill just wash my hands and be right back as nancy passed sallys booth one of the girls sitting with her she had short wavy blond hair and pale blue eyes looked up nancy was surprised when she saw the expression of hatred on the girls face she tried to think if she had crossed paths with the girl somewhere but nothing came to her nancy was drying her hands when the bathroom door flew open startled nancy glanced over her shoulder the girl from sallys booth was standing with her back against the door and her hands in the pockets of her leather motorcycle jacket her expression was even more hostile than before there was no mistaking it now nancy was definitely the target of her anger the girl was short and delicate but the fury on her face made nancy cautious she knew that rage often made people stronger than they seemed i know who you are and what youre up to the girl snarled who was this girl what did she know right now the most important thing was to get away from her if youll please move id like to leave said nancy advancing toward the door with shocking strength the girl pushed nancy back youre not going anywhere she said in a voice full of menace not until im through with you chapter five nancy staggered back almost losing her footing this girl was out of control nancy would have to deal with her carefully im telling you youre mistaken nancy said i dont know you maybe not the girl countered but im going to make sure you remember me for a long time the girl pulled her right hand back as if to rake her nails across nancys face as her arm started to move nancy reached up and caught her wrist her thumb pressed on a spot where the nerves that control the hand run close to the surface the girl turned pale and her hand opened let me go she muttered through clenched teeth kim a highpitched voice called whats going on in there nancy took a quick step to the left and put her back to the wall ready to take on two attackers if she had to but the newcomer was sally her hazel eyes filled with concern nothing nancys opponent said almost spitting out the word a moment later she stormed out of the rest room who was that and what is her problem nancy asked sally her names kim forster sally replied when she saw you walk in with victor it kind of lit her fuse if you know what i mean you mean she and victor nancy leaned back against the wall i thought maybe she found out i was investigating this case and she was involved somehow i doubt it said sally shes got this intense thing for victor they dated for a while kim didnt seem that upset when it ended but for the past couple of weeks all she can talk about is what a rat he is thats odd nancy remarked i wonder what set her off with a shake of her head she added well ive got other things to worry about have you discovered if any other kids have been approached by the gradechanger no luck so far how about you nothing yet nancy told her listen id better get back to victor hes probably wondering what happened to me and id better get back to kim sally replied now that shes cooled off a little id better make sure she stays that way as nancy walked back to her table she could almost feel kims glare boring into her back if that was the way kim was after cooling off it was a good thing that she hadnt stayed heated up victor looked up as nancy sat down you were gone so long that i went ahead and ordered for you a cheeseburger and french fries okay fine i just ran into a friend of yours nancy made a slight motion of her head in the direction of sally and kims booth victor glanced across the room then shifted uneasily oh did you have any uh problems sort of kim seems to be pretty hottempered and impulsive you could say that he replied with an empty little laugh did she try to show you her deed the one that says she owns me no nancy said chuckling good its a forgery anyway he paused and studied the top of the table we had a few dates thats all no big deal and we stopped dating because it wasnt working for either of us we were both okay with that i thought but now she looks at me like im a worm shes planning to dissect for her biology project nancy leaned back to let the waiter set their food on the table she wanted to get off the topic of kim and back to investigating the case how long have you been interested in computers since i was fourteen he said i was in a car accident i got banged up pretty bad missed a whole year of school i should have graduated last year but i had to make up the year i lost anyway while i was laid up i started hacking around with my dads home pc i couldnt do much else that year victor leaned back in his chair and smiled and that is how i became the computer genius you see before you today i bet i can guess what youre going to study in college said nancy taking a bite of her burger his smile disappeared and he became serious the big question isnt what its where the places that have really good information sciences programs cost a fortune i dont have that kind of money im at brewster on a full scholarship so either i get a college scholarship or i settle for a second or thirdrate school thats where you come in it is nancy asked cautiously for sure youre going to help me raise my grades im counting on it he gave her another of his charming grins nancy couldnt help smiling back but as she did she studied victors face he seemed to be open and uncomplicated but could she really tell did his remark have a double meaning or was he simply talking about the tutoring program how about a movie tonight victor asked boldly as he wolfed down the last of the fries time to tell him about ned said nancy to herself she told victor all about her relationship with her boyfriend to her surprise victor began searching for something under the table then the chair what are you looking for she asked ned he said with a smile well hes sure not here nancy laughed exactly said victor gazing meaningfully into her eyes i am so lets forget about ned i cant said nancy anyway im your tutor i dont think i can go out with students its not like youre a real teacher come on why not victor replied nancy felt herself melt a little in the warmth of his gaze but all she said was i have a couple of errands to run lets get the check i should get home too said victor my computer must be starting to wonder what happened to me he signaled the waiter and paid for their burgers and then they left as she drove home nancy reviewed the case even though she liked him victor paredes definitely had to be a suspect he had bragged to her that he could do whatever he wanted with the computer system he hadnt made a secret of his poor grades in english or about his need for money to go to college what if he had first cracked the school records access code while trying to change his own transcript then realized that he had a very profitable product to sell he was no dope he might have decided to leave his own grades unchanged for the time being just in case suspicion fell on him hadnt he been awfully quick to bring up just that point nancy laughed that was like saying that because a criminal might try to look innocent anyone who looked innocent must be guilty pushing victor out of her thoughts for the moment nancy started to think about kim had her attack on nancy really been caused by jealousy or was she somehow connected to the case but nancy didnt see how kim would know that she was a detective or that there was a gradechanging scheme and what about randi the newspaper reporter was she as straight as she seemed she obviously knew how to use the computer very well and she had seemed anxious to clear her computer screen when nancy showed up in addition she was petite and a brunette just as mrs tillman had described i wynn so far she was the only one who fit that description and of course there was phyllis hathaway she was still nancys numberone suspect nancy resolved to find out more about her and her mysterious friend dana the next day the next morning nancy had a break after her third student it wasnt long enough to do any investigating but it did give her time to go to the faculty lounge and fix herself a cup of tea as she was carrying it back to the learning lab she ran into victor he was standing in the hall talking to a heavyset young woman with curly dark hair and green eyes she was wearing a navy blue business suit and had a stilldamp raincoat draped over her arm it had poured all morning hey nancy victor called come here i want you to meet someone when nancy joined them he continued you were asking questions about the school computer system heres someone who knows it inside out meet ms maccauley president of pointtech computers and queen of the river heights hackers victor the woman said in mock outrage ive told you before you dont call people hackers these days its like oh i dont know what but dont do it victor saluted yes maam then he turned back to nancy ms maccauley heads up pointtech the company that designed the system here at brewster whenever it goes down shes the one who catches the flak and puts it back on line does the system go down often asked nancy no ms maccauley answered yes said victor at the same moment lets put it this way ms maccauley said smiling its a complex system thats had a lot of different demands put on it its designed to handle them but sometimes the pressure makes it a little ornery thats when i step in to give it lots of strokes and a few wellplaced strategic kicks nancy returned the womans smile i can easily imagine kicking a computer said nancy but how do you go about stroking it maybe this was her chance to learn something helpful about the computer system at brewster do you have a few minutes to show me a little more about the system ms maccauley glanced at her wristwatch then said i guess i do theres a terminal in the learning lab where im working nancy added victor gave a snort and said thanks to ms maccauley theres a terminal in practically every space in this school except the broom closet the woman turned to him and said with a straight face what happened to that one did someone steal it then laughing they all went up to the learning lab a few moments later nancy found herself seated at the terminal with an expert leaning over each of her shoulders she turned on the power typed in her password at the logon prompt and hit the enter button a list of menus appeared on the screen is there anything in particular youd like to know how to do ms maccauley asked her nancy hesitated a moment she had to be careful what she asked if victor was the gradechanger she didnt want him to suspect she was on his trail i was wondering she said lightly if someone sent you a message would there be any way of finding out what terminal it came from you could ms maccauley replied with a nod if you refuse the message the computer will tell you that its returning the message to its place of origin it will say returning refused message to terminal twelve or whatever terminal it is and how could you find out where terminal twelve is located asked nancy you couldnt ms maccauley replied youd have to have access to a set of computer files that the regular student user couldnt get to shed have to ask walter to look at the file thought nancy why cant students have that information she asked ms maccauley is it for security reasons not really we simply didnt want to overload the active systems with files students dont need by storing this information in a separate reference directory we freed up some space for active use no one but authorized personnel can get into that file authorized personnel and me victor piped up ms maccauley shot him an exasperated look victor she said covering her ears im not hearing this dont tell me these things disregarding the playful warning victor leaned in closer to nancy closer than he had to watch this he said as his fingers flew across the keyboard ta da he crowed finally there it was a complete listing of all the terminals in the school next to their code reference numbers nancys heart skipped a beat maybe she could just get a copy of the list now without bothering the headmaster but she couldnt ask for it without making victor suspicious oh no nancy exclaimed suddenly glancing at her watch a students due to arrive any minute and im not prepared yet nancy jumped up from her seat and pretended to twist her ankle she pitched forward bringing her hand down on the keyboard making sure to hit only one button print screen noisily the printer sprang into action oh my gosh she cried feigning surprise are you okay asked victor its just my ankle she moaned i hope it doesnt swell up im going to get a cold wet towel ms maccauley volunteered that might keep it from swelling lets take a look at that said victor as ms maccauley left the room he knelt down in front of her and propped her foot up on his leg slipping off her loafer he gently rotated the ankle does that hurt he asked his amber eyes meeting hers they were startled by a strangled cry from the doorway nancy looked over and saw kim standing there her face crimson with anger youll be sorry she cried you two will wish you were never born when im through with you chapter six kim turned and fled down the hall id better try to talk to her victor said dashing out of the room nancy hit the advance button on the printer and the paper moved up enough so that she could tear off the three sheets of the printout and slip them into her bag what was that about a voice spoke up behind her nancy whirled around to find ms maccauley standing in the doorway for a moment she thought the woman had been talking about the printout then nancy realized she was watching kim and victor just some kind of misunderstanding said nancy ms maccauley turned her attention back to nancy hows your ankle she asked offering her a few cool wet paper towels huh oh itll be okay nancy took the towel and pressed it to her ankle do you know what else i feel so stupid my student isnt even due to arrive for another halfhour i was mistaken im not used to my schedule yet terrific said ms maccauley settling herself at the terminal we can continue while victor sorts out his love life with nimble fingers she closed out the directory of computer terminals she chuckled and shook her head as she worked that victor hed better watch his step or hell land in big trouble someday once you know how to break into a system its very tempting to make mischief believe me i know there was something in the way she said i know that jolted nancys memory nancy gave ms maccauley a probing look she was obviously in her early twenties only a few years older than nancy nancy tried to remember what her father had told her about the girl who had gotten in trouble for using her computer to alter her parents telephone bills ms maccauley seemed to be about the right age she had her own computer company in river heights too and the remark shed just made indicated that she had gotten into computerrelated trouble nancy would be willing to bet that ms maccauley was the girl her father had defended trying to remain calm nancy said i suppose a person could tamper with all sorts of things like bank records government files even telephone bills ms maccauley looked so sharply at nancy that nancy knew her hunch was right well uh let me show you how the email works ms maccauley said her attention on the computer once again see these menus on the screen nancy nodded and ms maccauley went on you see the word mail that allows you to send and receive electronic mail do you have a mailbox yet phyllis hathaway gave me a password nancy replied but i dont know if i have an email box thats easily fixed said ms maccauley she tapped in some commands there from now on whenever you log onto the system it will tell you if theres any email in your box ive just sent you todays student mailings try it log off then log back on obediently nancy exited from the system then reentered and typed in her password when she hit return a blinking message flashed on the screen you have three email messages do you want to read them now y n nancy pressed y a school calendar appeared on the screen followed by a list of weekly club meetings and an announcement of tryouts for the next drama society play ms maccauley then showed nancy how to send a message and how to refuse one nancy kept her eyes on ms maccauleys face as she said this system is really impressive when i met phyllis yesterday i got the impression that she had designed it but didnt victor just say that you had ms maccauley stiffened ms hathaway and i have both worked on it she said in a tight voice she has a solid background in computers and a thorough understanding of the schools needs why was she suddenly so cool nancy wondered had nancy hit on something when she mentioned ms hathaway well however it happened nancy said lightly the computer system seems to be a big plus at brewster you should be proud of yourselves we are ms maccauley replied too bad the trustees didnt feel that way when they chose the new head for the school phyllis would have been the perfect choice abruptly she got to her feet saying i have to get back to my office ill walk you outside nancy volunteered she stretched a little as she got to her feet i could use some exercise besides there was more she wanted to learn from ms maccauley i have one more question said nancy grabbing her raincoat could i read a message and still find out where it was sent from this is one of the few systems on which you can ms maccauley said proudly as they went downstairs to exit if you save the message after reading it and then refuse it youll see the terminal code come up as its returned to its origin the sun was beginning to peek out through the heavy gray cloud cover but the parking lot was still awash and nancy and ms maccauley had to sidestep large puddles in the parking lot ms maccauley stopped next to a blue compact car that was several years old nice to meet you nancy she said offering her hand good luck with the tutoring thanks nancy replied ms maccauley got behind the wheel and drove off giving nancy a quick wave nancy waved back then turned to go inside the headmaster was standing a dozen feet away watching her his hands jammed into the pockets of his raincoat hi mr friedbinder nancy said as she walked up to him walter i mean hello nancy he replied i just went to check on my car windows kind of late now that the rain has stopped i guess oh by the way hows your work going nancy glanced around to be sure they couldnt be overheard then said im beginning to get a few leads but i should warn you im pretty sure this is going to turn out to be bigger than just one incident thats bad said walter shaking his head slowly i hope we can control the damage by the way id be careful about getting too friendly with dana maccauley nancy blinked dana maccauley she must be the dana that phyllis hathaway had been talking to on the telephone the day before why do you say that nancy asked he hesitated before answering in my opinion maccauley took brewster academy to the cleaners she talked the school into buying a system thats much more complicated and expensive than was needed i wasnt here when it was bought and installed if i had been i would have made a real stink i could have designed a better one in my sleep are you suggesting that shes a crook nancy asked i didnt say that walter said quickly theres nothing illegal about selling someone something he doesnt need but its not very principled either i may as well tell you that im interviewing other people who can keep the computer system going as soon as ive found someone dana maccauley is going to be out in the cold nancy frowned do you think she has any idea of the way you feel im sure she does he said i havent made any secret of my dissatisfaction as she and the headmaster moved along the walk to the door nancys thoughts raced dana must know more about the computer system than anyone if she knew that her company was about to run into serious financial trouble she might be frantic to accumulate extra cash could she and phyllis have dreamt up the gradechanging racket together that would explain danas touchiness concerning phylliss involvement in setting up the computer system maybe their motive wasnt just the money maybe they hoped to involve walter friedbinder in a scandal a scandal that would cost him his job both women had made it clear that they thought phyllis should have been chosen as the new head did they also think she might be chosen as walters replacement if he were out of the way ill leave you now nancy said walter breaking into her thoughts good luck with your work the headmaster continued down the hall toward his office and nancy went up to the second floor victor was waiting outside the learning lab leaning against the wall with his hands in his pockets hi teach he said straightening up he flashed his handsome smile nancy rolled her eyes were you able to calm kim down she asked im beginning to think its not safe to be seen with you forgive me o exalted one he wailed i have offended you nancy couldnt help but laugh i do hope you explained what really happened oh i explained he told nancy i dont think she heard a word i said though she just kept saying she was going to get even with us for everything nancy was puzzled kim had seen her and victor together only twice for a total of about twenty minutes why was she so upset everything like what nancy asked beats me victor said with a shrug all i can say is kim is getting to be a very big drag i wouldnt be surprised if she the bell down the hall started to ring and drowned out the rest of his sentence when it stopped he said id better run i am enrolled in school here and i dont want to get kicked out ill look for you after school maybe we can go back to the roost for a hot fudge sundae he walked away quickly leaving nancy staring thoughtfully after him was victor getting a little too fond of her keeping an eye on him because he was one of her chief suspects was one thing but playing with his emotions was something else she had told him about ned but he didnt seem to care she would just have to watch her step with victor for a start she was not going to be around after school for him to find and the next time they met she was going to be sure to find a way to work neds name into the conversation nancy unlocked the learning lab turned on the lights and checked her watch she still had three or four minutes before her next student the computer terminal caught her eye and she walked over to it switched it on and typed in her password she had a message in her mailbox she called it to the screen expecting an announcement of an upcoming glee club concert or a raffle to raise money for the volleyball team instead these words appeared snoops and spies get hurt nancy drew go home before you get erased for good chapter seven her heart pounding nancy stared at the monitor screen she wasnt imagining the message it was still there she leaned closer to study the transmission information at the top of the email message she knew that password iw and the time of transmission was startled nancy rechecked her watch the message had been entered only minutes before recalling what dana maccauley had shown her she saved the message then refused it returning message to terminal came the message on the screen in a flash nancy took her printout from her bag twentynine twentynine she muttered running her finger down the list there it is the message had been sent from the terminal in the newspaper office if she hurried she might catch its sender at the door she bumped into the girl who was arriving for her tutoring session sorry nancy gasped have a seat ill be right back as she dashed down the corridor everyone turned to stare at her when she reached the academician office she found it locked and the frosted glass in the upper half of the door dark nancy shook the knob a few times are you looking for someone a voice asked startled nancy whirled around to find randi the girl she had met the day before oh yes nancy replied thinking fast a student im supposed to tutor asked me to meet her in this room and she hasnt shown up has anyone been here that you know of she wanted to meet you at the academician office randi repeated in a dubious tone she unlocked the office door flipped on the lights and motioned nancy in nancy quickly took in the whole office crowded as it was with furniture there wouldnt be anyplace for anyone to hide she saw at once i was in the office myself until ten minutes ago and there wasnt anyone else here randi told her are you sure youre not mistaken before nancy could answer randi continued i know ive seen you before you look so familiar i know ive seen your picture in the newspaper who are you what are you doing here nancy felt her heart sink she couldnt let her cover be broken not now as i told you yesterday i just started working in the tutoring program she replied in a rush you might have seen my picture because i just won the river heights art contest second prize maybe that was it said randi suspiciously then she shrugged hey why dont i interview you about the program now as the girl reached for a pad and pencil nancy hastily said im not the one you want i just started im only temporary and i dont know that much about it why dont you interview ms hathaway or mr friedbinder randi wrinkled her nose theyre not actually working in the tutoring program you are i want to get a groundlevel view of it then the people you ought to talk to suddenly nancy clapped her hand over her mouth uhoh i just remembered i left someone in the learning lab waiting for a tutoring session randi was staring at her as if she had lost her mind too late nancy remembered that shed just told randi she was meeting a student there at the newspaper office luckily all randi said was okay but i still want that interview with you nancy drew shooting randi an apologetic smile nancy hurried back down the hall suddenly she gasped and stopped short so quickly a guy with a big stack of books under one arm obviously late to class walked straight into her she helped him pick up his books thinking about what randi had said randi had called her nancy drew not nancy stevens somehow shed uncovered nancys real identity randi wasnt the only one who had addressed her by her full name in the last hour either the author of that threatening message had done the same walter friedbinder and sally lane were supposed to be the only ones who knew her real name but if randi knew others might too nancy groaned it was going to be even more difficult to track down the gradechanger now when she reached the learning lab it was empty the girl must have gotten impatient and left nancy turned on the computer and checked her email no new messages had come in for her hey there a familiar voice called from the doorway sharpening your computer skills nancy turned to see victor stroll into the room something like that nancy answered him listen will you excuse me i have to make a phone call victors face fell but all he said was sure i just sneaked out of class to say hi catch you later once he was gone nancy dialed the number of the peoples federal bank harrison lane came on the line at once nancy he said i was just going to call you eight hundred dollars that was deposited yesterday in i wynns account was withdrawn from the archer avenue bank machine at eightthirty this morning before school hours nancy noted mr lane is there any way you can program the banks computer to alert you the next time somebody tries to make a withdrawal or deposit from that account that shouldnt be too hard the banker said well just put a flag on the account number with instructions to telephone me when it pops up we can also tell the computer to take extra time to process any transaction for that account that way well have enough time to react to the alarm great said nancy can you set it up right away i dont want our crook to decide to pull out of this scheme before we have a chance to catch whoever it is neither do i lane agreed ill flag that account the moment we get off the phone thanks as she hung up nancys stomach growled reminding her that it was almost time for lunch nancys heart sank when she entered the anteroom separating phyllis hathaways and walters offices shed rushed there after grabbing a quick bowl of soup in the cafeteria hoping to find phyllis out to lunch but apparently the assistant head was eating in that day and was hunched over some papers on her desk as nancy watched phyllis took a bite from a sandwich then turned her attention back to her work stepping out of phylliss sight nancy leaned against ms arlettis empty desk to think she had to get the woman out of there so she could search her office as she thought nancy became aware of walter friedbinders voice from inside his office sure mel well talk about it at the staff meeting before the board arrives fine see you then nancy stood up straight as an idea came to her a second later she sneaked inside walters office and closed the door behind her what he began when he saw her but she silenced him by putting a finger to her lips his gaze was openly dubious but he waited while nancy explained in a whisper what she wanted to do so i call phyllis in here for an emergency meeting giving you a chance to search her office walters intense blue eyes took on a pleased glint im sure i can handle that great said nancy smiling at him ill wait out in the hallway until i hear her go into your office if you can keep her here for ten minutes that ought to be long enough a few minutes later nancy slipped into the assistant heads office and stood with her back to the closed door in a flash she scanned the room two filing cabinets desk the computer station a bookcase and a coatrack with a raincoat on it she decided to start with phylliss desk which was against the wall to the left of the door sitting in the desk chair nancy glanced through the papers on the desktop next to the halfeaten tunafish sandwich they were nothing but notes on an upcoming parents visiting day next she pulled open the top desk drawer and sifted through a jumble of paper clips rubber bands and pens nancy saw nothing that would link phyllis to i wynn or the scam nor did she find any clues as to what plan phyllis had meant during her phone conversation with dana that nancy had overheard a few times nancy paused to listen but heard only the distant hum of phyllis and walter talking in the other office next she tried the file it was locked but she easily jimmied it open using the lockpicking kit she always kept in her purse what is this she thought her gaze lighting on a binder that was tucked in among the files the spine was labeled computer password logbook great snatching up the binder she opened it to the first page it was a chronological listing of the computer passwords next to each password was the name of the student to whom it was assigned and the date the password was issued all of the entries on the page were made in a neat flowing script probably phylliss nancys head snapped up as she heard a door open and then phylliss voice loud and clear nonsense walter i have the file in my office itll just take a second to grab it nancys breath caught in her throat and she slammed the book shut she could hear walter objecting but phyllis wasnt paying any attention her heels clicked on the floor as she crossed the wooden anteroom nancy checked frantically for somewhere to hide but there was nothing no closet no enclosed space unless she could suddenly disappear phyllis was going to catch her redhanded chapter eight nancy didnt have time to think about what to do holding the binder to her chest she slid the file drawer shut then rushed over to squat in the corner behind the door on the far side of the desk a split second later phylliss clicking heels stopped outside the door and the knob was turned nancy held her breath as the door swung in toward her she stayed low so phyllis wouldnt see her silhouette through the frosted glass in the top half of the door please leave the door open nancy begged silently and stay on the other side of the room she heard a drawer being opened and some papers being rustled over by the desk would phyllis notice the unlocked file drawer or the missing binder every muscle in nancys body tensed as phylliss shoes clacked back toward nancy the assistant head paused at the door a moment then the door was closed and she was gone nancys knees went weak and she let out a long breath phew id better work fast and get out of here in case she comes back again she thought reopening the binder nancy flipped excitedly to the last page of entries there at the end was her own password ns just above it was the listing for iw the name listed was nancy squinted trying to make out the letters the initials i and w were clear but the rest of the name was scrawled illegibly hmm she compared the handwriting of the iw entry to the others it seemed to be not as distinct but similar otherwise had phyllis tried to disguise her writing so that no one could link her to the fake entry or was someone else trying not quite successfully to imitate her handwriting so that phyllis would be implicated in the scam nancy shook her head she needed concrete evidence flipping back to the first page nancy ran her finger down the listings until she found phylliss and victors passwords and copied them down as an afterthought she wrote down randis password too then she replaced the binder in the drawer and began looking through the other files it seemed to be dull stuff for the most part budget information personnel files minutes from staff meetings curriculum files there was a fat computer file and a manual for the schools system but nancy didnt see how reading that would help solve her case she glanced at her watch shed been there for almost ten minutes now phyllis had to be returning any second shutting the drawer nancy moved quickly over to the filing cabinets opening them one by one there was no time to examine them thoroughly but she didnt see anything unusual or incriminating at first glance with a sigh nancy closed the last drawer of the file cabinets and scrutinized the office to make sure everything was the same as when shed entered then after cracking open the door to check the common waiting room to make sure it was empty nancy slipped back through the empty anteroom and into the hall well she hadnt hit the jackpot as shed hoped but at least she had those passwords now maybe they would lead to some valuable discoveries nancy sat at her bedroom desk and pounded on the papers in front of her i need a break here she muttered into the air it was sunday evening shed spent all of saturday afternoon at sally lanes using her computer after sally had shown her how to access the brewster computer with her pc nancy had gone to work using the passwords shed copied from phylliss log she accessed first phylliss then victors then randis files shed called up each and every file checking for anything that would point to any of them as her suspect by the time she was done shed read enough administrative memos computer programs and newspaper stories to last a lifetime but she hadnt found a single thing to incriminate any of the three that day shed given herself a break and had gone shopping at the river heights mall with her best friends george fayne and bess marvin but her mind was not on shopping she kept trying to make sense of the evidence she had so far the threatening message that had been sent from the newspaper room randis knowledge of her real name phylliss hushhush phone call with dana victors abilities to doctor offlimits files the use of her real name on the threatening message depending on how she read the clues any one of her suspects could be guilty nancy had laid out all her notes and papers on her desk waiting for something to strike her some pattern shed overlooked a sheet of paper drifted to the floor and caught her eye bending to retrieve it nancy saw that it was the funny version of walter friedbinders biography that victor had concocted she picked up the original biography and compared the two it was amazing how easily he had turned a serious press release into a joke as her eyes flicked from one version to the other it occurred to her that friedbinders real biography was pretty amazing in itself he had received both a masters degree and a doctorate in his first five years after college and taught at the same time wow nancy said softly thats pretty impressive after getting his doctorate friedbinder had become dean of students at a small private school while there he had increased both the percentage of graduates going on to fouryear colleges and the number of acceptances at highly prestigious colleges no wonder lane and the other trustees decided to offer friedbinder the job of headmaster at brewster many people thought the best indication of a schools success was the list of colleges its graduates attended a private school that wasnt seen as successful would stop attracting students and eventually go broke so friedbinders obvious skill in that area must have been an important plus at least in the eyes of the board nancy noticed the title of friedbinders phd dissertation the development of creative problemsolving skills the press release said hed gotten it published the dissertation sounded as if it might help nancy in her work so she decided to ask him about borrowing a copy nancy saw friedbinder at eightthirty on monday morning in the school hallway his manner was brusque and businesslike i need to speak to you privately ms stevens right away he said as she followed him into his office nancy wondered why she had become ms stevens instead of nancy she soon found out when i came in this morning said the headmaster rustling through the papers on his desk i found this note in my mailbox he held it up what does it say asked nancy ill read it to you word for word friedbinder replied he took a pair of glasses from his coat pocket adjusted them on his nose and read good grades are big business at brewster and the people raking in the dough let a computer do their dirty work want your grade changed talk to victor paredes and nancy stevens chapter nine the first thing nancy noted was the use of her alias nancy stevens whoever wrote the note probably wasnt the same person who had sent her the threatening message on friday the next thing that struck her was that the note concerned grade changing its author knew about the scam thats very interesting nancy said taking a seat do you mind if i have a look at it walter friedbinder passed it to her the accusing message was printed in blue felttip ink on ordinary lined looseleaf paper the large block letters indicated to nancy that the writer had apparently tried to disguise his or her handwriting nancy noticed one peculiarity though the small letter k had a closed loop for the upper arm so that it looked like a small capital r with a line sticking up from it nancy was sure she would recognize it if she came across it again well friedbinder said i thought you were going to solve this case now youre being accused of the crime whats going on nancy looked up hmm oh i have a pretty good idea who wrote this and why the interesting part is that victor and i are accused of grade changing and not of say writing graffiti in the halls or selling test answers what do you mean asked the headmaster this person knows about the gradechanging scam she explained maybe he or she has been approached by the culprit what about victor paredes im watching him said nancy but i dont have enough evidence to accuse him i dont think the person who wrote this does either this is the work of a jealous girlfriend friedbinder seemed to accept this and his manner relaxed somewhat the nine oclock bell sounded in the corridor outside nancy stood up i have a student in a few minutes she said will you excuse me of course friedbinder replied and please forgive me this whole business has made me tense she was in the doorway when she remembered to ask him for a copy of his published dissertation im sorry he replied i have only one copy of it and it must be in one of the cartons of books i havent unpacked yet in any case its pretty dry stuff as she walked upstairs to the learning lab nancy had a lot to think about why had he been so worried about the letter the idea of her being involved was ridiculous he had to know that he was probably so worried about the effects of a scandal that he wasnt thinking clearly as for the notes author nancy knew of only one person who would want to make trouble for her and victor and that was kim but why had kim assuming she was the one accused them of grade changing she must know that someone at brewster really was changing peoples grades for money kim didnt seem to have the computer knowhow to be in on the scheme but had she received an email message from the gradechanger or heard rumors from students who had and what about the fact that the note accused victor was that pure spite or a shrewd guess victor was after all one of nancys suspects did kim know that he was involved and if so how nancy shook her head too many questions and no answers she unlocked the learning lab and checked her watch there were still a few minutes before her student was to arrive after dumping her things on a chair she went to her desk to make a phone call mr lane she said when she was put through nancy i was just going to call you the banker said a deposit of five hundred dollars was made to the account after four on friday afternoon my immediate staff had gone home so i wasnt told about it until this morning nancy whistled so if i wynn hasnt already withdrawn his money he should start withdrawing the cash today can you arrange for me to be notified here at school as soon as theres any activity in the account i imagine i can lane replied youll have to move quickly though ill buy you as much time as possible by placing a special hold and recheck command on the account number as well as the slowdown weve already put in place thanks said nancy if im lucky he or she will go to the ivy avenue branch which is the one closest to the school there was a tap on the door nancy finished her call and went to answer it victor was standing there looking glum hi partner he said how do you like a life of crime what are you talking about nancy asked and what are you doing here i switched appointments with margie adams he said and if you dont know what im talking about you will as soon as dr f gets hold of you i just came from a grilling in his office i thought i explained everything to him that letter really shook him up i cant believe he called you to his office youd better come in she said to victor pulling him into the learning lab victor sprawled in the chair next to the computer terminal as nancy sat at the desk he gave her a shrewd look so you do know about it he said i thought so youre talking about the anonymous letter right nancy asked anonymous he said with a loud snort kim did everything but staple her photo to the top and put her thumbprint in the lower corner i figured it had to be her nancy said nodding listen ive known kim since eighth grade and ive never met anyone else who makes those funny ks isnt that proof that depends nancy replied not if lots of people know she writes that way victor stared at her then laughed hey he said youd make a great detective nancy studied his face had that been an innocent remark or had victor somehow penetrated her cover did he know her name was really nancy drew she decided not to respond directly to his comment why should kim or anyone else for that matter accuse us of changing peoples grades for money she asked well he answered in an embarrassed voice i guess its my fault one time when kim and i were going out together we were talking about how broke we both were i said i knew how to make a lot of money by offering to change peoples school transcripts victor you didnt nancy exclaimed his cheeks turned pink i was just goofing around he protested i could have said lets hold up a bank or something instead i didnt mean it but i guess kim didnt know that no i guess not nancy fell silent could she believe victor he was acting uncomfortable was it simply because he knew his comment might be misunderstood or was this a sort of doublewhammy in which he gave away something embarrassing but harmless in order to convince her that he was being completely open i just told this to mr friedbinder victor added but i couldnt tell if he believed me i hope he did i hear colleges pay a lot of attention to your headmasters letter of recommendation and if he shoots me down im dead nancy realized the conversation was starting to get a little too personal she was supposed to be tutoring victor after all why dont we see about bringing up your marks in english she said brusquely reaching for her stack of books and let mr friedbinder worry about what he says in his letter okay stu victor grinned sure thing teach after twenty minutes of solid work nancy said nice going keep this up and i dont think youll have any more problems victor stretched his arms and yawned thanks he replied but i cant help thinking that a lot of what youre doing could be done by a computer not the really creative part of course but all those drills you should talk to mr friedbinder about that nancy told him he wrote a doctoral dissertation on creative problem solving it was even published i wanted to read it but his only copy is packed away really asked victor i bet i could find you another copy somewhere lets see he leaned over and switched on the terminal then entered a series of commands separated by pauses im logging onto an interactive database he explained one of the things it has is a directory of published dissertations in different university libraries do you remember the title and the name of the school nancy told him and he typed in the information after a short while he entered some more commands then still others finally he sat back nope he said no good there is one dissertation that sounds kind of similar but its by someone else at a different school i guess youll have to wait until friedbinder unpacks his copy of it suddenly the phone rang harrison lane was on the other end right now at the ivy avenue branch youd better thanks so long said nancy not waiting for him to finish grabbing her coat she ran for the door whats the matter nancy victor called after her uh nothing victor tell anyone after you that i had an emergency had to go without another word nancy tore down the hallway and out to her car in the parking lot nancy reached the bank in a recordbreaking five minutes she parked right in front and jumped out of the car her heart thumped hard in her chest there coming out of the bank was a petite teenage girl with long almost black hair she fit the description of i wynn exactly the girl raised her head and her face went white when she made eye contact with nancy that gave nancy a good look at her face it was kim she was wearing a wig but nancy recognized her anyway stop nancy cried as kim bolted for a red car parked down the street chapter ten sprinting to her car kim jumped in and turned the key to rev the engine with a squeal of rubber the red car roared away from the curb and tore down the street nancy didnt hesitate she jumped into her mustang and broke her own personal record for getting under way soon she spotted the car several blocks ahead it was turning left onto a side street nancy followed as fast as the law allowed at the side street she made a racing turn and sped down the winding treelined avenue the red car still far ahead of her nancy pressed down on the accelerator her blue mustang responded instantly and the gap began to narrow they were heading into sally lanes posh neighborhood the street went down a little hill and curved to the left before straightening out as nancy came out of the curve she muttered oh rats the street was empty as far as she could see somehow kim had given her the slip nancy braked to a screeching halt the car couldnt have gotten that far ahead in the few seconds it was out of sight it must have turned into one of the driveways she began to move again at little more than walking pace pausing to peer up each driveway at the fifth one she got lucky she could just see the back fender of a red car sticking out from behind a trellis of vines she pulled over and parked just beyond the driveway the redbrick house was very large with white shutters and was set well back from the street matching oak trees flanked the brick walk that led to the front door nancy walked up to the door the name engraved on the brass door knocker was archibald hadnt sally told her kims last name was foster or forster yes that was it nancy pressed the motherofpearl bell to the right of the door after a few moments a middleaged woman with gray hair wearing a navy blue dress and two strings of pearls opened the door if its the junior league raffle she began im afraid ive already nancy smiled politely and said no maam im looking for kim the woman raised her eyebrows kim oh yes of course you must be one of her school friends its around the back dear over the garage nancy thanked her and went in the direction the woman had indicated at the back of the house separated from it by a high hedge was a twostory brick garage with spaces for four cars a wooden staircase led up to a secondstory door on one side nancy climbed the stairs and knocked no one answered but nancy was sure she heard someone stirring inside she knocked again louder then called out kim i have to talk to you there were more rustling sounds then the door swung open kim stood there obviously defeated the black wig in her hands come on in she said before mrs archibald hears you nancy followed her into a small but comfortable living room on a table between two windows was a large photo in a silver frame the picture showed a younger and happier kim seated between a man in a dark suit and a woman in a black dress apparently her parents were the housekeepers for the archibalds seeing where nancys attention was focused kim rushed over and turned the photo facedown on the table why dont you stay out of my life she cried im afraid i cant nancy told her kim what were you doing at the bank just what you said kim shot back hotly why cant you leave me alone what i said nancy echoed very confused i havent kept a single penny of it for myself and you both know it kim continued nancy simply stared at the girl what was she talking about kim listen to me nancy said im a detective whoever you think i am youre wrong my real name is nancy drew the reason im at brewster is that someone on the board of trustees asked me to find out who is responsible for the gradechanging racket and im pretty sure you can help me oh suure kim replied rolling her eyes this is a test right to see if i can be trusted dont worry ill live up to my end of the bargain with that she collapsed into a chair and began crying bitterly nancy waited until kim calmed down and straightened in the chair wiping the back of her hand across her cheeks i guess thats it huh kim told her now youll lower my gradepoint average just the way you said you would if anything went wrong i can kiss college goodbye nancy went over and held kim by the shoulders listen to me i am not the person responsible for this i swear youve got to tell me whats going on kim its the only way i can help you kim stared up into nancys eyes are you for real she finally asked nancy nodded i was so sure you had to be involved i just couldnt see victor running this on his own kim continued he loves fooling around with the school computer and getting it to do weird tricks but once hes figured something out he gets bored and goes on to something else he couldnt be bothered to do the same thing over and over not even for money so i figured he had to have a partner then you showed up and i was sure if victor did have a partner it would be someone at the school nancy pointed out perching on the edge of the sofa but ive only just started there and this gradechanger has been operating for almost two weeks besides what makes you so sure victors involved kim stared down at her lap and said so softly that nancy had to lean in closer to hear he told me so he said that hed changed someones grades he pretended to feel really bad about it but now i can see that was just a puton if hed meant it he wouldnt have kept doing it and he wouldnt have forced me to get involved nancys breath caught in her throat why did you write that note to the headmaster she asked after a pause it was you wasnt it sure i was furious at you and victor for what you were doing to me kim replied her pale blue eyes flashing i wanted to get you in as much trouble as i could without getting myself in hot water it didnt work did it it might have nancy told her except that mr friedbinder knows who i am and why im at brewster how did you get involved in this racket there was a message in my email kim explained whoever sent it knew i couldnt afford to pay to have my grades changed but he said i could improve my transcript if i ran a few errands he also said that if i didnt agree my transcript could end up looking a lot worse than it really is so i opened the account wearing this dumb wig and he tells me when to pick up the money why didnt you go straight to the headmaster and tell him about it nancy asked kim shook her head sharply i couldnt bring myself to turn victor in im really hung up on the guy victors not the only one who could be responsible nancy told kim if im going to catch the culprit i need to know how the money transfer works i know you have a bank card for that account but how do you know when to use it and what happens to the cash i get an email message kim replied in code if it says m five i know i should withdraw five hundred dollars on monday t ten means one thousand dollars on tuesday and so on its usually after or before school but today the message said to go at lunchtime im missing math right now how do you deliver the money nancy asked i put the bills in a brown envelope and leave it in one of the faculty mailboxes before school what nancy exclaimed straightening up which one kim shrugged its not labeled its on the bottom row on the side near the door nancy frowned and stared into space then she said im going to need your help to put the person behind this out of business how about it kim nodded hesitantly great nancy continued now heres what i have in mind i want you to deliver the money you picked up today you do said kim incredulously yes i do nancy replied and then i want you to stay home from school for the next two days think you can play sick for that long no problem kim said no problem at all at eight fortyfive the next morning nancy was standing near the coffee urn in the faculty lounge paging through a news magazine she glanced up just as kim came in stuck a brown envelope into a mailbox on the bottom row and scurried out more and more teachers were drifting in checking their mailboxes and getting coffee each time one of them blocked nancys view of the mailboxes her anxiety level soared she longed to move closer but she didnt dare the person behind the racket knew nancys real reason for being at brewster the threatening message in her email proved that if she was seen too near the mailboxes the culprit would sense a trap and leave the envelope with the money where it was nancy straightened up and felt her pulse beat faster dana has just walked into the room and paused near the mailboxes was this the pickup but then she turned and headed straight for the coffee urn the envelope was still in place hi nancy dana greeted her how are you getting along with the computer system so far so good nancy replied youre here early is there a problem dana smiled no no not this time i have an appointment near here in a little while and i thought id stop by to make sure the computer beast is behaving itself nancy smiled back distractedly she was very aware that dana was blocking her view of the mailboxes she made a halfstep to the right but dana moved in the same direction and began asking her about tutoring she wanted to know if nancy had thought of using the computer system if she could have nancy would have pushed dana aside she had to see that mailbox slowly nancy angled to the left again dana adjusted her position so that she was blocking nancys view this is unbelievable nancy said to herself was dana moving on purpose it didnt seem so because she kept talking excitedly about the applications of the computer in tutoring nancy was about to explain that she wasnt in charge of the program when friedbinder entered and paused to survey the room when he saw dana and nancy together he scowled and turned his back on them a moment later phyllis came in she too noticed dana and nancy she gave nancy a quick nod then turned to victor who had appeared at the door to speak with her dana her back to the door missed all this as the nine oclock bell rang she said oh dear id better run well talk again about coming up with an interactive approach to tutoring i really think its the way to go heading for the door nancy looked at the mailboxes and drew in a quick breath the brown envelope was gone chapter eleven nancy continued in the direction of the door fighting down an impulse to break into a run how could she have let someone make off with the envelope right under her nose pausing outside the door nancy peered up and down the hall to her left she saw a girl in jeans and a tshirt with books under her arm to her right was phyllis hathaway just going into the administration offices she was too far away to see if she had anything in her hand the trap had failed that was obvious the question was why was it an accident that dana had blocked nancys view at the crucial moment or had she done it on purpose if it had been a coincidence then it was just a piece of bad luck if not it meant that dana and phyllis were guilty and that they knew nancy was trying to trap them the only way they could have known that was if kim had told them nancy shook her head stop jumping to conclusions drew she told herself walter friedbinder and victor had also been near the mailboxes either of them could have made off with the envelope too she would simply have to come up with a new plan for trapping the guilty party hi there someone called nancy turned and saw randi coming down the hall toward her i looked for you yesterday randi continued i still want to do that interview are you free at noon nancy decided it was time to be direct randi yesterday you called me nancy drew how did you know my name she watched randis face carefully the threatening message had been sent from one of the terminals in the newspaper office after all that fact alone put randi in a very select group of potential suspects randi rolled her eyes oh come on its not such a big deal i was just goofing on you yesterday can you blame me after that art show story you gave me of course i know who you are im a journalist right i read the river heights papers every day ive seen your name and picture have you told this to anyone else asked nancy no replied randi a good journalist doesnt go around blabbing about her biggest story before shes even written it so tell me what are you really doing here i cant tell you but i will when its over nancy promised as long as you keep quiet about it now deal randi agreed nancy groaned inwardly as she walked away a reporter on the trail of a hot scoop was the last thing she needed she just hoped randi kept her word for the next couple of hours nancy was too busy helping bewildered sophomores understand the mysteries of past participles to give any thought to her case when she ushered her last student out the door she returned to her desk to do some quiet thinking could she eliminate randi as a suspect she was inclined to say yes yet one thing still bothered her randi had been the only one near the newspaper office when the threatening message was sent hey i can practically see the wheels going around victor said interrupting her thoughts he was standing in the doorway grinning at her do you know you have steam coming out of your ears nancy gave a laugh hi victor she said in a tone of resignation wow what enthusiasm he replied falling into the chair across from her you looked a lot more lively when i saw you down in the faculty lounge maybe you need to drink more coffee maybe i need to do less tutoring retorted nancy by the way what were you doing in the faculty lounge uhoh shes starting to pull rank on me he teased i had a right to be there i was picking up something for one of my teachers nancy sat up straighter oh what for whom he opened his eyes wide for whom he repeated golly if i keep hanging around with you can i learn to talk like that or am i a hopeless case youre the one who said it not me nancy replied with mock sternness but seriously how about answering my question about the package sure mr parley my physics teacher ordered some reprints of an article and he asked me to get them from his mailbox and bring them to the lab for him why victors story could easily be checked so easily that nancy doubted he would have told it if it werent true still that didnt mean that the reprints were the only thing he had picked up in the mailroom you didnt notice a brown envelope about this big did you she asked indicating the size with her hands someone was supposed to leave it for me but it hasnt turned up nope he replied shaking his head but i wasnt really paying attention i was too busy plotting my next exploit nancy raised an eyebrow and whats that just imagine he said leaning closer tomorrow morning at the beginning of first period a cartoon of the headmasters face appears on the screen of every terminal in the school victor nancy began he held up his hand wait im not done the eyes look one way then the other then just when everybody is getting spooked he puts his thumbs in his ears wiggles his fingers sticks out his tongue and makes a really rude noise nancy laughed in spite of herself you wont really do it will you she asked youd get yourself expelled i know he said with a sigh i have to face it im chicken nancy sat back and studied him a moment she couldnt think of anyone who made her laugh as often as victor did she was growing to like him and had to admit that she found him very attractive but if he was guilty nancy couldnt afford to be blinded by his charm shed been hoping not to have to wade through stacks of paper records but now she could see shed have to do it obviously she couldnt crosscheck everyones records with four hundred students at brewster each taking five courses a year and being graded four times in each course that would make eight thousand data points to check but she could start by crosschecking victors and kims grades those of her tutoring students and then a few other students at random making an excuse to victor nancy went downstairs to the school office hi ms arletti she said to the secretary is the headmaster free in response walter friedbinder appeared in his office door and said hello nancy what can i do for you nancy explained that she wanted to check the school records of some students against their teachers grade rosters id like the files on victor paredes kim forster and a few others victor paredes huh said friedbinder his name keeps coming up doesnt it his record and kims are on the computer you can use the one here in the corner but digging out the grade rosters is another matter they should be in the file room shouldnt they ms arletti he gestured to a door behind the secretarys desk thats right ms arletti replied but theyre in a locked file cabinet along with other confidential papers it might take me a while to hunt up the key why dont you come back after lunch the headmaster suggested ill make sure were ready for you by then heres a key to the outer door in case im out ms arletti added ill put the file cabinet key in an envelope with your name on it and leave it here on my desk thanks nancy told her as she turned to go she noticed the door to phyllis hathaways office was slightly ajar was she inside listening nancy went back to the learning lab and worked for twenty minutes but soon her impatience got the better of her surely ms arletti must have found the file cabinet key by now nancy didnt want to wait until after lunch downstairs the office door was locked nancy found the key she had been given and went in the envelope with her name was right where ms arletti had said it would be nancy took it went into the file room and turned on the overhead light the room was lined with a dozen gray fourdrawer file cabinets and some shelves piled high with papers nancy realized that she had no idea which one she wanted was she going to have to try the key in each of them one by one then she gave a little snort of laughter there was no point in trying the key unless the cabinet was locked she tried the top drawer of the nearest cabinet it opened easily she shut it and tried the next which also opened she kept going until on the fifth try she found one that didnt open maybe this was the one she tore open the envelope and took out the little key she was about to fit it in the lock when a noise caught her attention the sound of footsteps retreating down the hall outside the office someone was running away from the office then came a whoof a yellow glare suddenly filled the room nancy whirled and gasped in terror flames were shooting up from all around the open doorway charring the paint on the doorframe in a flash the flames swooped across the floor setting stacks of papers on fire already the doorway was completely blocked and the flames were advancing toward nancy her body tensed as she frantically searched the small windowless room she was trapped chapter twelve the tiny room was filling with black acrid smoke nancys eyes were stinging and when she tried to take in a breath the overheated air seared her lungs struggling to remain calm she buried her nose and mouth in the crook of her elbow and got down on the floor the air was a little cooler and less smoky down there but she knew that wouldnt last if she didnt find a way out and very quickly she was going to die somewhere outside a fire bell was clamoring help was probably on its way by now but she doubted it could arrive in time to save her should she try to run through the flames she shivered with horror at the idea there was no way to do that without being burned but at least she would have a chance by staying in the file room she had no chance at all why wasnt the sprinkler system working nancy raised her eyes to the ceiling and spotted the manual turnon valve she didnt hesitate or even take a moment to think or plan drawing in a deep breath nancy held it and sprang to her feet under the turnon valve was a tall steel bookcase nancy hurled some of the books onto the floor her chest felt as though a loop of barbed wire were tightening around it she began climbing the bookcase the hot metal of the shelves seared her hands but she ignored the pain it was happening to someone else in a distant place the higher she got the thicker the suffocating smoke became finally teetering on the top of the case her foot braced against a lower shelf nancy reached up to the sprinkler valve come on come on she thought desperately as the stubborn valve refused to move a glob of purple darkness floated in front of nancys eyes a deep nausea rose up inside her nancy you cant pass out she urged herself hang in there with a last desperate twist nancy gave the valve all she had suddenly bursts of water sprayed down from the small sprinkler heads mounted in the ceiling in minutes the flames were dying and nancy could see the doorway clearly coughing and feeling sick she staggered across the smoky office collapsing into the arms of a helmeted firefighter who was just arriving when nancy opened her eyes the first thing she saw was a clear sky dotted with fluffy white clouds she blinked then turned her head she was lying on a stretcher in the school parking lot just outside the open door of an ambulance on one side of her was an alert paramedic with an oxygen tank in his hand on the other was victor more serious than she had ever seen him am i okay she croaked in a husky voice that surprised her the fires out i was going to ask you that victor replied and dont worry about the fire you had it out so fast theyre going to make us go back to class soon nancy sent questioning messages to various parts of her body once she had received the answers she told him my hands hurt and it aches when i breathe everything else seems to be all right well be taking you to the hospital in a few minutes for examination and treatment the paramedic said do you feel up to answering a few questions from the fire marshal before we go sure nancy started to sit up then thought better of it when the parking lot started swirling around her she would have to stay lying down for now the fire marshal was a man of about fifty with a deeply lined face and kind brown eyes he squatted down next to the stretcher and asked her to tell him what had happened then it was you who turned on the sprinklers that was quick thinking young lady that probably saved your life as well as kept the fire from doing serious damage were not sure yet why the heat sensors in the sprinkler system failed brewster may be in for some heavy fines for having faulty safety equipment it was arson wasnt it nancy said in a low voice what makes you say that the fire official asked her frowning the way it started all at once and spread across the floor nancy replied it seemed to flow and to me that sounds like some kind of liquid was burning not just a bunch of old papers we dont know what else may have been stored in that room the fire marshal said were looking into that now thanks for your help ms stevens if i have any more questions ill be in touch with you okay bill he added straightening up and turning to one of the paramedics a few moments later nancys stretcher was secured inside the ambulance and the vehicle sped away her father was already at the hospital when nancy arrived so was harrison lane they joined her in her examining room after she and the paramedic assured them that she was basically in good shape lane said sally called and told me what happened i called your father nancy i feel terrible that i put you in such danger i never expected anything like this i want you to drop this investigation not yet nancy told him shaking her head i beg you the banker continued if there has to be a scandal at brewster so be it well live it down somehow at least we wont be putting you in further jeopardy nancy shook her head again i told you you were wasting your time carson drew said to lane once shes made up her mind its impossible to talk her out of it i cant give up now nancy insisted she paused while a doctor examined the burns on her hands and put a soothing ointment on them as he began to wrap them loosely with gauze nancy continued the reason the file room was torched is that im getting close to a solution to the case too close for somebody but i dont think that i was meant to be trapped like that if i had gone to the file room when i said i was going to i would have found the fire department on the scene and the file room already gutted but i was impatient to check something so i went early her father gave her a sharp look then you think the person who set the fire is someone who knew when you were planning to go to the file room there cant be too many people like that nancy thought a moment who did know she would be there there was friedbinder and ms arletti phyllis hathaway might have been in her office and overheard nancy asking to check the files it was possible a student had been in the office with her at the time and she recalled she had suggested to victor that someone might think to check the grade rosters thats a strong possibility she said of course the fires timing could have been a coincidence the fire could even have been an accident you can rule out that possibility lane told her frowning i spoke to the fire marshal a few minutes ago and he told me unofficially that hes planning to list it as arson theres also strong evidence that someone tampered with the sprinkler system so it wouldnt go off as it should have isnt there anything i can say to persuade you to give up this case nancy nancy managed a grin you could tell me youve found the gradechanger other than that i cant think of a thing that would make me quit now fortyfive minutes later nancy was released from the hospital she talked her father into driving her back to brewster i have to get back there dad she coaxed the gradechanger is getting scared the arson proves that who knows what he or she is up to at this very moment probably scrambling like crazy to cover up this scam in any way possible i wynn could disappear altogether if i dont get to him soon okay okay carson gave in lets hear what youve got so far as they drove toward brewster nancy laid the case out for her father i havent decided that phyllis and dana are guilty yet she said after listing all the clues that pointed to the pair and i have to admit im wondering more and more about the headmaster now walter knew that i was planning to check some of the records and he knew when by the way dad she added with a grin ive figured out that dana was your client i had a feeling you would her father told her a proud gleam in his eyes a few minutes later he pulled into the brewster parking lot nancy thanked him for the ride and the emotional support and promised that shed call him to drive her home later as she walked into the school the smell of smoke made nancys stomach turn it was almost three oclock but the halls hadnt filled up yet with crowds of students going home she went straight to the office where ms arletti clucked over nancys burns her narrow escape and the mess the fire had made of her office it was a mess much of the furniture had been scorched and the carpet was soaked with chemicals from the fire extinguishers nancy swallowed twice and looked into the file room the walls and ceiling were dark with soot and a thick layer of charred watersoaked papers and books covered the floor but the file cabinet appeared to have suffered little more than scorched paint one of the maintenance staff will be in to clean out all that rubbish ms arletti explained with any luck well be back to normal by tomorrow thank goodness the computer system wasnt damaged if we lose that we might as well close the school i hate to bother you said nancy but it doesnt seem as if the grade rosters were burned could i look through them ms arletti sighed youre a determined young woman arent you go ahead nancy opened one of the cabinet drawers and found kim victor and sallys files she winced from the pain as she grabbed them balancing them gingerly in her arms then she took another small stack of student files at random thanks she told ms arletti as she left the office ill return this stuff tomorrow wanting a place to sit down and go over her materials nancy went upstairs to the learning lab before opening the files she decided to check her email three messages were waiting for her all of them amounted to getwell notes one each from walter friedbinder and phyllis hathaway and the third from victor who added an invitation to join him for a hot fudge sundae at the roost nancy smiled to herself and started to compose an answer then she noticed a flashing box appear in the upper corner of the screen another piece of email was arriving for her the password of the sender was iw chapter thirteen nancy instructed the system to print the message on the screen you got away this time next time you wont be so lucky get out of here while you still can this is your last warning controlling her reaction of shock and rage nancy quickly saved the message then told the computer to refuse it returning message to terminal appeared on the screen the message had come from the newspaper office again it had been entered on the system only seconds before nancy whirled around and dashed out the door the person who had sent the threat would have no way of guessing that nancy would read it instantly and not minutes or even hours later the chances were that he or she was still at the terminal nancy stopped running just before she reached the corridor that led to the office of the academician and began to walk softly she wanted to catch the guilty person in the act if he or she tried to leave the office before nancy got there it didnt matter she would still see the culprit at close enough range to identify him or her and that was almost as good her heart pounding nancy tiptoed up to the door it was standing ajar this was it the moment of truth she cautiously peeked in randi she was seated at the same terminal where nancy had seen her the week before her back was to the door and she was typing something on the keyboard stepping into the room nancy said more threats randi you might as well save computer time and make them in person im here now nancy randi jumped up from her chair so quickly that it fell over backward as she spun around to face the doorway you startled me the student reporter continued what are you doing here catching you redhanded nancy replied randi gave her a puzzled look it was almost convincing i dont know what youre talking about she said but i dont think i like your attitude what were you writing just now nancy demanded she pushed past randi and approached the terminal a story for the paper about the girls soccer team randi replied not that its any of your business nancy looked at the monitor and read paced by star forward lisa mongiello the team rolled over the deerfield falcons last thursday clinching their first preseason game i want to know whats going on here randi insisted either tell me right now or get out of my office about two minutes ago someone sent me a threatening message from this terminal nancy said do you have anything to say about that randis face turned red thats a dirty lie i dont know what kind of game youre playing but ive been right here working on the paper for the last halfhour and no one no one has been anywhere near this terminal except me randi seemed completely sincere but what about the message that had come from this room since she was the only one there both times nancy had received messages she was clearly implicated in the scheme or was she nancy suddenly thought of another possibility you say youve been using this terminal steadily for the last halfhour she asked in a softer tone did anything unusual happen during that time randi frowned unusual no well the computer locked up on me for a few seconds at one point but thats not so unusual it happens every day or so i keep meaning to ask someone about it what do you mean locked up nancy asked eagerly a tingle of excitement spreading through her it quits working sort of randi explained shrugging the screen blanks out the keyboard goes dead and then a few seconds later everything is back to normal listen whats going on whats all this about threats what kind of case are you working on i cant tell you now nancy replied but i think im beginning to see some of the answers i promise ill tell you everything i can when the time comes right now id better get moving i need to find victor paredes why dont you see if hes logged onto the system randi suggested she bent to set her chair upright again knowing victor he probably is unless hes asleep or in the shower sitting down in front of the terminal randi pressed some keys i was right she said after a moment hes in the computer room do you want to use my terminal to talk to him nancy didnt want her conversation with victor to be open to everyone who happened to be using the computer system no thanks ill go down there in person suit yourself randi told her ill tell him youre coming and remember im expecting to hear what this is all about otherwise ill have to start an investigation of my own just as randi had said victor was at one of the computer room terminals you look pretty good for someone who just got back from the hospital he commented how do you feel ive been too busy to tell nancy said listen i have an important question for you is it possible to send a message from one terminal in the system to another but make the system say that it came from a different terminal hmm victor leaned back in his chair and stared into space as he considered this i dont see why not he answered at last it shouldnt be that hard to program the computer to accept a message for retransmission from a different origin but youd leave a trail of course you mean a record of where the message really came from nancy demanded her blue eyes widening do you know how to find a record like that victor studied her face for a moment then nodded probably a message to whom received when nancy smiled at his halfjoking use of whom and then gave him the information he needed he busied himself at the terminal humming the refrain from a hardrock tune under his breath finally just when nancy was sure she couldnt stand to wait a second longer he pushed his chair back and said okay i got it the message was actually entered a couple of minutes earlier than it said and the real place of origin was the work station in ms hathaways office youre sure nancy exclaimed not a hundred percent sure he admitted there might be a second layer of tricks call it eighty percent good enough nancy started for the door then paused to look over her shoulder thanks victor she added youve been super youre welcome and dont forget that hot fudge sundae ms arlettis office was almost back to normal except for the lingering smell of burnt and wet wood she looked up from some work on her desk as nancy came in ms hathaway she replied to nancys question oh what a shame she just walked out this second she had an urgent phone call a few minutes ago and told me she had to leave you can probably catch her in the parking lot if you hurry thanks nancy called jogging out the door nancys car was in the visitors parking lot because she hadnt been assigned a permanent teacher space yet she climbed in wincing as her hands touched the wheel and drove around the back of the building where faculty members parked a red sedan that looked like phylliss was just pulling out into the street nancy waited a few seconds then followed the car turned right at the next corner then left a couple of blocks later nancy followed far enough back to stay unnoticed she hoped she was beginning to think she knew where phyllis was going a few minutes later her hunch was confirmed as phylliss car approached archer street the right turn signal started to blink sure enough phylliss car slowed as she reached the bank branch about halfway down the street nancy slowed too then pulled in behind a van parked on the street its bulk would help hide her car from anyone in the bank nancy watched as phyllis parked in the lot and headed for the bank while she observed her nancys attention was drawn to a dusty blue car that she knew was dana maccauleys nancy ducked down in her seat until it too pulled into the bank lot then slid over to the passenger seat and removed a small pair of binoculars from the glove compartment from there she could just see around the bulk of the van dana was pulling into a spot near phylliss car it was obvious that they had a prearranged meeting danas must have been the urgent phone call ms arletti had referred to dana called to phyllis who was waiting for her at the entrance together they continued toward the bank dana put her bank card in the door slot and the two women entered the twentyfourhour lobby nancy longed to get out of her car and move closer but she didnt dare the glass walls of the lobby made it too easy for the women to notice her nancy picked up her binoculars and peered into the window with a happy almost triumphant look on her face phyllis handed dana something it was a wad of cash chapter fourteen nancy held her breath and adjusted the focus on the binoculars that money had come from phylliss purse not the machine she couldnt tell the denomination of the bills but even if they were twenties the amount would be large dana studied the wad a moment then smiled and shook phylliss hand dana wrote out a deposit slip put the cash and the slip in an envelope and deposited the envelope in the automated teller machine nancy watched the women a while longer they seemed happy when they left the bank got into their respective cars and drove off nancys mind was racing normally two people didnt meet at a bank just to make a deposit obviously they were up to something was phyllis giving dana her cut of the illegal money when both cars were out of sight nancy got out of her car and went to a phone booth near the bank luckily she was able to reach harrison lane in his office after nancy explained what she wanted to know he took the number of the telephone she was calling from and promised to call her right back in fact it was almost ten minutes before the telephone rang im sorry to have taken so long the banker told her but i wanted to be absolutely sure of my facts what did you find nancy asked was i right was a big deposit just made into the i wynn account she held her breath and waited for his response im afraid not said lane nancys mouth fell open there wasnt no he replied im sorry but the only recent activity in that account was that withdrawal yesterday afternoon by the way i gather your little trap was a success yes and no said nancy i got answers to some questions but the big one is still a mystery if anything its more of a mystery now than ever youre positive that no one put money into that account from the archer street cash machine in the last fifteen minutes maybe your records are running a few minutes behind no im afraid not lane said once more the only activity at that cash machine in the last quarterhour was a deposit of two thousand dollars into the account of pointtech computers hmm i think thats the company that installed the system at the school pointtech she repeated suddenly an idea occurred to her thanks mr lane ill let you know if i get any closer to a solution then nancy said goodbye and hung up as she walked back to her car she tried to make sense of what she had just learned of course she thought i should have realized right away the i wynn account was just a coverup account it was only for dropoff and pickup purposes the money was actually going into the pointtech account it was the perfect cover yet there had been no activity in the i wynn account at all maybe the two thousand dollars represented most of the cash students had paid till then nancy was distracted from her thoughts as she felt her hands throbbing it was time to put more anesthetic cream on them so she started up her car and drove home hoping her dad wasnt mad because she hadnt called him hannah that pot roast was delicious said nancy pushing her empty plate away from her it turned out that carson drew had had to work late anyway so nancy and hannah ate a dinner of pot roast potatoes and broccoli alone i couldnt eat another bite the housekeeper raised her eyebrows a teasing glint in her eyes as she said i guess that means you wont be having any of my chocolatechip cookies bite your tongue nancy exclaimed you know i can always find room for a cookie hannah she got up and began helping hannah clear the table but the housekeeper waved her away ill get it dear you need to give those poor hands a rest thanks hannah she gave hannah a quick hug after grabbing a couple of cookies and went up to her room stretching out on her bed nancy simply let her mind wander in the past shed discovered that sometimes confusing clues made sense when she did this she began to drift off to sleep images from the case swimming through her mind one face continued to reappear that of walter friedbinder walter friedbinder standing next to the faculty mailboxes walter friedbinder making plans to check the filing cabinets walter friedbinder reacting to the note kim had left him and nancy thought he knew her real last name shed noted his odd behavior on several occasions but shed been so busy concentrating on dana and phyllis and victor that she hadnt actively investigated the headmaster nancy suddenly came fully awake and sat up in her bed she got up and went to her desk for friedbinders biography then she began dialing the universities that he said hed attended it was late though and she wasnt able to get through to any of the offices shed have to wait until the morning to check on friedbinders background story propping her elbows on her desk nancy rested her chin in her palms she could be wrong about friedbinder after all kim was the only suspect shed ruled out so far she headed downstairs her mind still on the case but the sound of the doorbell interrupted her thoughts nancy opened the door to find herself facetoface with victor hi he said a little nervously i hope you dont mind but i looked up your address in the phone book an alarm went off in nancys brain in order to look up her address victor had to know her last name her real last name is that so she asked how did you know where to look kim told me who you really are victors tone was flat the sparkle in his amber eyes and his easy grin were gone he was pale and seemed anxious id like to talk to you he said want to take a drive its kind of important okay nancy agreed grabbing her denim jacket from the hall closet she called to hannah to let her know where she was going come on she said pulling the door closed behind them they climbed into victors beatup car and began to drive the night had grown foggy and the streetlights gave only a hazy dim glow occasionally victor flipped on his wipers to brush the mist from the windshield for five full minutes neither of them said a word then pulling to a stop at the curb of a residential street victor turned to her so youre the famous nancy drew he said i guess im the guy youre after huh nancy shot victor a quick look what was he saying was this an admission that he was the gradechanger i dont know she hedged are you dont play games with me victor said a rough edge in his voice i know changing phils grade wasnt right but id do it again why dont you just tell me how it all started she said carefully nancy didnt want to reveal that she didnt know about phil or even who he was ill just hear victor out she decided thats simple victor replied about a year ago a guy whos been a close friend of mine since we were kids told me he was in big trouble hes an ace basketball player and a couple of good universities had their eye on him but he had flubbed one of his courses during fall semester he was afraid that they were about to put him on academic probation right before basketball season started hed be bumped from the varsity and lose his chance at a scholarship so he asked you to change his grade nancy suggested victor shook his head not a chance he never even knew it was all my idea i did a good job too i didnt dare change that d hed gotten it would have been too easy to spot so instead i eased his other grades up just enough to bring his average above the danger line i see nancy said and once you found out how easy it was you decided to keep doing it only for money victor stared at her blankly for a moment before asking is that whats going on his amber eyes grew wide with surprise i figured you were trying to find out who changed my pals grades i thought friedbinder had noticed it and put you on the case boy do i feel dumb what youre investigating is much bigger isnt it well i can tell you for sure that its not me i dont care if you believe me or not its the truth i fiddled with my friends record one time afterward i swore id never do anything like that again and i havent nancy didnt know what to think victors manner was very convincing but all good liars could be convincing she measured victor against what she knew about the true criminal victor could be made to fit the profile but only by making a number of unlikely assumptions she didnt see why hed tell her about his friend phil if he really was changing grades for money then there was the fact that nancys threatening messages had come from phyllis hathaways computer it would probably be pretty hard if not impossible for victor to gain access to her office and why would he bother when he had easy access to so many other terminals besides nancy had better candidates already ones who fit the pattern of facts almost perfectly i guess i blurted out my little secret when i didnt really need to victor noted are you going to tell friedbinder nancy was silent for a long moment then she said why dont you confess to him yourself victor that would probably help things go more in your favor i dont think it would be fair to penalize someone too harshly for one mistake and i suspect the people in charge at brewster will end up feeling the same way once they understand the circumstances i hope youre right victor said in a gloomy voice he turned around and started the engine then added its weird but i feel better now that you know thanks for listening id better get you home one more thing said nancy dont confess right away wait a day or so why he asked you may be confessing to a whole new set of people she told him thats all i can tell you right now victor whistled softly sounds like bigtime stuff on the drive back nancy settled into her seat and closed her eyes starting to plan her next move when she opened them she saw that they were just passing brewster academy i just saw lights in the school office she said urgently grabbing victors arm its nearly nine whod be there at this time victor pulled over to the curb cleaning people he suggested following her gaze maybe they brought somebody in to work on the fire damage maybe nancy replied but id like to check it out do you mind his answer was to drive into the school parking lot they got out of the car and walked quietly up to the front door to nancys surprise it was open i dont like this nancy muttered come on down the hallway a fan of light spilled out from the open door to the administration offices nancy led the way creeping on tiptoe and peeked inside dana maccauley and phyllis hathaway were standing in the far corner of phylliss office staring down at the screen of the computer terminal dana was shaking her head a puzzled expression on her face suddenly phyllis let out a cry of alarm dana do something quick she shouted its starting to reformat the hard disk if we cant save the file our entire plan will be ruined chapter fifteen nancys heart was pounding she was tempted to rush in and catch the two women off guard but there was one thing she had to check first victor tapped nancys arm then whispered i could probably help them out that gave nancy an idea yeah go ahead she said quietly do what you can and keep them in there for as long as possible victor nodded giving her the thumbsup sign nancy stepped back as victor sauntered into phylliss office hey ladies whats the problem she heard him say in his most upbeat voice i saw lights and came to investigate dont want anyone burglarizing my school boy am i glad youre here dana exclaimed sit down and see what you can do with this from the hallway nancy watched as victor sat in front of the computer and began to work she waited until they were all staring at the computer screen and then stole silently through the anteroom and into friedbinders office she didnt dare turn on the light outside the security lights glistened through the foggy mist it would have to be enough light nancy tugged at the middle drawer of friedbinders desk it was locked taking a letter opener off his desk she used it to work at the lock open she silently urged it with a satisfying click the lock finally gave and nancy pulled open the drawer jackpot she murmured softly in the dim light she saw all she needed eagerly she sorted through papers there was a bit of ripped newspaper the obituary of ignatz wynn the name and address were highlighted in yellow there was also an opened letter addressed to the deceased mr wynn inside was a social security check with wynns social security number written on it nancy recalled the old woman telling her that a man had come by the house it must have been friedbinder hed been snooping around for the social security number and hed found it nancy continued to sort through the papers on a yellow legal pad she found names and friedbinders notes to himself scrawled casually across the paper sally lane read one line altogether nancy counted six more students names with numbers scribbled beside them on the top of the pad hed written a note to himself kim forster eager to go to college needs scholarship cant afford payment any use you found a use for her didnt you said nancy completely disgusted she tore the sheet off the pad of paper and stuck it in her jacket pocket then she continued to search through the drawer the next thing she found was a small notepad opening it nancy saw computer notes most of them were unintelligible to nancy but she recognized the dots squiggles asterisks and letters as being computer commands they were definitely in friedbinders handwriting here was good proof that friedbinder had a very sophisticated knowledge of computers suddenly the sound of raised voices made nancy jerk up her head mr friedbinder victor nearly shouted warning nancy what are you doing here i might ask you the same nancy heard friedbinder reply his voice full of accusation as if i didnt know shoving the notepad into her jacket pocket nancy moved quickly to the door but not quickly enough she was momentarily blinded as friedbinder entered his office and snapped on the light he stopped short when he saw her and what are you doing here he growled my job she said coolly friedbinder seemed to relax and youve done a good job too he said i see youve witnessed all three of them i should have guessed they were all in it together he was trying to pin the whole scam on phyllis dana and victor but nancy already had the proof she needed why are you here she asked trying to keep her voice neutral forgot some papers he said it was just a lucky coincidence i got here in time to see them trying to finish the job they started by setting todays fire what job is that asked nancy isnt it obvious trying to destroy evidence of their little gradechanging racket i guess they realized you were getting close friedbinder walked to his desk picked up the phone and dialed a number harrison walter here listen nancy drew and i have our gradechanger he said into the receiver can you get down here good at that moment phyllis hathaway appeared in the doorway her face livid with anger apparently shed overheard part of the conversation what are you up to now you you worm she cried nice try phyllis but it wont work said friedbinder glowering at the assistant headmaster i think you can kiss your career as an educator goodbye is that so phyllis replied well for your information thats exactly what i intend to do ive just given dana the last payment making me half owner of pointtech computers im giving you my notice that certainly explains a lot thought nancy the money changing hands the phone calls the meetings why would the records being destroyed spoil your plan nancy asked recalling what shed heard phyllis say when they came in because i couldnt resign with brewster in the middle of a total computer breakdown that would be pretty irresponsible it would look as if id done it to make work for pointtech which is not true phyllis said emphatically a major computer problem would delay my leaving by months thats almost convincing friedbinder sneered you and your partners dont fool me first dana saddled brewster with an overelaborate and faulty computer system that was bad enough but now this gradechanging plan is your greed limitless nancy observed friedbinder carefully he was as tense as a tiger ready to spring his icy blue eyes were fixed menacingly on phyllis he was hardly the controlled headmaster one would expect dana and victor walked into the room we havent done anything wrong dana insisted i sold brewster a fine computer at a fair price anyone in the business will say the same and if you are implying that we are involved in some gradechanging which i just overheard youre insane then what are you doing here now after school hours friedbinder asked phyllis stepped forward there was a message on my answering machine saying that someone was going to sabotage the computer system this evening i thought it was probably a crank call but i couldnt take the chance that it wasnt on the level i collected dana and we came right over just in time to see the hard disk erase itself said nancy mr friedbinder i think you have some explaining to do what he cried i i youre in on this too he sputtered you know thats a lie said nancy facing friedbinder squarely just then a breathless harrison lane rushed into the office what on earth is happening here he asked ms drew seems to have lost her mind completely said friedbinder either that or these three have induced her to join their sordid scheme turning to nancy lane asked what is he saying hes upset because ive accused him of being the phantom gradechanger nancy told him her eyes still on the headmaster which he is what cried harrison lane you cant prove anything friedbinder said at the same time those records are completely lost erased no not really said dana at the end of each workday the contents of the computers hard disk are automatically copied into a highcapacity tape cartridge that way no matter what happens you cant lose more than one days work im surprised at you walter obviously you didnt finish reading the users manual i provided would those include a record of when and from where the command to erase the hard disk was entered nancy asked dana smiled yes they would i bet i can access those files right now said victor leaving the room i find this hard to believe lane put in why would a man in walters position do such a thing greed nancy suggested ill sue you friedbinder shouted youd better watch your step ms drew victor returned to the office i wont be able to get those records tonight itll take too long thats because theres nothing to get said friedbinder you have nothing on me i wouldnt call these nothing said nancy pulling the yellow sheet of paper the newspaper clipping and the pad of computer notes from her pocket sally lane one thousand dollars all the color drained from walter friedbinders face as nancy read the list of students and the amounts hed gotten from each of them where did you get that he sputtered his face purple without waiting for an answer he lunged toward nancy nancy was ready for him but before he reached her victor butted his shoulder into the headmasters chest friedbinder went flying backward and landed on the floor harrison lane examined nancys evidence i dont think well be needing computer records he said youll be hearing from the boards lawyer in the morning this is an outrage cried friedbinder climbing to his feet no fraud arson extortion those are outrages replied lane friedbinder flashed a furious gaze at nancy i was on easy street he said puffing his chest out arrogantly i had those kids so scared i knew theyd never tell anyone what was going on and who would they blab to anyway me thats who he let out a short disdainful laugh everything was going great until you came along his face red he sneered if id had my way you would have died in that fire nancy drew i planned to set it before you showed up when i heard you go in early i figured i might as well get you and the evidence out of the way at once it was easy to pour that gasoline around the door without your hearing you were so involved you mean you were trying to kill nancy victor gasped grabbing the headmasters right arm he twisted it behind his back as if to ensure he wouldnt try to make a run for it dont worry victor nancy told him friedbinders not going anywhere for a long long time chapter sixteen at lunchtime the next day nancy walked into phyllis hathaways office phyllis dana and victor had been working there all morning trying to retrieve the schools erased files here she is now our heroine cried phyllis nancy had dropped her tutorial look and was wearing jeans and a large soft cowlneck sweater of deep blue nancy laughed im just here to wrap up a couple of loose ends and to say goodbye you should be proud of us teach said victor we managed to save all the computer files while we were at it we did some investigating of our own guess what weve discovered dana added walter was transmitting messages from his terminal routing them to a midpoint terminal sometimes two midpoint terminals and then sending them to their final destination so i was right thats why the messages seemed to be coming from the newspaper room said nancy well guess what i found out this morning nancy told them leaning against phylliss desk i called all three colleges mentioned in his resume not one of them has ever heard of walter friedbinder hes a complete fraud never even graduated from college then i called the last school where he was headmaster i told the new headmaster what had been going on and he began going through their files guess why he had such a great reputation for bringing up the schools academic performance he electronically doctored students records phyllis guessed yep nancy replied apparently the one thing he didnt make up was his ability with computers though we may never know how he got to be such a whiz harrison lane told me that hes organizing a classaction suit against friedbinder to get all the students reimbursed said phyllis the board of trustees is suing him for fraud plus hell probably be indicted for arson and attempted murder id say hes in for a whole lot of trouble dana chuckled softly couldnt happen to a nicer guy she patted her computer adding all the students grades are back to what they were thanks to pointtechs brilliant backup system speaking of pointtech nancy said to phyllis are you still joining the company you know brewster will probably ask you to be their head now theyll have to ask someone else phyllis told her it was a big step for me but now that ive made it i cant go back im leaving brewster at the end of the month nancy got up well good luck i have to go now i just wanted to say goodbye victors eyes locked with hers ill walk you to your car he said getting to his feet and grabbing his jacket they walked out the front door of the school it was a warm day the thermometer had climbed into the low sixties and a warm breeze rustled the vividly colored leaves on brewsters campus did you tell phyllis what you told me last night about changing your friends grade nancy asked him as they walked i did this morning victor replied grimacing slightly she said it wasnt fair to punish phil for something he knew nothing about then she gave me a long lecture about ethics and technology which i deserved i guess my punishment is to stay after school and work on getting those files back together until its done nancy gave him a sympathetic smile thats tedious work isnt it major tedious he agreed they walked on in silence for a little while longer until they reached nancys car opening the drivers door nancy threw her bag onto the passenger seat and climbed in behind the wheel victor leaned down resting his elbows on the open car window i hope you didnt come to say goodbye to me too nancy he said seriously i really want to see you again nancy took in his handsome face broad shoulders and beautiful eyes then she sighed victor i told you about ned i like you but victor stopped her words with a warm tender kiss on the lips victor i cant she said if it wasnt for ned suddenly victor looked under her car then checked the back seat he walked to the front of the car and checked under the hood what are you doing nancy asked with an exasperated laugh looking for ned he answered flashing her his disarming grin nancy couldnt help playing along ned isnt here she told him victors grin grew even wider thats right he said so im going to keep trying for you nancy drew
