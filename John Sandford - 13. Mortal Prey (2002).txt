the thought popped into her head as she lay in the softwashed yellowed sheets in the hospital bed the thought popped in between the gas pains and muscle spasms rough the pungent odor of alcohol swabs and if shed read the thought in a book she might have smiled at it she wasnt smiling at anything now she stared past the iv drip bag at the whitewashed plaster ceiling and tried not to groan when the pains came knowing that they would end tried not to look at the hardeyed mexicano at the end of the bed his hand never far from the pistol that lay under the newspaper on the arm of his chair tried not to think about paulo tried not to think about anything but sometimes the thoughts popped up tall wiry paulo in his ruffled tuxedo shirt his jacket on drens book father christmas sitting naked at her kitchen table with a glass of milk and a milk mustache delighted by the grumpy santa claus paulo asleep next to her his face pale and trusting in the days first light the soft light that came in over the gulf just before sunrise but the thought that might have made her smile if it was in a book was just like thefuckin godfather like this an italian restaurant called ginos with the full italiancliche stage setting sienna orange walls bottles of chianti with straw wrappers redandwhite checked tablecloths baskets of hot crusty bread as soon as you sat down the room smelling of sugar and wheat olives and peppers and black oily coffee a few rickety tables outside faced the plaza de arboles and the fifties touristcoordinated stucco church across the way san fernando de somethingorother the church belfry contained a loudspeaker that played a full slow bell version of the singing nuns dominique more or less at noon depending on whose turn it was to drop the needle on the aging vinyl bellrecord paulo took her to lunch almost every day picking her up at the hotel where she worked as a bookkeeper theyd eat mexican one day california or french the next italian twice a week he picked her up about noon so on most days she could hear near or far the recorded bells of san fernandos ginos was the favored spot despite the cliched italian stagesetting there was an actual gino cooking at ginos and the food was terrific paulo would pick her up in a black bmw il his business car with his smoothfaced business driver theyd hook up with friends eat a long caribbean lunch and laugh and argue and talk politics and cars and israel coen sat up in the choir loft at the back of the church with his rifle a scoped remington model in hed sighted it in along a dirt track west of town zeroed at exactly sixty yards the distance hed be shooting across the plaza de arboles there was no problem making the shot if all you wanted was that izzy coen make a sixtyyard shot with a scoped remington you could specify which shirt button you wanted the slug to punch through not that everything was perfect the moron whod bought the gun apparently thought that bigger was better so izzy would be shooting at sixty yards through an eightpower scope and about all he could see was a shirt button he would have preferred no magnification at all or an adjustable two to sixpower scope to give him a little room around the crosshairs but he didnt have that and would have to make do the problem with the scope was exacerbated by the humidity in the loft not only was the temperature somewhere in the s he thought but the humidity must have been percent hed sweated through his shirt at his armpits and across his chest and the sweat beaded on his cheeks and forehead and arms when he put the rifle to his cheek the scope fogged over in a matter of seconds he had a bottle of springwater with him and that helped keep his body cool enough to function but there was nothing he could do about the fogging eyepiece the shot would have to be a quick one no matter hed scouted the play for three days he knew what the conditions would be and he was ready up high with a rifle yellow vinyl kitchen gloves protecting against the inadvertent fingerprint the jeans and thin longsleeved shirt meant to guard against dna traces izzy was good hed been in the loft for an hour and ten minutes when he saw the up the first walkietalkie pushed the transmit button and asked hear me yes come now one minute ten of them had been sitting in the back ofginos the talk running down a friend leaving and then another with his new girlfriend whod been brought around for approval then paulo looked at his watch and said to rinker we better get back just a minute she said turn this way she turned his chin in her hand dipped a napkin into a glass of water and used the wet cloth to wipe a nearly invisible smear of red sauce from his lower lip i was saving that for later he protested i couldnt send you back that way she said your mother would kill me my mother he said rolling his black eyes they walked out of the italian restaurant just like the fuckin godfather and the black bmw stopped beyond the balustrade that separated the restaurants patio from the plaza they walked past an american who sat at a circular table in his hawaiian shirt and widebrimmed flat hat peering into a guidebook all the details as clear and sharp three days later in the hospital as the moment when it happened and the driver started to get out and paulo called i got it i got it and rinker reached for the door handle but paulo beat her to it stepping in front of her in that last little quartersecond of life the shot sounded like a firecracker but the driver knew it wasnt the driver was in his pocket as rinker suddenly feeling ill not in pain yet but just ill and for some inexplicable reason falling went to the ground paulo on top of her she didnt understand even as a roaring ripping sound enveloped her and she rolled and paulo looked down at her but his eyes were already out of control and he opened his mouth and his blood gushed onto her face and into her mouth she began screaming as the roaring sound resumed she rolled and pushed paulo down on the cobbles and turned his head to keep him from drowning in his own blood and began screaming at the driver paulo paulo paulo the driver looked at her everything slowmoving she saw the boxy blacksteel weapon in his hand a gun like she hadnt seen before she saw his mouth open as he shouted something then he looked back over the car and then back down at paulo then he was standing over them and he lifted paulo and put him on the backseat and lifted her and put her in the passenger seat and in seconds they were flying across the plaza the hospital three minutes away no more she looked over the seat into paulos open eyes but paulo wasnt there anymore paulo had gone she could taste his blood in her mouth crusting around her teeth but paulo had left the building izzy cohen said goddamnit and he wasnt sure itd gone right the scope had blocked too much and he ran the bolt and lifted the rifle for a second shot the bodies right there and he saw the driver doing something and then as izzy lifted the rifle the driver opened up and the front of the church powdered around him and izzy thought jeez an uzi he thought or a gun just like it izzy rolled away from the window as the glass blew inward picked up the two walkietalkies and scrambled to the far corner of the loft and the steel spiral stair the bullets flying around him like bees he dove down the stair and punched through the back door where a yellow volkswagen beetle was waiting with its engine running izzy threw the gun in the back climbed in and slammed the door the driver accelerated away from the churchs back door and shouted what was that what was that gun fuck if i know izzy said he was pulling off the latex gloves shaking glass out of his hair blood on his hand he dabbed at his cheek just a nick a fuckin uzi maybe uzi what is this uzi israeli gun its a machine gun i know what is a fuckin uzi the driver shouted why is this fuckin uzi why is this i dont know izzy said just get us back to the plane and maybe we can find out the airstrip was a onelane dirt path cut out of apiece ofscraggly jungle twenty kilometers west of the city on the way the driver got on his cell phone and made a call shouting in spanish over the pounding of the volkswagen find out anything izzy asked when he rang off i call now maybe find out something later the driver said he was a little man who wore a plain pink shortsleeved dress shirt with khaki slacks and brown sandals his english was usually excellent but deteriorated under stress a couple of kilometers east of the airstrip they stopped and the driver led the way through a copse of trees to a waterfilled hole in the ground izzy wiped the remington and threw it in the hole and tossed the box of shells in after it hope it doesnt dry up he said looking at the ripples on the black water the driver shook his head theres no bottom he said the hole goes all the way to hell the phone rang on the way back to the car and the driver answered it spoke for a minute and then clicked off with a nervous sideways glance at izzy what two dead the driver said one bullet one shot izzy said with satisfaction what was that machine gun the driver shrugged bodyguard maybe nobody knows the airstrip terminal was a tinroofed concrete block building surrounded by ragged palmettos with an incongruous roostershaped weather vane perched on top what might have been a more professional windsock hung limply from a pole beside the building except that the windsock was shaped like a sixfootlong orange trout and carried the legend west yellowstone montana a honda generator chugged away in a locked steel box behind the building putting out the thin stink of burnt gasoline fingersized lizards climbed over walls poles and tree trunks searching for bugs of which there were many everything about the place looked as tired as the windsock even the trees even the lizards from the trip in izzy knew the generator ran an ancient air conditioner and an even older dustyred cocacola cooler inside the building where the owner sat with a stack of playboy magazines a radio and a can of raid for the biting flies ill call again the driver said you check on the plane when izzy had gone inside the driver now sweating as heavily as the american dug a revolver out from under the front seat of the volkswagen swung the cylinder out and checked it closed the cylinder and put the gun under his belt at the small of his back izzy and the driver had known each other for a few years and there existed the possibility that the drivers name was on a list somewhere that somebody knew who was driving israel coen around cancun but the driver doubted it nobody would want to know the details of a thing like this and izzy wouldnt want anyone to know only two people had seen the drivers face and izzys in the same place izzy himself and the airport manager the driver walked into the airport building and pulled the door shut the building had four windows and they all looked the same way out at the strip and it was cool inside izzy was talking to the airport manager who sat with a cocacola at a metal desk directly in front of the air conditioner is he coming the driver asked hes twenty minutes out izzy said and the airport manager nodded the driver yawned he had twenty minutes not much time nice trip he said to izzy he tipped his head at the door as though he wanted to speak privately hope your business went well let me get my bag izzy said he stepped toward the door and the driver pulled it open with his left hand and held it izzy stepped out the driver right behind him his right hand swinging up with the revolver when it was an inch behind izzys head he pulled the trigger and izzys face exploded in blood and he went down the driver looked at the body for a moment not quite believing what hed done then stepped back inside the airport manager was half out of his chair body cocked and the driver shook his head at him too bad he said with real regret weve known each other for a long time the airport manager said im sorry why is let me say a prayer no time the driver said today we killed raul mejias baby boy he shot the airport manager in the heart and again in the head to make sure back outside he shot izzy twice more the shots sounding distant in his own ears as if theyd come from over a hill he dragged the body inside the airport building and dumped it beside the airport managers he took izzys wallet and all of his cash a gold ring with a big red stone and the inscription university of connecticut and every scrap of paper he could find on him he also found the padlock for the door on the managers desk and the key to the generator box in the managers pocket he went outside padlocked the door behind himself killed the generator there was a black patch of bloody dirt where izzys head had landed he scuffed more dirt over it got back in his volkswagen and pulled away raul mejias baby boy the driver would have said a prayer for himself if he could have remembered any junker didnt know the names of the players when she woke up she was in the hospitals critical care unit three empty beds with monitoring equipment and her own bed anthony and dominic paulos brothers were sitting at the foot of the bed she couldnt quite make out their faces until anthony stood up and stepped close her mouth was as dry as a saltine cracker paulo anthony shook his head rinker turned her face away opened her mouth to cry but nothing came out tears began running down her face and anthony took her hand he was he was dead when they got here we uh you have been in surgery we need to know did you see the man who shot you rinker wagged her head weakly i didnt see anything i just fell down i didnt know i was shot paulo fell on top of me i tried to turn his head he was bleeding more tears and dominic was turning his straw hat in his hands pulling the brim through his fingers in a circular motion like a man measuring yards of cloth we are trying to find out who did this the police are helping anthony said we uh you will be all right the bullet went through paulo and fell apart and the core went into you in your stomach they operated for two hours and you will be all right she nodded but her hand twitched toward her stomach i think im i might have been i think she began looking at anthony and then dominic who had stepped up beside his brother dominic now shook his head you have lost the baby oh god dominic reached out and touched her covered leg he was tough as a ball bearing but he had tears rolling down his cheeks he said well find them this wont pass she turned her head away and drifted when she came back theyd gone she was in the hospital for a week missed paulos funeral slept through a visit by paulos father on the fourth day they had her up and walking but they wouldnt let her go until she had produced a solid bowel movement after that painful experience she was wheeled out to one of the familys black bmws and was driven to the mejia family compound in merida paulos father rolling his own wheelchair though the dark tiled hallways met her with an arm around her shoulder and a kiss on the cheek do you know what happened she asked he shook his head no i dont understand it yet weve been asking everywhere but there is no word of anything some people who might in theory have reason to be angry with us from years ago have let it be known that they were not involved and have offered to help find those who were you can believe them she asked perhaps we continue to look there was a strange circumstance the day paulo was killed he hesitated as if puzzling over it then continued two men were killed at an airstrip not far from here shot to death one was the airstrip manager and the other was an american there was no indication that they were involved with paulos assassination with that strip there is always the question of unauthorized landings he meant drug smuggling but still it is a strange coincidence the american was identified through fingerprints he was not involved in trade in he made a figure eight in the air with his fingers meaning drugs but he served time in prison and was believed connected to american organized crime to the mafia a minor person he was not important we are asking more questions of our police and our police are talking with the americans we will find out more sooner or later when you find them rinker said through her teeth her cold eyes only inches from the old mans when you find them kill them his eyes held hers for a moment doing an assessment of the woman he knew as cassie mclain they didnt know each other well but the old man knew that paulos involvement with her was more than casual knew shed been pregnant with one of his own grandchildren this tidy blond american with the perfect spanish after the moment he nodded something will be done he said this dead american at the airstrip she said at the end of the audience do you even know where he was from that we know he said he closed his eyes for a minute parsing the information in his head he smelled lightly of garlic and had fuzzy ears like a gentle yoda there was a legend that in his early years hed had an informer hung upside down by his ankles and had then lit a fire under his head according to the legend the informer stopped screaming only when his skull exploded now mejia opened his eyes and said he lived in a town in missouri called normandy lake a woman who lived there told the missouri police that hed gone to cancun on vacation she said she would come for the body but she didnt come when the police went back to the house she had gone shed packed all her personal belongings and had gone away thats crazy rinker said shaking her head but her brain was moving now cutting through the glue that had held her since the shooting and she was touched by a cool tongue of fear after a mo ment she said i dont want to go home im a little frightened if it would be all right i would like to go to the ranch until i can walk then i think i will go back to the states you are welcome to stay as long as you wish the old man said he smiled at her you may stay forever if you wish the friend of my baby she smiled back thank you papa but cancun she made the same figure eight in the air as he had cancun is paulo i think it would be better to go away when i am well one of the old mans bodyguards wheeled her back out to the bmw and as the car pulled away she looked at the drivers shoulders and the back of his head and realized that she now knew more about what happened at ginos than the old man did she knew that the bullet had been aimed not at paulo but at her if the old man found out that his baby boy had been killed because of rinker and that rinker had never told them of the danger she hadnt expected it hadnt believed it could happen then maybe the old mans anger would be directed at her she shivered at the thought but not too much because rinker was as cold as the old man instead of worrying she began planning she couldnt do anything until she got her strength back which might take some time shed benefited from the report put out by the mejia family and the mexican police that shed been killed along with paulo at the time theyd done it simply to protect her from a possible cleanup attempt if it turned out that shed seen the shooter the story would serve her well enough the st louis goombahs didnt have anything going in mexico as far as she knew and the only information they would have gotten would have come from the newspapers on the other hand with the old man pushing his drugworld con tacts sooner or later the truth would come out by that time she had to have made her move before she talked to the old man she hadnt had anything to do now shed be busy as cassie mclain shed retired and was living on her investments as clara rinker she had to move money retrieve documents talk to old acquaintances across the border she had to be healthy to do it all rinker spent a month at the old mans ranch living in a bedroom in the main house with an armed watcher to follow her around the middle brother dominic visited every third day arriving at noon as regular as clockwork to bring her up to date on the familys investigation all the time at the ranch she waited for her image of paulo to fade it never did to the very end of her stay she could smell him she could taste the salt on his skin she still expected to see him standing in the kitchen listening to futbol on a cheap radio his white grin and black tousled hair and his weekend bottle of americanstyle corona by the second week on the ranch bored but still weak feeling more and more pressure to move while remaining determined not to move until she was solid she began talking with her watcher his name was jaime a short hard man with a deeply burned face and brushy mustache he was goodnatured enough and went everywhere with a pistol in his pocket and an m in the back of his truck rinker said show me about the m after a little talk and perfunctory protests by jaime he hauled two chairs out to a nearby gully set up a target range and showed her how to fire the m she did well with the weapon and he became interested he was a gunman deeply involved with the tools of his profession and brought out other guns a scoped boltaction weatherby sporting rifle a pump a leveraction treintatreinta and a shotgun they spent two or three hours a day shooting stationary targets bouncing tires and with the theyd shoot at clay pigeons thrown straight away the clays were almost impossible to hit at the end she might hit one or two out often learning to time her shots to the top of the targets arc as they shot jaime talked about rifle bullets and loads wind drift and heat mirages uphill and downhill shooting doityourself accurizing he liked working with her because she was serious about it and attractive an athlete he thought though she didnt really work at it like some gym queens he knew in cancun trim smart and pretty in a blond gringo way and she knew about men he might have put a hand on her himself if she hadnt been in mourning and mourning for the son of raul mejia he remained always the professional there is no way that you can carry or keep a long gun for selfprotection he told her with a handgun you have it always by your hand like the name says with a rifle which is very good if you have it in your hand well it will be in the bedroom and you will be in the kitchen when they come for you or you will be sitting in the latrine with your pants around your ankles and a playboy in your hands maybe not you but me anyway and the rifle will be leaning against a tree and thats when they will come so this gun he slapped the side of the m this gun is fine when you are shooting but you must learn the handgun for selfprotection she demurred she wanted to learn the long guns she said rifles and a shotgun not a doublebarreled bird gun or anything cute but a stubby fatbarreled combat pump she didnt want to learn how to shoot any fuckin birds give her a shotgun and a moving target five yards away he shook his head and smiled goodnaturedly and showed her the long guns two weeks of firstclass tuition but he kept coming back to the handgun just try it hed say you are very natural with a gun the best woman i have ever seen shootings not exactly rocket science shed said but the phrase didnt translate well into spanish didnt come off with the irony of the english in her second two weeks on the ranch she went a halfdozen times into town to her apartment and gathered what she needed in order to move she also wiped the place thered be no fingerprints if anyone came looking for her then one wednesday after shed been on the ranch for a month dominic came out and said weve got word about a man who some people say might have been the driver for the shooting we dont know where he is but we know where his family is so we should be able to find him then we might learn something when she asked by the weekend i hope dominic said we have to know where this came from so we can get back to business and for paulo of course that was on a wednesday she was still not one hundred percent but she was good enough to run shed handled everything she could by phone she had documents she could get to shed moved the money that had to be moved she would leave on thursday afternoon shed already worked it out she had two doctors appointments each week on monday and thursday the driver always waited in the lobby of the clinic when she came out of the doctors office if she turned left instead of right she would be at least momentarily free on the streets of cancun and not ten yards from a busy taxi stand she should have half an hour before the driver became curious if she got even two minutes shed be gone shed done it before rinker and jaime went for one last shooting session on thursday morning with the shotgun jaime had six solidrubber fourteeninch trailer tires that he could haul around in a john deere utility wagon they went out to the gully and jaime rolled the tires one at a time down the rocky slope the tires ricocheted wildly off the rocks while rinker tried to anticipate them with the twelvegauge pump when she hit them at ten yards shed knock them flat but on a good day she struggled to hit half of them with the first shot she learned that a shotgun even at close range wasnt a sure thing when shed emptied the shotgun theyd pick up the tires and rinker would drive them to the top of the slope and roll them down while jaime shot at them taking turns he did no better than she did though they both pretended that he did on this day she made what she thought later was almost a mistake jaime pulled the beretta from his belt clip and said just one time with the handgun eh make me happy jaime with asperity no no no he wagged his finger at her i insist we have time before the doctor and this you should learn jaime goddamnit he ignored her a halfdozen empty coke cans sat in the back of the john deere and he threw three of them down the gully you can do this you will find it much harder than the rifle or the shotgun give me the gun jaime she said making the almostmistake he stopped in midsentence looked at her and handed her the beretta shed always liked that particular gun when she was shooting nines it seemed to fit in her hand and she liked jaime and might have wanted to impress him a bit on this her last afternoon she flipped the safety and pulled down on one of the cans and shot it six times in three seconds before it managed to flip its nowraggedy ass behind a rock they stood in a hot dusty powdersmelling silence for several seconds then rinker slipped the safety on and passed the piece back to jaime jaime looked at the gun then at her and said after a while i see he didnt really hed probably find out soon enough that afternoon she ran lucas davenport parked in the street a rusty dumpster blocked his driveway which had become a bog of blackandtan mud anyway so he parked in the street climbed out of the porsche and looked up at the halffinished house the place had been framed and closed and the rock walls had been set but raw plywood still showed through the second story and parts of the first although most of it had been covered with a black weatherseal the lawn between lucas and the house was a wreck the result of construction trucks maneuvering over it after an illtimed summer rain two men in coveralls were sitting on the peak of the roof drinking what lucas hoped was perrier water out of green bottles and eating a pizza out of a flat white box given that they were roofers and that when they saw him they eased the bottles down behind their legs and out of sight he suspected that the bottles did not contain water one of them waved with his free hand and the other lifted a slice of pizza and lucas waved back and started across the rutted lawn toward the front porch he crossed the ruts and rain puddles gracefully enough he was a large athletic man in a dark blue suit and nontasseled black loafers with a white dress shirt open at the throat his face and neck contrasted with the easy elegance of the italian suit old scars marked him as a troubleseeker one scar in particular slicing down across an eyebrow onto the tanned cheek below he had kindly iceblue eyes and dark hair old frenchcanadian genes hanging on for dear life in the american ethnic mixmaster the house was his or had been his and would be again now it was a mess an electrician stood on a stepladder on the new front porch working on overhead wiring a couple of nail guns were banging away inside sounding like cartoon spit balloons pitoo pitoo and as he walked up to the porch a table saw started whining he could smell the sawdust or imagined he could listening to all the commotion he thought all right two guys on the roof an electrician on the porch at least two nail guns inside and a table saw that was a minimum of six guys and if there were six guys working on the house then he wouldnt have to scream at the contractor seven or eight guys would have been better ten would have been perfect but the house was only a week behind schedule now so six was acceptable barely as he climbed the porch steps he noticed that somebody had pinned a fourbyfour beam in the open ceiling down at the far end it would someday soon support an oak swing big enough for two adults and a kid the electrician saw him coming ducked his head to look down at him from the ladder and said hey lucas jim hows it going the electrician was screwing canaryyellow splicing nuts onto pairs of bared wires that would feed the porch light okay im getting close but somebodys got to put in that telephone and cable wiring or were gonna get hung up on the inspection the inspectors coming tuesday and if we have to reschedule it could hold things up for a week and they wont be able to close the overheads ill talk to jack about it lucas said he was supposed to get that guy from epps i heard the guy fell off a stepladder and broke his foot thats what i heard the electrician said pitching his voice down dont tell jack i mentioned it i wont ill get somebody out here lucas said goddamnit now he was back in yelling mode again much of the problem of building a new house was in the sequencing sequencing the construction steps and all the required inspections in a smooth flow one screwup of even a minor thing like phone and cabletelevision wiring which should take no more than a day could stall progress for a week and they didnt have a lot of time to spare besides which living in weather karkinnens house was driving him crazy he didnt have any of his stuff everything was in storage weather had even lost her tv remote and never noticed because she watched tv only when presidents were assassinated for the past two months hed had to get up and down every time he wanted to change channels and he wanted to change channels about forty times a minute hed taken to crouching next to the tv to push the channel button weather said he was pathetic and he believed her inside the shell of the new house everything smelled of damp wood and sawdust smelled pretty good he thought building new houses could become addictive everybody was working on the second story and he made a quick tour of the bottom floor four new boxes were piled on the back porch toilet stools and then took the central stairs to the second floor one nailgun guy and the table saw guy were working in the master bedroom fitting in the tongueingroove maple ceiling the other nail gunner was working in the main bathroom fitting frames for what would be the linen closet they all glanced at him and the guy on the saw said morning and went back to work jack around the saw guy shook his head naw i been working harolds been kinda jackin around though rick no time for carpenter humor is jad around he was down the basement last time i saw him lucas did a quick tour of the top floor stopped to look out a bedroom window at the mississippi he was actually high enough to see the water far down in the steep valley on the other side of the road and then headed back downstairs his cell phone rang when he was halfway down and he pulled it out and poked the power button yeah hey marcy sherrill a detectivesergeant who ran his office and a portion of his life that fbi guy mallard is looking for you he wants you to get back to him soon as you can did he say what he wanted no but he said it was urgent he wanted your cell phone number but i told him you kept it turned off he gave me a number to call back give it to me he took a ballpoint out of his jacket pocket and scribbled the number in the palm of his hand as she read it to him you at the house she asked yeah theyre about ready to put in the toilets we got four of the big highflow american standard babies white he could feel her falling asleep but she said getting close two months they say i dunno ill believe it when i see it call mallard in the basement jack vrbecek was peering up at the ceiling and making notes on a clipboard hey lucas seven guys today yeah thats good thats good looks like things are moving whatre you doing checking the schematics on the wiring youre gonna want to know where every bit of it is in case you need to get at it lucas bent his head back to peer at the ceiling maybe we ought to put in a plexiglas ceiling finish it off but then wed be able to see everything except that the workshop would sound like the inside of the brassband factory every time you turned on a saw vrbecek said this will be fine well get you a complete layout and with the acoustic drop ceiling your access will be okay and youll be able to hear yourself think lucas nodded listen weve got to get somebody to do the cable and telephone stuff and i heard someplace today down at city hall i think that the guy from epps broke his foot if we dont get that in with the inspector coming tuesday yeah yeah were moving on it he made a note on his clipboard and one of the guys up on the roof is drinking what might be perrier water but might not be and if he falls off and breaks his neck im not the one who gets sued goddamnit theyre supposed to be in a twelvestep program and if thats a goddamn bottle of beer they started for the basement stairs at any other time lucas might have felt guilty about ratting out the roofers but this was the house two months earlier lucas had stood on the edge of a hole where his old house had once been looking into it with a combination of fear and regret both he and weather wanted to remain in the neighborhood and they were old enough to know exactly what they wanted in a house and to know they wouldnt get it by buying an older place building was the answer taking down the old house putting up the new only when he looked into the hole did he realize how committed hed become after a long life of essential noncommitment the old house was gone and weather karkinnen was as shed announced with child theyd get married when they had time to work out the details and theyd all live happily ever after in the big new house as hed stood on the edge of the hole the lowspreading foundation junipers clutching at his ankles as though pleading for mercy theyd get damn little given the practicalities of building a new house hed expected to live with the regret for a long time hed bought the place when he was relatively young a detective sergeant with a reputation for busting cases he was working all the time roaming the city at night building a web of contacts and working until five in the morning writing roleplaying games hunched over a drawing board and an ibm selectric a couple of the games hit producing modest gushers of money after wasting some of it on a retirement plan and throwing even more down the rathole of sober longterm investments hed finally come to his senses and spent the remaining money on a porsche and a lake cabin in the north woods the last few thousand made a nice down payment on the house standing at the edge of the old basement hed thought hed miss the old place so far he hadnt the hole had been enlarged the new foundation had gone in and in short order the frame for the replacement house had gone up and been enclosed he found the process fascinating hed enjoyed the design stage working with the architect had enjoyed even more the construction process the careful fittingtogether of the plans and the inevitable arguments about changes and materials he even enjoyed the arguments sort of like writing a strategy game he thought the old house though comfortable had problems even living in it alone hed felt cramped at times and if he and weather had kids the kids would have been living on top of them in the next bedroom down the hall the big new house would have a grand master bedroom suite with a versaillessized bathroom and a bathtub large enough for lucas to float in weather a small woman should be able to swim laps the kid kids would be at the other end of the hall with a bathroom of his own and thered be a library and workrooms for both himself and weather and a nice family room and a spot for weathers piano the new house was a place he thought he could happily live and die in die when he was ninetythree he hoped and with any luck it should be finished before the kid arrived right now he didnt want to leave not even with the screaming up on the roof he wanted to hang around and talk with the foreman and the other guys but he knew hed just be sucking up their time he walked around the first floor once more thinking about color schemes that would fit with the rock hed picked for the fireplace twenty minutes after he arrived he dragged himself back to the car and remembered mallard he took the cell phone out of his pocket and leaned against the porsche and punched in the number written in the palm of his hand an old lady went by on her bike a wicker basket between the handlebars she waved and he waved back a neighbor making her daily trip to the supermarket up the hill on ford parkway mallard is that pronounced like the duck lucas asked an instant of silence then mallard figured it out davenport how far are you from the airport ten minutes but i aint flying anywhere yeah you are youve got a northwest flight out of there in mmm two hours and eight minutes for houston and from there to cancun mexico electronic tickets are already under your name its all cleared with your boss and your federal tax dollars are picking the tab ill meet you at iah in about six hours and you can buy some clothes there whoa whoa i hate flying sometimes a mans gotta do whats going on six weeks ago somebody shot and killed a mexican guy outside a cancun restaurant and wounded his girlfriend the guy who got killed was the youngest son of a mexican druglord or a guy whos supposedly a druglord or maybe an exdruglord something like that so the mexicans started sniffing around and word leaks out to a dea guy the shooter wasnt aiming at the druglords son it was a mistake thats really fascinating louis but cancun is outside the minneapolis city limits the shooter was going for the girl see she was wounded and the cops put out the word that she was dead until they could find out what was going on so after she got out of the hospital she went out to the druglords ranch outside of merida thats a city down there for a month recovering then she disappeared like a puff of smoke everybody was looking for her and eventually we get this request from the mexican national police about these fingerprints theyd picked up at the ranch we had one print that matched came off a bar of soap lucas finally caught up its her clara rinker mallard said what do you want me to do get your ass down to houston first thing the dea has hooked us up with the national police and were gonna talk to some people who knew her down there you got a better feel for her than anybody i want you to hear it lucas thought about it for a minute looking up at the halfcompleted house i can do it for a couple of days he said but i got stuff going on here louis i mean serious stuff my fiancee is gonna be pissed shes in the middle of planning the wedding she really needs me right now and im running off just a couple of days mallard said i promise listen i gotta go im just coming up to national right now and i gotta make some more calls before i get out of the car is malone coming yeah shes coming but youre engaged i was just asking louis you got something going with her no i dont but she does have something going i gotta hang up see you in houston weather would be upset lucas thought looking back at the construction project the house was only halfway done and needed constant supervision the wedding planning was completely disorganized and needed somebody to stay on top of it finally there was a political piefight going on at city hall as a halfdozen candidates jockeyed for position in the democratic primary for mayor the political ramifications of the fight were severe the chief was already dead meat her job gone lucas as a political deputychief was on his way out with the chief but with a little careful maneuvering they might be able to leave the department in the hands of friends he could leave the politics though the chief was a lot better at it than he was the real problem was weather weather was a surgeon a maxillofacial resident at hennepin general she and lucas had circled each other for years had had one wedding fall through lucas loved her dearly but worried that the relationship might still be fragile to leave her now five months into the pregnancy weathers secretary answered at hennepin general lucas a patient just went in grab her will you ive got to talk to her right now lucas said its pretty serious weather came on a second later showing a little stress are you all right yeah im fine why she was exasperated lucas when you call like this and you say its important and youve got to talk to me right away tell carol tm not hurt but its important thatll keep me from an early coronary okay lucas sighed yeah sure so whats going on she asked she was looking at her watch lucas thought mallard called he told her the story in thirty seconds then listened to four seconds of dead silence and opened his mouth to say well or apologize or something but didnt quite get there thank god she blurted youre driving me crazy youre driving the entire construction company crazy if youll just get out of the country for a few days i could finish the wedding plans and maybe the builders could get some work done hey he was offended but she paid no attention she said go to cancun god bless you call me every night remember flying is the safest way to travel have a couple martinis or better yet theres some valium in my medicine cabinet take a couple of those youre sure you dont im sure go youre sure go go the trip to houston was the usual nightmare with lucas hunched in a businessclass seat ready to brace his feet against the forward bulkhead when the impact came not that bracing would save him in his minds eye he could clearly see the razorsharp aviation aluminum slicing through the cabin dismembering everybody and everything in its path then the fire trying to crawl legs missing toward the exit hed talked to a shrink about it the shrink an ex military guy suggested three martinis or a couple of tranquilizers or not flying he added that lucas had control issues and when lucas asked control issues you mean like i dont wanna die in an airplane crash the shrink whod had three martinis himself said i mean you wanna tell people how to tie their shoes because you know how to do it better and that means you dont want somebody else to fly you in an airplane then how come im not scared of helicopters the shrink shrugged because youre nuts in any case the valium hadnt helped hed just had time to drive to weathers place put some clothes and his shaving kit together along with a small tube of drugs and make it back to the airport in the tahoe he didnt want to leave the porsche in the airport ramp because it might get stolen and even if it didnt he might not ever find it again and pound for pound hed rather lose the chevy than the porsche the plane failed to crash either on the way to houston or on landing when he really expected it so tantalizingly close to safety or even when it was taxiing up to the gate and a little more than five hours after speaking to mallard lucas led the parade through the gate into the terminal louis mallard who pronounced his name louie was a stocky professorial man who wore goldrimmed professorial glasses and a dark professorial suit he had a wrestlers neck and sometimes carried acaliber automatic in a shoulder holster waiting with him in a lighterblue professorial suit and carrying a black briefcase was a lanky grayhaired woman named malone the last time lucas had seen malone hed seen quite a bit more of her louis lucas said shaking the other mans hand malone turned a cheek and lucas pecked it and said louis tells me you got one on the line she looked at mallard who said hastily i didnt exactly say that mmmm malone said to lucas its somewhat true somebody conservative wellplaced in government lucas suggested maybe a little money of his own malone was a fourtime loser with a taste for artists and muscle workers no she said hes a sheetrocker a sheetrocker he waited for a smile and when he didnt get one he got instead a defensive browbeetling he said well thats good always jobs out there for a good sheetrocker before lucas sank completely out of sight mallard jumped in hes also a writer hes almost done with his novel okay well good lucas said you gotta get some clothes mallard asked trying to keep the antisheetrocker momentum going theres a place nah im okay i had time to get home he looked around so wherere we going we leave out of here we catch a ride to another terminal mallard said the rides outside they rode to the next terminal in a darkblue government car driven by a man whom mallard never introduced a junior agent from the houston office lucas thought who looked a little sour about the chauffeur duties malone rode in the front with the agent while lucas and mallard rode in the back during the walk to the car and the twominute ride mallard quietly sketched the series of circumstances that had led to the identification of rinker as the woman who was shot and to the belief by the mexican cops that a shooter from st louis was involved the shooter was now dead probably killed by a mexican man who was still on the run she was pregnant malone said they killed her lover and when she was wounded she lost the baby lucas winced and weathers face popped into his head you think shes headed back here back across the border mallard shook his head we dont know weve put sketches of her everywhere every port of entry the problem is she doesnt look all that special midthirties middle height athletic pretty thats about it the other thing is rinker just got out of the hospital so its possible that shes lost some weight and might not look like she used to malone turned and said over the seat its also possible that shes just running that shes already in majorca or someplace the mexican police have been tracing the phone calls she made from this ranch where she was recovering there were six calls up to missouri and two went out to banks in mexico we got on top of the banks right away but both of the calls went into the general number so we dont know who she was talking to or what she did there arent any records of large sums of money being moved on the days she called that cant be accounted for no big accounts closed or switched that cant be accounted for with both the mexican cops and this mejia guy this gang guy taking an interest were pretty sure the banks are telling us the truth maybe safedeposit boxes lucas suggested were trying to run that down we thought maybe an offthebooks box so far nothings panned out malone said shes good lucas said but we knew that how about the missouri calls all six guys are connected all six guys admit that she called and all six say she was asking about john ross who we think was her main employer mallard said all six say they told her nothing that they didnt have anything to tell her ross runs things around the river in st louis the port trucks some drug connections over in east st louis malone added he has a liquor distributorship you remember wooden head from wichita yeah wooden head worked for ross you believe the six guys that they didnt have anything to say she talked to four of them for about five minutes and the other two for about two minutes we dont know what was said but apparently not too much you can say a lot in five minutes lucas said does ross have the six names not as far as we know we havent talked with him yet mallard said okay so claras boyfriend gets killed and shes wounded and loses the baby and they think the shooter is from st louis and she makes calls to st louis asking about this ross guy but she doesnt call ross himself as far as you know so you think ross sent the shooter that shes on a revenge trip a kamikaze deal mallard shook his head again dont know were guessing thats it whatever rinkers broken out now shes in the open i really want her really want her shes run her score up to maybe thirtyfive people this woman is the devil shes maybe more inflected than that malone objected to lucas we have a good biography on her now you can read it on the way down to cancun she had quite the little backwoods childhood their connection was tight an hour after lucass northwest flight put down at houston the continental flight to cancun lifted off mallard and malone sat together with lucas behind them next to an elderly woman who plugged her soundkilling bose headphones into a sony discman looked at him once with something that might have been skepticism and pulled a sleeping mask over her eyes when they were off the ground malone took a bound report out of her briefcase and handed it back to lucas rinker she said lucas had never been able to read on airplanes the clara rinker file was a first when malone handed him the file hed wondered at its heft and turned to the last page page he flipped through and found a dense singlespaced narrative not the usual cop report the first page began there are only four known photographs of clara rinker three from drivers licenses and one from an identification card issued by wichita state university none of the people who knew rinker were able to immediately pick her photograph from a spread of similar photographs prepared by the bureau in each of the four photos she had obscured her appearance with eyeglasses and elab orate hair arrangements this is typical of what we know of clara rinker she is obsessively cautious in her contacts with others and she apparently has from the beginning of her career prepared herself to run the author of the report a lanny brown whom lucas hadnt heard of had a nice style that would have worked in a truecrime book rinker had been killing people for almost fifteen years the first reports had been of various organizedcrime figures both minor and major taken off by a killer whose trademark was extreme closerange shootings many of them withcaliber silenced pistols because of the circumstances of the shootings two of them had taken place in womens rest rooms although both the victims were men the bureau began to suspect that the shooter was a woman who lured the victims into private places with a promise of sex a friend of one victim in shreveport louisiana said that hed spoken briefly at a bar with a pretty young woman who had a southern accent and later had caught a glimpse of the young woman and the victim leaving the club in the victims continental the car and the man were later found on a lovers lane the man who was married had been shot three times in the head with acaliber smith no fewer than nine people had been executed in stairwells or between cars in parking structures the bureau believed that the choices of execution locale indicated that the shooter had carefully scouted the victims knew where they parked their cars and favored parking structures because they offered good access and egress large numbers of strangers interacting with each other a strange woman wouldnt be noticed and sudden privacy bodies had apparently gone unnoticed for as much as four hours when rolled under a car she was also believed to have posed as either a mormon missionary or a jehovahs witness one quiet evening in suburban chicago a straightlooking young woman carrying what a neighbor said appeared to be a bible or a book of mormon had knocked on the door of a recently divorced hood in oak park illinois neighbors whod been sitting in a porch swing in the restored victorian across the street said shed spoken to whoever answered the door then turned away and left three days later after theyd been unable to get in touch with the bad boy friends looked in a window and saw him sprawled on the floor by the front door hed taken two in the heart and one in the head and died in a pair of flowered boxer shorts with a tight grip on a can of coors light the time of death was estimated from the fact that hed apparently just taken off a pair of greg norman golf slacks and a midnightblue and whitehibiscus aloha shirt which other friends said hed worn to a golf course three days earlier after summarizing the executions that rinker was believed involved in the bureau report spent some time with her childhood shed grown up on a brokendown farm outside of tisdale missouri not far from springfield her father had deserted the family when she was seven and had died unknown to the family twelve years later in a car accident in raleigh north carolina her mother cammy rinker had divorced rinkers father four years after he left and two weeks after the divorce was final married a man named carl paltry paltry was an alcoholic and a bully and had been arrested for beating both cammy rinker and rinkers older brother roy the police had learned of roys beating after a gym coach noticed that roy was peeing blood according to rinkers aunt her mothers sister paltry also had sexually abused his wife cammy rinker clara and possibly claras younger brother gene the abuse had begun a few weeks after the marriage when rinker was eleven and continued until she ran away from home when she was fourteen until she was eleven shed had a good record in school but that went bad after paltry arrived the aunt also said that rinkers older brother roy had sexually abused her paltry and cammy rinker had remained married for twelve years until one day when clara would have been nineteen and already working as a shooter hed disappeared he hadnt run anywhere the local cops said hed gotten drunk and had beaten cammy so badly that shed been hospitalized and paltry had been arrested he was out on bail when he disappeared his car had been found parked engine running behind a dairy queen in tisdale his checkbook and wallet were on the passenger seat he was never seen again and the bureau believed that clara rinker may have paid him a visit rinkers mother had almost nothing useful to tell the bureau her memory of clara seemed uneven and when she went to get family pictures she found that all the photos of clara were gone the bureau had tracked roy through a series of minor crime reports and eventually found him in santa barbara california where he was involved in a lightweight prostitution ring roy and a man named charles green ran teenaged hookers around to country clubs the bureau report quoted one source as saying you could get your shoes and your knob polished at the same place and time it was convenient for everybody roy was two years older than rinker and had left home two years after she had he had seen her twice when shed stopped in santa barbara looking for their younger brother gene who was also someplace in california roy didnt know anything about anything though he said that rinker appeared to be doing well and drove nice cars he had no photographs of her and denied having sexually abused her the interviewer thought he was lying rinkers younger brother gene had shown up on three police reports in california all three for minor drug offenses he was listed as homeless on the police reports and was apparently living on the beaches between venice and santa monica the bureau had been unable to find him next to this paragraph a female hand had scrawled lucas ask me m lucas reached forward and tapped malones arm theres a note here to ask you about gene rinker she turned and said yes we found him yesterday he was working for a pool cleaning company in pacific palisades los angeles were holding him on a drug charge good charge he was in possession of marijuana how much maybe a gram a joint jesus is that its more than enough is what it is as soon as we get done here im going to l a to talk to him see if he has anything interesting on clara okay malone turned away and lucas sank back into the report rinker had worked for a bar in st louis then for ross who was a liquor distributor shed also worked off and on as a bookkeepersecretary for a mobster named allen kent whose mothers family was closely tied to the old giancana outfit in chicago eventually rinker had put together enough money to buy a bar in wichita which had done well until shed fled after her disastrous involvement in a series of killings in minneapolis where shed gone immediately after minneapolis was unknown shed eventually popped up in cancun where shed worked illegally as a bookkeeper at a boutique hotel called passages lucas had danced with her once not knowing who she was at her club in wichita the rink theyd had a good time for a little time that night shed even chatted with mallard and malone she mustve known who they were although they hadnt known who she was later shed tried to kill lucas in his own front yard shed missed almost purely by chance as hed missed her reading about his own encounter with rinker lucas was struck with the strangeness of writerly synthesis he was in the story but it didnt sound like him or feel like him he felt as though he were looking at himself in an old millimeter movie something that wasnt quite true but was undeniably accurate and he wondered if the entire report was like that accurate but not especially true rinker came across as mallard saw her as the daughter of the devil at the same time almost against the will of the writer another picture was emerging a kind of annie oakley oldtimey story of survival after completing the detailed review of rinkers life and activities the report went on to detail what was known of the business and crime activities of her various bosses names were named connections made possibilities explored much was speculative but all of it was based on the kind of rumorfabric that lucas had lived with most of his working life not much could be proven but much could be understood he was twothirds of the way through the report when he heard the flight attendant saying something but he paid no attention until the planes attitude changed with an audible clunk that reverberated through the cabin he sat upright looked around and saw that people were packing up briefcases putting away computers sticking stuff back into the overhead he looked at his watch theyd been in the air for two hours and were coming into cancun he leaned forward tapped malones arm and when she turned passed the report back finish it no got another hundred pages and ill want to read the whole thing over he said good stuff in there i can see what you meant when you said inflected tough life which is not exactly an excuse for all the people shes killed especially people like barbara allen allen had been a rich charityandroundation socialite in minneapolis rinker had shot her to death so that her client could get at allens husband no but it was still tough lucas said the thing is you kinda liked her malone said you went for that whole perky cheerleader teasedhair barowner act whats not to like lucas asked he said better buckle up and leaned back out of the conversation the plane failed to crash in canciin but the heat and humidity jumped them as soon as they walked off the plane they retrieved their luggage and took a taxi from the mainland over to the island where mallard had gotten rooms at the blue palms lets get cleaned up and find something to eat he said the hotel restaurant is supposed to be okay how about the italian place where rinker was shot lucas asked your report says its pretty good saving that for lunch tomorrow mallard said the hotel room was a blankfaced offwhite cubicle with a tv and a minibar a toosoft double bed and a bathroom without a tub the place smelled faintly of bug spray and salt water and could have been at any seaside anywhere lucas hung his clothes in the closet and washed his face then walked out onto the narrow balcony and looked down at the water rinker had been here and not long ago had worked within a couple of blocks of the blue palms had probably spent time on the beach ten stories down she might well be in the same kind of place somewhere else on the globe looking for a job trying to settle in or she might have a hideyhole in st louis ready to go to war on her lovers killers if shed simply run theyd never find her but if shed gone to st louis he thought if shed gone to st louis theyd get her they had dinner together and caught up with their separate lives lucas poked at malones new relationship with the sheetrocker despite mallards efforts to warn him away malone had almost nothing to say about her friend except that he had terrific shoulders from lifting the sheetrock mallard mentioned that his office had been renamed it was now called the special studies group and the last big case had involved the destruction of a bank robbery gang operating out of toronto canada they never did a thing in canada mallard said they were completely lawabiding truck drivers and autoparts guys then about once every two months theyd come down south and hit a bank howd you bust them computers they always hit the same kinds of banks at the same times of day with the same techniques which told us that we were working with one gang so we got all of the robberies with that signature and plotted them with a geographical information system the computer took a while but one of the statistical clusters it turned up was a drivetime thing all of the robberies were within a couple hours of border crossings different border crossings anyway we ran the dates of the robberies against the names of people coming in which didnt turn up anything because they kept switching ids but then we ran the incoming license plates and we found them two trucks going through one after the other the day before each of the robberies once we had that we figured out who they were and then we watched them move watched them scout the bank cleared out the bank a half hour before they were due to come in and when they came in there we were they talked about it for a while and then lucas gave them details on a case involving an art professor on which mallards office had provided help marcy sherrill said your information was so generic that it made her brain hurt he said fuck her if she cant take a joke mallard said louis lucas said the language and that was the evening the next morning lucas was a few minutes late getting down to the lobby mallard and malone were both early risers and he wasnt he shaved stood in the shower for five minutes lay down on the bed for a few minutes more dozing then had to brush his teeth again when malone called to ask where he was she was annoyed get going lucas our contacts already here when he got down mallard and malone were waiting in the lobby with a mexican man who wore a gorgeous offbrown suit with a cornflowerblue shirt and buffed mahogany oxfords lucas was admiring the mexicans dress when mallard said jeez davenport where do you get these clothes lucas looked down at himself he was wearing tan slacks with a gray cast a black silk hawaiian shirt with redandgold cockatoos a mediumblue tropicalweight woolknit jacket and loafers that were the casual variants of the mexican mans he thought he looked pretty good whats the problem no problem you look excellent the mexican said smiling his english was lightly accented and malone said this is colonel manuel martin mexican national police he arranged the interview with the mejia family lucas and martin shook hands the mexican clearly had more indio in his ancestry than spanish was six inches shorter than mallard and a little rounder his expression was one of weary amusement lucas said pleased to meet you and martin nodded and said i understand youve danced with clara rinker shes a good dancer lucas said they were drifting toward the dining room whats the story on this mejia guy martins eyebrows arched a bit and he cocked his head to the side i was trying to think how to explain that and finally i came up with this he is mexicos joseph kennedy the father of your president kennedy where the early money came from is not exactly known it is now legitimate but because of past associations the entire mejia family is very very careful and they have excellent connections with the less reputable he struggled for a word and finally landed on element theyll talk to the cops martin shrugged of course joseph kennedy would speak to the police would he not so will mejia especially where our interests are aligned the breakfast was american eggs milk cereal sausage and coffee though martin stayed with fruit bread with cheese and olives popping the olives one at a time with his fingertips as though he were eating pecans during the breakfast he gave them a short history of cancun drew schematic maps on a paper napkin to explain the lay of the yucatan and the cities of cancun and merida and outlined what was known of clara rinkers stay in mexico she wasnt working for the mejias before she came here of that we are certain they had no idea of who she was if they had known it is doubtful that paul mejia would have been allowed to continue the relationship from what we can piece together he met her at the hotel where she worked purely accidentally she was a bookkeeper and he was checking on a business question having to do with automobile parking costs at various beach hotels and that she did not know about the mejia family until another woman at the hotel told her some time after they began seeing each other she lived quite modestly in a rented apartment fingerprints lucas asked nothing the room had been methodically wiped there were personal items left behind but nothing that you could not buy in five minutes in another city and of course nobody ever took a picture of her there was never an occasion no way to tell where she went she disappeared after an appointment at the doctors office martin said she had recovered from the shooting the checks is that right the medical checks checkups malone offered yes the medical checkups were routine and had become more a matter of physical rehabilitation she had some damage to her stomach muscles and they needed strengthening anyway there is a large taxi stand not far from the doctors office but none of the taxi drivers weve found remembers seeing her or taking her anywhere thats possibly because they take all kinds of americans everywhere and they simply cant remember or because the mejia connection had been rumored and nobody wanted anything to do with her so she takes a taxi and shes gone martin shrugged again and said what else can i tell you we have document checks of course for people coming and going and since that time we have no cassandra or cassie mclain and of course no clara rinker entering or leaving mexico malone and mallard questioned martin through the breakfast they werent quite rehearsed lucas noticed but they were coordinated he began watching them more closely and began to suspect that the coordination was personal rather than professional but what about the sheetrocker he wondered then in the government gmc suburban that martin himself drove to merida mallard scrambled into the back with malone and lucas noticed that their shoulders touched during much of the ride and he thought hmmm the two fbi agents pushed the questions even when it was obvious that they were running in circles as though they were playing a ranking game with each other martin was unfailingly polite through it all halfway to merida the fbi questions ran out and they rode in silence for a while martin eventually turned to lucas if i might ask where did you get your jacket its very nice also the shirt although its not my style got it in san francisco one of the gay mens boutiques my fiancee would know the store lucas said he opened the front lapel and read it its a gianfranco ferre i liked the fabric for hot weather although it does get some pulls in it hmm martin nodded pursing his lips large people like yourself look authoritative even in casual clothing im afraid my body was made for suits but thats a great suit lucas said i saw one like it i think a friend of mine had one ralph lauren the purple label though it was in blue exactly this is what it is martin said looking pleased touching his necktie knot and lapel some people in america think brown suits look bad but i think with brown people they look notsobad and a moment later have you ever looked at a suit by kiton lucas said i saw some at a show they talked about suits for a while then about shoes martin told lucas that hed paid for a pair of semicustom oxblood loafers by an english cobbler named barkley only to find that every time he went through an airport metal detector the steel shanks in the shoes set off the alarm so when i go to the states my beautiful shoes stay at home it is the only way i can assure myself of the sanctity of my he searched again for the word came up with rectum and smiled brilliantly over his shoulder at malone dont like those bodycavity searches eh lucas asked american security is sometimes unusual martin said when they got out of the truck in merida malone took lucas by the elbow and stood on tiptoe her mouth by his ear and said if you talk for one more fuckin minute about fashion ill fuckin shoot you hey raul mejias house was surrounded by an offwhite stucco wall with access through what appeared to be a simple spanish wroughtiron gate as they were passing through lucas noticed that the bolt was electronic that the wrought iron was actually steel and that the black faux wroughtiron leaves at the top of the gate eight or nine feet up were essentially knives if anyone were to scale it he would need serious protection like a kevlar quilt without it a climbers fingers would be lopped off like so many link sausages inside the wall was a small neatly kept yard grassy in the north american style with a steppingstone walk to the front door of the house the house itself from the front seemed as modest as the outer wall a high singlestory and was made of the same offwhite stucco pierced by tall dark windows martin led the way through the gate up the steppingstone walk and pushed the doorbell a moment later a young man opened it smiled and said come in come in im dominic mejia my fathers waiting in the library the house was much larger than it appeared from the outside lucas realized from the outside there was no way to see how far back it extended but once inside dominic led them through a public reception room across a large interior courtyard open to the sky with a small swimming pool into the back of the house and down another hallway to a library the library looked as though it might be a hundred years old all of dark wood with thick shelves set at different heights to accommodate the books the bottom two feet of each wall was taken up by cupboards the books themselves were varied and included several hundred paperbacks and perhaps three thousand hardcovers the room smelled faintly of lemonscented furniture polish and leather soap it smelled good an old man was sitting in a wheelchair at a library table a book in front of him he smiled when they entered pushed back from the table and said in english colonel martin a pleasure as always your friends as well come in sit he gestured at a circle of chairs at the back of the room two leather reading chairs and three easy chairs that had apparently been brought in for the guests mejia wheeled himself over lucas went along the shelving and said this is a good room im building a house now with a library he was looking at the books they all appeared to have been read most were on history culture and economics with a selection of latin american and spanish novels all the bindings were modern mejia was a reader rather than a collector mallard was settling into one of the leather chairs while malone took the other mejia wheeled to get a better look at his shelves then said a library i envy you the task the thought the difficulty is to make the library comfortable and distinguished at once much thought and a good architect he tapped his temple as he said much thought mejia spoke english well but not quite as well as his son he looked at his son dominic open the folding doors and find anthony at the far end of the room two large fourpanel folding doors dominated the center of the wall dominic opened them and revealed a builtin desk with a computer console and an overhead shelf lined with software boxes then went to find anthony whoever that was internet raul mejia was saying a wonderful thing even for an old man i have this beautiful library where i can sit with my books and a highspeed internet connection behind harem screens made in andalusia lucas took one of the fabric chairs as mallard asked have you ever put clara ranker into a search engine three thousand references now on google beginning with the investigation in your kansas and minnesota mejia said there is discussion of a movie or perhaps a television show you were surprised to see them all the references i was dominic came back into the room trailed by a man who might have been a year or two older but was obviously his brother raul mejia looked at his sons and said asombrado astonished amazed anthony said his english was as good as his brothers they sounded californian more than surprised mejia said he sighed i wish she had the baby this is the real assassination a baby from my son and a woman like this this would be a baby malone jumped in as we understand it you have had enemies in business but can find no sign that these enemies made the attack on your son and rinker with the st louis connection it seems now that the attack was aimed at rinker and your son was killed accidentally does this change your your feeling toward rinker sthe old man shrugged of course but i can also understand this attachment paulo was a good boy but wild crazy sometimes this woman clara rinker there must have been a fire between them she must also have this craziness somewhere inside i could feel it myself when i spoke to her so i am angry that she did not tell us but i understand why she did not now what is to be done you could help us catch her mallard said you have commercial connections everywhere in mexico she needs money and shelter and she will go places that the police may not see we would also like to know from you this man who was murdered at the airfield what is his connection with these criminals in st louis he is a mafia he has connections with st louis organized crime mallard said you think some italians from st louis came to cancun and shot my boy mejia said by mistake not so many italians anymore but thats basically what we think yes mallard agreed you will tell us their names now mallard showed a little nervousness we cant do that but as the investigation progresses im sure you will learn a few of them we wouldnt want you to take ummm any active role in the ummm investigation but perhaps through my family commercial connections i have connections with hotels motels friends in the states perhaps i could find information for you if i had the names we really cant bring in civilians hes afraid you would send gunmen to st louis to kill the names lucas said to mejia he might not mind if they did that if it would help catch rinker but he couldnt tell you the names because that might turn out to be technically criminal and he would be purged thats not exactly accurate mallard said irritably besides you dont need him to tell you lucas said still talking to mejia watch your computer the fbi leaks like crazy and the names will appear if rinker starts shooting there will be lists in the newspa pers in your search engine put in organized crime st louis and the word shot goddamnit lucas mallard said mejia looked at lucas for a long five seconds then turned to mallard so then from me you need clues to clara rinker mallard nodded yes mejia nodded back we will look if you will give us a telephone number we will call when we find anything mallard took a card from his pocket scribbled a number on it and handed it over mejia glanced at it and held it out to anthony who like his brother was leaning against the library table thats my secure cell phone mallard said i sleep with it you can call me twentyfour hours a day youre not married mejia said not anymore mallard said the job was more interesting they talked for another ten minutes but not much came of it mejia and his sons gave them impressions of rinker she was a happy woman they said and had made paulo happy although she said she was younger than paulo they thought she might have been a couple of years older would they have married perhaps mejia seemed to lack any real information about the crime which wasnt surprising since the fbi and the mexican national police had the same problem as they left lucas and mejia talked a few minutes about library shelves and how to prevent unsightly sagging and the arrangement of books which the old man called an enjoyable but impossible task on the way out of merida malone said nice old man for a ganglord martins eyes flashed up to the rearview mirror to catch hers and he said maybe not so much ganglord talk outside the car and i do not think many people would agree that he is a nice old man do you think hell help us trail rinker mallard asked if he sees some benefit in it martin said benefit for him he will analyze analyze analyze and if finally he is sure of the benefit he will help realpolitik lucas smiled at the word you speak really good english you know with martin asa guide they returned to cancun and toured the restaurant where paulo mejia and rinker had been shot interviewed the restaurant owner and climbed into the loft of the church to see the shooting position taken by the assassin had to have local help to find this lucas said as martin explained how the shooter had probably fired once then retreated down the stairs and out the back door to a waiting car there would have to be a driver martin said you couldnt park a car back there it would block the entire street and bring attention you know the driver mallard asked we are looking for a man he is unaccountably absent normally he would go to relatives to be hidden but they do not know where he is they knew where he was three days ago but then he went away running malone suggested maybe he felt you coming he went to a business meeting his mother says he didnt come back mmm the loft was hot as a kiln and smelled like hay like a midwestern barn loft in summer a wasp the size of lucass little finger bumped along the seam of the ceiling and wall they looked out on the hot street for another minute then trooped back to the restaurant for a light lunch the service was wonderful which martin seemed to take tor granted lucas again noticed the body language between mallard and malone an offering from mallard equivocation from malone he smiled to himself and went back to the pasta salad from the restaurant they went to the hotel where rinker had worked as a bookkeeper shed worked off the books illegally but no body was being coy about it with both the mejia family and the national cops involved the hotel manager simply opened up and told everybody everything hed hired her because she had the bookkeeping skills she knew excel backward and forward and was willing to work whenever she was needed for as long or as little as she was needed and there were no benefits or taxes to pay she said she just needed an extra squirt of money to supplement her disability pension the manager told them she was very good the arrangement was convenient for everybody is there any possibility that she took the job because she knew she would meet paulo mejia lucas asked the manager shook his head mr mejia never came here only the once to look at the parking for an appraisal he was doing i introduced them when he needed some numbers purely by chance he nodded by chance he explained that he didnt know mejia was coming that day and that shed come in at the last minute to deal with a money problem involving a group of americans who had asked to extend their vacation stay she could not have planned it he also characterized her as cheerful and hardworking and said that her hours were increasing each month i would have liked to employ her fulltime if she had not been a foreigner he said she worked very well mallard asked about pictures and the manager shrugged how often do you take pictures of people in your office were not tourists we work here on the way back to the hotel all four of them were quiet thinking their own thoughts until lucas asked martin why is it that everybody speaks english everybody weve seen martin sighed gringo imperialism cancun business is americans and canadians and english people and now some germans always israelis theres a story not a story you would call it a line about cancun martin said its that cancun is just like miami except in miami they speak spanish at the hotel martin got out of the truck shook hands with the three americans and asked lucas to get the name of the san francisco store where hed bought the jacket lucas said he would find it and call back not much here lucas said as he watched martin drive away then he mallard and malone crossed into the cool of the hotel but we got a deal with old man mejia which is the main thing mallard said if he decides to put a price on her head rinkers gonna have a hard time getting any help from the underground wordll get around you have more faith than i do lucas said most of the fuckin underground cant read a tv guide im not talking about the assholes on the corner mallard said im talking about the gun dealers and the moneymen and the document people theyll hear shell have trouble moving lucas shook his head he disagreed the disagreement was fundamental and generally divided all cops everywhere some believed in underlying social order in which messages got relayed and people kept an eye out and bosses reigned and buttonmen were ready to take orders and a network connected them and some cops believed in social chaos in which most events occurred through accident coincidence stupidity cupidity and luck both good and bad lucas fell into the chaos camp while mallard and malone believed in the underlying order when working out the trip to mexico mallard had allowed extra time for a certain inefficiency but martin had been so ruth lessly efficient that they were done at two oclock mission more or less accomplished swim malone asked too hot lucas said im gonna get a beer at the bar then a couple of papers and lay up in my room with the airconditioning on maybe swim before dinner not bad mallard said im for a beer or two ill join you malone said but i gotta run up to my room for a minute lucas and mallard stopped at the hotel gift shop and bought copies of the times and the wall street journal carried the papers into the cool of the bar got a booth and ordered dos equis you read the editorials mallard asked yeah though i know its wrong lucas said you want the fascists or the commies lucas considered for a moment then said fascists and mallard passed him the journal they both opened to the editorial pages looked over the offerings and then lucas asked casually how bad you got it for malone mallards newspaper folded down he looked at lucas for a long moment then sighed and said is it that obvious yup lucas said the goddamn woman drives me crazy i know you guys he didnt say it that lucas and malone once spent a happy weekend together thats not a big deal i just hunger after her i thought i was hiding it pretty well im a trained investigator lucas said he looked at an editorial headline that said sweatshops often build sustaining family businesses after a moment of silence from mallard he added i suspect nobody else knows except any trained investigators you might have at the fbi and malone of course mallards eyebrows went up you think she knows jesus christ louis she knew before you did lucas said women always know that shit first and shes not backing away if i were you id set up a moment somewhere have a few drinks around the pool tonight tell her a few stories give her a chance to tell you a few and vou know going up stairs put a hand on her what about the drywall guy the sheetrocker fuck the drywall guy youre not playing tennis have to be more than a few drinks mallard said gloomily he looked scared to death its no big deal louis lucas said people do it all the time not me mallard said im not exactly your romantic hero yes you are louis youre a big wheel in the fbi youre involved in international intrigue you carry a great big gun you spend the taxpayers money like it was water im paying for the beer personally louis what the fuck are you talking about yeah yeah the phone in his pocket rang and he slipped it out answered listened for a moment then said oh boy when well be out front he clicked it shut and said martins coming back they found that guy who might have been the driver dead not yet but hes in terrible shape martin says he was tortured where is he here cancun he was dumped at a hospital martinll be here in five minutes malone came out of the elevator as mallard was ringing her room mallard explained about the phone call on the way to the door martin roared in three minutes later parting the clouds of volkswagen beetles like a wolf going through a flock of sheep hes at the hospital now he said as they scrambled aboard how bad lucas asked he could die before we get there martin said his face had gone grim as a crocodiles and the easy charm had vanished they bounced over a curb going out of the parking lot onto the strip lucas had no idea of where they were going the gmc was rigged with a siren to g with the flasher lights above the bumper and martin punched the truck through the traffic an unknown person had driven an old toyota corolla over a curb at the hospital emergency entrance martin said had left the motor running and the passenger door open and walked away when a cop inside the emergency room noticed the car hed gone out to order the owner to move it and found the tortured man sitting in a bloodsoaked passenger seat nobody saw where the corollas driver went nobody remembered what he looked like then here it is martin did a uturn and dropped down a slanting concrete ramp to the emergency entrance at the hospital a cop at the entrance tried to wave them away but martin put the truck astride the main doors entrance ramp hopped out and showed the cop a card the cop stepped back and mejia said something that lucas thought might mean park the truck and they all went inside three doctors were standing in a hallway smoking they saw martin coming the americans trailing behind and the tallest of the three stepped toward them shaking his head muerto he said shit martin said they spoke for a minute in spanish then martin turned to mallard malone and lucas hes dead he died five minutes after they got here we will do an autopsy because the doctors arent quite sure why he died possibly shock possibly a stroke possibly something else like what they dont know can we see him im going to you may if you wish but you may not want to the three americans all looked at each other and malone said lets go the man called octavio diaz was lying faceup nude on a stainlesssteel medical cart his face was covered with blood his eyes had been poked out and his arms and legs were black lucas took a look and said jesus christ what happened to his mouth and hes black snipped his tongue off looks like with a pair of wire cutters the tall doctor said put his eyes out with a knife and it appears they did something to burn his ears so he couldnt see hear or speak he was dying when he arrived you cant see it so much but when we tried to get him out of his car look he picked up one of diazs feet and lifted it above the cart the leg hung in an almost perfect catenary arch down to his hip the bones have been minutely crushed in both legs and both arms that must have taken a while and they were very thorough picking him up getting him out of the car was like trying to pick up an oyster malone made a sour face at the comparison and said why didnt they just dump him out in the jungle sending a message lucas said martin nodded to anyone else who thinks the mejias have gone soft they wanted people to see this to see him alive the nurses and the doctors there will be stories everywhere in cancun in an hour wonder if they got anything out of him mallard asked looking down at the body what do you think malone asked she still had the sour face dont you think you might have answered the questions if they were doing that so if theyre looking for rinker or the assholes behind the shooting theyve probably got a jump on us lucas said he turned to the doctor can you tell from the wounds when this was all done the autopsy will give a good approximation how about between say eleven oclock and noon today the doctor nodded from the way the blood is crusted around the eyes from the extent of the bruising and discoloration im no pathologist but that might be a reasonable guess nice old man for a ganglord lucas said to malone to martin he may also have been sending a message to us with the timing i mean martin nodded not too much curiosity about this particular killing or the mejias will be forced to prove their innocence by naming two high fbi officials and an american police officer as their alibis and perhaps provide some details of what could be portrayed as an exceedingly cynical deal your english is really good lucas said they didnt have to do this mallard said moving his hand toward the ruins of octavio diaz the killing wasnt done for you martin said the timing of the killing possibly but that would be a minor aspect of it perhaps we are even reading too much into that mejia needed to send a message to the population i knew that i knew that diaz was a walking dead man but i hoped to find him before he died he looked at the body again reluctantly i was late tom and michelle lawton lived in a stucco house surrounded by rubber trees with one overhanging tangerine in atwater village off los feliz behind a concrete ditch that everyone in los angeles called a river down the river if thered been water in it and youd been allowed to boat it and if youd followed it far enough youd come to the port of long beach which is where the lawtons berthed their sailboat they got to the boat in a red jeep cherokee with a surfboard rack on top down and the rather than down the river the lawtons grew a little weed under lights kept a couple of redstriped cats and michelle read mystery stories and made tangerine marmalade and worked parttime in a chain bookstore while tom took meetings on his screenplay the screenplay involved the shadowy world of flesh smugglers who ran human cargo into the states against the best efforts of outmanned and outgunned american law enforcement officers played by one or both of the sheen brothers although tomd take jeanclaude van damme and a chick named heather if he had to the few people whod read the screenplay suggested that it wasnt realistic enough not enough violence they said not enough brutality a mailroom guy from icm told tom around a garden veggie sandwich in a bagel joint that it could use a little sexual and racial schtick maybe the human cargoes should be chinese sex slaves and he could try to sell the product to jackie chan what pissed tom off was that he and michelle were smugglers of human flesh neither one had ever owned a gun or had more than the briefest encounters with officers of the law for the good reason that they smuggled only one person at a time never anything but americans and those persons always had good documents which they brought themselves or tom supplied through a persian guy from pasadena who made really good texas drivers licenses the lawtons werent overwhelmingly busy as smugglers but their rates were high and a body a month pretty much covered their nut this particular body was a woman who would come across on wednesday evening she had her own id and it was good toms raaninmexico said at wednesday noon the lawtons took their boat the star of omaha out the long beach channel a six or eightknot breeze was blowing across the islands and they cut the diesel put up the sails and headed south taking their time they werent going to mexico they were going to a spot fifteen miles off san diego crossing the border was the job of their mexican contact a guy named juan duarte duarte owned a twentytwofoot boston whaler guardian with a hazegray hull just like the american coast guard but without the coast guards bowmounted fiftycaliber machine gun the hull color which was standard was the closest thing on earth to the romulans cloaking device from twenty feet on a dark night it was invisible juan put the body in the boat waited for dark then idled up the coast to a spot distinguished only by its gps coordinates he found the lawtons with their sails backed quietly waiting a couple of cigarette coals glowing in the dark though the star of omahas hull was white they were very nearly as invisible as the whaler dude duarte called using the international sailboat hailing sign juan how are you juan tossed a bowline over the sailboats foredeck and tom used it to pull the two boats together the lawtons had dropped foam fenders over the side to keep them from knocking too hard the body threw a bag into the sailboat then clambered up and over the side into the sailboats cockpit nice to see you tom said nodding at her in the dark the body nodded back she could smell tobacco on him a pleasant odor michelle passed a small package to juan its an olivewood rosary from jerusalem for your mom it was blessed in the church of the holy sepulcher where mt calvary is jimmy brought it back she said thank him for me juan said you good tom called down to juan juan held up a hand meaning that hed been paid and said cast me off there tom tossed the bowline back in the whaler and they drifted apart again see you juan called maybe got something week after next call me tom said that was pretty much all there was to it the lawtons gave the body apeanutbutterandtangerinemarmalade sandwich which shed ordered in advance through duarte they talked in a desultory way as they loafed through the night the body had a nice husky whiskey voice and tom thought if she kept talking he might get a little wood on the sound alone though hed never tell michelle that tom turned on the running lights a few miles north of the rendezvous they saw boats coming and going nothing came close by morning they were off long beach again and they took their time going in there was always a chance that theyd be stopped by the coasties but the passengers documents were good and the boat was clean tom had no idea who the body was his one really salient criminal characteristic was a determined lack of curiosity about his cargoes he was not even interested in why an american wanted to be smuggled back into the country there were any number of people who preferred to come and go without unnecessary timewasting bureaucratic entanglements and tom really didnt blame them we were the home of the free were we not a few minutes after eight oclock in the morning the body walked down the dock a cheap twa flight bag on her shoulder the lawtons were still on the boat stowing equipment the that the body left behind was taped to michelles butt just in case michelle last saw the other woman walking toward the corner of the ships store when she looked back again a moment later the body was gone rinker caught a cab to lax and from lax another to venice and from venice after getting a quick lunch on the beach and walking along some narrow canallined streets for a while watching her back she caught another one out to the industrial flats in downey the driver didnt much want to go there but when rinker showed him a fifty he took the money and dropped her in front of jackie burkes store burke ran a fulltime custom hotrod shop on the front side of his warehouse and a parttime stolencar chop shop in the back rinker had once solved a desperate problem for him burke was a chunky man strong darkcomplected balding tough as a lug nut his store smelled of spray paint and welding fumes he was standing beside the cash register sweating and talking over a hard board counter to a young japaneseamerican kid about putting a nitrox tank in the kids honda he didnt recognize rinker for a moment women didnt often come into the shop and he sort of nodded and said be with you in a minute and went back to the kid and then suddenly looked back rinker lifted her sunglasses and smiled burke said holy shit and then to the kid let me put you with one of my guys i gotta talk to this lady he held up a finger stuck his head through a door in the back yelled hey chuck cmere chuck came burke put him with the kid then led rinker into the back and to a tenbytwentyfoot plywoodenclosed office in the back he shut the door behind them and said again holy shit clara i hope uh i need a clean car thatll run good with good papers something dull like a taurus or some kind of buick sort of in a hurry she said i was hoping you could help me his eyes drifted toward the doors as though they might suddenly splinter are the cops v no she smiled again no cops i just got back in the country and i need a car not that you should mention it if you happen to bump into a cop no problem there burke said he relaxed a couple of degrees he liked clara all right but she was not a woman he would choose to hang out with i can get you something off a usedcar lot the guyll have to file the papers on it but he can push the date back for a while anyway not forever no hell have to put them through sooner or later cause of bank inventories if you only needed it for a month or so he could fake it out that far then if somebody inquired the papers would show the transfer to the dealer and hed show the transfer to you but there wouldnt be any license or insurance checks or anything i can guarantee you that itd be in perfect condition thatd work i wont need it for more than a month anyway she said where do i find the usedcar guy ill drive you over burke said you paying cash you think hed take a check she asked burke grinned not bothering to answer the mildly sarcastic question and said youre looking pretty good she smiled back and said thank you ive been down in mexico for a while got the tan look like youve been working out youve lost a little weight since you know cut off a couple pounds maybe she said got a little sick down there montezumas revenge more or less she said but her eyes were melancholy and burke had the feeling that the sickness had been more serious than that he didnt ask and after a pause rinker asked so wheres your usedcar guy much later that afternoon as they were parting she tossed her new rand mcnally road atlas onto the passenger seat and said if anybody from st louis calls you never saw me i never saw you ever burke said dont take this the wrong way but you make me nervous no reason for it she said not unless you cross me burke looked at her for a long three seconds and said finally tell you what honey if there was enough money in it i might mess with the guys in st louis but im nowhere stupid enough to mess with you good she said she stepped closer stood on her tiptoes and pecked him on the cheek jackie i owe you i will get back to you someday and we will work something out that will make you happy she waved got into the beetred olds shed bought for and drove away carefully like a little old lady from iowa down toward the freeway entrance burke went back inside his shop dug behind a stack of old phone books got his stash got his papers rolled a joint and walked out back to smoke it cool his nerves clara fuckin rinker burke thought she was pissed about something god help somebody and thank god it wasnt him rinker was headed east to st louis but not that minute instead she drove north on taking her time watching her speed she spent a bad night in coalinga rolling around in a kingsized bed thinking about old friends and paulo and wishing she still smoked in the morning tired her stomach scar aching she cut west toward the coast and took the into san francisco jimmy cricket was a golf pro with a closetsized downtown shop called jimrny crickets proline golf he was folding claiborne golf shirts when rinker walked in and he smiled and said can i help you he was wearing a royalblue vnecked sweater that nearly matched his eyes and dark khaki golf slacks that nearly matched his tan he had the toofriendly attitude of a man who would give you a halfstroke a hole without asking to see your handicap card the store was empty other than rinker so she saw no reason to beat around the bush id like to buy a couple of guns she said her voice casual holding his eyes semiauto nines if youve got them gotta be cold id take a ruger if you got it excuse me jimmys smile vanished he was taken aback this was agol shop there must be some mistake im roseanne jimmy rinker said you left me that gun i used to kill gerald mckinley you put it in a tree up in golden gate park and picked up two thousand dollars in twenties you remember that jesus jimmy said his adams apple bobbed mckinley he hadnt known what happened with the gun what it would be used for the mckinley killing had been in the papers for weeks as had the somewhat bereaved young wife and the very bereaved older exwife it was a sad thing rinker said a man in his prime cut down like that well jeez roseanne i dont know cut the crap jimmy ill give you two thousand bucks apiece for either two or three guns jimmy processed this for a minute and she could see it all trickling o down through his brain like raindrops of thought on a windowpane okay hed been offered money in the face of his denials if she was a cop itd be entrapment and if she was a cop and knew about the tree in the park he was probably fucked anyway ami if she were roseanne and he didnt sell her the guns then he might be truly and ultimately fucked therefore he would sell her the guns uh maybe you should step into the back the back was behind a green cloth curtain smelled of bubble wrap and cardboard and was full of golfclub shipping boxes and club racks at the far end was a workbench with a vise jimmy pushed a couple of boxes aside and pulled out a tan gym bag unzipped it and said this is what i got rinker watching his eyes decided he was okay took the bag stepped back and looked inside three revolvers and three semiautos all three semiautos were militarystyle mm berettas she took one out popped the magazine the magazine was empty cycled the action a couple of times did the same with the other two and said ill take them she looked at the revolvers one was a and she put it with the automatics you got any long guns no i know where you might be able to pick some up if you want to run down to bakersfield she shook her head naw i can get my own how about ammo i can give you a couple of boxes of federal hollowpoint for the nines but i dont have any on hand give me the nine she said silencer um i usually charge two thousand good ones are hard to get can you get it quick yes another two thousand if its a good one its a coeur dalene ill take it he fished around in another box and came up with a purple velvet bag that had once contained a bottle of scotch he handed it to her and said quick enough she took the bag slipped the silencer out it was a coeur dalene all right the absolutely faultless blued finish was the signature somewhere a master machinist was doing artwork she screwed the silencer onto one of the nines and flipped it out to arms length to test the balance good ill take the whole bunch jimmy nodded said okay moved some more boxes around picked up a small one reached inside and produced two boxes of ninemillimeter ammunition he handed them to her and asked you in town for long her mouth wasnt grim but she wasnt exactly radiating warmth i was never here she said gotcha said jimmy cricket rinker spent the night in a motel outside sacramento drawing squares and triangles on a yellow legal pad killing wasnt hard any asshole could kill somebody doing it often and getting away with it every time was much harder what had made her a good killer besides the lack of revulsion with the job was her ability to plan she planned with yellow pads not in words and paragraphs but in triangles and spirals a few with names above them some with lines connecting them to other symbols sometimes she made maps aside from the killing rinker hadnt been much different from other young successful businesswomen in wichita kansas until her fa cade broke down and shed had to run shed owned a friendly country bar called the rink with dancing all the time and live music on weekends she had a nice apartment that shed decorated herself went parttime to wichita state and would have liked to have had a pet but traveled too much to feel good about it she didnt like fuzzy stuffed animal toys or chocolate hearts but did tarry at times in front of victorias secret display windows she had an interest in makeup read a couple of womens magazines liked to dance got a massage once a month and would drink a beer or a glass of wine she liked guns and the power that grew out of them knew enough about semiautos to do her own trigger jobs wasnt much interested in cars like that lying on the bed in sacramento she wrote four names on her legal pad john ross nanny dichter andy levy paul dallaglio all of them knew her face all of them had the clout to send a gun to kill her all of them had probably agreed to do it since they all talked to each other wouldnt have wanted to go against the others and because all four must have been worried about her running around loose the problem was rinker knew way too much she knew where the bodies were buried and that wasnt a joke not in the several states where the four men operated all those good states having opted for capital punishment if rinker was taken alive and if she decided to cut a deal rinker lay on the bed and put together an outline she could fill it in while she drove from sacramento to st louis is three solid days if youre driving a used oldsmobile dont want to attract attention and stay with it rinker took four days passing from one fm station to the next hard rock to soft jazz to country through two sets of mountains with a desert between them then out on the great plains to cheyenne into denver across kansas and missouri on into st louis red roof inn and best western bp and shell mcdonalds and burger king and taco bell and the colonel she stopped at four different shopping centers she got her hair cut tight to her head punky so that a wig would fit over it she bought wigs good ones in black red and blond shoulderlength she talked to a woman at a nordstroms makeup bar about a mexican friend of hers who had suffered a facial burn and needed some dark coverup makeup to conceal the burn and she got instruction on how to use it she played with the makeup trying to make herself look mexican but it never quite worked instead of brown she looked orange and odd she eventually decided that the black wig looked okay with just a bit of dark eyebrow pencil as long as she wore longsleeved blouses with a couple of changes of clothes one from nordstroms one from kmart shed have six distinct looks even a good friend of the nordstroms perky light lady would never recognize the funky kmart red and she made some calls cautiously had to call three times starting with the first day in l a before she finally got through said this is me you remember me oh my god where are you at out east pennsylvania hows life ive run out of time like we talked about what are you going to do you know ive got an idea but i havent worked it out yet ill call you back whens good three oclock is good like now this line yeah this is as good as any you never know though never know what might be monitored get you a clean phone rinker said ill call again three oclock when shed been pushed out of her life forced to go on the run rinker had been killing people for a long time felt like a long time anyway she was not deliberately cruel in her paid assassinations she did the shooting and went on her way a businesswoman taking care of business she had once been necessarily cruel to a man in minnesota whod betrayed her but that had been a matter of survival she still thought about him from time to time she wasnt morbidly fascinated or neurotically fixated but the image of his body tied to the bed sometimes popped into her minds eye as she drifted off to sleep the fear hed shown she thought about the fear as she drove and the other fears she inspired the people whod directed her whod used her as a weapon had no reason to fear her guns because rinker was entirely loyal to friends these were people whod helped her out of a life that had been headed straight for a whitetrash ghetto she appreciated that if the cops had taken her she would have gone to the gas chamber or the death gurney or whatever it was without saying a word these former friends didnt know that or decided they couldnt be sure if theyd simply tried to kill her and had failed she might have let it go on the rational grounds that if she hit back at them she was putting herself at risk they hadnt just failed theyd killed her lover theyd killed her baby and they were most likely still looking for her now not just from fear of the consequences if she was caught but fear of her guns no matter where she went there was always the possibility that some asshole from st louis would pick her out of a crowd and another gun would be sent there was no question that her survival in cancun had been a matter of luck as rinker had once told another woman whod been interested in her business anyone can be killed if the assassin is patient enough and the victim is not aware of a particular threat she didnt exempt herself from that truism shed never felt a thing in cancun she hadnt known shed been spotted hadnt known shed been stalked the only guarantee of survival was the elimination of the threat and there was the revenge factor shed had few friends as a child shed taken care of her younger brother who was somehow wrong in the head not stupid but constantly preoccupied even as a baby but he was not really a friend he was too much younger and too psychologically distant there were two or three girls from school that she could recall but only one that was close the one she hoped was still living in st louis her stepfather and older brother had thoroughly abused her and the sense of abuse had kept people away in that part of the country nobody would say much but people would know and stay clear watching rinker grow up was like watching a slowmotion car wreck her life in st louis hadnt been much different the people she knew well with three or four exceptions mostly feared her then shed been in wichita and in wichita thered been two or three people that she might have become close to but she hadnt quite gotten there when the cops had broken her out then shed had to run and almost magically everything had changed shed found a friend in mexico in paulo both a lover and a friend the beginnings of several friendships really and the beginning of a family she loved paulo and she also liked and laughed with and felt safe with his brothers and his parents they seemed to like her back shed started taking birth control pills when things got serious with paulo but after a few months when she needed to refill the prescription she simply hadnt kept thinking gotta do it but didnt the missed period could have been natural a change in the way she lived but she knew better than that felt nothing stirring yet but felt heavier more serious a child then the gun and paulo was gone and the child and the family driving across the high plains late at night she had what she later thought was a vision or wideawake dream she saw her child a girl a darkhaired kid playing on a tree swing in what must have been the yucatan paulo was there wearing a pair of white pleated shorts barechested and barefoot pushing her water in the background so it must have been near the coast and then the little girl screamed with laughter and paulo stopped pushing her and walked around the path of the swing and rinker could see a hand her hand with a popsicle reaching toward paulo their hands touched and there was a spark and he was gone with the vision she snapped back to the present and far away saw the lights of a truck approaching down the interstate how long shed been on mental cruise control she didnt know but she felt that shed been there in a different future she could see the little girl now her little girl in her minds eye and paulo five years older and her own life and she began to weep holding tight to the steering wheel weaving down the highway if the people in st louis feared her guns they had good reason rinker got off the interstate highway system at kansas city made a phone call from a mall a man answered with an abrupt what rinker leaning on a trashy southmissouri accent asked is this arveeda sound like fuckin arveeda the phone crashed down on the hook and she smiled t j baker was still in residence and from the sound of it still an asshole out of kansas city she turned south on local highways headed for the town of tisdale fifteen miles east of springfield the biggest industry in tisdale was the poultryprocessing factory which killed and plucked six thousand chickens a day and left the entire town smelling like wet chickenshit and burned feathers hell of a thing she thought when the thing you remembered most about your hometown was the bad smell at midafternoon she stopped again made another call a man answered sgt mccallum ordnance she smiled and hung up she dialed again a different number and a different man answered yes the voice was a slap in the face and her lingering smile vanished the last time shed heard the voice shed been threatening its owner with death she almost hung up but hesitated yes hello rinker said you killed my baby i wanted you to know that i was pregnant and a piece of slug hit me in the stomach and i lost the baby he was as startled as shed been a moment earlier he got it together and said clara i heard something about this but i dont lie to me im coming to kill you and i wanted to give you time to think about it instead of just popping up and shooting you in the head i want you to think about what youre losing all the rest of your life after a moment of silence the man chuckled and said ah shit what can i tell you bring it on clara you know where to find me ill tell you what though dont let me catch you id have to make an example out of you now you got anything else thats about it youll be hearing from me the man laughed and said yeah well take it easy honey you too t j baker lived in a weathered white house next to a creek outside the west city limit of tisdale the house was surrounded by a chainlink fence two pit bulls roamed the yard only marginally restrained by their long chains baker was rough with the dogs whipping them regularly with a wide leather belt until they screamed with anger theyd be killing rough on anyone who crossed into the yard while they were out though that was not likely to happen the fence was spotted with signs that said beware of dog and if an illiterate trespasser happened along one look at the dogs themselves would be warning enough rinker called baker twice from springfield once at six oclock and once after dinner at seven and got no answer baker had always preferred the second shift at the chicken factory because it gave him daylight with the dogs or to hunt or kill anyway his greatest joy was sniping rats at the landfill when the second call got no answer she called the chicken factory asked for baker by name and finally was put through to a man who said hang on i gotta find him he was here a minute ago ah thats okay if hes not right there ill call back whatever she got in the olds and drove out of springfield thought about driving past the place shed grown up where her mother still lived but decided against it there was really nothing she wanted to see nobody she wanted to talk to she went instead to tisdale through town past the dairy queen and habers drivein root beer which was closed boarded up past the bank and the pharmacy and the bakery and out the west side bakers house was on a county road his nearest neighbor a hair mile away his driveway ended at a ramshackle garage that looked as though it had been too long blown upon by the northwest wind it leaned toward the house shingles peeling off paint shedding into the pastelpink hollyhocks that surrounded the brick foundation rinker pulled nosein to the gate the dogs had been sitting near their stake in the middle of the yard in a dirt circle worn free of grass when she pulled up they stood silently watching when she lifted the latch on the gate they moved like blackandtan leopards toward her still silent disciplined like soldiers dragging their long chains she walked the gate open careful to stay out of range of the dogs got back in her car and drove up to the garage now she was in killing range and the dogs moved up to the drivers side of the car they were snuffling a sound that was almost a growl but not quite the throaty slavering was actually more threatening than a growl they sounded like they wanted to eat rinker reached under the seat and took out the shed bought a box of standardvelocity hollowpoints at a walmart in kansas city she checked it almost unconsciously then ran the window down the bigger of the two dogs stood on its hind feet its front feet lightly on the door it was peering directly at her and she remembered reading in a book somewhere about a killing dog that had eyes like coal this was that dog the black eyes peered at her hungered after her this dog wanted her no romantic when it came to dogs she pointed the pistol at the animals head and shot it between the coalblack eyes no romantic itself it dropped dead the other dog took a step back looking at its dead companion before it could do anything else rinker killed it the two shots sounded like nothing else but shots if anyone was at the house a half mile away the shots might have sounded like popcorn popping two light pops in the evening breeze coming from bakers house she doubted that anyone would be curious on the other hand there was no point in taking chances she dragged the dead dogs back to the stake in the middle of the yard and rolled them upright as though they were sleeping on duty bakers back door had another sign forget the dog beware of owner ranker ignored it and used the butt of the pistol to knock a hole in the window she reached through flipped the bolt and let herself in baker had two gun cabinets that she knew of both of them bolted into the concrete floor in the basement neither was really a safe in the strictest sense but they wouldnt be easy to get into either rinker intended to use an ax on the doors and if that didnt work well bad luck for baker shed wait for him to come home now she called out anybody home nothing but silence she went to the basement door turned on the light and went down the stairs the two gun safes sat at the far end of the basement one of them was open an inch empty unlikely more likely that baker just started feeling safe all these years gone by with no burglaries the dogs in the yard his reputation fuckin baker she thought leaving the door like that was purely laziness she reached out to pull it open but with her hand just an inch away she stopped boy that was convenient the way the door just hung there rinker didnt believe that life was easy something was wrong she stepped away looked around spotted a length of twobytwo propped in a corner she got it stood back away from the safe and eased the door open the shotgun blast nearly killed her not from the steel shot but from the shock of it the gun was behind her under the stairs the blast had gone right past her into the gun safe she staggered back away from it her legs stinging her hands at her ears she was deaf her head aching her eyes watering her legs hurt she looked down her jeans looked okay but when she lifted the pant legs she found little stripes of blood trickling down into her socks she left the gun safe and went back upstairs and peeled off the pants in the light of the kitchen shed been hit by three pellets all ricochets all buried just beneath her skin she popped them out with her fingertips found some bandaids and a bottle of peroxide in the bathroom wiped the wounds and bandaged them fuckin baker as she worked the ringing in her ears faded and she could again hear her feet moving around on the bathroom floor when she was done she went back downstairs and looked at the nowempty doublebarreled shotgun it had been rigged with a simple wire on a pulley the wire ran from the safe door through a hole in the back of the safe to a pulley on the wall up to the ceiling joists across another pulley to the stairs down to the trigger on the shotgun the trigger itself had the lightest pull shed ever experienced in a weapon she was tempted to rig it backward pointing up the stairs but hell it was his house she went back up the stairs out to the garage got bakers ax carried it into the basement and went after the second gun safe she worked at it methodically and it took her five minutes cutting through the front then using the ax handle to pry a gap in the metal there were nine rifles in the safe all with scopes four boltaction varmint rifles two in and two in three boltactions in larger calibers a remington mm magnum a steyr and a winchester plus two semiautos a ruger ranch rifle in and a militarystyle ar also in three gun cases were stacked beside the safes each could handle two rifles she packed the three larger calibers plus the ar and the two boltactions and carried them up to the car she threw the other three rifles on top of the packed guns and around them she stacked seventeen boxes of ammunition two shooters sandbags two packs of paper targets and a sawhorse with a clamp on the bottom which was used to hold the targets she didnt need all the stuff but couldnt afford to be selective gun thieves wouldnt be and shed prefer that nobody got the idea that clara rinker had long guns as she was leaving she thought again about the shotgun and thought about burning the house down decided against it looking at the lumps of dead dog in the front yard pretty even she thought though her ears were still ringing she left tisdale an hour after dark headed northeast toward st louis in the dark she crossed a river stopped and threw the three loose rifles into the dark water she spent the night halfway up the state in a cash motel in the town of diffley there was an abandoned quarry outside diffley where the locals sightedin their guns not many people went and in her gunning days shed often driven down from st louis to work with new pistols the next morning she got an eggandsausage mcmuffin at mcdonalds then drove out to the quarry she was alone and spent an hour sighting the rifles leaving the ar for last the ar looked a lot like jaimes m and even had a selector switch she fired off a couple of single rounds landing them just where shed expected then she flipped the selector switch aimed it and squeezed off a burst whoa it was fullauto she looked around a little selfconsciously if anyone had heard that she could be in trouble all the guns were right on as she expected after the burst of automatic fire she decided shed better get out of town she quickly but carefully repacked the guns got out of the quarry and drove the familiar homey roads into st louis shed always liked the place neat town lots of things to do good bars and she was a student of good bars rolled down along forest park stopped in central west end and got a sandwich picked up a book and walked around in the afternoon getting back into the feel of the place she did a little shopping and then at four oclock went down to the southeast corner of the city to soulard along the mississippi she sat in the car and drew more triangles and squares on her yellow legal pad as she watched the people come and go on the sidewalk she thought about the vision shed had of the darkhaired girl closed her eyes and let the feeling corne back but now all she had was a memory the vision was gone outside the car a woman walked by carrying a string bag with what looked like a green glass lamp inside she was a large woman and rinker sat up when she saw her coming then she thought after a minute too old the woman she was looking for was three years older than rinker her name now was dorothy pollock before they left cancun lucas asked malone if she could either lend him a copy of the rinker file hed scanned in the plane coming down or make a copy and send it to him in minneapolis she shook her head a lot of that stuff is speculation were not even supposed to show it to you the first time you mean its classified or something like that like if it got out rinker could sue you like if it got out there are about a hundred people who could sue us they wouldnt but theyd be calling up their friends in congress whod be pissing and moaning about violations of privacy and human rights and the way we spend our budget if i cant copy it could i read it overnight spend some time with it sure she said it without thinking because she didnt actually know him very well give it back to me in the morning the blue palms didnt have a business center but the hilton did in the evening after dinner lucas told mallard he felt like a walk the heavy food and all he strolled six blocks down to the hilton and talked to the concierge about the business center he was a writer from los angeles he said and he needed access to a xerox machine very late in the evening as soon as he finished compiling his research would it be possible to rent one of the hiltons machines for a couple of hours that courtesy was not usually extended outside the hotel the concierge said he would have to think about it and after thinking about it he decided that it would be a generous thing to do and would help the hiltons image with traveling businessmen at one in the morning lucas walked back with the file met the concierge and took care of the rental and courtesy fees by twothirty hed finished copying the file and by three oclock was safely back in bed the copy snugged away with his shirts the next morning they gathered in the lobby to check out and lucas gave mallard a look mallard turned away thered been no moment with malone lucas thought he muttered chicken and malone asked what nothing lucas held on to malones copy of the rinker file until they got to houston where they split up if theres anything i can do call me lucas said he handed the file back to her sorry i wasnt more help in cancun if i think of anything from the file ill call you helped mallard said between us we gave old man mejia ummm a dearer view of the situation there are things that malone and i just cant say lucas nodded whatever ill be watching you guys when are you going to st louis we re already moving our setup crew in malone and i will be there as soon as theres any hint that shes there mallard said given her whole psychology the way she was abused from the time she was a kid then her true love getting shot and losing the baby can vou think of any more likely place than st louis to pull her in lucas shook his head nope if i were her id be there malone smiled at him her nasty lawyers smile thats another reason we asked you you two think alike lucas was back in minneapolis by midafternoon having unexpectedly survived both flights he stopped first at the new house counted six guys working on it talked to the foreman and was told that the cable and telephone wiring was going in the next day he collected a sample pad of parquet blocks that the designer was proposing for the library floor and headed downtown marcy sherrill was sitting at her desk staring at a computer screen when lucas walked in hows cancun she asked looking up hot and humid full of foreigners lucas said he yawned already a long day anything new ummm bob cline croaked yesterday did you know him yeah vaguely cline was an aging radio talk show host known for his unwavering support of the police department no matter who had done what howd he die heart attack i guess he was at a saints game and he was on his way home when he pulled over to the side of the road and died called on the car phone but never said a word not a bad way to go anything else rose marie wants you to come by she called twice the homicide guys sloan basically got the name of a kid in that busstop driveby on thirtythird they say hes the one but they cant find him his family says he went to new york which probably means we oughta look in la thats it thats it all right ill go talk to rose marie he yawned again whatre you doing she yawned back picking it up from him vacation and comp time report okay he opened his briefcase took out the copy of the fbi report which hed transferred from his suitcase and handed it to her i sneaked a copy this is illegal read it and tell me what you think how was malone she asked the question with a tone be nice lucas said shes dating apaperhanger or something you mean like hitler what shed lost him hitler was supposed to be a wallpaper guy or something before he became a dictator oh well hes not exactly like hitler i dont think ill ask her next time i see her read the file mallards in love with her with malone marcy perked up which one told you that or did you just perceive it mallard told me i told him to grab her ass but he didnt jesus lucas grab her assv she was appalled you know what i mean make a move grab her ass sherrill said shaking her head he told him to grab her ass not exactly that then he had to explain but it was too late as soon as the word ass had come out of his mouth hed fulfilled all female expectations of insensitivity and nothing more was necessary he finally gave up trying to explain and went to see rose marie roux the chief of police lucas sometimes suspected that the chief was a selfswitching manicdepressive willing herself into periods of gloom or frenzy as an antidote to the emotional control required of her chiefdom when he walked into her office and found her smoking one cigarette while another one burned in an ashtray on the windowsill he realized that shed pushed herself into the manic youre gonna get busted someday on the cigarettes he grunted waving a hand through the layered smoke her office smelled like a seventies bowling alley and indoor smoking was prohibited in minneapolis im down fifteen pounds since i started smoking again she said when i get down twenty ill go on a program to maintain the weight and then quit again i just didnt quit the right way last time thats the stupidest thing youve ever said lucas said irritably in the meantime youve got two cigarettes going yeah yeah she snuffed out both butts dug through a pile of paper on her desk and said sherrill got the top score lucas smiled dropped into her guest chair excellent i thought she might which means that if we can get pellegrino to retire i can slip her into that slot as a temporary replacement shed have to wear a uniform for a month or so but then leman will go in september and i can move her into his slot and shed be set its a regular lieutenants job shell be good at it lucas said not only that shell owe us rose marie said so what about pellegrino im talking to him hes at the max percentage for his retirement so his only reason to stay here is to pick up any pay raises that come along but if he moves over to the state hes in a whole different retirement plan so he gets a double dip theres a slot in the public information office thats empty and hed be perfect for it is he gonna take it lucas asked yes his wifes nervous but shes coming around what about the governor unless he commits to you publicly hes making the announcement friday ill take over as of november ill leave here october and you can leave anytime you want you probably wouldnt actually get pushed until the new guy comes in and that might not be until the first of the year im gonna go when you go lucas said but jesus two and a half months if were gonna swap marcy for pellegrino we gotta get him out of here quick hell put in his papers next week they talked about the personnel maneuvers for another ten minutes the mayor was not running for reelection and none of the leading candidates would reappoint rose marie as chief shed made too many bureaucratic enemies during her tenure so she was out but as a former longtime state senator she had solid political connections and loyalties when the governor elmer henderson had gone looking for a new director for the department of public safety a group of her political pals had had a quiet word with him and shed been anointed as soon as the deal was done shed begun shuffling members of her city management team into protected job slots marcy sherrill would be the new head of intelligence and slipping old departmental enemies into jobs where they would be lethally exposed the new mayor might not be willing to appoint rose marie to a third term as chief but he was going to get her team whether he liked it or not with a few exceptions lucas was a pure political appointee with no civilservice protection at all and his job would expire with hers rather than try to find a protected slot hed agreed to follow her to the state where he would head a new special investigations team with the state bureau of criminal apprehension del capslock would leave minneapolis at the same time to join lucass team lucas had also quietly offered a job to his old friend sloan but sloan had decided to stay with the city he was nonpolitical liked what he was doing didnt need the double dip and suspected that the state job would take him out of town too much when they finished the personnel talk rose marie leaned back in her chair lit a cigarette with a blue plastic bic and asked was it rinker yes they think shes headed up to st louis gonna kill a few assholes rose marie shrugged and said part of the overhead lucas agreed if you went into organized crime sooner or later youd get the bill yeah for rinker too theyre gonna try to trap her theyre already papering the motels and hotels and bars with the old photographs and the composites theyre moving a big special team in all hushhush theyve mostly cut out the st louis cops are you going back down if they ask i guess lucas said its an interesting situation a top killer turning on her own people with all her special knowledge with her record of successful hits the knuckleheads gotta be pretty freaked out and no matter what happens the fbi wins rose marie said peering at the ceiling if she kills a few people they can squeeze the rest of the assholes with protection deals if they catch her they can squeeze her with the death penalty yeah and shes out for revenge too so if the feebs get their hands on her theyve got that going another reason for her to talk not much downside rose marie puffed on the cigarette exhaled smiled and said the governor liked that shit we did with qatar qatar was a recently deceased serial killer if we could squeeze a little more good pr out of st louis itd be worth doing elmer got elected on his family money and everybody considered him a pencilnecked geek he likes the idea or having his own goon squad makes his testicles swell up i thought it was idealism lucas said rose marie snorted let me know when anything happens on the way out of the building an oldtimer cop sidled toward him and lucas said ah jesus hempsted go away i just got a business tip for you the cop protested you heard about the big pillsbury merger right something about it lucas admitted well after everything was said and done pillsbury wound up owing the trojan company what yeah theyre coming up with a selfrising condom get away from me dickweed youre laughing to yourself davenport hempsted called after him i can always tell weather karkinnen was sitting at her desk in her office at hennepin general peering into a computer monitor lucas caught her unaware and leaned in the doorway watching her face shed put on weight with the pregnancy had gone rounder and softer shed always been a sailor the girl on the foredeck hauling on the spinnaker wide shoulders and crooked nose the sunbleached hair and windburned cheekbones the softness and weight was so different hed seen her just out of bed in the morning standing naked in front of a doormounted mirror measuring the changes in herself she moaned about the weight about the changes in her figure but lt all sounded to lucas like the war stories hed heard from other women whod gone through childbirth stories akin to male basicraining tales but female a bunch of women sitting around talking a ut water weight and stretch marks and ultrasounds and episiotomies you look terrific he said and she jumped god dont do that she said smiling blue eyes crinkling at the corners she stood up stretched and came around the desk put her arms around his waist and stood on tiptoe to kiss him i mean it he said he had her hands on her waist his thumbs near her navel the growing part of her you make my heart feel funny when i look at you that kind of talk could get you somewhere she said when did you get back just a few minutes ago lucas said talked to rose marie the conspiracy is flourishing shell quit minneapolis in the middle of october and move over to the state on november first thatll be the busy season with the baby coming lucas nodded i dont have to be there the exact minute she is im thinking i could quit minneapolis when she does but not move over to the state until december or january have a couple of months off to get the house together and you and the kid set up she tapped him on the chest thats the best idea youve had in weeks so well do that he said how about rinker was it her are you going to be involved maybe the feebs think shes headed for st louis as soon as something happens theyll let me know what they want to do but nothing happened a week went by lucas and weather spent one sunday sailing in a regatta on lake minnetonka and lucas took two days to work on his wisconsin cabin never far from the cell phone finally he called mallard whats up malones been out in la squeezing the brother not getting much he probably doesnt know much if that file was right its a little more than that hes borderline mentally impaired not dumb exactly but not quite right the public defender is giving us a hard time about holding him but were gonna hang on anyway we figure we can keep him for a couple of months before we have to go to trial how about clara nothing shes gone mallard said you still think doesnt matter what i think st louis is what ive got and thats what im sticking with dorothy pollock was a heavyset hardfaced woman pale from a life under fluorescent lights a duck waddler with bad feet from standing on concrete floors a victim of ballardmcclain avionics where she worked at a drillpress station her job came to this she would take a nickelsized aluminum disk from a tupperware pan full of disks and an extruded aluminum shaft about the length and thickness of a pencil from a pan full of shafts each disk had a collar at the center with a hole through the collar so it looked like a small wheel pollock would fit the end of a shaft through the hole make axiinch freshly drilled hole through the collar and shaft and then tap an aluminum rivet into the hole finally shed use a pair of hand pinchers to crush the ends of the rivet fixing the disk to the shaft shed drop the finished shaft which would become a tuning knob on a radio into another plastic bin then shed make another one every hour or so the foreman would come by and take away the finished shafts pollock was expected to finish a hundred shafts every shift she got two fifteenminute breaks one in the morning and one in the afternoon and a half hour for lunch which she could stretch to forty minutes if she didnt do it too often she made an hour and the year before had gotten a centanhour raise which worked out to a little more than three percent or a week shed taken the raise but hadnt been doing any handsprings about it if she saved all the extra money for a month shed have just enough after deductions for social security state and federal income taxes and union dues to pay for a bad haircut she wasnt all that unhappy when clara rinker came along and offered to pay her a thousand dollars a week for her spare room not that she had much choice if shed thought about it twelve years earlier in memphis pollock had killed her husband roger in his sleep by hitting him six times on the head with a hammer while she was hiding out in alabama shed read a smartass newspaper column in the commercialappeal that quoted a prosecutor as saying the first four whacks could have been emotional but the last two indicated intent they were looking for her on a firstdegree murder warrant the cops never caught up with her rinker had in fact taken her in had hidden her had used her special skills to get pollock a new name an apartment and a job pollock had been walking home from work sweating from the humid evening heat through the breadsmelling yeasty air outside the anheuserbusch brewery carrying a plastic grocery sack containing a loar of white bread a vacuumsealed variety pack of sliced salami and a sixpack of lowcal custard puddings when she saw rinker cutting across the street toward her she hadnt seen rinker for three years except in the newspapers she stopped and said delighted smiling clara my lord where you been girl been a while patsy clara said smiling back and calling pollock by her real name my lord you looked pollock said and thought she does she and ranker went back to childhood growing up in similar trashy small towns both had changed pollock for the worse rinker for the better pollock had always been too tall too skinny with hands and feet too big for her bones over the years shed put on sixty pounds and limped with the weight and weariness like a woman fifteen years older rinker on the other hand was wearing jeans and a white blouse that looked fitted to her with a haircut that cost a hell of a lot more than thirty dollars and she held herself as rich ladies did straight up easywalking casualeyed small hoop earrings that looked like gold you still drink beer clara asked course i do you got some a sackful of corona and a couple of lemons i gotta talk to you about something rinker got a grocery bag out of her car and she and pollock walked side by side down the slanting sidewalk pollock had a twobedroom apartment in a red brick house that had been painted white and looked as though mark twain might have walked past it an elm tree had once stood in the patch of front yard but had died years back of dutch elm disease the stump was still there along with what her neighbors called a sucker maple a clump of foliage that was a cross between a tree and a bush pollocks apartment was twobedroom only technically the second bedroom might have been more useful as a closet pollock called it her shit room because thats where she put all the shit she didnt use much the place smelled of twelve years of baked potatoes and cheddar cheese and nicotine and human dirt a small dry aquarium sat in a corner the goldfish long gone a photograph of jesus hung over the tv his hands pressed together in prayer his eyes turned heavenward his sacred heart glowing through his robe rinker followed pollock through the door and looked around she didnt say nice place because pollock was too old a friend and they both knew exactly what kind of place it was the kind of place that you could still rent for two hundred and fifty dollars a month utilities included pollock dropped her grocery sack on the kitchen table and said you want some ice in that beer wouldnt mind rinker said theyd drunk iced beer when they were kids she put her bag on the table next to pollocks fished out a couple of bottles and twisted the tops off pollock found glasses and filled them with ice put a slice of lemon in each and a dash of salt they went out to the front room and pollock dropped on her couch rinker took the lazboy poured a little of the corona over the ice and held her glass up big city she said pollock held hers up big city they both took a sip and then pollock said whats going on im running from the cops rinker said i need a place to stay for a couple of weeks you got one pollock said promptly more complicated than that patsy rinker said this is heavy shit everybody in the world is gonna be looking for me the fbi the st louis cops if they find me here and take you in and fingerprint you youre toast pollock shook her head makes no nevermind to me you got a place when i was running you kept me for three months besides they put me in jail couldnt be no fuckin worse than this place and my job i got a load of money rinker said it wont cover the risk but ill give you a thousand a week plus whatever i got left over at the end oliock opened her mouth to object but rinker held up an imperious finger dont want to hear about it im leavin the money and you take it and spend it on something stupid i can do that no doubt about it pollock said maybe buy a stairclimber or something she sucked up an ice cube ran it a couple of times around her mouth and then spit it back into the beer so tell me what youre up to pollock threw most of the shit out of the shit room and rinker put down an inflatable guest mattress shed bought at a target store with a sheet and an acrylic blanket her clothes stayed in her suitcase pollocks landlady had an extra space in the garage next door and pollock walked around the house and rented it thirty dollars a month so that rinker would have a place to put the california car that night rinker left pollock in front of her television and began to scout the men shed come to kill nanny dichter was the richest of the bunch with a home in frontenac he had a fountain on the front lawn the fountain in the figure of a small girl with a water jug on her back was carved out of golden marble imported from austria dichter sold drugs and had for most of his adult life hed been one of the first to make cocaine imports into a business instead of an adventure he was married had two sons and four daughters and three or four livein servants he owned the majority interest in a chain of midwestern mallbased import stores that sold native art to the aesthetically impaired and provided a convenient network for his bulk cocaine sales paul dallaglio worked with dichter taking care of competitive issues which was how hed met rinker hed used her nine times and paid her a little more than a half million dollars he lived not far from dichter in a home on a heavily wooded lot in creve coeur he was executive vice president and part owner of the import chain andy levy was a banker and worked a straight job as vice president of development with first heartland national of st louis he handled most of the mob money in st louis including rinkers before she moved to wichita he lived in a huge old redbrick cube in central west end and was a patron of the performing arts he dated dancers and sometimes actresses rinker had killed levys wife and her lawyer when the marriage went on the rocks and the lawyer was foolish enough to threaten levy with the exposure of his money operation levy liked to walk in forest park hed once been banned from the zoo for throwing centercut pork chops to the lions finally there was john ross whod originally recruited rinker and taught her the gun trade ross ran an overworld liquor distributorship and had interests in vending machine and trucking businesses he had parallel shadow businesses in cocaine sports betting and loansharking he was retail to nanny dichters wholesale hed also acted as rinkers agent selling her guns for cash and taking his cut in clout rather than money ross lived off a semiprivate street in ladue in the center of six acres of lawn hed been rinkers friend and protector though when shed been broken out by the cops hed tried to have her killed she gave him that one because of their history but had warned him at the time that if there was another unsuccessful attempt shed be coming for him dichter and ross were smart and personally violent dallaglio was essentially a criminal executive who worked by remote control hed never gotten his hands bloody but he did know how to protect himself levy barely thought of himself as criminal he was just a guy who knew some guys and like a bunch of rotarians they all threw business at each other every one of the four men knew too much about each of the others and more than enough about rinker while any one of the rur could have authored the assassination in canciin it was un ikely that any one of them would have done it on his own hook hey walked carefully around each other and none of them would want to be blamed if something had gone wrong as it had theyd have talked rinker slept in pollocks room for three more days going out at night getting a handle on the town she knew it well from her days as a dancer and with ross at the liquor warehouse but there were always changes and shed never really surveyed it from the perspective of an assassin she needed to know what was open and when where she could ditch if she ran into trouble where she could pick up a car in a hurry where the targets did their business as she wandered around town she refined her ideas about her approaches to the targets one night she dropped pollock at a country joint with twenty dollars and a handsized sony tape recorder and told her to sit as close to the jukebox as she could have a couple of beers and taperecord the bar pollock did all of that and rinker listened to the tape on the way back home the tape sounded fine and reminded her of the rink she made the first open move on a monday night with a stop at the bluesnote cafe at lacledes landing on the river the bluesnote was owned by john sellos the club had never done well and without a variety of minor criminal activities the barkeeps ran a sportsbetting business and a back room became an informal office for a fence and a branch office for one of rosss loan sharks the place would have closed fifteen years earlier as it was it struggled and sellos worried incessantly rinker wore black jeans for the job a black blazer and black nike running shoes she carried one of the ninemillimeter pistols in her jacket pocket she parked a block from the club and sat in the car for a while gathering herself watching the street she knew she frightened people but she knew that was only an edge physically she was in good shape but a large man was still a large rnan even an outofshape cigarette freak like jackie burke in la or timmv cricket in san francisco could pull her arms off if he was pissed or desperate and forgot about her reputation for a minute that meant that when she wanted to talk to a man she had to get on top of him immediately she didnt have to flash the gun but it had to be there in his minds eye right from the start she had to be the coldeyed killer right inside his shirt a blond couple the woman a little wobbly and a single man in cowboy boots went into the bluesnote as she watched and one man left the man who left stopped just outside the door and looked up and down the street looking for action which meant that not much was going on inside the club when rinker had run her bar in wichita shed hated the sight of a man looking both ways on the sidewalk outside the rink hadnt come through for him after watching for ten minutes she got out of the car hung a purse on her shoulder and walked down to the club the door was surrounded with predistressed wood that was now genuinely distressed the doorknob rattled under her hand she stepped inside the door paused let her eyes adjust to the gloom a longhaired young man sat on a dais at the end of the main room a guitar on one knee he was saying learned this song from an old indian guy up in dakota i was working the wheat harvest this was back in rinker thought jesus when she could see rinker walked along the left wall straight back to the kitchen doors through the doors and up the stairs she knew the place from her years at the liquor warehouse nothing had changed he door at the upper landing was closed but there was light coming through the crack at the bottom she put a hand on the pistol in her pocket and pushed through the door sellos was sitting behind his desk when rinker pushed through door without knocking he jumped saw her face and settled back into his chair you scared me he said smiling hopefully good she said she kept her hand in her pocket noticed that sellos was watching that hand and said yeah i got a gun you gonna shoot me i havent done anything to you he was a thin man with a big nose and a yellowish tint to his skin he looked as though somebody large had blown nicotine and tar on him he looked like he should be wearing a brown fedora i didnt come here to shoot you rinker said i need about four of your cell phones and i need you to make a call for me whatevers good he said if you mess with me ill shoot you right in the heart rinker said she eased her hand out of her pocket letting him see the gun with the fat snout i got no patience for being messed around his adams apple bobbed once and he said i dont have the phones here i gotta make a call call she waggled the pistol at the phone he picked up the telephone punched in four numbers and said without preface have carl bring me up four phones and you know that poster we got under the bar give him that too i want to show it to a guy whos carl rinker asked when he hung up old guy works for me could you put the gun away you got folk music downstairs john rinker said an accusation and it made sellos uncomfortable she slipped the pistol back into her jacket pocket they listened for a minute and heard faintly through the floor the singers scratchy voice the sioux and ankara are gone driven by the white mans trains across those treasured freewind plains where the wheat waves like dollar bills and overflows some bankers tills gotta pay the mortgage clara he said the guy costs me nothin howre you gonna grow your bar traffic john with some asshole singing about freight trains and wheat folk music is worse than noth ing hiring folksingers does nothing but encourage them its like letting cockroaches into your house i gotta have something and i cant hire country sellos said defensively country people wont come down here and blues are dead except with the corduroy university crowd and they can make a whole night out of a beer and a dish of free peanuts they heard footsteps in the hallway and both turned their heads then a knock sellos got up opened the door took the phones and a piece of paper said thanks carl and shut the door again he stepped back behind his desk looked at the back of the telephones for a few seconds then put them where rinker could reach them how much rinker asked you dont have to pay sellos said just take the fuckin things how long are they good for couple of weeks anyway two of them are arranged the other two are on vacation arranged phones were phones that the owner arranged to have stolen for a fee vacation phones were lifted in burglaries of people who were out of town all right you know the numbers for these phones rinker asked theyre on the tape on the back she looked at the back of one of the phones found a piece of white adhesive tape with a number in blue ballpoint write this down she said she read the number off and sellos wrote it on his desk pad soon as i leave here i want you to call nanny dichter on his private line and tell him to call me at this number i dont talk when im driving so i wont turn the phone on until im somewhere safe but you tell him to call me okay are you and nanny uh are you lookin for each other you dont want to know about this john you call nanny tell him want to talk about john ross eleven oclock right around there nannyll be pissed at me he shook his head sadly thinking about it no he wont just get in touch with him when i leave and tell him i was pointing a gun at your head ill tell him the same thing you gotta promise me sellos said to tell him that cross my heart rinker said now i need a home phone number for andy levy sellos was puzzled andy who levy the bank guy sellos shook his head i dont know him john honest to god clara i never heard of him hes a jew or something i dont know hardly any jews honest to god rinker looked at him for a moment her best look and decided that sellos was nervous but was probably telling the truth all right ill find it somewhere else id do anything clara rinker stood up the best thing for you to do john is to give me a few minutes before you call nanny or anybody else if the cops come screaming down the street ill come back and kill you first no problem i wont call the cops you ought to see this he pushed the piece of paper across the desk it looked like a wanted poster and had rinkers face on it whered you get it its in every goddamn bar and motel in st louis sellos said the pictures not very good it could be anybody but if you know you it looks like you whyre you telling me rinker asked he shrugged i always sorta liked you when you were working out of the warehouse i didnt know about the gun stuff until it was in the papers she nodded he had liked her she thought she remembered that all right give me a couple minutes she stood up and stepped away to the office door and then said listen john you gotta get rid of that fuckin folk music okay promise me she let out a thin smile i mean im not gonna shoot you if you dont but just do it for american civilization american civilization nanny dichter lived on chirac road a semiprivate deadend lane in frontenac all the houses sat well back from the lane and any car turning into it could be seen watched from any of the houses along it on the other hand any car coming out of the lane could be seen up and down nouvelle road the main street at ten minutes past ten oclock rinker parked on nouvelle road three blocks from chirac ten or fifteen cars lined the street a party she parked at the end of the line closest to chirac turned off the lights and slumped behind the steering wheel watching chirac in the rearview mirror bunches of kids were still arriving at the party and a couple left from her spot in the street rinker could hear their music and see flickering multicolored lights some kind of techno shit she thought better than folk music anyway a little after tenthirty a kid wandered out of the party stood on the front lawn of the party house and began vomiting he continued for a minute then walked on to his car got in got back out vomited again then got back in the car and drove away happy trails rinker thought at tenthirtyfive she began to wonder if dichter was going to call her or if hed been home when sellos called him what if hed been at his office working late shed be sitting here and never know there was no chance that hed call from either his house or his business though the feds probably had him so tapped that they knew every time he opened the refrigerator at tenforty a mercedes rolled out of chirac road sat for a minute then turned right away from her and headed down the street slowly uichter always drove a mercedes rinker reached for the key then stopped the benz was a little obvious dont you think clara rolling up and stopping like that so anybody could get a look she sat still as the mercedes disappeared at a corner three blocks away maybe a mistake maybe hed be calling in two minutes and shed have no idea where he was then another car rolled out of chirac a station wagon a volkswagen she thought and turned left toward her this car did not hesitate at the street entrance when it passed her she saw two men inside one had a hand to his head as thought he were talking on a cell phone probably to the driver of the benz rinker thought she let the car get two blocks down nouvelle over a hump and out of sight before she followed she didnt think dichter would go far any phone would do as long as it wasnt his she started to tighten up now started to feel the adrenaline the hunting hormone flowing into her bloodstream shed always liked the feel of it the stress and she thought about paulo dead on the ground in cancun his blood all over her his blue eyes vacant thought about her baby the way things were going to be forever the adrenaline was a familiar thing but now something else flowed in a coldness that shed felt only once before about her stepfather hate and it was liquid and cold like mercury flowing through her veins nanny dichter two blocks away still breathing while paulo lay rotting in his grave she knew enough not to try to get close to the volkswagen she stayed way back turned off her lights once followed the volkswagen around a corner west onto clayton road worried that shed lose him clayton road had more traffic than the side streets and she closed up just a bit the volkswagen continued on turned north off clayton then west again and finally cut into a lincoln inn she continued past the hotel down the block to a second entrance kept looking back and saw the volkswagen pull up to the reception bay and a man who looked very like nanny dichter get out and go inside she parked as close to a side door as she could picked up the sony tape recorder and turned it on the dixie chicks were singing something inoffensive she got out of the car and walked toward the hotels side door the door was locked she took a step away looking toward the front thinking about the second man in the volkswagen and saw a young guy coming down the hallway toward the side door carrying a sleepy redeyed kid the guy pushed through and rinker held the door smiled and was inside the telephone rang she punched it on held the tape recorder close to her face as she walked along the hallway and answered hello this is me dichter said what do you want i want to know whose idea it was to go to cancun she said was that john or was that the whole goddamn bunch of you i didnt know anything about it until the feds told me dichter said i got with john hold on rinker said im gonna go outside i can barely hear you where are you in a bar she said tersely she pulled the tape recorder away from the phone as though she were walking away from the jukebox and clicked it off then wait a minute a guys coming let me get over here a guy was coming a hotel guy with a chest tag that said chad she put her hand over the phones mouthpiece and asked could you tell me where your pay phones are down the hall into the lobby turn right then around the corner and theyre right there thanks she continued down the hallway into the lobby phone to her ear slipped the safety on the ninemillimeter into the lobby not looking at the few faces passing through it glanced to the left her vision sharp as a broken mirror picking up everything as tiny fragments of motion the indian woman behind the desk the guy with the suitcase talking to her another guy in the tiny gift shop a sign that said elevators and she was saying into the phone all the time that fuckhead killed my guy and killed my baby and im gonna take him out the righteous anger was surging in her voice and was real and convincing you can get in or get out whatever you want but if youre with john ill take you right along with him listen listen listen dichter was saying his voice rising and she turned the corner and heard the last listen both through the phone and in person dichter was there his back to her talking into the pay phone he felt the movement behind him and turned his face going slack when he saw her face and the gun leveled at his forehead he had just time to say no and rinker shot him the first shot went in between his eyes the second and third went into the side of his head as he slumped down the wall leaving blood lines down the yellow wallpaper the shots even with the silencer were loud enough to attract attention rinker shoved the gun into her jacket pocket screamed and ran into the lobby mans got a gun she screamed mans got a gun she was looking over her shoulder at the hallway and somebody else screamed and the man with the suitcase ducked but didnt run he was looking at the hallway where dichter had fallen she turned down the hall where shed come in out of sight from the lobby now running banged through the side exit heard shouting behind her forced herself to a walk went to her car was in was rolling was gone there was no easy way to drive to st louis from the twin cities the easiest was to head east into wisconsin then south through illinois on the interstate highways the interstates were full of highway patrol cops though so lucas took the porsche straight south through iowa along secondary highways and country roads spending a couple of extra hours at it but having a much better time he eventually cut west of st louis and took it into town arriving just after sunset on a gorgeous warm august evening dichter had been shot the night before and malone had called at midnight as they spoke mallard was on his way to st louis with his special studies group with malone to follow in the morning no question it was her malone said a latenight caffeinated excitement was riding in her voice two people got a pretty good look at her but nobody knew who she was they thought the shooting was coming from somewhere else she must have used a silencer and they were all running around like chickens with their heads cut off she got out of the place clean nobody saw her car or where she went howd she know dichter was in the hotel shes got a stolen cell phone dichter was killed on a pay phone and we traced the number hed called to a phone owned by a guy from clayton thats just outside of st louis to the west the clayton cops went to the guys apartment and talked to the manager who said the guy was in europe so they checked the apartment and found the place had been broken into ransacked we called the guy in europe and asked about the cell phone and he said it should have been home on the dresser in the bedroom no phone itd been taken howd ranker know dichterd be calling from that pay phone did she know him that well or was she watching him we dont know if shes watching her targets you could set up a surveillance net around anybody else she might go after see if she comes in on them lucas said weve talked about doing that take a lot of guys maybe twenty at a time three shifts sixty guys thats a lot how bad do you want her that bad malone admitted but we have to get the budget st louis must have a few stolenphone dealers the cops should have some lines on who might be selling them you dont think rinker stole it lucas said jesus christ no shes not a burglar she just knew about the guy who deals them thats all probably a bar guy she was a dancer remember or a barbershop in the barrio if theyve got a barrio get somebody to look in the latino community or the african community ill bet theres a dealer who wholesales them to a couple of guys who retail them out to people who want to call colombia or somalia like that thats pretty common a couple of dozen overseas calls will pay for a pretty expensive phone ask the st louis cops ill do that can you get down ill drive down tomorrow lucas said no problem with weather nope shes pretty interested in the whole project and shes far enough out on the pregnancy that she doesnt really need me here see you then im flying the first thing in the morning the fbi contingent was housed in a block of rooms at the embassy suites hotel a couple of blocks off the waterfront there was no garage but lucas found a spot within direct eyeshot of the front door parked and carried his bag inside to the reception desk fbi asked the woman behind the desk looking him over no lucas said so everybody knew the feds were in town he pushed his american express card at her id really appreciate something comfortable thats not a problem she said pleasantly her accent came from farther down the river she was looking at a computer screen as they talked and said i see you have a message she stepped to the left looked through a file produced an envelope and passed it to him are there a lot of fbi people in the hotel lucas asked mmm she said then they think that lady killer is here clara rinker here in the hotel she was nicelooking a fairskinned black woman and lucas thought a little moonshine couldnt hurt especially with a southerner she picked up on it and smiled at him not in the hotel silly in st louis ill look out for her they chatted as she checked him in the kind of light southern flirting that established a mutual pleasure in the present company with no implications whatever the room was decent the space was okay with a small sitting room the bed was solid and if he pressed his forehead to the window he could see the towboats working up the river one was working up the river the first time he looked maybe one of the same tows hed see from his place in st paul not bad he dumped his bag on the bed powdered his nose splashed water on his face and opened the envelope the note said were at the local fbi office easy to get to too far to walk ask at the desk though it was warm he got a jacket a crinkled cotton summerweight before he headed out downstairs the southerner was working the desk and he asked can you tell me where the fbi office is she looked at him a little warily was he hustling her trying to extend the fbi comment and he said really i have a meeting big fibber she said you said you werent no no im not fbi i just have a meeting well if youre really not fibbing really okay if you were its only ninetynine dollars federal rate for your room you save fifty dollars she paused but he shook his head okay the fbi building its about ummm twenty blocks from here you want to go out this way to market she pointed him out the door he retrieved the porsche found market took a right and five minutes later was easing into a parking space outside the fbi building hed expected a highrise office with security he got a low flat fiftieslook two or threestory building that must have covered a couple of acres with big green windows a welltrimmed lawn and a steel security fence on the perimeter lights were burning all through the building inside the front door a guard checked him off a list lucas declared no weapon and the guard said we have a weapon pass for you mr davenport lucas shrugged i thought itd be better to leave it for now fine ill show you the conference room mr mallard is there now with the rest of the special studies group he handed lucas a plastic card with a metal clip put this on the guard led him to an elevator while another guard took the desk the first guy was older midfifties lucas thought with a mildly unfashionable haircut and a nose that might have been broken twice you ever a cop lucas asked as they got in the elevator the guard glanced at him twentytwo years city of st louis you let these fbi weenies get on top of you the guard smiled pleasantly showing his eyeteeth that doesnt happen you a cop or a consultant or what deputy chief from minneapolis ive bumped into rinker a couple of times and mallard thinks i can help can you i dont know lucas said shes a problem you think these guysll get her the guard considered for a minute and the elevator bumped to a stop one floor up ah these guys arent bad for what they do the guard said as the door opened they took a left down the hall we used to think downtown that they were all a bunch of yuppie assholes but i seen some pretty good busts come out of here what they do usually has a lot of intelligence lot of surveillance patience is what they got they might have trouble with a street chick heres your room the conference room was unmarked lucas stopped and said you ever have a beer when you get off bite to eat usually the guard said theres a latenight place up on the hill get together with some of my old pals i dont know st louis if youre out of here by eleven stop at the desk ill give you a map you driving yeah no problem then whats your name lucas asked dan loftus lucas davenport they shook hands see you later the guard headed back to his station and lucas knocked once on the conference room door and stepped inside a dozen people seven or eight men in ties and longsleeved shirts with the sleeves rolled up and four or five women in slacks and jackets were sitting around two long tables with mallard at the front a white board covered the front wall and somebody had drawn a flow chart on it with three colors of ink five or six laptop computers were scattered down the conference table malone sat in a corner wearing a skirted suit she lifted a hand lucas mallard said he stepped over to shake hands and pointed lucas at a chair this is chief davenport mallard said to the group treat him well a few of the agents nodded most looked him over then turned back to mallard like that lucas thought not a member of the tribe on the other hand he had his own tribe he thought of the guard and leaned back in the chair to listen mallard had six names on the whiteboard six local crime figures who might have been tied into rinker they included nanny dichter now dead paul dallaglio a business partner of dichters in the import and dope businesses gene giancati involved in sex and loansharking donny obrien improbably a trustee of a halfdozen different union pension funds randall ferignetti who ran the biggest local sports books and john ross who ran a liquordistribution business a trucking company several lines of vending machines and an atmservicing company we think rinkers most likely target is dallaglio mallard was saying tapping the white board he and dichter were like peter and paul the salesman and the organizer if dichter was involved enough with rinker that she killed him then dallaglios got to know her can we talk to him a blueshirted agent asked i called him this morning but he wouldnt talk mallard said he said hed have an attorney get back to me but we havent heard anything we suspect theres some pretty heavy conferencing going on right now we could put a net around him without asking the agent said malone chipped in we could if we could keep it light enough that he didnt know the problem is hes hired private protection emerson security out of chicago we dont know who yet but emerson has a whole bunch of ex bureau guys if they put up their own security net theyd spot us so what another agent asked so we want him scared mallard answered officially were reluctant to get involved in this unless we get something back if we do it right we might do a lot of damage to these guys maybe hell just hire emerson forever no good protection from emersons gonna cost him between three and five thousand a day hes got money but hes not a rock star mallard said were gonna let both him and emerson know that were watching his banking activity that the irs will want to know where the moneys coming from and where its going to probably most of his money is offshore and getting it back here in big amounts wont be easy especially to pay off a legit company like emerson they wont take cash under the table not in their business not when they know were watching maybe well eventually put a net around him malone said she and mallard were doubleteaming the briefing they were good at it practiced coordinated without awkwardness or deference right now though we want to put some light tags on the other people keep track of them maybe somebody will run and well want to know that do we have anybody on the street asked a woman in a squareshouldered khakicolored dress that made her look like a tomboy or an archaeologist shes not in any hotel within two hundred miles shes not staying with anybody weve got in our history her face is all over the place on tv and in the newspapers but nobody sees her where is she if we can figure that out what do people do when they come to st louis but the cops are looking for them they still got boardinghouses or something they all thought about that for a few moments then started making noises like a bunch of ducks quacking lucas thought no reflection on mallard lucas what do you think malone asked finally lucas shrugged you guys are always putting up rewards like a million dollars for some arab terrorist if shes ditched underground with an old crooked friend why not offer a hundred thousand and see if you get a phone call rewards cause all kinds of subsidiary problems a grayshirted agent said you get multiple claims you guys got lawyers coming out of your ears to be polite lucas said fuck a bunch of multiple claims bust her first litigate later once you have her chained in the basement you can work out the small stuff its an idea malone said without much enthusiasm wed have to get the budget a guy in a white shirt said we know every place she ever worked here in st louis what if we ran the social security records on every place she worked and got a list of all her coworkers and crossmatched them that idea turned their crank mallard made notes and lucas looked at his watch when they sorted it out one of the agents asked is gene rinker going to be a genuine resource mallard looked at malone who said two possibilities on that first we use him to talk her in hes resisting the second is at some critical point we throw him out there as a chip come in we guarantee no death sentence and your brother walks on the dope charge lucas was twiddling a pencil anxious to get going but asked where is he gene were moving him here howre you going to face him off to clara how is she even going to find out about him malone shrugged the press theyve been all over the dichter thing this is a large story here therell be a story on tonights news that were bringing gene here to assist with the investigation and weve let it be known that weve got him by the short hairs rinkerll hear about it unless shes in greenland or borneo lucas blinked and twiddled and malone finally asked what i like blackmail as much as the next guy when youre dealing with smalltimers lucas said clara isnt i dont see her turning herself in if you hang her kid brother out to dry hes the only person weve been able to find who she cares about she could do something unpredictable like what i dont know if i did it wouldnt be unpredictable well god lucas what do you want us to do hes a resource said another guy we dont have to use him i think wed be remiss if we didnt keep him available said a third a woman chipped in hes a violator i say to heck with him the meeting broke up a little after nine when lucas went by the guard desk loftus the guard hed talked to wasnt there the guard who was there said youve got a note from dan hes hung up for a while and passed lucas a piece of typing paper outside the door lucas opened the paper and found a map drawn with a ballpoint and next to that the words oclock lucas went back to the hotel got a cornedbeef sandwich from room service unpacked his suitcase talked to weather for fifteen min utes watched the news and headed out the door a few minutes after eleven oclock st louis was easy enough to get around and luca found the place on the first try a corner tavern with budweiser and busch signs in the window and a flickeringorange andys sign hung over the front door a halfblock up the street a couple of guys were working on what looked like an eighties camaro using shop lights on orange extension cords that led across the sidewalk to the car at the curb he could hear traffic at some distance and a nearly full moon was high and squarely aligned with the street felt kinda good inside andys a long bar led away from the door into the interior a halfdozen guys and one woman seated at the bar turned their heads to see who was coming in and gave him a good look when they didnt recognize him he could smell microwave pizza popcorn and beer a jar of pickled pigs feet sat at the end of the bar beside a jar of pickled eggs a bartender was wiping glasses and as lucas ambled past he asked you looking for dan yeah is he here in the back on the right their pitcher is probably pretty down by now so give me another one and a glass lucas said he gave the bartender a twenty got his change and carried the pitcher down the bar loftus and two other guys who both looked like excops were sitting in andys biggest booth big enough for six or eight when lucas came up loftus lifted a hand and lucas slid into the booth with the beer loftus pointed at the other two men dick bender micky andreno dick was homicide micky was a patrol lieutenant when he retired lucas said hello and they all poured beer and bender said i called a guy up in minneapolis and he said you werent the worst guy in the world said you got shot a lot and that you like to fight said you got shot by a little girl right in the throat lucas said that was a good fuckin day so he told the story and they told a few about car chases and assholes theyd known one story about a cop whod been killed when hed run through a stream of water from a fire hose and got his neck broken and then lucas had to tell the story of the minneapolis guy whod fired a blank at his own head as a joke and blown his brains out and andreno told about the three women a grandmother a mother and a daughter who had all been beaten to death by the men in their lives the daughter when she was only seventeen she already had a kid of her own a daughter shes growing up somewhere howd you like to have that curse on you after the dogsniffing they got another pitcher and loftus asked how was the meeting ill tell you guys they might get her but if they do its gonna be by accident lucas said theyre gonna run computer programs all night trying to nail down every single person she ever worked with they figure shes got to be staying with somebody she knows probably is bender said i know but jesus she worked for a big liquor company and a couple of bars here in town with all those contacts and she went to two different colleges that we know of maybe theyll get lucky but thats a hell of a lot of people lucas said so whats the choice here andreno asked i dont see that youve got an edge before lucas could answer a fourth guy showed up a former patrol sergeant named bob carter he slid into the booth and was introduced and said pour me one of them beers some asshole parked a porsche outside thatd be me lucas said really a fuckin c carter was not embarrassed they must have good bennies in minneapolis then they had to dogsniff some more until lucas finally got back to andrenos question she bought a hot cell phone here in st louis so shes already gone to somebody that guy might know where shes at he might know who shes calling how many guys you got selling hot cell phones here bout a hundred loftus said wholesaling them well enough established that she could come back after a few years away and go straight to him dont know that she did that andreno said she might have called a friend who got them for her thats right but she mustve called somebody connected because dichter called her on her cell phone and the feds have dichters phone calls both business and home from every phone we think he had and shes not on the list her phone isnt she never called him she cant have been here for more than a few days somehow she got to dichter through an intermediary and she bought a phone at the same time if dichter was calling her at night at eleven oclock i bet he didnt have her number for long bender said why would you sit around all day looking at the cell phone number and then go out at eleven oclock to call her the st louis cops sat and looked at him for a moment waiting for lucas to absorb the point lucas had absorbed it and after a moment said thats one thing the feds didnt come up with and then anybody who cant keep their mouth shut raise his hand nobody raised a hand carter said whataya got ill tell you if this shit gets out dan could be guarding a parking ramp lucas said loftus didnt bother to look around the table they wont talk whataya got lucas took a paper out of his pocket hed pulled it out of the information packet that mallard had passed around all the packets were supposed to remain in the building list of phone numbers that called dichter lucas said he put it on the table and the st louis cops huddled over it andreno finally said pay phone at tuckers down at lacledes landing carter said yeah tuckers is right next to the bluesnote john sellos loftus leaned back and said to lucas there you are sellos is connected he knows dichter and all the rest of them and hell sell you a phone if you ask him right tell you what else carter said sellos used to work for john ross driving a truck this was years and years ago maybe i oughta go see him lucas said andreno looked at his watch got time for a couple more beers but if youre going id like to ride along i know sellos from way back dont go hittin anyone you dont have a badge anymore loftus said to andreno to lucas micky sorta liked to fight himself andreno shook his head those days are gone now all i do is hit golf balls and wonder what the fuck happened they had a couple of more beers and talked about what the four cops were doing in retirement none of them was sixty and all were looking at twenty years of idleness before they died if the goddamn pickled pigs feet dont get to me first carter grumbled a few minutes later loftus asked lucas did you meet richard lewis the aic yeah he was in the meeting for a while dark suit one of those blue shirts with a white collar thats him ill tell you what he dont like this mallard guy coming in and taking over hes running a little hippocket operation of his own looking for rinker hes got his intelligence guys doing it loftus said it in a way that suggested a further step into treason all in the way of the brotherhood of cops got any names lucas asked striker allenby lane and jones loftus said let me lucas took a pen out of his pocket and jotted the names in the palm of his hand striker allenby lane and jones dont tell anybody where you got that lucas looked at him and loftus said yeah yeah at one oclock andreno tipped up his beer glass finished it and said to lucas lets go as they stood up loftus looked at lucas and said might be best if we dont spend too much time talking at the office but ill be sitting here tomorrow night were gonna kick some ass lucas said he burped fuckin budweiser jesus christ watch your mouth loftus said and he crossed himself andreno was a slick hard neighborhood boy capped teeth probably paid for by the city after they got broken out forehead scars toosharp jackets hands in his pockets and the attitude of a housewifeslaying mean fuckin vacuum cleaner salesman even if he hadnt had an italian name lucas would have bet that hed gone to a tough catholic high school somewhere probably run by the psycho brothers for christ andreno liked the porsche and crossexamined lucas on how he could afford it as they rolled along through the night top down the moon in the rearview mirror lucas told him a little about the roleplaying games hed written in the seventies and eighties how he hired a kid from the university of minnesota to translate them into early computer games how that drifted into simulations for police systems holy shit youre rich andreno said comfortable lucas said bullshit youre rich andreno said happily why dont you give me this car when you leave id look great in it clubs in the passenger seat kind of casuallike driving along with my sunglasses and the rolex couldnt do that you have to have a certain level of sexual magnetism before youre allowed to drive a porsche lucas said and id have to get a rolex andreno said he pointed at a slot near the curb a halfblock from the bluesnote put it there then itll be close if we have to run for it run pulling your weenie andreno said johns actually an okay guy if you like crooked barkeeps who suffer from clinical depression and progressive hair loss think hell be there he always is hes got nowhere else to go the bluesnote was only a couple of blocks from lucass hotel one of a collection of nineteenthcentury brick buildings called lacledes landing bars mostly a couple of music spots all kinds of restaurants tourist junk shops selling st louis souvenirs cobblestone streets like that what you got in any older city when the city engineers decided to do something hip at the door to the bluesnote andreno said stay close behind me place is kinda dim they went in fast straight to the back though the kitchen doors and up a flight of stairs that had a private sign above the first step and at the top of the stairs andreno went straight on across the landing and pushed open the door at the top john he said john sellos was a thin man tiredlooking worn down sitting behind a wooden desk in the screen glow of a cheap laptop computer he looked at andreno and lucas behind him and said ah shit he said it in a quiet way as though andreno or somebody like him had been expected then whatre you doing youre not on the force anymore im showing my friend around andreno said this is lucas davenport hes a deputy chief from minneapolis and is working now with an fbi task force on clara rinker you heard of her i heard of her sellos said uncomfortably he leaned back and crossed his legs what do you want andreno glanced at lucas who looked at the two chairs in front of andrenos desk carefully brushed off the seat of one of them and sat down john can i call you john you can john lucas said you helped set up nanny dichter to be murdered by clara rinker we know that and you know that and you know what the penalty is for felony murder in missouri lucas made a delicate slashing gesture across his throat when sellos didnt immediately answer lucas knew that they were on the right track so did andreno he moved off to lean against a wall and nodded at lucas his chin dipping a quarterinch weve got nannys phone records john lucas continued we know you called him weve got a witness who can put you on the phone weve got claras phone number though she isnt answering it we know where the phone came from and pretty soon were gonna know who stole it and that person is gonna get on the witness stand and he is gonna put you on death row i better get a lawyer sellos said his voice lacked enthusiasm and he didnt reach for a phone the question is do you need a lawyer andreno said pushing away from the wall you dont for me because im not a cop anymore lucas here isnt exactly official were just a couple of street guys trying to come up with some information so they were projecting rays of light and all sellos saw was bullshit and lies so we talk lucas said shrugging no need for everybody to get excited about a telephone i mean if the feds find you later thats their problem and your problem but were not gonna talk to them about it we got our own thing going sellos turned skeptical youre not going to tell them andreno shook his head nope if youll help us out ill give you my beeper number and if clara calls you beep us thatll be it but youve gotta tell us the rest of it now lucas said otherwise youre gonna need a lawyer a really good lawyer and youre gonna need him really bad i didnt help set nanny up sellos said he didnt bother to deny anv of it i had no idea what clara was going to do i thought she was going to try to talk to him and needed a safe way to call him she came in she put a gun on me a big fuckin automatic you know how many people have looked down claras guns and walked away not many anyway she got the phones four phones and she told me if i talk to you guys shell kill me and she will if she hears about this not ten years from now on death row shell kill me this week when was she here sellos told them the story at the end of it he stood up went to a halfsized refrigerator got a heineken popped the top off took a sip he didnt offer one to lucas or andreno she wanted nanny to call and she wanted this andy levy guys phone number the banker so she could call him thats it other than that shed kill me if i talked to anyone lucas asked youve never heard of this andy levy no when she mentioned him that was the first i ever heard of him lucas looked at andreno and cocked an eyebrow andreno shook his head never heard of the guy back to sellos you think hes here in the city thats the impression i got they ran him through the story again but sellos had nothing more to say except that rinker had not disguised herself at all she looked just like she did when she was working at the warehouse except richer she looked pretty welltended welltended andreno repeated as though he liked the phrase very well sellos said they left him behind the desk worrying lucas said we wont talk to anyone and you better not i mean were a couple of friendly guys dont think clara would be all that friendly andreno left his beeper number with sellos sellos said hed call the minute rinker got in touch with him if she did you arent gonna run are you john andreno asked no no somebody would find me either you or clara i got nowhere to run to out on the street andreno stretched and yawned and looked down the quiet streets and up at the sky and said what a great fuckin night this was more fun than i had in five years operating lucas said thats exactly what it is andreno said poking a finger at lucas im operating again after a moment is there anything else i can do any other way i can cut into this let me think about it lucas said ill see what the feebs say tomorrow when i drop andy levy on them if andy levy isnt dead tonight lucas got up early for him a little after eight oclock he pulled on jeans and a tshirt went to the lobby and got a postdispatch and a couple of diet cokes returned to his room lay in bed and drank the coke and read the paper gene rinker in orange prison coveralls and chains was on the front page being taken into a jail somewhere behind a row of shotgunarmed marshals a show a movie the fbi was making a movie about being tough about kicking a little rinker ass the postdispatch quoted malone on gene rinkers arrest and described her as a tough flinty fbi agent a veteran of the mob wars a small photograph at the bottom of the story showed malone talking to a marshal looking flinty maybe she is lucas thought and he extracted the comics and read them while room service put together some pancakes and bacon during the leisurely breakfast he started calling local banks and got lucky with the fifth one lucas got to the fbi building at ninethirty loftus wasnt yet on duty another man gave him his neck card and escorted him to the meeting room when he stepped inside the collected agents turned to look and mallard said we started at seven had a late night lucas said out drinking oh good one of the male agents muttered lets try to keep ourselves together folks mallard said but he was exasperated behind him on the white board was an expanded list of names heavy on the italian rinkers probably going after a guy named andy levy a banker lucas said as he found a chair he pulled it back from the table so he could stretch his legs she had a list of at least two guys when she came into town nanny dichter and andy levy theres an andy levy whos a vice president at first heartland national bank here in st louis i dont know hes the one but hes a possibility they all turned to look at him again malone whod been sitting in the corner poking at a laptop asked whered you get this on the street lucas said while i was out drinking drinking with any specific guy asked the tomboy agent who the day before had been wearing khaki now she was wearing an olivedrab blouse with epaulets lucas liked the look sort of squareshouldered italian army nobody specific he said just a bunch of guys maybe nothing to take seriously said another one of the agents gotta take it seriously lucas said you dont take it seriously and andy levy gets hit and the papers hear about it then youre a laughingstock thats not the fbi way or maybe it is but its not something youd want to talk about whod tell the papers lucas shrugged i might i always liked newspaper guys mallard said ah man lucas lets step out in the hallway for a minute huh we gotta talk mallard pushed the door shut stood with his back to it and asked whos your source a guy i ran into last night lucas said if you wind up desperately needing him and i cant see how that would happen then ill tell you who he is until then the informations got to be enough is it good information its good it comes right out of rinkers mouth but im not sure the guy at heartland is the right guy rinkers the one who called him a banker and my source doesnt know if she meant a mob banker or a legit banker or what if levys legit maybe rinkers got some money with him thatd be good thatd be really good anything else i ought to know yeah the aic here is running another rinker group out of his back pocket four guys named striker allenby lane and jones out of intelligence he doesnt like you being here what that means is there are about six groups of cops looking for the same woman and not finding her but pretty soon theyre gonna start finding each other boy you do keep your ear to the ground whered you hear this on the street lucas grinned everybody knows about it youre the last mallard sighed and said listen im going over to talk to john ross thats really why i was a little anxious about your not being here i want you to come along and were leaving in fifteen minutes could have called never occurred to me that you might be sleeping in mallard said i figured you were up to something and i was right and listen take it easy in here okay i know theyre a little chilly with outsiders a little chilly my ass i almost froze to death last night lucas said im sure your guys are good at what they do but thats not what i do i think id be more valuable doing what im doing hooking up with the locals seeing who is doing what mallard shrugged thats fine with me as long as you stay in touch i sort of value your input ill be around andy levy a banker mallard said thats right lets go back in back inside mallard looked at one of the agents and said i want you and four more guys on this andy levy and i want a list of all the andy levys in the metropolitan area as soon as weve got the right guy i want a team on him around the clock start now find him take whoever you want except sally the woman named sally in the epaulets sat up and tapped the eraser end of a pencil on her yellow pad why not her mallard answered the question without being asked sally lucas is going to be running around town i want you to run around with him as our liaison she shook her head looked at lucas unhappy i cant do that lucas said dont be a princess lucas malone snapped from the corner take sally her old man is a cop her brothers a cop she understands i dont care if her fathers the fuckin pope of cleveland i aint taking her lucas said the people i talk to arent going to talk to me if shes around dont tell them that shes with the bureau lucas looked at mallard think about the second piece of information i gave you thatll give you a clue about where some of my sources are and why i cant take sally along are you ah man he got it in one second at least some of lucass sources were with the fbi all right sally you work here with malone but lucas sallys your contact with us shell get you what you need from our side call her anytime day or night feed her everything you collect all right and try to get to the morning report on time seven oclock okay okay lucas said with no sincerity whatever mallard went through the list of the days assignments then said to malone im outta here i doubt that well be with ross for an hour and ill be on the phone the whole time good luck she said sally followed them out into the hall give me two minutes with chief davenport she said to mallard mallard said im going to hit the john and walked away to lucas she said what was the second piece of information lucas shook his head youd have to get that from louis i surmise that one of your informants is with the bureau he shook his head again kept his face straight youd have to get that from louis its really good to build up this level of trust with the guy youre coordinating with she said i dont need my balls busted by the fbi lucas said im getting tired of leading you guys around by the hand i dont think thats the case she said bullshit you guys couldnt find your own elbows with two agents and a pair of binoculars her lip twitched and lucas thought she might smile my old man wouldve said you couldnt find your asshole with both hands and a flashlight that was my thought lucas admitted i edited it because of your tender years im not that tender she said what are we doing ill get your number and give you mine its always on except at night good they finished the arrangements in two minutes and she asked that andy levy stuff isnt just a rumor is it no but i dont know anything about him she nibbled at the inside of her lip well have a formal profile in an hour were very good at that lucas started down the hall then do it when you find anything out call me he said over his shoulder and hey i like the epaulets they took a dark government car a dodge mallard in the back a younger agent driving lucas riding shotgun on the way over mallard browsed through a file on ross reading out occasional anecdotes the anecdotes covered rosss youth his love life and his legitimate interests ross lived on a semiprivate street in the town of ladue in the middle of a broad rolling lawn of faultless green dappled here and there with flower beds the house a rambling redbrick mansion with white trim was set at the crest of a low hillock and was surrounded by mature artfully spaced trees if ross had any kind of security system rinker would need a rocket launcher to get at him lucas thought the driver stayed with the car while lucas and mallard went to the door rosss wife answered the doorbell she was a striking woman in her midthirties with strawberryblond hair a smooth oval face and jadegreen eyes way too much for her missouri accent she was wearing tennis whites and carrying a bottle of orange gatorade she led them across polished wooden floors past colorful intricate framed prints back to a home office and called john theyre here and then said to mallard well im off to play tennis as though she found the idea amazing good luck he said she turned away as john ross came up to the office door come in ross said looking after his wife mallard and lucas followed him back into the office ross looked like what he was a hood the smart hard kind of hoodlum the borderline psychopath the kind who might have run the docks in new york in another era he weighed maybe twotwenty lucas thought and had wide sloping shoulders he was square with heavy lids over dark eyes a dark saturnine face and fingers like fat stubby cigars the office around them was attractive just as old man mejias library had been all good wood and wellcoordinated the furniture sitting on a blueandbeige oriental carpet that glowed at them from the floor two orchids sat on his desk and another on a side table one of the orchid blooms was the exact color of green that lucas remembered from a huge luna moth that had once visited his wisconsin cabin beautiful flowers mallard said as they settled around rosss desk my principal hobby ross said i have two thousand of them you take care of them yourself ross nodded mostly he wasnt interested in talking about his flowers what can i do for you folks youve probably got a pretty good idea mallard said you once employed clara rinker she just killed nanny dichter and we think she is probably going after you she blames you for the killing of paulo mejia ross made a hand gesture a what can you do gesture and said i never had anything but the best relationship with her i was amazed when i found out that shed been killing people but her career started way before i met her at least if what the papers say is correct look you know as well as i do that the bureau has a major file on you mallard said i think that some of the surmises made in those files are correct but i dont care about that i dont care if youre a bigtime mobster because my job right now is to find and stop clara rinker what i want from you is any ideas you may have of where shes staying who she may be working with old friends people she could force to take her in anything like that ross was shaking his head id have no idea i will go around and ask though when she worked for me she mostly worked in the warehouse and there must be twenty or thirty people out there who knew her ill have one of my guys talk to everyone how about if we talk to them ive got no problem with that ross said he leaned forward opened a small drawer and took out a sheet of paper and a yellow pencil he scribbled on it and pushed it at mallard this is the managers name and phone number ill call him as soon as you leave and tell him to expect a call from you mallard nodded thank you you personally have no idea ross shook his head again none ill tell you im really not sure that shes coming after me im not sure exactly why she went after nanny dichter i mean you hear these rumors that nanny played by his own rules sometimes but i didnt know they had any prior relationship maybe thatll be the end of it nanny thats a possibility but she has at least one more man on her list for sure not you and we know that she made a series of phone calls from mexico to missouri after the shooting and that you were the main topic of conversation so we think there are at least two more people on the list and you are one of them whos the other guy rosss dark eyebrows went up sorry mallard said i cant paul dellaglio mallard shook his head really give you that information why would you think dellaglio because anything nanny dichter did paul was part and parcel of unless the rinker thing involves sex dont think so neither do i nanny didnt get around so much so i would guess that pauls the other guy on your list mallard shook his head and said ill have a couple of our agents around to your warehouse this afternoon anything i can do ross said that was the interview after a few more unpleasantries ross took them out on the way they stopped in a room whose leadedglass wall overlooked the back lawn to the left a greenhouse stood facing the south a resortsized rectangular swimming pool was straight ahead and with its blackpainted bottom acted as a reflecting pond to the right was a tennis court where rosss wife was batting tennis balls around with a whitehaired man tennis lessons ross said ruefully that guy costs me fifty bucks an hour your wifes got a nice swing lucas said ross looked at him with a tiny spark in his eye the first sign lucas had seen of humor yes she does always has had ross said ross stood in the doorway and watched them go when they were m the car he pushed the door shut and walked to the opposite end of the house moving silently on the thick carpet two men were in the billiards room one of them looking out the window while the other a fiftyish man with a bald pink scalp and a long swedish face was flipping playing cards down the length of a billiards table at a tweed hat ross watched him for a moment johnsons dour face reminded him of someone but he couldnt think who ross did not like honus johnson nobody did but he was sometimes afraid that hed let that attitude leak through and that honus had picked it up honus was a throwback a genuine sadist whod found his perfect place in life as an interrogator a punisher with rosss organization some of the others used him from time to time with rosss approval but he was rosss creature and like most people who owned creatures ross sometimes wondered if the beast would ever turn on him johnson with his playthings his hammers and saws and pliers and wire would give a man a hard way to go he stepped into the room and both men turned to him theyre gone ross said they have no idea where she is but they pretty much said what i told you she has to be staying with somebody she knew from before i want you guys to get out there and start talking to people if we find her asked the man from the window if you find her if you literally find her like walk in on her you wont have to worry because shell kill you but if you hear where she is get back to me well get some guys to pick her up i dont know if i can be of much use honus johnson said im not a scout i want you to go along with troy here and stand in the background ross said people have some ideas about you that might convince them to be more forthcoming and i have something else for you hmmm johnson didnt quite look eager ross looked at troy you remember that woman nancy leigh ton used to work in fulfillment black hair little mustache quit maybe three years ago drove a camaro troy said thats the one she used to be a good friend of rinkers i think shes got an apartment down on the south side somewhere get in her apartment take her apart johnsons eyebrows went up take her apart completely completely be careful no prints no dna but we want it to be noticed we want it in the newspapers front page make it ugly an example johnson said with relish he rubbed the edge of one hand through the palm of the other back and forth like a saw then do i get clara if we pick her up id have to think about that ross said i do like the girl but shes a very bad example hitting nanny like she did id like to have her for a while johnson said his flat tongue flickered out to his thin lips his flat pale eyes catching rosss it wouldnt have to be long at that moment when he caught rosss eyes ross realized who johnson looked like the old man in the grant wood painting american gothic the somber old man with the pitchfork standing next to his equally somber wife old rivals huh ross said and smiled at the thought the two of them had been a powerful combination too bad about clara at the fbi building lucas said goodbye to mallard and got into his car gonna roll around town for a while he said he dug up micky andrenos phone number and dialed it andreno was out in the yard and snatched up the phone on the fifth ring as lucas was about to hang up washing the car he said know anybody at heartland national no but one of benders kids works there want me to call him i think that andy levys a vice president i did some calling around oh shit oh shit what im so fuckin stupid how could i be this fuckin stupid andreno sounded shocked what nine ten years back there was a double murder a woman and her divorce attorney were found together in bed shot to death actually the guy was in bed and the woman was on the floor right beside the bed and the way it was reconstructed theyd been screwing right in the act this was at her house somebody walked in and shot the attorney twice in the back of the head with a smallcaliber weapon the woman apparently tried to slide out from under and get out but she was shot in the forehead and then twice in the temple there was a hideout in the bottom of her dresser and a bunch of jewelry was taken worth maybe ten grand something like that the husband was a guy named levy i think it was aaron levy but ill tell you what nobody knew it at the time but looking back it sounds exactly like rinker like one of her hits aaron levy andy levy could be the same or maybe sellos got it wrong lucas said no arrests on the two killings never a smell of one levy this guy a young guy was like at some big jewish convention somewhere with several thousand witnesses his wifes name i think was lucille lucy thats what i remember bender could probably get a file hes still tight with the guys in homicide see if he can ask him if his kid will talk to us lucas said call me back when you know pick me up andreno said sure call bender lucas dialed the number sally had given him she answered with yes i just talked to a guy who said there was an aaron levy a case nine or ten years ago whose wife lucille and her divorce attorney were shot to death in her bed executionstyle rinkerstyle smallcaliber weapon close range head shots no arrests hang on a minute he heard her repeating what hed said and then malone came on interesting malone said louis just walked in im online let me get this aaron levy and lucille conventional spellings thats the names i got he could hear her typing and then she said here it is case still open nothing here let me search she hit a few more keys then said nothing here on rinker so nobody attributed it to her all i get is aaron no andy no bank job no job reported here a male voice in the background said thats him though weve got a newspaper file from the postdispatch website a speech for the chamber of commerce hes listed as aaron parenthesis andy parenthesis levy vice president at heartland national bank this is five years ago then another male voice where is davenport getting this shit malone said im speeding everything up were putting a screen around levy right now weve got to talk some tactics here but im going to suggest to louis that we might go see him go see levy let me know lucas said they talked for another minute then he rang off five seconds later before he could put the phone away another call came in andreno benders going downtown to see if he can get the levy file he doesnt think itll be a problem to look at it but hell have to slide around a little to xerox it hell try to get it what about the kid hes calling the kid outstanding if it works out let me tell you how to get where i am andreno lived in an aging brick house in a narrow street of older brick houses all shouldertoshoulder with tiny yards and high porches and pairs of bedroom windows looking out over the porch roofs toward the street workingclass maybe lucas thought a movie set for an italian neighborhood lucas pulled up in front and andreno banged out through the door a few seconds later lucas climbed out of the porsche and said want to run it sure lucas tossed him the keys got in the passenger side and located the instruments for the other man andreno eased away from the curb now we got to drive around in front of all my exgirlfriends houses thats gonna take a while never got married got married twice loved both of them to death but they didnt like me much i guess andreno said i can be an asshole any kids two one with each they seem to like me all right got one myself with another one in the oven lucas said gotta have kids andreno said otherwise whats the point they were halfway downtown the old courthouse on the horizon with the gateway arch behind it when bender called andreno answered then handed the phone to lucas i cant talk and shift lucas took the phone whats up my daughters name is jill shes got a friend in the computer systems department over at heartland and he can get you a list of levys private clients take about twenty minutes can he do it without anybody knowing that hes the one who printed it we dont want levy pissed at anybody in case you know in case rinkers a friend of his we talked about that he can get it without anybody knowing turns out he pipes stuff out to a business guy at the postdispatch so hes done it before jills gonna get it shell meet you at tonys coffee lucas looked at andreno tonys coffee sure right downtown ten minutes well be at tonys lucas told bender howre we doing lucas laughed everything thats broken on the case was broken by us were rolling hang around tonys ill see you there myself in a half hour bender said till bender was a thin redhead with a big nose and wide smile she found them twothirds of the way back in tonys huddled over cups of coffee she slid in beside andreno and asked whereve you been keeping yourself playing golf andreno said he introduced lucas and then asked her hows your mom she still hurts they say they replace both knees at the same time because if you only do one youll never do the other because of the pain better than being crippled andreno said to lucas arthritis i heard that about the knee thing lucas said my fiancees a surgeon bender was digging in her purse and came up with a plain white business envelope you never heard of me she said if they really busted their asses could they figure out how it got to us lucas asked she shook her head i dont see how nobody knows about me and dave and even if they did itd be a long train and dad sounded excited about the whole thing so take it lucas took the envelope and put it in his pocket id like to buy you something a cup of coffee or a diamond necklace or something but itd probably be better if you got out of here she bobbed her head yup you guys be careful make dad be careful they said they would and she patted andreno on the thigh in a niecelike way and left lucas took the envelope out of his pocket and spread the four sheets of paper on the table on the left side of the paper was a list of names and addresses and on the right a bank balance and account number he scanned them but nothing in particular caught his eye as he finished each page he pushed it across the table to andreno when andreno had read the last page lucas asked see anything i know a couple of the companies the names andreno said nothing out of line but did you see the balances nothing under four mil bronze industries at thirtytwo million what the hell is bronze industries i dont know some kind of metal deal i never heard of it only four individuals never heard of any of them i dont know what to tell you i gotta get this back to the feds lucas said this is what theyre good at theres a copy place down the street they probably got a fax andreno waited at tonys for bender while lucas walked down the street on the way he punched sallys number into the cell phone got her and asked for a fax number she came back with it and he scribbled it on the palm of his hand what is it andy levys private client list with addresses account numbers and current balances you need to look at them and see what they lead back to most of them are companies whered you get it this might not be legal he heard somebody else in the room ask what lucas said look im gonna fax these things to you if you don t want them shred them as far as legal is concerned im not a lawyer i just got them from a guy he punched off and five minutes later started dropping the sheets into the fax machine the machine on the other end was running and accepted them bender and andreno were drinking coffee when lucas got back as lucas sat down bender pushed a neat stack of paper across the table lucas thumbed through them xeroxes of a police file i read some of the crimescene reports while i was xeroxing them bender said he was pleased with himself rinker killed them look at the pages i marked with the red pen lucas started pulling out paper reports from a crimescene team from a pathologist from a cop who ran the case the killer got in without breaking anything and there were no signs of tools used around the door the killer almost certainly had a key which didnt mean much there were ways to get keys the killer also knew where to find a jewelry hideout box a concealed vertical slat on the side of a dresser in the master bedroom the investigating cop described it as builtin and invisible in my opinion the perpetrator must have had prior knowledge of its location further along was a note that levy had receipts and appraisals for the missing jewelry setting its value at about sixty thousand dollars sixty thousand on the jewelry lucas told andreno my memorys getting bad or maybe its just the inflation some of the jewelry levy had purchased for his wife but most shed inherited from her grandmother and a greataunt the levys insurance covered only a small fraction of the valuation no more than five thousand dollars because theyd neglected to get a jewelry rider on their home insurance policy there was also a later note by a second investigator made when the active investigation was suspended that much of the value of the inherited jewelry was not in the stones but m the makers mark early tiffany gold and diamonds and that value would be lost if the pieces were melted down or broken up though a knowledgeable thief might try to sell them intact nothing had been recovered typical mafia greedhead would have been insured up to the nuts bender said maybe he thought thatd be too much of a tipoff lucas said like pulling the family pictures out of the house before you torch it andreno said might even consider it a nice touch losing the jewelry the victims had been sexually engaged when they were killed the man was shot in the back of the head there were no exit wounds and according to the pathologist the hollowpoints had made mush out of his brains because there were no exit wounds there were no spatter marks to indicate his exact position when shot the woman had tried to push him away but was shot herself before she could get entirely from beneath him she was draped over the bed onto the floor with one leg under the mans body lucas tapped the papers back together into a neat stack somebody comes in after a lot of research gets very close kills with a that none of the neighbors hear maybe a silencer provides levy with a nice touch on the jewelry and is long gone before the bodies are found very efficient rinker said bender finishing his coffee bender offered to drop andreno lucas took the porsche back to the fbi building went through the identification rigamarole and found malone sitting in the conference room by herself she looked up from her laptop blinked a few times to refocus and said lucas where is everybody most of them are working levy louis is down talking to the aic and the two computer guys went to lunch got anything new you get the faxes were running them now davy mathews the organizedcrime guy we introduced you the guy with the blue suit and white shirt thinks he remembers three of the names from references back in washington if he can remember three off the top of his head then there are probably more levy could be a serious matter her eyes drifted back to the laptop okay when is mallard getting back lucas pulled out a chair and sat down dug a legal pad out of his briefcase a few minutes hes just trying to get straight on whos doing what you want to see the st louis file on the levy murder now she turned to him one eyebrow raised lucas had heard that the oneeyebrow ability was genetic like the ability to curl your tongue you have access i got the file lucas said not the original but a complete xerox he took it out and pushed it across the table and malone walked her office chair over and thumbed quickly through it ill have somebody check it and crossreference the names thanks sure what are you going to do now sit back close my eyes and think he said he put his feet and calves on the table tilted the chair back and closed his eyes after a minute she asked youre just going to sit there for a while malone watched him for a few more seconds then shrugged and went back to the laptop after a minute or two his eyes still closed he asked louis make a move on you yet heavy silence then no is he going to i dont know hes certainly taking his time he wants to but hes too shy i tried to get him to grab you in mexico and he got in a heavy sweat hes sorta that way you may have to help him along ah jeez she said and after a while im not one hundred percent sure i want to hes not the most i dont know not a paperhanger sheetrocker the sheetrocker is like a fantasy big arms big legs little butt dumb as a bowl of mice hell never finish his novel he only has a novel because hes just barely smart enough to understand that women arent impressed by sheetrocking i doubt that hes faithful jeez i know hes not i mean i havent caught him running around or anything but it just isnt his nature lucas cracked his eyelids and looked at her she was sitting in her chair facing him shoulders hunched hands in her lap she looked lonely you guys look try him out mallard really take him out for a cup of coffee and just take a meeting for christs sake you both know how to do that thank you for your concern chief davenport fuck it im going back to sleep after a while he dropped the chair back down scratched his head and asked i guess youre monitoring claras cell phone in case she calls anyone yeah did you think about asking her brother to call her on that number whyd you have to mention louis malone asked i thought somebody ought to put the poor bastard out of his misery if nothing else she sniffed and lucas said no no no you know the rule no crying she wiped her eyes with the heel of her hand and he went back to his question anyway did you think about having her brother call rinker like early in the morning if he did and she answered and he kept her on for a few minutes maybe we could zero in on the neighborhood where shes staying shes gotta be ditched with a friend were talking about that malone said we dont have the street contacts here but weve got the brains weve talked through most of the possibilities based on what weve got you gonna do it probably if she doesnt move on levy or one of the others were doing a fullcourt press you got the budget yes we did she sniffed again and said you know i always thought i was going to grow up and be pretty glamorous an fbi agent high up with a gun and a computer and fly in jets and all i wind up doing is marrying stupid guys and i get to be a joke im too tall and im too thin and i always dress too conservatively im flinty this isnt the way it was supposed to be jesus malone you married them i cant tell you about that it always seemed like such a good idea at the time you know one of the guys the actor we got married at the courthouse by a judge and we went outside and he asked me if i had enough money for a cab and i thought this isnt going to work wed been married exactly seven minutes talk to louis for christs sake im going back to sleep lucas leaned back again he could hear an occasional flurry of keystrokes from the laptop as malone pushed through a file somewhere out in electronic fbiland his basic personal asset in the investigation was a bunch of guys who knew the town but that didnt mean much at the moment because there was no way to leverage that into more information if they had even a rough idea of where she was then some of the fbi data combined with street information might get them close until then he d read in an informational brochure at the hotel that there were more than two and a half million people in the st louis metro area too many another thought popped up say did you check levys past account records to see if claras in there if we could tell where shes moved her money thatd be good or maybe levy would know workin on it malone said if we can figure out these other accounts we may have something to squeeze him with huh two minutes of silence then another thought she probably crossed the border illegally i mean you know wetbacked it across she cant know the level of surveillance at the border she wouldnt want to take a chance of a random check on faked or stolen documents so so if she crossed the border illegally that means she probably crossed in texas new mexico arizona or california yeah i drove out to california last year and there arent that many ways to get from those places to the midwest in a hurry she could fly but she never flew much when you guys were tracking her before because theres always a record and they want id to get on the planesi bet she crossed out of mexico and bought a car shed need one when she got here and i think shed stick to interstate highways because theres more volume of traffic and shed be less conspicuous and shed probably pay cash for everything wheres this going youd only have to backtrack down a couple of interstates seventy fortyfour maybe fiftyfive malone said getting interested now ever since gas theft became a deal most of the interstate stations have surveillance cameras snapping photos of the cars as they gas up what if you gave the id photos to all the local sheriffs departments and had them paper the gas stations along the interstates if somebody recognizes her if we could even find out what day or even week that she was at a particular place we could run all of the plates and check the anomalies long shot lucas said but its a shot she said they were still talking about it when mallard arrived looking harassed lucass eyes met malones across the table and she gave a tiny negative shake of her head not now lucas turned to mallard and asked you all meetinged out yet meetings are the water we swim in mallard said he fussed with some paper but now we all agree whos running this particular investigation he paused me what about the net on levy were all over him hes in his office and if he walks down the hall to the rest room well know he looked at malone when i was listening to all that bullshit from lewis i was thinking about levy i want to contact him now this afternoon get everything we can on him go over there tell him hes on rinkers list and ask him why find out if he knows her or knows where her money is at least get him cooperating with the net what if he runs malone asked what if she kills him mallard said they all thought about that for a moment then malone asked if you make the call i can put it together in an hour mallard looked at lucas what do you think lucas shrugged if he decides to run can you stop him running would be the safest thing for him and he wouldnt even have to talk to you if you have something anything that would keep him from leaving id put it on him because if he has money ditched offshore somewhere and he splits it could be a long time before any of us see him again mallard nodded well find something you cant live in this country for two days without breaking some law somewhere you want me to put it together malone asked mallard nodded yes do it rinker had spent the early morn ing watching the outside of andy levys mansion mansion was the only word she had for the place she was parked a block and a half away across a busy street waiting for any kind of movement she needed to know that he was home and not hiding out somewhere else shed been waiting for an hour when the front door opened and levy in a robe and slippers stepped out on the stoop and picked up the newspaper opening and turning it in his hands as he stepped back inside he was reading the followup on the dichter killing she thought if the story was anything like what shed been watching on television it should spook him even further before he closed the door he looked carefully up and down the street even from a block away he looked worried she grinned as she tossed the glasses on the passenger seat and put the car in gear she needed him worried she needed him eager to make a deal eager to explain eager to talk when she got back to pollocks she found a copy of the postdispatch on the kitchen table with a piece of typing paper on it dorothy had scrawled read this ranker picked up the paper didnt take in the headline at all but saw the man in the orange suit and the chains and there was a click of recognition but she couldnt place him and then she thought no no they had gene and they were dragging him rinker read the story through an fbi agent a woman named malone rinker recognized the name from minneapolis was dragging gene gene she said might provide clues to clara rinkers whereabouts and was inclined to be cooperative because hed been arrested for possession of drugs this was his fourth arrest on drug charges and this time malone said he could be going away for a long time rinker put the paper down sprawled on the couch and stared at the ceiling and thought about it she thought for ten minutes then rolled off the couch still uncertain walked out to the car climbed inside she needed someplace reasonably far away like in illinois she drove north crossed the river drove across east st louis without looking down and on the outskirts found a truck stop with a halfdozen payphone booths designed for truckers she got five dollars in quarters checked the phone book called information got the number and called the minneapolis police department and asked for lucas davenport the phone rang once and a woman answered marcy sherrill is this chief davenports office she asked yes it is how can i help you can i speak to chief davenport please im afraid hes not here right now im not exactly sure when hell be back could i help you or have him call you rinker thought again then frowned and asked is he still in st louis yes i think so who is this please um charlotte could you tell him charlotte called now the woman on the other end of the line sounded pissed charlotte charlotte who just charlotte thanks a lot she hung up then grinned to herself sounded like she had gotten davenport in trouble she thought about crossing back to st louis since davenport was there but the pile of quarters was right in front of her with a couple of phone books so she turned to the yellow pages found hotels and started calling those with the biggest advertisements she found him on the fifth call nobody in his room thought another minute looked around found a white pages for st louis looked up the fbi what was the name of the woman in minneapolis marcy or cheryl marcy she thought she got a central switchboard at the fbi office and said my name is marcy and im with the minneapolis police department i work for chief lucas davenport chief davenport is there in st louis working with special agent malone i really need to talk to him its an emergency with a case hes on please hold and then after a minute and a half on hold like magic after a click or two davenport was on the line marcy lucas yeah is this marcy no actually its not lucas a long silence then his voice gone suddenly deeper howve you been not so good but you should know about that she could imagine the ferocious gesturing and waving on the other end of the line yeah i heard you were hit pretty bad he sounded calm enough im really sorry about the baby my fiancee is pregnant im doing that whole trip myself gonna get married in the fall your fiancee anybody id know no shes a doctor pretty tough girl youd probably like her maybe but to cut the bs i just wanted to call you and to tell you to keep gene out of this i knew the federales were going to get involved i wasnt surprised when i saw that woman malone in the paper but we all know that gene isnt quite right putting him in jail wont help anything im not going to come in you cant blackmail me but you can tell whoevers running that show over there that i take gene real personally and if they mess him up if they put him in prison or hurt him or do any of that then they better look to their families i wont try to blow up the president ill start killing agents husbands and wives and you know ill do it ill try to get him cut loose but im not a fed in the background faint but clear she heard a mans voice say shes not on her cell youd lie to me anyway she said hey clara id put your butt under the jail if i got my hands on you but im not fuckin with gene i think gene is a bad idea and ill try to get him cut loose im just not sure how much clout ive got okay she looked at her watch theyd been talking for exactly one minute i gotta go now theyre probably pretty close to busting this line give me your cell phone number i dont have goodbye wait wait wait i was just trying to stall you he read off the number and rinker jotted it down without saying goodbye again she hung up moved quickly out to her car and put it on the highway back to st louis six miles out an illinois highway patrol car went by in a hurry going east all lights and no siren maybe a train wreck she thought she was restless and though she wasnt inclined to move around in the daylight she headed back downtown maybe she thought another little probe on andy levy maybe she should call levy to sweat him a little to get him used to the idea of talking and she thought about that davenport was in town shed been told that he was not only ruthless but lucky which really frightened her ruthless she could deal with lucky was a problem when shed been stalking people shed always been so careful but always so aware that at any moment luck could turn and strike at her like a rattlesnake in her disastrous visit to minneapolis she and her client had twisted and turned and worked and struggled and never had been able to pull the last piece of stickytape bad luck off their backs luck had beaten them not intelligence skill or bad planning but maybe shed had a piece of luck this time shed heard that mans voice talking about a cell phone they must have the number on the cell phone that dichter had called they would have traced the number he was calling when he was shot and when it came up with a stolen phone must have known it was her what if theyd traced it to john sellos shed asked sellos about both dichter and levy before she went to look at levy again she might as well ask sellos about it she saw a sign for a bp station coming up took the offramp rolled in to a driveup phone found selloss number in her phone book and punched it in sellos answered sellos who was always home rinker said if you tell me why you talked to them if you tell me honestly i wont hurt you what i wont hurt you after a pause and then in what was almost a groan sellos said they knew all about it i didnt have a choice they said if i didnt talk to them theyd bust me on the dichter murder as an accessory and send me to death row they said they could trace the guy who stole the phone i didnt know what to do you gave them levys name clara what could i do i figured i could either tell them to screw themselves and maybe wind up on death row or maybe sneak it past you he was honest enough anyway goddamnit john was davenport there a guy from minneapolis big dark hair goodlooking guy yeah guy from minneapolis tough guy he came in with a local excop another tough guy i dont know how they found me exactly all right you gonna kill me no but ill tell you john the feds are cutting a wide swath with this one if they really think youre involved you could be in deep shit ah you dont know half of it what clara you know that guy troy who works for ross muscle guy with a flattop who always puts that tanning stuff all over himself no he mustve been after me well hes a real mean asshole and hes going around to everybody asking if theyve seen you or heard where you might be guess who hes traveling with i dont know john why dont you tell me honus johnson again it came out almost as a groan i know you know honus i know honus honus said that if they find out im lying about you that hed spend some time with me he said it in that real queer way and he touched me on the cheek ive been washing my cheek every five minutes but you lied well i like you clara but im really scared now between the cops and you and honus im sorry about this rinker said if i were you john id go away for a while it really would be for the best for you in six weeks itll all be over what ifyoure over honus johnson before i leave ill take care of honus johnson rinker said so go away john i got the club clara yes i know but you cant add value to the club if youre dead be very calm make arrangements with your accountant and the bartenders and then go oh man thats my last word john good luck to you goodbye she hung up and thought that answers that the feds had levys name and that meant they were probably crawling all over him by now more to think about and she had to consider honus johnson and his toys honus once told her that in his work for ross he preferred craftsman tools from sears because of the guarantee it hadnt made her laugh because honus had been serious then it occurred to her that luck had been with her this time sellos had provided a lot of critical information and then she thought as long as the cops werent monitoring sellossphone she looked around for a cop car a finger of fear touching her heart then peeled out of the bp lot and didnt start breathing again until she was back on the interstate at pollocks she turned on the television looking for the local news when you dont need it you cant find anything else when you do need it you can never find it she spent an hour clicking around the local channels then clicked over to cnn headline news and after a twentyminute wait saw a short piece of tape of federal marshals takmg gene into what was either a courthouse or a jail she saw malone again apparently supervising the tape made her so angry that she jumped off the couch and walked around the house back and forth punching at the air talking to herself fucking hurt him you fuckin hurt him imagining what shed do if they fuckin hurt him in the tape gene had looked utterly forlorn he couldnt take much jail time he was claustrophobic along with everything else if davenport didnt get him out of there shed have to do something move on the fbi that would kill her maybe she should simply leave she thought about that her money was well hidden and she had a place to go a warm place with beaches if it werent for gene she could just give it up make a call to ross to warn him off again let dichter stand as a warning she could leave now she couldnt not until gene was taken care of pollock usually got home around three oclock when she was going out rinker liked to go with pollock because then pollock became part of the disguise by two oclock shed been thinking about gene for so long and had looked at the postdispatch article so many times that she finally said the hell with it and went back out looking for another phone in the morning shed gone east so this time she turned west out she eventually stopped at an upscale shopping center called plaza frontenac to make the call she called the postdispatch but it wasnt easy the postdispatch operator switched her to the reporter whod written that mornings story about gene but the reporter wasnt in and his voice mail handed her to a woman on the city desk the woman sent her back to the same reporter before rinker could object and the voice mail sent her back to the city desk again this time she told the desk woman that i just need to talk to somebody who covers this clara rinker thing i used to know her the woman on the other end was unimpressed with the information and said in as close to a monotone as anyone could manage i could switch you to either fabian broeder whos our organizedcrime reporter or to sandy white the metro columnist well which one do you think whos the most important sandys the best known hes working on a rinker column for tomorrow let me talk to him she was on hold for another three seconds then the phone rang once and a mans voice said white are you reporting on the rinker case im writing a column white said who is this clara rinker a moment of silence then bullshit bullshit your own self rinker said you got something to take notes with yeah but i still dont think this is rinker thats what im gonna prove to you dumbhead just listen theres a cop from minneapolis working with the fbi on this case his name is lucas davenport she spelled it for him and hes a deputy chief from minneapolis i had a runin with him up there and he chased me out of my bar in wichita now hes down here helping the federales you got that much yeah he was typing like crazy the computer keys rattling in the phone okay heres how i prove who i am i called him this morning about ten oclock from east st louis and talked to him about the case he told me that his fiancee is pregnant i called him at the fbi building pregnant jesus are you kidding is this really rinker his voice was rising he was starting to believe yeah this is rinker if you call davenport and ask him about his fiancee hell confirm that i called him and that nobody else could know about it about that part of the discussion now i have a statement okay go what go with the statement white said oh okay um the fbi arrested my brother gene in california on some madeup drug charge gene isnt right in the head he never has been hes not stupid but hes just not in this world you got that and hes claustrophobic they are torturing him by putting him in jail hes an innocent kid and theyre torturing him because they think that will make me surrender but i wont i will tell you and everybody else this if anything happens to gene hes just like a helpless kid if anything happens to him the blood is on their hands and i will wash it off them one at a time one at a time off them and off their families off the fbi people whove done this go ahead thats all ive got you say the drug charges are bullshit you sure swear a lot for the telephone rinker said sorry im kind of excited okay ask them the fbi about the charge on gene gene never had more than a single doobie in his whole poor life he never had more than ten dollars when was the last time you saw somebody dragged from california to st louis in orange prison overalls and chains because he had a doobie okay oh and something else the fbi are all over a guy named andy levy from first heartland because they think im going to kill him next but im not going to andy used to handle money for me but he hasnt for a long time i just wanted to talk to him first heartland yes andys a vice president at first heartland and he does the banking for the mafia here in st louis the fbi knows that and theyve got him protected because they hope they can catch me but theyre wasting their time ive got no interest in andy holy shit first heartland there you go again sorry but listen who are you going to kill next id like to send a photographer rinker laughed almost like a quick cough the guy had some balls i gotta go let me read this back i dont have time but you talk to davenport i dont what uh why in the hell is a guy from minneapolis down here the fbi brought him down because they think hes the most likely guy to catch me are they right maybe but he hasnt caught me yet and hes had his chances rinker arrived back at pollocks in time to see pollock climb the porch steps and then disappear inside she pulled her car in a tight uturn took it down the dirt driveway to the garage hopped out lifted the door and parked when she let herself into the house pollock was in the kitchen pollock leaned into her line of sight and called you okay im good rinker said got a hornets nest going pollock said rinker looked at her for a minute then said if you think i should go i just think you should lay low for a few days pollock said she came out of the kitchen wiping her hands on a dishcloth i heard on the radio about you calling the fbi there are cops all over that truck stop if that was really you its on tv its everywhere on tv pollock said theyre taking fingerprints theyre talking to witnesses theyre making a sketch of you from witnesses all right rinker said soon as it gets dark im gonna take off for a while ill be gone two or three days outa here i dont want to know where youre going but she did and rinker said anniston alabama the garden spot of the deep south i been there i dont remember no garden pollock said thats okay because im not going after carrots rinker said im going to see an old army buddy the day was dragging on malone had put together an approach to levy and one of the feds was doing a powerpoint presentation on levys connections in the overground banking world and his possible ties with underground moneylaundering activities levys privateclient list had turned up a vein of investment by people tied to organized crime a threeman team had put together a halfhourlong briefing after six hours of financial research the team was taking questions when a silent strobe began flashing on a phone on a corner table malone was irritated by the interruption but she was closest she leaned back and picked up the receiver listened for a second and then looked at lucas marcy wants to talk to you problem at your office she said in a quiet voice shed met marcy during the rinker investigation in minneapolis sorry she should have called me on the cell lucas walked around the table and took the call halfturned his back to the guy making the presentation pushed the hold button and said quietly marcy lucas didnt sound like marcy unless shed developed a cold yeah is this marcy no actually its not lucas it took him just a second in that second he remembered what she smelled like the nice smell of perfume and a little beer the time they danced in her wichita saloon howve you been lucas started waving frantically at mallard who looked puzzled for a second then caught on he said silently miming the name with his lips rinker lucas nodded but missed part of what rinker had said he caught you should know about that around him the feds were scrambling for phones and one man dashed out the door a yellow legal pad spinning to the floor behind him yeah i heard you were hit pretty bad lucas said his heart was pounding but he thought cool down cool down shes too smart to give herself away he groped for something that would make a human connection and keep her talking im really sorry about the baby he said my fiancee is pregnant im doing that whole trip myself gonna get married in the fall one of the feds looked up at that and gave him the thumbandforefinger attaboy circlesign he could hear malone mumbling into a phone need an immediate trace on the call rinker said your fiancee anybody id know no shes a doctor pretty tough girl youd probably like her maybe but to cut the bs i just wanted to call you and to tell you to keep gene out of this i knew the federales were going to get involved i wasnt surprised when i saw that woman malone in the paper but we all know that gene isnt quite right putting him in jail won t help anything im not going to come in you cant blackmail me but you can tell whoevers running that show over there that i take gene real personally and if they mess him up if they put him in prison or hurt him or do any of that then they better look to their families i wont try to blow up the president ill start killing agents husbands and wives and you know ill do it ill try to get him cut loose but im not a fed lucas said one of the feds behind him said shes not on her cell and lucas thought ah shit youd lie to me anyway rinker said hey clara id put your butt under the jail if i got my hands on you but im not fuckin with gene i think gene is a bad idea and ill try to get him cut loose im just not sure how much clout ive got okay i gotta go now theyre probably pretty close to busting this line give me your cell phone number i dont have goodbye wait wait wait i was just trying to stall you he recited the number there was a pause and he added you can call that anytime but she was gone holy shit lucas said he turned to the room shes gone we got the line malone was on the phone waving him off then the man whod dashed out of the room hurried back in and said were jacked directly into the highway patrol when we get the line we got the line malone blurted its in illinois damnit said the man whod contacted the highway patrol weve got missouri highway patrol on line one they must have a quick way to get to the illinois cops malone punched up line and after identifying herself told the missouri cop that she was calling from illinois how quick can you get to them how long go then heres the location a truck stop lucas said when the cops get there dont let anybody leave the truck stop isolate the phone she was on we need to see we can get more prints see if we can get some people who saw her who can tell us what she looks like now malone nodded and started repeating what lucas said mallard said ive got a car lets go if its just you lets take my porsche ill get us there in a hurry mallard said to malone ill be on the cell phone call me in two minutes and vector us in on the truck stop its right off get on and go east and ill call you and get you there ive got a flasher for my car lucas said over his shoulder as he and mallard headed for the door tell the patrol that were coming through the distance was a little better than thirty miles once on the interstate they flew with mallard hunched over his cell phone listening to directions and updates from malone talking over the rush of the wind sheltering the face of the phone away from the red flasher behind the windshield between calls lucas filled him in on what rinker had said the warnings about her brother weve dealt with people a hell of a lot more dangerous than she is mallard said maybe not maybe not as personally dangerous lucas said most assholes arent focused on a particular group of agents that makes them easier to nail down shes not nuts not in that way the warning just tells us that the brother ploy is effective its working on her mallard said hope it doesnt bite you in the ass lucas said mallard went back to the phone and filled in malone on the warning from rinker when he got off he said malones routing out a crimescene guy to print the phone and another guy with a laptop u kit she talked to the manager of the truck stop and told him to keep people off the phones if we can find one guy who got a good look a her itll be worth the trip lucas looked out the window you know if rinkers staying here in town and if she went out there just to make the call the chances are were driving right past her over in the other lane mallard looked over into the westbound lane and said so close the truck stop looked like all truck stops a yellow steel building with blackout windows in the middle of an oversized oilstained concrete fuel pad with a double line of gas pumps and a couple of diesel sheds inside a convenience store was hipjoined to a macaroniandcheese restaurant with a set of rest rooms in the middle and a locked suite of driversonly showers a halfdozen cop cars were parked around the place when lucas gunned the porsche up the ramp and into a narrow slot between two highway patrol cruisers an illinois highway patrolman had just stepped up to the door going in when lucas pulled up and he shook his head and then stepped toward them when lucas killed the engine mallard was out first with his id fbi he said the cop looked at mallard then at lucas then at the porsche and said to mallard you guysre getting pretty fat rides these days hey the income taxes are pouring in you cant believe it lucas said we figure might as well enjoy life mallard said he owns it personally hes rich hes an asshole he works for the city of minneapolis the federal government drives lowend chrysler products that would make your mother cry with shame and whos running things i dont know i just got here myself the cop said e first cop on the scene had been a highway patrol sergeant named eakins who hadnt known exactly what was required and as an hed fnd adept at cvering his ass had done exactly the right thing a ph rzen the scenenobody out untl the feds said so nobodynear dont make much difference anyhow everybodys got a cell phone he said anybody see her two guys think they might have theyre in the restaurant eating pie eakins said all right mallard said just keep doing what youre doing can we let people out yeah if youre pretty sure theyre okay but get ids truck tag numbers just in case check the trucks make sure nobodys hiding behind the seats anybody coming in we should warn off if they can move along let them go if theyve got to stop here for some reason tell them there could be a delay before they can leave we can do that eakins said let me show you the pie guys and then ill get organized outside the pie guys looked remarkably alike big squarefaced overtheroad drivers in checked shirts with guts hanging over their tooledleather belts the woman they saw was probably rinker theyd both had a chance to look her over nicelooking blonde they said trim o j short hair classy but looked like a pretty good time she was in a hurry blueberry pie said i was kind of watchin her out of the corner of my eye she made a couple of calls but she was real quick with them like a businesswoman thats what i figured she was a realestate lady checking on calls or something apple pie added that she had a nice ass and thought she might have been heading toward a ford explorer when she went out the door i didnt see her get in it but there werent a hell of a lot of cars down there and when the cops come running in the door i noticed that the explorer was gone what color umm dark red livercolored sorta you didnt naw never looked at the plates i was too busy looking at her ass both pies agreed that rinker had used the second phone from the end in a bank of phones on the back wall of the convenience store as lucas and mallard finished the interview a black tahoe pulled up and a halfdozen feds climbed out then another tahoe and more of them all in suits looks like a podiatry convention lucas said to mallard they looked at the phones which looked like a lot of other phones and talked to other people who hadnt seen rinker and to people who hadnt seen her car and to one guy who was fairly sure that hed seen a black feller getting into the maroon explorer thats good lucas said to mallard now were not sure about the explorer malone arrived with another batch of feds they all went to look at the phones again and a fingerprint technician said im pretty sure those pie guys were right about the phone this was the phone she used hows that mallard asked i dont think any of the other phones will be this thoroughly wiped he said looks like she sprayed it with windex an hour after they arrived now convinced that they were wasting their time lucas bought a purpleflavored popsicle took malone aside recited the rinker conversation as close to wordforword as he could through the crumbling bits of fauxgrape ice and said i want o talk to gene maybe claras got some other reason for trying to push us away from him weve got some pretty good guys talking to him malone said know i know i just want to chat with him see what he has to say look him over can i come you can listen if you want but id rather you not be inside with me im looking for a nonfederal vibe she thought about it for a second then said okay i want to bring another guy to listen oldcop type your friend del shed met del in minneapolis no a guy from down here old buddy hes got a good ear maybe he could pick up something local if gene knows anything local a hint a little anything he looked around finished with the popsicle where do i throw the sticks she said no not the floor then ill set it up for this afternoon its getting late so itll have to be soon the gene thing what about levy you were all set to walk in on him were still go on that she said well take him home and when he gets there well knock on the door they took an hour to get organized get in touch with andreno and make it to clayton where gene rinker was being held in a rented cell at the county lockup i thought it was better from a security point of view given claras style to hold him here malone said as they went up in the elevator were not moving him in and out of an obvious spot when we want to talk to him andreno whod been waiting for them in the parking lot said so you guys been working day and night on this thing round the clock malone glanced at him andreno had changed to a lush gray doublebreasted chalkstriped suit that hed apparently bought from mafia tailors pretty much she said we have more than fifty agents in the field right now got some great italian restaurants in this town he said lucas shook his head she already has romantic entanglements he said andreno worked his eyebrows yet another reason she might want to try the local rigatoni malone looked troubled and turned to lucas hes not even a very good sheetrocker i realized that last night andreno was puzzled a sheetrocker the bottom line is her heart belongs to another lucas said were just trying to identify him andreno shook his head if ask me later lucas said to andreno well get a cup of coffee and talk about feelings fuck you malone said but she didnt say it in a mean way the elevator bell dinged the doors opened and they got out gene rinker was already in the interview room malone hung back while a jailer let lucas and andreno into the room the jailer gave rinker the be good look and shut the door rinker sat wordlessly as lucas and andreno settled in rinker was an inch sort of six feet and slender but not thin unhealthy as though he ate bad food his face so weathered that it actually seemed to be pitted with grains of sand his hands were rough as weathered as his face slack in his lap the roughness made them dark but the first two fingers of his right hand were nicotinestained his hair was limp dishwater blond and fell lifelessly to his slumping shoulders he wore a gray tshirt and jeans a size too big with white gym shoes the clothing appeared to have been given to him by somebody whod guessed at sizes he didnt look straight at either lucas or andreno if lucas had seen him on the street he would have thought loser a throwaway kid a street kid probably did a little dope probably stole a little probably too unsure of himself to go violent as lucas and andreno sat down he rubbed one finger between his eyes nervous then dropped his hands back to his lap were not feds lucas started im a cop from minneapolis this other guys a cop from st louis ive actually talked to your sister a couple of times talked to her yesterday rinker was skeptical but too scared to say anything lucas grinned at him you wouldve liked it she called me in the fbi building right in the middle of a meeting and told me to get the feds off of you there were fbi agents running around like chickens we figured out where she called from but by the time we got there she was gone rinker nodded cleared his throat good he ventured listen son the feds only got one handle on clara and youre it and theyre pissed andreno said theyre gonna stuff you in a drawer someplace if we dont catch her pretty soon and youre not gonna like it they got some tough goddamn prisons in the federal system he was using his sincere voice and it came off he sounded absolutely paternal lucas thought catching clara would be the best thing for everybody lucas said i know you dont want to hurt your sister not gonna hurt her rinker said thats good thats family feeling im italian and we got that feeling andreno said the problem is claras gonna get hurt theres no way around it the feds are gonna hunt her down and theyre probably gonna kill her if we could get her off the street i mean hell she has to have a trial and everything a spark of intelligence showed in rinkers eyes theyre gonna put her to sleep anyway no matter what you say he said one way she s free and maybe shell get away if you get her in jail theyre just gonna put her to sleep better to get shot than that having to wait around in a place like this he flipped one hand at the sterile room and then have somebody tie you to a table and put a thing in your arm maybe but maybe not lucas said but ill tell you this shes not only hurting herself and you shes hurting her friends shes crashing someplace around here with one of her friends and whoever that is shes just as guilty now as clara is shes taking her friends down with her does that sound right he put a little authority into it and vvatched rinkers wavering intelligence crawl back in a hole rinker mumbled i guess not and he looked at his hands do you know her friends here andreno asked rinker said nothing at all didnt seem to have heard the question his eyes flattened he seemed even slacker in the shoulders as though his mind had slipped away andreno repeated himself do you know her friends rinker stayed away for another few seconds then his eyes focused and he pulled himself out of wherever hed gone he shook his head she never said nothing about friends around here i didnt know anything about st louis i took off for los angeles as soon as i was old enough he stopped catching himself lucas pushed then where were her friends she must have had friends back home somewhere maybe rinker conceded he licked his lips i wouldnt know nothin about that she was oldern me they worked on him for another fifteen minutes but nothing came out of it he was not only a thrownaway kid lucas realized he did have some mental deficit or otherness he slipped away when they pressed him and only reluctantly came back when they ran out of questions lucas and andreno sighed simultaneously and lucas said well hell and andreno said wish we could help you son these goddamn feds they can be real assholes i gotta get out of here rinker said struggling to come alive i got all my stuff back in la if i dont get back larry or jane is gonna find it and theyll just fiat sell it theyll sell it first chance they get got some good stuff there got a suit got a radio i wish andreno began i gotta get out of here rinker said cutting him off his eyes were wg and going oily and he looked around the room looked for a window or a crack or anything that might let in some air i mean i just just i gotta get out of here i cant breathe i got dreams about clara lucas asked about me im like this big moth like the moths that come at night when youve got flowers theyre like hummingbirds but theyre moths and im one of them and these guys catch me and im flapping my wings and they keep pulling at me like theyre gonna pull my wings off and my feelers i got these big feelers like feathers and theyre gonna pull them off and they were all laughing and when i sat up on the bunk last night i thought i was there that they were pulling my wings off and i couldnt breathe i just kept flapping my wings lucas called the jailer then told rinker well try to do something gotta be a little patient though andreno chipped in hold on son when the jailer took him away rinker looked back at them and said i really gotta get back all my stuff is in la theyre gonna sell it if i dont get back malone had a tape if you want to listen to it again its all there he said as they took the elevator down i only saw one thing lucas said looking at andreno clara had a friend or maybe a couple of friends back home he didnt want to say it shouldnt be hard to find if theyre still there andreno said towns about two blocks long weve had agents out there malone said interviewed everybody nothing her mothers a vegetable barely remembers clara weve gone over the whole house from top to bottom looked at every scrap of paper find any friends nobody not many people even remembered her the family was sorta isolated huh lucas thought about it then asked andreno what do you think what else have we got maybe our friend the phone guy lucas suggested we could try him again if we dont get anything its about three hours down to tisdale we can go down late tonight after we talk to levy poke around tomorrow morning stop at the bass pro shops store and still get back by early afternoon gotta think about it lucas said to malone and you gotta think about cutting gene loose theres nothing there he could use some help this whole thing will resolve itself in the next week or so malone said weve got so many people looking that well either turn rinker up or shell leave when its resolved yeah well probably cut him loose if we dont catch her here well let him go and keep an eye on him for a few months see if he has any visitors they deflected malones curiosity about the phone guy she made a call talked to mallard for a few minutes lifted her face away from the receiver to tell lucas that theyd rendezvous in central west end at seven oclock and go from there to levys levy according to his watchers usually worked late at his office and got home sometime after six oclock louis wants to find a place to eat before we go in she looked at andreno andreno thought about it for a second then brightened perfect spot tell him theres a place called the black lantern fiveminute walk from levys place steak joint good salads good martinis weve got just enough time to eat comfortable malone relayed the information listened for a moment then said goodbye and hung up she told lucas he says youre supposed to call marcy at your office she says its semiurgent when they got out on the sidewalk lucas used his cell phone to dial the office in mineapolis black picked up then switched him over to marcy whats up lucas asked a columnist for the st louis postdispatch called here trying to get you he says that rinker called him this afternoon and gave you as a reference for some stuff she told him he says hes pretty sure its rinker who called gave me as a reference yeah whoever this is she told him that she talked to you marcy said she did she said she was you whatrtell me and in the background lucas could hear her say to black she called him she said she was me she sounded thrilled to have been touched by a celebrity ill talk to you later lucas said whats this news guys name and number his names sandy white lucas jotted the name and number in the palm of his hand rang off and told malone and andreno what had happened jesus andreno said whos running this operation the fbi or rinker there seems to be some disagreement about that malone said so do i talk to white lucas asked you make the call well have somebody else talk to him ill call louis on the way down to central west end malone said that way white cant push you because our guy can deny knowing too much about it and we find out what she said the black lantern was an oldstyle steak house set a few steps below street level and smelling of sizzling beef fat and beer mallard had already taken a table and was reading a menu the size of a wall calendar lucas introduced him to andreno and mallard asked does anybody read this guy sandy white probably not more than half the people in st louis andreno said hes got a job as a tv editorial guy too so hell have that going along with the column goddamnit mallard grumbled i talked to him rinker called him all right hes running a piece tomorrow warning us off her brother white talked to a cop somewhere and got gene rinkers arrest record and they know were holding him on simple possession one good thing about it lucas said as he studied the menu tell me please if somebody gets screwed for this its gonna be you not me lucas said andreno nodded and said got that straight they ordered wine and malone told mallard about the interview with gene rinker and then mallard and malone ordered salads and lucas and andreno ordered steaks and andreno said gene rinker is a troubled young man i dont think it was dope looked like he was fucked from the gitgo and you got nothing from him mallard predicted eh lucas said probably nothing we might run down to tisdale and poke around tomorrow tonight if nothing comes up get abed in springfield mallard shrugged we talked to everybody she knew but hell if you want to its fine with me maybe youll turn something up she didnt make good friends she was too messed up lucas said we think she might have had some friends when she was a kid we keep thinking shes gotta be staying somewhere shes not sleeping in her car whatever the steaks came a few minutes later and they talked about the case a bit and lucas thought about the friend that rinker must be staying with and said gesturing with a neatly forked square of rib eye you know if you really dont care how you get her i mean dead or alive you ought to talk to all the local assholes and tell them that shes staying with a friend somebody in that whole grapevine would know who her friends were she worked for them and somebody would know especially if there was some money on the table malone nodded there would have been no reason for her to keep her friendships secret back then mallard said except that shes smart we know shes smart and this whole thing with this white guy makes me think shes a little smarter than i realized i mean shes messing with us shes gonna have a bunch of civil rights attorneys on our asses in the morning all that makes me think shed know that her old pals might sell her out shed be ready for that levy lived on a semiprivate street four blocks from the black lantern a huge blackbrick pile with a marble entrance and a carriage house visible in the back one end of the street was open but with warning signs against nonresident parking the other end was closed with a wroughtiron fence theyd decided to go in cold the supervisor in the group covering levy called mallard toward the end of the meal to say that levy had arrived home hes scared hes got a guy traveling with him apparently a bodyguard he took his car straight into the carriage house and the bodyguard ran between the carriage house and the main house somebody met him and then levy ran up to the house while the bodyguard waited at the door must be pretty sure that nobodys in the carriage house then lucas said our guys said both the house and the carriage house are wired up tight wei at least we know hell be there doesnt sound like he expects to go barhopping andreno said they took their time walking over looking at the houses along the side streets there were lights everywhere people moving around if rinker was in one of the houses on levys street or behind levys street shed have a tough time getting out lucas thought as soon as we talk to him vou oughta have the net guys start going door to door making sure that rinkers not holding somebody in one of these places lucas said well do that mallard said at the entrance to levys street they passed though a wroughtiron gate closed it behind themselves a man in a suit climbed out of a car and walked toward them he was carrying a pale straw hat and said louis david everybody this is david homburg mallard said to lucas and andreno to homburg were going in you and me and malone and lucas and uh mr andreno i guess hate to miss it andreno said mallard told homburg to leave two watchers on the front and back of levys and to have the rest of the net begin knocking on doors two men at a time homburg stepped back to his car and spoke on a radio for a few moments then rejoined them done so lets go mallard said levy was not what lucas expected hed expected one of the toughfaced finance guys and instead got a roundfaced beach boy middle forties with bleached tips on his light brown hair a carefully revised nose dark brown golf shirt under a soft leather lounging jacket with fawn slacks and leather moccasins without socks the bodyguard was another case altogether he was a muscular size with a buzz cut he looked like he was made from leather that the cobbler had thrown away before making levys shoes hed come to the door carefully checking them from a side window then through the securityglass window on the door mallard and malone held up ids so he could read them and when he opened the door he still had a hand on his back hip pocket where lucas thought he had a gun federal bureau of investigation mallard told him were here to talk to mr levy ill see if hes in the tough guy said we know hes in because weve had a net around him all day watching him we just watched you take him from the carriage house to the back door running when you see if hes in you might suggest to him that clara rinker is unlikely to show up with a committee wait here the tough guy left them standing on the porch one minute two looking at their shoes and the trees listening to the cicadas fiddling down at them nice night mallard said eventually fuckin guy andreno said then the tough guy came back looked them over again and said come in levy bleachedtip hair and sockless mocs stood with his hands in the pocket of his jackets in the doorway of a library mr mallard could i see your id again mallard handed him his id malone and homburg held theirs up so he could scan them as he read down mallards then he looked at lucas and andreno a petulant frown creasing his forehead what about these gentlemen theyre essentially hired thugs mallard said they dont have id in any case we really dont want to spend any more time sorting through the personnel mr levy clara rinker is here to kill you we know that for sure were trying to catch her you might be able to help how do you know it for sure because one of our agents talked to a gentleman who she interrogated and your name was prominent in the discussion we think you know all of this weve been watching you for a couple of days and weve noted the precautions youre now taking like the man with the gun levy stared at mallard for a moment mallard looked placidly back then said why dont we sit down they filed into the library the library was a stage setting lucas thought filled with decorator book sets bought by the running foot an oversized mahogany desk with an inset leather top an expensivelooking oriental carpet and a globe the size of a weather balloon levy settled into a chair behind the desk mallard and malone took guest chairs facing the desk homburg found a seat on a faux louis xiv and lucas and andreno picked out places to lean andreno seemed fascinated by the globe and began turning it under one hand as mallard and levy talked levy said how do you know shes looking for me she blames you and several other people for the attempt on her life in mexico you managed to kill her fiance she was also pregnant and when she was wounded she lost the child she has now clearly gone over the edge shes insane we frankly think you have one small chance to stay alive cooperate with us what if i decide to take care of myself then youll die mallard said nanny dichter was as well protected as you are and she picked him like a bad apple levy said i really dont know anything about what happened in mexico and my involvement with her was only peripheral one of my other clients once asked me to help her set up a retirement account which i thought was entirely legitimate you can cut the shit malone said weve known about your privateclient accounts for quite a while we let you run them because we were learning so much about the crime club around here but just leave out the bullshit okay itll make this conversation a lot shorter lucas suppressed a smile the mallard and malone goodcop badcop act was back in town and malone made an excellent bad cop the vulgarities slipping from her notably prim mouth made her that much more effective levy leaned back i do not know mallard interrupted what we would like to do is slip a few people in here as soon as were sure that she isnt watching then well pull back our covering net and let her walk into the trap thats what we want what if you dont have enough guys this isnt a tv movie shes not invincible shes not wonder woman once we see her well take her mallard said well have two or three guys who could take her by themselves and well have two or three guys to back them up and then well have a couple more guys to back them up well have a net to take you downtown and another trap at the bank youll be safer than the president so all i have to do is agree ill be blunt mr levy we think we could build a hell of a moneylaundering case against you malone said we think we could see you into leavenworth for twenty years and thered be no parole you might want to get a lawyer and see what you can negotiate if you had any kind of information for us wed be happy to take that into account otherwise do what you want but its in both of our interests to take out clara rinker levy made a steeple of his fingers resting them on his chest then im gonna want to talk to my guy my counsel my attorney ill get him over here tonight until then keep her off me if she sees us well be wasting our time mallard said youve got to decide tonight so we can get our people out of sight ill decide levy said let me call my guy they all sat for a moment with nothing more to say until andreno said this is a hell of a globe where do you get a globe like this levy left them talking in the library while he called his attorney seeing no point in waiting lucas collected andreno and told mallard that they were going out have a couple of beers talk to people maybe head to springfield back tomorrow late afternoon unless something comes up youve got my cell phone on the walk back to lucass car andreno asked you think shell walk into it mmm no could happen it could happen but i doubt it she aint gonna walk up and ring the doorbell itll be something trickier i just dont know what lets find sellos maybe shes come back to him they headed downtown but when they got to the bluesnote they found that sellos had disappeared the bartender said he went to golf school what yeah a shortgame school he polished a glass and held it up to a light looking for smears you know from a hundred yards in dont know where exactly andreno looked at lucas and said now what lucas leaned close to the bartender and said give me four bottles of dos equis just crack the caps outside again with the four bottles of beer in a paper bag lucas said where do you think he went if hes alive maybe michigan theyve got good golf courses mmm i guess palm springs would be a little hot this time of year a warm breeze scuffled down the street lucas looked up at the moon nice night for a road trip unless the highway patrol catches us with open beer like they could catch us lucas said the pain pushed through the sleep like an arrow and he rose to the surface and tried to sit up and stretch his right leg but the cramp held on and got deeper and lucas groaned man man manomanoman and tried to knead it out but the cramp held on for fifteen seconds twenty then began to slacken when it was nearly gone he climbed gingerly out of bed and took a turn around the hotel room his calf still ached as though with a muscle pull he sniffed and looked around getting oriented he was on the eighth floor of a holiday inn outside of springfield missouri like most holiday inns it was nice enough neat and clean but still smelled a little funny nothing he could quite pin down years before in college hed ridden buses down to madison to see a particular university of wisconsin coed and had noticed that there was always the faint snap of urine in the air and assumed that it was urine then one day on a longer trip on an express bus theyd all been asked to get off in memphis so the bus could be cleaned when he got back on one of the cleaners was still at work and the urine smell was not only fresh but intense and close by and he realized that the everpresent urine smell was nothing more than the cleaning agent whatever it was and not the end product of somebody pissing down the seats he hadnt ridden those buses in years but he could still summon up the memory of the odor as he limped around the hotel room it occurred to him that the funny smell in holiday inns something you could never quite put a label on might be builtin if it was he thought they should build in something else he stopped the circular march long enough to click on the tv hoping to pick up the weather he got cnn by default and as he was about to click around for the weather channel the blond newsreader turned expectantly to her left and the shimmering image of a st louis reporter came up and under his ruddy round face the label sandy white st louis postdispatch sounded distraught and while people may certainly have no sympathy at all for miz rinker i personally find the plight of her brother gene to be intensely painful he was arrested and charged on a crime that usually produces something on the order of a traffic ticket in california and here he is being dragged across the nation and exhibited to television cameras as if he were a criminal mastermind in fact betty there is good evidence that gene rinker is mentally impaired and may not even understand why he is locked up in a special highsecurity cell in one of the hardest jails in missouri ah jesus lucas said to the tv as the two heads continued to talk he watched the rest of the segment which produced nothing more of intelligence then clicked around until he found the weather channel he sat on the bed rubbing out his calf until the local segment came up and headed for the bathroom happy with a prediction of lateafternoon thunderstorms that was okay theyd be out of springfield before the storms arrived he shaved brushed the sour taste of overnight beer from his teeth and tongue and was in the shower for two minutes when andreno called they agreed to meet in the breakfast bar in fifteen minutes and lucas finished cleaning up hed brought one change of clothes in a plastic laundry bag stolen from the st louis hotel he changed into jeans golf shirt and a light wovensilk sport coat stuffed the dirty clothes back in the plastic bag and headed out you get a chance to look at cnn this morning andreno asked the gene rinker thing with that sandy guy yeah assholes of course hes right sandy white is fuck him anyway lucas snarled silently across the breakfast room at a pretty young waitress who hurried over two waffles maple syrup two cups of coffee for me he looked across the table at andreno and what do you want andreno ordered and when the waitress had gone lucas said malone and mallard are smart people theyll figure out gene ill call them yeah fuckin cnn jesus you sound like you got up on the wrong side of the bed ill cheer up lucas said thinking of the leg cramp i dont usually get up at seven oclock christ im amazed that they already let the air outside when the pretty waitress came back with the food he smiled at her and tried to make small talk but shed already written him off because of the silent snarl and he finished breakfast feeling like a jerk i feel like a jerk he told andreno as they left hed overtipped and that hadnt helped not me andreno said i think she sorta took a shine to me before you got there i told her if she could get off for a few minutes j d run her around town in my porsche whatd she say she said she couldnt get off lucas started to laugh and a little of the gloom lifted tisdale was the secondlargest town in mellan county after hopewell the county seat they drove through on the way to hopewell where the sheriff could meet them at what is that smell andreno asked as they bumped across a set of railroad tracks into the town i dont know lucas said it aint rosebushes a minute later they passed what looked like four of the biggest yellowsteel pole barns in the midwest painted neatly on the side of each building was logan poultry processing and under that in small letters really pluckin good the smell andreno said like a combination of scorched feathers and wet chicken shit which it probably is lucas said you know if you breathe through your mouth you can still smell it there was nothing in tisdale they drove past rinkers mothers house a mile out in the country and saw nothing moving the house was short a story and a half with peeledpaint clapboard siding and drawn curtains a neglected driveway projected into a singlecar garage the door was open and the garage was empty a small brownandwhite dog sat under the rusted rural mailbox at the end of the drive and looked lost and thirsty in the back an ancient ford tractor sat abandoned and rusting in a crappy brushchoked woodlot what if we busted in with our guns out and clara was sitting at the kitchen table eating oatmeal andreno asked shed probably shoot us both and throw our bodies in the septic tank lucas said so lets go see the sheriff mellan county sheriff errol lamp was not an impulsive man and when lucas and andreno showed up at the county courthouse in hopewell he questioned their credentials and had a deputy check with the feds in st louis eventually he got to mallard who told him exactly where his bread was buttered and who buttered it as they were talking a woman stuck her head in the office and said errol you know that porsche out by the rinkers its these guys the sheriff looked at them with his slow eyes and said you went by the rinkers huh yeah howd you know neighborhood crime watch the sheriff said they report anything suspicious like a porsche lot of drug runners drive porsches seconds before lucas would have lost both his patience and his temper lamp assigned a deputy to take them around the county and lucas thought to fill him in later been ten federal people here to see rinkers mother and none of them went in believing what we said but they all came out believing said the deputy whose name was tony mccoy mccoy was a heavy sweating man in khakis with a straw stetson a rodeo beltbuckle and deepblue cowboy boots they were in his jeep grand cherokee whats that andreno asked thats shes craziern a goddamn cuckoo clock she wont have no idea what youre talking about so lets not go there lucas said lets go to the school the school yeah you know brick building full of kids mccoy gave him a hard look and lucas smiled into it lucas had kindly blue eyes but his smile often came off as a threat and mccoy flinched away wanna go to the school the school it is he muttered the mellan consolidated school was larger than lucas expected with two academic wings built around a gymnasium the principal was a thin youngish woman with carefully colored hair a single eyebrow that extended straight across her brow ridge and glasses that sat a quarterinch too far down her narrow nose she had the habit of pushing them back up with her middle finger and as andreno said later every time i looked at her she was flippin me off we have cooperated with a number of fbi requests and interviews and frankly we just dont have much she said there was an agent here named josh franklin if you were to talk to him were looking for different angles lucas said if you know anybody who knew clara rinker or any of the rinkers im sorry but im about the same age as clara so when she left here i was in ninth or tenth grade in weston oklahoma she said we only have two teachers here who remember her and so far nobodys found them helpful if we could just get a couple of minutes with them of course were happy to cooperate she said unhappily the two teachers both women both in their late fifties or early sixties remembered only one new thing the older of the two said it might not mean anything at all but one thing i do remember about clara and never told anybody else because it hadnt happened yet and its not exactly about clara is that ted baker got all his guns stolen last month and his guard dogs were shot this was before clara showed up in st louis ted was only two or three years older than clara and he used to run with claras older brother roy huh lucas said all his guns he looked at the deputy who scratched his head and said thats right we handled the breakin i figured it was one of those gun nuts that baker hangs out with if he didnt do it himself for the insurance i didnt know that he knew clara he did the teacher said dont tell anybody i said so mccoy said he knew where they could find baker if hes not at the landfill shootin rats or outpluckin chickens hes usually around his house hes got some new dogs and hes training them mccoy drove them from hopewell back to tisdale they stopped at a dairy queen and got chocolatedipped cones agreeing that they must be lowcal because they were ice milk not ice cream and then rode out the west side of town on the county road bakers house was a close cousin to the rinker homestead a beatup seventyyearold frame house with a tired garage off to the side the house was surrounded by a waisthigh chainlink fence and two young german shepherds were staked out behind it mccoy ran down the driveway as far as the gate then leaned on his horn baker a rawboned man with shaggy brown hair and a twoweek beard stepped out onto the porch he had a can of budweiser in his hand squinted at them pointed a finger at the dogs who dropped back to their stomachs and walked up the driveway they talked over the fence never occurred to me that it could have been clara though it sounds stupid to say it he told them when lucas explained why they were there i didnt even hear about her coming back to st louis until a couple weeks after i was hit i never put it together you think it was her mccoy asked you got some crazy friends running around out there baker grinned at them through lightgreen teeth and said shit mccoy theres nothing wrong with those boys yeah like harvey well harv baker considered the name reluctantly harvs a couple cans short of a sixpack is what he is mccoy said well harvey tell you the truth it crossed my mind that it might be one of them except i cant think whod shoot the dogs takes a cold man to shoot the dogs even harvey wouldnt you think clara could do it lucas asked ill tell you what baker said the last time i seen clara was five or six years ago she came through to see her mama and i bumped into her down to the rootbeer stand she asked me what i was doing and i said shootin and working at logans and thats about the end of it we wasnt like good friends not that i wouldnt have liked to fuck her if you know what i mean know what you mean mccoy said hitching up his khakis she had these nice little hard tits like cupcakes baker continued and you got the feeling shed probably fuck back at you the dogs lucas repeated i dont know if she can shoot all those people shes supposed to i guess she could shoot the dogs somebody did baker said right in the head bam bam anybody figure out what kind of gun it was it were a baker said i couldnt bring myself to dig out the slugs but i looked at the holes and id say it was a standardvelocity good tight entry wounds no sign of bullet breakup no exit wound good shootin too they never knew what hit them and you havent seen her for all that time nope kinda like to though if you catch her i might go see her in jail she was a nude dancer before she was a killer i bet shes got some stories to tell bet she does mccoy said nodding his tongue flickered over his lips tasty stories did she know about your guns lucas asked oh sure pretty much everybody around here knows i got an interest baker said i used to hang with her brother and she was over here a time or two when we were gunnin im the one who taught her brother how to reload so you were friends andreno said nah not with clara she was around because roy took her around i personally think roy may have been knocking a little off her you know what i mean but she was standoffish even when she was little shed just look at you i didnt have much to do with her did you know any of her friends lucas asked i dont think then he stopped and looked from lucas to andreno you know about patsy hill right lucas and andreno shook their heads and lucas said havent seen the name jeezus baker looked at mccoy you know about patsy hill mccoy shook his head baker said great fuckin police work huh all you runnin around like maniacs and you havent heard of patsy hill well who is she lucas asked patsy lived over by clendenon over toward springfield thats where carl paltry came from andreno said who lucas remembered the fbi report rinkers stepfather baker nodded thats right i think he was fuckin her too clara anyway he come from over there and i think maybe they even lived there for a little while or off and on if you know what i mean thats where rinker met patsy hill so who in the fuck is patsy hill mccoy asked another goddamned killer baker said with a wide green smile i always thought it was amazin two smalltown girls get to be best friends and they both grow up to be killers cops was all over the place here about ten years ago must be maybe longer because patsy was living down in memphis with her husband and she killed him with an ax or something like that maybe it was a hammer whacked the shit out of him then she ran and they never caught her never lucas asked not as far as i know and i think id probably hear about it i know some people who growed up over there it aint that far cross the county line near to springfield mccoy said he was plainly relieved not his jurisdiction clara and patsy didnt go to the same school lucas asked not here baker said i dont know where patsy went to school maybe springfield but there was a time when patsy and clara was like this he crossed two fingers they both grew up to be killers she got any family around patsy lucas asked yeah over in clendenon right there on tree street they talked a while longer got a list of the stolen guns and headed back into hopewell lucas thanked mccoy for his help then he and andreno drove back toward the interstate in the porsche we going to clendenon andreno asked we might be onto something lucas said the feds dont know about this i read the whole file if this patsy hill killed somebody years ago and ran and rinker hid her and if shes somehow living and working around st louis then hill could be paying rinker back letting her stay over and hill couldnt turn rinker in no matter how big the reward was even more ill bet none of claras mafia friends knew about hill why would clara tell them one of them might have been tempted to use hill as a getoutofjail card lucas said he looked over at andreno ill tell you what ill bet five united states dollars right now that rinker is staying with hill i dont know where hill is but if we can find her well find rinker andreno thought about it for two minutes then said no bet he said it with a tone like lucas he could smell the trail a little farther down the road lucas said lets not forget about that list of guns huh shes always been a pistol queen but now shes got a carload of rifles we gotta let mallard know we need to spread the net around levy on the way to clendenon lucas got the address for a hill family on tree street chuck and diane and the phone number he tried to call ahead but there was no answer and no answering machine we could be here for a while he said to andreno clendenon was a small town not quite a suburb of springfield with a blocklong downtown and a bp station at the end of that block they asked the gas station attendant about tree street and got detailed instructions you might want to keep your speed down in that porsche the attendant said as they turned to go the town cop figures out speeds based on his best estimate and your car looks like its going forty when its sitting at the gas pump thanks lucas said no problem youll find the cop just about ablock down that way sitting behind that blue house take er easy they crept by the blue house at twenty miles an hour and if there was a cop in the black mustang parked at the curb behind the house he made no move to come after them they took a left two blocks farther on and found tree street two more blocks down lucas took a left found the house numbers going the wrong way made a uturn drove two blocks down and parked in front of the hill place as with the rinker and baker houses the hills was an older place small with a detached garage but all of it was neatly kept with a front windowbox full of yellow and winecolored pansies and a strip of variegated marigolds along the driveway when they got out of the car lucas could smell freshly cut grass they knocked got no answer tried the neighbors a woman in a housecoat told them that chuck hill worked at the grain elevator and diane went grocery shopping in the morning and should be back at any moment saw her leave an hour ago so she oughta be here she comes diane hill arrived in an aging taurus station wagon bumped up the drive and got out with a plastic grocery sack she saw them coming and waited in the driveway lucas identified them and she said sullenly what do you want when your daughter disappeared she had to go somewhere we think she might have gone to clara rinker and we think clara might be with her now a transient look of what pleasure lucas thought so crossed hills face and then vanished as quickly as it had come we dont have any idea where patricia might be we just hope to god that everything is all right with her after the hell that her husband put her through she never got in touch just to tell you that shes all right yes shes called from time to time and i told the police that she calls sometimes and she cries because she cant come home and she cant tell us where she is because shes afraid that somebody will find out and the police will come get us shes protecting us by not telling andreno tried mrs hill honest to god we dont care about patsy patricia shes somebody elses problem but clara is killing people mafia hoodlums hill snapped shes killed a lot of innocent people lucas put in shes going to kill more thats not my problem hill said clutching at her groceries all i know is she was kind to my daughter when my daughter needed some kindness and couldnt come here to get it and i know what happened to poor clara when she was just a girl and it doesnt seem strange to me at all that shes grown up to kill people where were the police when her stepdaddy was working his perversions on her and her not even fourteen where were they when patricias husband was burning her back with a clothes iron mrs hill you tell me where the police were then mrs hill and if i were you i wouldnt go talking to chuck thats my husband because hes gonna be a damn sight less cordial than ive been we dont approve of any kind of criminality but if the police really took care of crime there wouldnt be any clara rinker and our patsy would still be with us excuse me she marched up the driveway and into the house and slammed the door after a moment andreno said i think we handled that pretty well we oughta get a warrant and tear the house down really lucas shook his head no shit want to try chuck ill drop you off if you want to no thanks back to st louis then lucas sighed looked up at the hill house i guess ten miles out of town he said the hills didnt mention any other children andreno shook his head no i sorta got the impression that patsy might be the only one huh how many longdistance phone calls you think come pouring into the hills house mmm i bet she calls on christmas lucas said or new years or right around then i bet the feds can get a warrant for their phone records bet they can too he picked up his cell phone gonna tell them about the rifles so they can spread the net around levy i want to tell them in person about the hill idea i dont want them pissing on it when i cant defend it theyve sat around that conference table and pissed on every idea ive had even when they paid off theyre feds thats what they do theres no good way to get from st louis to anniston alabama in a hurry any more than theres a good way to get from minneapolis to st louis rinker couldnt hurry anyway because she couldnt risk a traffic stop she took east to and down to nashville where she picked up and all the way to birmingham and then east to anniston she started late in the afternoon and was still driving at dawn she listened to a st louis cardinals game heading down to nashville thinking about those times in the liquor warehouse about a million years earlier when the cards games always ran in the background and she no baseball fan knew every man on the roster she lost the cardinals outside of nashville and poked around the radio looking for some decent country but that was hard to come by she finally found a local station along the alabama line playing a long string of leann rimes including blue one of rinkers favorites when that station faded she spent the rest of the night dialing around the radio for more good places to listen at am a little beatup but pleasantly so she always liked road trips she checked into a cheap motel called tapleys and when asked how many thered be she said well my husbands probably coming over during the day hes a sergeant in the army but im not sure if hell be staying the night the lady clerk looked at her with a touch of warmth in her eyes and said well put you down for one and if that changes honey just let me know ill do that and thanks rinker said id give you a credit card but i dont know if itd work hes probably put a bass boat on it ill just give you cash if thats okay thatd be fine she called wayne mccallum at eight oclock and got him on the first ring sergeant mccallum ordnance wayne george mccallum how are you she used her best whiskey rinker voice there was a pause then oh shit i need to talk i wouldnt doubt it but things are pretty hectic right now his voice was casual with an underlying layer of stress did you take that twelvestep i heard about or are you still running down to biloxi on the weekends i sure as shit aint took no twelvestep he said mccallum had a fondness for craps so come on i got something you need and you got something i need i cant talk right now could you call me at my other number in about five minutes he gave her a number ill call she said she waited while he ran out to a pay phone gave him an extra minute and dialed he picked up on the first ring i can get you two good ones equipped three thousand i dont need them i need something special special real special we better talk see you at the usual the usual she got four hours of sleep and a little after noon got cleaned up changed into jeans running shoes and a shortsleeved shirt and clipped one of her pistols into a pulldown fanny pack behind the pistol she stuffed a brick of fiftydollar bills wrapped with rubber bands when she was ready and feeling a little adrenaline she headed south to talladega then east into the mountains of the talladega national forest she stopped at a wayside park where a hiking trail started off into the woods she sat in her car for a moment watching then retrieved the fanny pack from under the front seat and strapped it on with the pack in front she also dug out one of her cell phones checked to make sure it was the right one and carried it with her for years wayne mccallum had been her main source of silenced ninemillimeter pistols and shed dealt with him twenty times theyd once had a long talk about meeting places places to talk places to exchange equipment for money they had agreed that cleverness was its own enemy if you met in a crowded public place which was one theory on how you do it the crowd bought you protection from the person you were meeting and if somebody was onto you youd never see them coming if you could just see them coming there was always a chance a lonely spot but still technically public where you wouldnt seem suspicious just for being there was the best solution a hiking trail was perfect as long as she had her best friend along with a full magazine and a spare she climbed out of the wayside park up the hiking trail then looped up a secondary track to a scenic overlook when she got to the top she found it empty she had in fact met mccallum a halfdozen times at the overlook and except for mccallum had never encountered another soul the overlook was nothing more than a circle of rocks around a patch of beaten earth on the edge of a steep hill there was a good view back toward talledega and no sign of recent use nothing but old cigarette filters scattered around the rocks and a couple of weatherrotted clumps of toilet paper back in the bushes she expected the filters would last until the next ice age longer than the rocks anyway mccallum arrived precisely at one oclock driving an older cadillac hed always driven a caddy because thats what men like him drove and thered always be a set of good golf clubs in the trunk he climbed out smiled up at where he thought she was and came puffing up the trail a fat redfaced man in civilian clothes way out of shape welcome to todays army rinker thought we gotta find some goddamn place flat he said as he wheezed into the overlook he was close enough that she could smell his breath and it smelled like sensen she wondered if they still made it or you gotta take off some weight rinker said she smiled how are you a hell of a lot better than you mccallum said he looked her over then said after all that shit up in minnesota i figured the next time i saw you wed both be in hell not there yet she said if you dont stay the fuck away from st louis you will be he said got a couple more things to do before i take off she pulled the top off her fanny pack let the pistol unfold then dug behind it for the brick of fifties she tossed it to him and he caught it glanced at the denomination on the top bill and said this is a lot she held up the cell phone remember you told me about that israeli thing he laughed and said youre shitting me he ran two hands through his short hair then scrubbed at his scalp like one of the three stooges rinker could never remember their names but it was the fat one youre not shitting me im not can you really do it she asked hell yes ive been itching to jeez rinker thought his eyes are bright banged off a couple myself he said up here in the hills just to make sure it works it works it works beautiful how about the plastic can they get back to you its all civilian they could never bring it back here back to me how long to do it couple hours i could have it tonight he said he was getting excited aroused i mean its real easy bout everything you need is already built into the phone you need one chip and the plastic itd be a favor wayne rinker said she gave him her numberthree smile the quicker the better she drove back to anniston leaving after he did taking a different route checking her back trail at the motel she slept the rest of the afternoon and spent the early evening watching television at eight oclock she drove out to an interstate gas station and a telephone mccallum picked up on the first ring we going out or what she asked im ready honeybun tell me where how about boots boots was an army bar shed been there once before in the parking lot see you there again she was there before he was that was part of the deal though she had little faith in the idea that she could spot cops she was virtually certain that mccallum wouldnt turn her in hed helped her too many times and alabama had primitive ideas about the proper punishment for murder when the caddy rolled in she watched for five minutes then decided shed buy it shed seen nothing that worried her she rolled down the hill into the parking lot up close to the cadillac and dropped the passengerside window neon lightning rolled off the caddys hood reflecting the onandoff boots sign overhead mccallum saw her got out of his car stepped over climbed into the passenger seat and fumbled the cell phone out of his jacket pocket heres the phone he said he sounded eager to get rid of it or to please her like a child giving a gift to a teacher if you was to take it apart and knew a lot about phones you might find the plastic if you didnt and if you just looked into it youd never see it what happens if i call out nothing its still a perfectly good phone but ill tell you what you dont want to call out to cause if you do the beastll blow your ass off youre sure im sure he nodded in the dark same thing when youre calling into it you call you make sure you got your guy and you punch then you wont have your guy anymore how powerful is it rinker asked i mean would it blow up this car oh hell no mccallum shook his head i got a chunk of plastic in there not much biggern a slug no the damage would all be to the head but itll flat knock a hole in that if you were to put it in the backseat and it went off you probably wouldnt hear much for a few days and thered be a hell of a hole in the upholstery but it wouldnt kill you its bout like a charge in a say a mag rinker looked at the phone then back up at the soldier wayne if youd gone into this business fifteen years ago i wouldnt have had a job werent no cell phones fifteen years ago mccallum said and you know what puttin this thing together made me kind of horny id like to see it go i mean i could do this youre a freak wayne rinker said of course i am sweetheart mccallum beamed at her his fat sweaty jowls trembling with excitement course i am she checked out that night told the woman working behind the counter that things just hadnt worked out going past the bama border she looked for the country station that had featured leann rimes but it was an am station and she lost it in the static of the thunderstorms closing in from the west she caught the rain at nashville lightning bolts pounding through the inky dark night radio stations coming and going the jocks talking of tornado warnings and multiple touchdowns near clarksville she came out the other side of the squall line before dawn and rolled on into st louis on dry pavement kept thinking about the telephone this wasnt like her should work and could flush a couple of more quail andreno was a little bashful about accepting the necktag id but lucas shooed him through the fbis entrance check and a guard led them to a new room they outgrew the old one the guard told them on the way they call it the command center now the command center had twice the space of the old conference room and windows a dozen men and three women were sitting around the main table the men in shirtsleeves coats draped over their chairs a litter of paper spread across the tables and between the laptops the phones and the powerpoint projector mallard had his place at the far end of the table with mai one at his side malone was listening at a telephone when they walked in mallard was still in a suit harried but happy he called rifles bet on it lucas said hed talked to sally with the epaulets from the car and told her about baker and the rifles thats not good news mallard said now about the rifle theft weve got a team on the way to completely debrief mr baker so what else is happening lucas asked behind him andreno popped a piece of dentyne and snapped it a couple of times with his teeth he looked like a schnauzer in a pen full of greyhounds working levy mallard said nothing moving at this point waiting her out we may know who shes staying with lucas said there was a pause in the work around them and malone said hang on a minute and took the phone down mallard frowned and said staying with who a woman named patricia hill lucas said but theres a teeny problem mallard said what patricia hill killed her husband ten years ago and disappeared we think she came here shed be living under an assumed name how did you lucas explained it with andreno chipping in on parts of the argument the good news is andreno said and he snapped the gum for emphasis we think she might call her mom if you could check the hills phone records you might find a few calls from st louis and then wed know where shes at and wed get a twofer two killers for the price of rinker malone shrugged the records are a piece of cake the rest of it sounds like moonshine though we gotta check mallard said i kinda like it the records were a piece of cake the memphis cops pulled the patricia hill file scanned it and shipped it in an hour patsy hill ten years earlier had been a tall thin blonde with a large nose and bony shoulders a highres color version of the digital photo was sent to an inkjet printer somewhere else in the building and fifteen minutes later came back as a finished paper photograph doesnt look like anybody in particular andreno said as the photo went up on the bulletin board better than what weve got on rinker lucas said malone said her husband was sent to jail twice for abusing her so what andreno asked so maybe theres a little more here than a simple murder malone snapped so what andreno asked again malone put her hands on her hips whats this so what attitude do you give a shit about hill andreno asked malone opened her mouth to reply but andreno kept going i dont give a shit about hill im chasing rinker if hill gets in the way id pick her up and send her back to memphis to stand trial but otherwise i wouldnt drive around the block to find her malone looked at lucas who shrugged im with him two agents were assigned to dig up the phone records they made calls to technicians talked to lawyers for both the phone company and the fbi and two hours after lucas and andreno walked in the door a list of phone calls had been downloaded to the taskforce computers in washington and bounced out to the st louis laptops with the lists running simultaneously on four different screens they determined that the hills did not get a lot of incoming longdistance phone calls but that at least two and usually three times a year theyd get a longdistance call from the st louis metro area one call always came christmas morning another always came august after checking with the missouri drivers license division they determined that august was diane hills birthday are we good or what patsys calling mom andreno said to lucas one of the agents nailed down the addresses of the telephone numbers and found that all but one came from convenience stores or gas stations the odd one from the first year that patsy hill was on the run came from a greyhound station the agent put the addresses on a computer map each one represented with a red dot and projected it with powerpoint goddamn mallard said peering at the map what is that its called soulard andreno said he circled an area of southeast st louis with a finger its not that big a place i mean hell a few thousand people maybe as residents but the brewerys down there and a whole bunch of factories and truck places so she could be working there and living somewhere else mallard looked at malone what do you think wed have to coordinate if we want to sweep the area we dont have the manpower to do it on our own if we want to keep levy and everybody else covered you get a bunch of flatfeet pounding on doors theyll either get out ahead of the sweep or if we manage to surprise them youll have a couple of dead cops lucas said mallard spread his arms and said well well we were once looking for a black kid this gangbanger hiding out in minneapolis and figured if we went door to door with a bunch of white cops everybody would see them coming so we got our black guys and they went around and talked to friends who hooked them up with other friends and asked everybody about who was where we covered the whole goddamn area in four days with four guys we knew who was where in every single house we got six leads and one of them paid off we could do that andreno said to lucas just you know our guys i must know five or six people down there myself lucas looked at mallard were not doing much anyway mallard sounds good to me especially if it works and its cheap its costeffective malone said heck its almost free think shell stay put andreno asked lucas as they headed down the hall lucas said no reason for her to run not until shes done here want to go cruise soulard sure if we can do it in your car shes seen mine andreno drove a twoyearold silver camry the perfect spy car comfortable and inconspicuous and foreign and underpowered unlike cop cars he took them on a tour of soulard which was much like the fading neighborhoods near the st paul breweries not far from where lucas lived lots of redbrick apartments grimy with age old houses some of them in good repair some of them on the edge of collapse with sagging roofridges scaling shingles flaking paint some had been substantial residences some built after the neighborhood began its decline had been poor from the start here and there like good teeth were fully restored buildings all tuckpointed and painted lucas picked up on the place in ten minutes bumping over the narrow swaybacked streets lots of illegal apartments rented rooms being lived in if she lives down here at all now you sound like you dont believe oh i believe lucas said peering out the passenger window at two old ladies hobbling along the crazyquilt sidewalk this is one place where you might wind up if you were on the run lets see if we can get the guys down here loftus cant do it but we could get bender and carter along with us two we could cver some ground ill call them tonight get going tomorrow andreno said seven eight jesus no not that early i got a date heavy date i do have plans involving sex then ill probably have to talk to her for a while and probably wont be outa there until three oclock or so you sensitive types are going out of style lucas said women are going back to the more macho toughtalking guys what i got is what i got andreno said and he eased the car away from the curb not much more to do this night lucas got a sandwich then walked to a downtown mall bought a pile of magazines and a couple of newspapers and carried them back to the hotel he thought about andreno going out and felt a little sad in the past out of town hed always been happy enough to make the rounds at night seeing who was doing what to whom and who might be available for a tightly scheduled romance a meaningful overnight relationship no more he thought but hell he was wearing pajamas most of the time now the bottoms anyway and reading barrons in hotel rooms at eight oclock at night getting older and life goes on for some people anyway lucas had a good night the kind of night you have after a good day when you traveled learned a few things felt like you were making progress but the phone rang way too early an agent named forest said he was calling on mallards behalf to tell him that gene rinker had committed suicide in the jail out in clayton what the fuck are you talking about lucas asked or shouted i thought he was on suicide watch he was but he knew what he was doing well what the fuck did he do what time is it anyway fivefortyfive he cut his wrists with the punchout thing the hole from a can of soda he had a can of soda at dinner and he mustve palmed it jesus they didnt find him where in the hell were the he had one blanket this is what im told i havent been there myself he had one blanket and he got down under it and after one of the checks cut himself they say he knew what he was doing the cuts are real deep vertical right down both wrists theres a second set of scars going the wrong way across the wrists so he had some experience he messed it up the first time he tried and this time he knew better after hed cut himself he curled up under the blanket and bled to death they were watching him in the camera they thought he was sleeping until the blood started to drip on the floor and they saw the puddle ah man emptied him out mr mallards over there malones on the way they thought you might want to run out lucas took time to clean up an extra ten minutes wouldnt make any difference to gene rinker now and lucas had taken enough unexpected calls to know how crappy hed feel later in the morning if he didnt clean up now in the shower he thought about rinker he thought about what she might do could they turn this to their advantage and he thought about sandy white and the st louis pestdispatch and before he left the room he dialed andreno smiling grimly as e did it at least this piece of misery would have a little company andreno picked up the phone and groaned what gene rinker cut his wrists hes dead silence for a beat a couple of beats awww shit the cell had the bloodysteak smell of sudden death riding over the usual odors of floor wax paint and disinfectant the medical examiners assistants had rolled gene rinkers body but not moved it off the bunk rinkers ferretlike face was paperwhite but finally peaceful almost happy in death except for the dry salty tear paths that ran sideways across his nose and cheeks hed been crying as he went down lucas thought there were no marks on his body of the kind that usually accompany violent death except that his lower arms and legs were coated with dried blood and there was a stripe of blood in his hair where he apparently had pushed back his long bangs after cutting himself the blood puddle had soaked into the mattress when lucas and andreno stepped inside the cell to look the me s assistant moved back to improve the view and said hes got old transverse scars he tried before got it right this time lucas said gives me the goddamn willies andreno said im afraid of flu shots but cutting yourself man he shuddered at the thought after cutting his wrists and probably wiping the hair out of his eyes the mes assistant said rinker had rolled onto his side into a fetal position and clasped his hands between his thighs there were three new cuts on one wrist two practice marks in addition to the killing cut but only one on the other the cuts ran vertically beside the ligaments that ran down to the hand now i wish i hadnt brought him malone said from behind them standing just outside the cell she was grayfaced tired on the edge of anger these people she looked around how could they let this happen andreno opened his mouth to say something then closed his mouth shrugged and went past her toward the exit past the line of locked cell doors whatss with him malone asked i think he was was kinda depressed by the whole thing lucas said he went down to talk to the people who were on duty last night not that theres going to be much they followed procedure but the procedure was bad probably dont have that many people cutting their wrists with cokecan holes lucas said just goddam incompetence malone said bitterly and some of the muds gonna stick to me what a disaster i gotta find mallard are you coming im going to wait until they move the body i dont want anything else screwed up malone said she looked past his shoulder and said heres louis mallard came up blocky thicknecked face sour as angry as malone he was wearing a suit jacket over what might have been a silk pajama top he looked at lucas and shook his head bad business gonna be hell to pay for this especially after whites column yesterday i dont blame people for being mad this is unbelievable mallard said these people he looked around and shook his head louis rinkers gonna call me when she finds out lucas said we gotta be ready i think we should move all your people and whatever kind of detection equipment you can find down to soulard shell use the cell phone but i bet she doesnt drive a hundred miles to do it i bet she calls from wherever shes hiding or maybe goes out a few blocks but shell be pissed and i bet shell call you think id bet you a hundred dollars so then maybe we want it on tv malone said this gene rinker thing is bad enough but if we can snag clara then maybe some goodll come of it shes gonna call lucas said shes gonna freak out im gonna head down to soulard myself and wait theres nothing else to do ill get everybody going im gonna try to get some choppers in weve got a couple in chicago that are equipped to spot cellphone calls and we gotta keep the net on levy but every other guy i got and the technicians ill have them down there andreno wasnt in the building lucas looked around for him then stepped outside and spotted him leaning against his cars fender in a handicapped zone he saw lucas and pushed away from the car and came up the sidewalk to meet him those assholes he said who lucas asked but he knew the fuckin feds malone and mallard andreno said he was fuming for christs sakes theyre the ones who did this not some poor brokedown jailer but guess whos gonna take it in the ass friends of yours not exactly but theyre our guys theyre not some bigshot assholes piped in from washington to run the world if the jail people have any sense theyll announce an investigation and all but then theyll go out the back door and talk to press and blame the feds and nothingll happen to anybody maybe andreno said squinting at lucas thats what would happen in minneapolis lucas said id take care of it myself if you were gonna take care of it yourself would you call white directly or go through a friend or what everything lucas said id know white would bite because hes a hometown boy and hes inclined to piss on the feds hes already started then if i had any media friends id fill them in get them on my side thats if i was in minneapolis andreno nodded and then said and thats just taking care of yourself nothing to do about that poor fuckin rinker kid lucas shook his head and andreno continued i grew up in a shithole and half the kids i went to school with wound up in jail or dead some bad way i feel like im about one inch from gene rinker if it hadnt been for my mom whyn the hell did they have to drag him out here wasnt right davenport no it wasnt but ive done something like it a few times myself andreno thought about it for a minute then nodded quickly a head jerk hed done it too sod i but i always knew what was going on i always knew the guy i was fuckin with i wouldnt have done it with rinker if id known him you could see this coming both of us could didnt do much about it lucas said yeah andreno shook his head again in disgust whatre you gonna do now lucas told him hed head for soulard wait for the news of gene linkers death to be released and then wait for the call from clara drive around in the porsche i guess lucas said i got a couple errands to run andreno said when i get done ill call you we can hook up cruise in my car see you then lucas said good luck with the errands andreno looked up at the jail yeah well fuck those fuckers lucas went back to the hotel had breakfast went up to his room checked his cell phone to make sure it could receive calls inside the room and then sprawled across the bed and read the paper a second sandy white column was stripped across the top of the front page this one from inside the st louis police some of the cops apparently thought his rinker column was a little too prooutlaw so now it was kissandmakeup time the favored cops agreed that if rinker was caught shed be caught by a cop on the street probably during a traffic stop lucas yawned through the column the next days story would be better he thought when the paper found out that gene rinker was dead white was about to become a prophet which over the long term was unfortunate lucas thought in his experience few newspaper columnists could resist prophet status and after assuming the robes became tedious and eventually stupid when would clara rinker hear about gene and how on television probably maybe on the radio word was probably leaking already certainly was if andreno had carried out his preemptive strike on the feds could be any time he went into the bathroom to take a leak and thought halfway through that maybe he shouldnt be in the bathroom maybe the phone wouldnt work in there with all the tile he was back on the bed with the paper when the room phone rang he frowned at it could rinker have his room phone they hadnt thought of that he picked it up hello instead of sitting around pulling our weenies i got bender and carter meeting us down in soulard in half an hour bender got a big map from the assessment guys shows everything andreno said so you gonna sit on your ass or what see you there lucas said rinker never thought about the television or the radio she unpacked the guns and the boobytrapped telephone and tucked them into a handbag got undressed except for her underpants and a mans tshirt that she used as a nightie then hit the bed and fell into a shallow restless sleep the dreams came in little shattered fragments of her life with paulo shards of the bar in wichita little wicked pieces of jobs shed done for john ross her eyes popped open when she heard the key in the door she felt stunned her mouth tasted bad but she was coming back in a hurry rolling across the mattress something wrong she hadnt been asleep long enough she looked at the clock just after noon pollock wasnt due back until three oclock she pulled one of the nines from the handbag and crouched behind the bed watching the door as the intruder clumped across the floor and it sounded like clara pollock rinker exhaled slipped the pistol back into the bag and stood up yeah she stepped over to the door and pulled it open hey she said she was smiling whatre you doing home pollocks face was congealed gloom been watching tv no oh god clara tears started down pollocks face gene is gene died what the smiled stuck on rinkers face for a few seconds as though she were waiting for a punch line there was no punch line i heard it on tv in the lunchroom pollock said he died thats what they say on tv i cant rinker forgot what she was about to say and brushed past pollock to the television and fumbled the remote and finally managed to click it on her hand shaking as though she were being electrocuted i dont think and she couldnt remember what she didnt think words werent making connections for the moment they could find nothing at all on television they looked at all the local channels and clicked around to all the cable channels and found nothing at all clara i promise you i heard it i went over to watch they said he was found dead in his cell ah god rinker headed back to her room and began pulling on yesterdays clothes where are you going i gotta make a phone call she said she got her bag with the guns and the boobytrapped phone from the bedroom ill be back can i borrow your car i just ill drive pollock said youre not in shape to drive thanks lucas andreno bender and carter worked down a list of names that the three st louis excops cobbled together as they sat around in a deli drinking cream sodas the names included personal friends and known community activists and local politicians its been a while and people move around down here carter said some of them wont be there but most of them will the idea is we spread out geographically lucas told them we ask all these people about their friends and neighbors who we know are safe and then about people who fit patsy hills profile tall woman late thirties probably living alone if shed remarried or had a family rinker probably wouldnt stay with her we make a list of both kinds of people and check off their houses take forever bender said three or four days at the most lucas said we could get lucky and hit her on the first day we go to the politicians and the community people first theyll be able to rule out a heck of a lot of people then we extend the contacts to other people they know if we think weve found her then what then we bring in the feds we dont go in ourselves i think she could be on a suicide run especially after this gene thing and if we just jump her shes gonna shoot until shes dead and shes good bender nodded okay lets go lucas stuck with andreno for the first few interviews because he didnt know the people they were looking for they talked to an elderly democratic party voter registration woman at her home crossed off twenty houses and got eight more names for interviews a woman who was a member of a city zoning advisory board eliminated a dozen more and gave them a halfdozen more names for interviews a realestate agent spotted houses that he thought were unregistered apartments and gave them even more names a mail carrier they encountered on the street crossed off forty houses suggested two more mail carriers that they should talk to and also gave them two patsy hill candidates lucas ran the patsy hill possibilities through sally at the fbi war room and she came back with negatives on both theyve both got long histories and one has a lowlevel arrest record for disorderly conduct not her at twenty after twelve they were sitting in andrenos camry at enton park eating eggsalad sandwiches andreno was looking at the map and was saying shit we got ten percent of the thing done all by ourselves when lucass cell phone rang they both froze for a second then lucas fumbled the phone out of his pocket thats her could be anybody with a quarter lucas hook his head thumbed the talk button said hello and rinker was there is it true about gene im afraid it is lucas said nodding at andreno we had him on a suicide watch they were checking him every fifteen minutes and watching him in a camera but he man he did it you assholes she was screaming i told you what would happen if you killed him i told you lucas said clara listen goddamnit clara listen listen you wanna know what happened but she was crying and lucas thought she hadnt heard and he said again clara do you want to know i heard you she said i know what happened you know that he tried to do it before hes got scars on both wrists where hed cut himself before the kid goddamnit clara this is awful but the kid had tried before this time he did it he cut his wrists yeah with what jn a holding cell whatd he cut them with somebody loan him a jackknife somebody tried to be a nice guy at lunch and gave him a can of coke he stole the hole punchout thing you know the hole and hid it and thats what he used he covered himself up with a blanket and by the time they figured things werent right he was gone okay okay i got a message for you for the feds clara clara wait a minute listen get out of here pick up your shit and go to spain or south america or somewhere but stop this you might want to get these guys but you dont have to get them right now right this minute stop now come back some other time youre giving me friendly advice its gotta stop lucas was looking at andreno who gave him the keeprolling sign all right youre holding me on the phone well good luck with that she said her voice had gone cold as ice heres the message i meant what i said you got that meant what i said clara but he was talking to himself he looked at the phone shook his head said gone and punched it off we had her for a while andreno said he was on his own phone when it was answered he said andreno and davenport you got her yeah were rolling where lucas asked when andreno had hung up right up on she switched cells going west close so she does live around here its not that patsy works for anheuser she wouldnt drive to where patsy works to make a call and she was pissed she called me as soon as she thought she was okay sounds good to me what do you wanna do run around soulard doesnt seem like much point of going out on the highway yeah lets just wander who knows five minutes later lucas said til tell you something its one thing to cover the streets but this is fucking ridiculous every single streets got a car with two guys in it driving at ten miles an hour it looks like a goddamn shrine parade andreno snorted so mallard talked to our guys who probably talked to everybody else we probably got five agencies and fifty cars down here all looking for clara if they find her i hope to hell they can shoot i dont think shes gonna go easy lucas said she sounded pissed she sounded psychotic pollock and rinker turned onto tucker avenue and two blocks ahead rinker saw two large american cars stopped in the street the occupants apparently talking to each other take the next right she said to pollock but you think those are police maybe take a right they went right at the corner up a block and turned left back toward pollocks place another block and pollock looking in the rearview mirror said another car turned in behind us end of the block going really slow keep going rinker slipped down in the foot well the handbag in her lap got another car up at the corner ahead theres a stop sign im going to slow down and stop and let him go she slowed down and stopped a few seconds passed and then she accelerated away two guys and they really looked me over pollock said i think they were police any more cars the one behind us just stopped at the corner they might be talking to the other guys now theyre coming again how far from the house a block pull into the driveway then get out get something out of the trunk let them see you theyll know youre not me dear god pollock said but she did it bumped up into the driveway got out fished around in the trunk then dropped the trunk lid with a bang a minute later she said nobody coming you can move now but id hurry in ten seconds they were inside watching through a crack in the curtains another cop car went by every minute or two theyre all over the place rinker said they cant be doing this everywhere they must know were here how rinker shook her head i dont know weve got to think about that lucas and andreno hooked up with bender and carter and they compared maps and lucas told the others about the call from rinker scary bender said gotta find her quick lucas said shes outa control they put the maps together and lucas comparing the crossedoff houses and eliminating duplicates said terrific we dont have half but weve got a third or more if shes down here im worried that shes over on the flats working for one of those companies or the brewery carter said i dont think so lucas said because clara isnt working and i think clara was close by when she found out about gene i think she came right out of here somewhere could be west a little more but not as far over as the hill why because clara was freaked when she called he explained what he thought that meant and they all nodded and went back to looking at the maps we oughta get those other letter carriers tonight carter said men bender could look them up do that lucas said i think andreno and i better get back with the feds we dont want to leave them alone too long with nobody but themselves to talk to when they got off the elevator at the fbi building they could see the door to the operations center was standing open and they could hear the feds snarling at each other starting to think about blame lucas thought all a goddamn theory an agent named brown was saying when lucas and andreno came through the door everyone around the table glanced their way and the discussion died the authors of the theory malone said dryly she was sitting at the end of the table legs crossed looking beat whats the problem lucas asked the problem is the whole soulard search and patsy hill and cellphone idea is a stretch and weve got too much pinned on it brown said its the only goddamned theory weve got and it paid off lucas said she called from the right area she was on the interstate everybodys on the interstate theres a million cars on the interstate she was going west which meant that she had to get on it somewhere east of where you had her right lucas asked and that means from where you had her she either got on in illinois or she got on in soulard or on the edge of it anyway so whatre we gonna do sit around and wait for her to call you brown rapped next time shell be up in florissant so whatre you suggesting andreno asked i mean we really need something and if you got dont be shy big reward brown said a million bucks we can get it we put a million bucks on her well have her in twentyfoui hours i thought uh that was a problem lucas said if you can get the money im all for it though i dont think patsy hill would turn her in she really cant the hill thing is just a theory brown said twiddling a yellow pencil between his fingers so fast that it looked blurred like a propeller well jesus you gotta work on something lucas said you cant sit around a fuckin mahogany table and pull on your weenies theres levy and ross mallard objected we got that going lucas jumped in ill tell you something else thats not a theory brown thatd be a goddamned relief clara rinker is gonna come after our ass lucas said i promise you she was nuts this afternoon whats she gonna do mallard asked he sounded curious rather than skeptical shes gonna kill somebody or try to lucas said to mallard he said if youve got any family that she can figure out or if malone has any she mentioned malone the first time i talked to her so she remembers her from minneapolis mallard and malone were both shaking their heads not really malone said ive got my folks of course but i dont know how she could figure them out shed have to pull my file at the bureau and all that stuff is pretty locked up weve had some pretty tough hackers make a run at it shes gonna do something lucas insisted if she figures out that weve got a net around levy and ross she might try to hit one of the guys on the net theyve gotta be warned and weve got to set up some kind of reaction procedure in case that happens so were not just running around in a circle waving our arms well talk to everybody right now malone said i think thats a i point even brown nodded but he added were not being proactive we gotta be more proactive we gotta find something andreno said hey were listening malone washingtons gonna come up with some ideas if we dont theyre getting anxious snarling lucas thought like a pack of yellow dogs rinker and pollock had watched the street when they got home had seen the big cars trolling by way too many of them and talked about pollocks life so nobody knows where youre at rinker said not exactly where im at pollock said my folks know im around somewhere i think they know its st louis i call them every once in a while rinker looked around felt the house closing in on her a rat trap you call them from here no of course not pollock said i go out how far pollock thought for a minute then said up to the gas station the minimart you know close by pollock thought again and finally said shoot thats it isnt it they looked up all the phone calls to my mama and they figured out that they all came from down here they thought about the implications of that and then rinker said ah jeez patsy im sorry they never would have come looking if it werent for me we dont know its davenport im gonna wax his ass one of these days i swear to god the guy you danced with yeah hes lucky then she said sadly youre gonna have to run again theyll be going house to house but pollock shook her head and said wryly naw i aint gonna run im gonna turn myself in sounds like a plan rinker said her eyebrows up i cant stand this shit anymore pollock said sinking into a couch i cant stand my job i cant stand this place id just as soon be in prison and get it over with you never been in prison you dont know what youre talking about ive read about it all kinds of things at the library pollock said i been thinking about it for three or four years now i talked to my folks about it and theyre for it did i ever show you my back your back i kinda hide it im not a swimsuit girl pollock stood up turned around and pulled her blouse up rinker didnt know exactly what she was looking for then noticed what seemed to be a large paler birthmark on pollocks pale back what the heck is that what does it look like it looks like an iron rinker said rick held me down on the bed one day and ironed me and i got scars from a few more cuts and burns cigars mostly i think after all these years if i turned myself in i kinda think id either get off or they wouldnt put me away too long and i want to go home clara i know you dont like it down there springfield and i dont blame you but i want to go home someday and see my folks and be able to walk down the street without worrying rinker took a quick turn around the living room intent now you know what if youre gonna do this if you really want to you gotta do it now right away and youve gotta turn me in what yeah thatll alibi you you tell them i showed up and insisted on staying and you got scared and ran for it and decided to turn yourself in you could use that in a trial good faith and all that do you know an attorney pollock nodded i got a name from the memphis magazine shes a criminal attorney and shes a big feminist deal down there shes got a reputation for defending women who were beat up and did something about it is she good the magazine says she is she was like a winner in their moverandshaker issue okay then this could work this could work but youve got to think about it harder ive got money we could get you out of here seattle or somewhere really out of it nah pollock looked around i hate this place everythings gray nothings mine i never felt like i could hang a picture because old lady mccombs would get pissed about me hammering a nail in the wall if i go somewhere else itd be the same thing all over again rinker looked at her for a long moment and then said lets think about it you think i think its reasonable rinker said tell me about this attorney they talked the rest of the afternoon and then pollock went out and brought groceries and a bottle of wine and they had fish and white wine and a nice spinach salad halfway through pollock started to sob and rinker said youre gonna be scared for a while ah jeez and its a risk the papers say firstdegree murder its no risk im dying right here one inch at a time then lets run with it clara grinned at her the first smile since she heard about gene but not until tomorrow i got a couple of things to do tonight you could call the lawyer tomorrow morning and head down to memphis in your car id like to talk to mama first i shouldnt go out until after dark thingsll be safer on the street then rinker said we can make the call from the gas station they went out after dark both wearing skirts and dark blouses hoping to look like old women they went downtown first to the heartland national plaza rinker found a federal express station and took an envelope she called a cab from a pay phone then put the boobytrapped cell phone in the envelope with a note shed written that afternoon and walked out to the sidewalk and waited the cab showed in five minutes and she gave the driver the envelope and twenty dollars and took his card as soon as the cab was out of sight she waved pollock over and they wandered farther west found a gas station with an outside phone and pollock called her mother and told her what she was planning rinker watched the rearview mirror for fastmoving cars and after two minutes gave pollock the hang up sign pollock talked for another thirty seconds then hung up and they pulled out davenport pollock said what davenport was at my folks home mama put a bug in his ear sounds like she smiled and suddenly looked almost happy rinker thought she remembered his name because she always called a couch a couch and dad always called it a davenport really rinker said so were going back to my place i oughta pack a few things and maybe put some stuff in a box and send to mama tomorrow i could go to the post office before i leave for memphis i could mail it for you tell you what lets get out of town someplace someplace over in illinois and get us an ice cream one big last calorie blast before you take off pollock started crying again and rinker let her go a minute later pollock wiped her nose on the shoulder of her blouse and said thats sounds really good clara lucas was at the hotel reading an esquire about fall fashion and what anyone not a savage would be wearing in october when mallard called showtime he said shes coming in no she sent levy a cell phone in a cab in a fedex envelope he didnt know what it was he thought it was from his office so he opened it and there was a cell phone and a note she says she wants to talk about money and about some other things said she was afraid to call him at his office and his home phone was unlisted and that the feds are probably watching him she said not to tell anybody about the phone he might not have if hed had a choice does the note say when shes gonna call yeah she said shed call at ten twenty minutes from now the guys already tried out the cell phone and its the one shes been using to call you so shell either be calling from a new cell phone or shell be calling from the ground were ready to go either way weve got choppers to look for the cell phone and weve got guys all the way along the major interstates we should be able to get to any ground station in two minutes were all over soulard so youve got a choice youve got enough time to get to levys barely or you could head down to soulard okay ah are we gonna be able to set it up so we can all hear what shes got to say were trying but i dont think theres time we can tap it but we wont be able to hear it live listen i gotta get going wait wait one second how many guys are down in soulard five teams too many already ill see you at levys lucas parked a block from levys at eight minutes to ten and hurried along as he passed through the wroughtiron fence at the blocked end of the street he looked to his left into the dark and said aloud davenport go he went to levys front door knocked and another agent let him in mallard was in the library with levy malone two more agents including sally with the epaulets and a technician three minutes mallard said he was excited rolling are we looking around the neighborhood this could be an excuse to pull you or malone into range we got guys with nightvision glasses all up and down the streets for two blocks around were covered two minutes the tech said he had a sony tape recorder and it ran to a pickup fastened to the cell phone levy sat staring at it as though willing it to ring to malone levy said so i answer her questions and then i ask her about john if shes seen him and ask if she knows what hes done with his security i say i was out at his place and hes got some guys outside with nightvision glasses just like the ones you saw here describe them like you were impressed malone prompted yeah i say that you gotta keep coming back to the idea that you didnt know what was happening in mexico and you didnt know about her brother ask about her other brother roy thatll keep her going we need two minutes minimum and every second after that increases the chances of getting her ah lord levy said whatd i do to deserve this joined the fuckin mafia lucas said does this guy have to be here levy asked looking at lucas but talking to mallard yeah pretty much then maybe you oughta tell him that i got nothing to do with any mafia for christs sake thats like some kind of fairy tale what do you know from mafia up in minneapolis what you got one italian guy in the whole freezin fuckin place keep talking ill pull your fuckin nose for you lucas said and smiled shut up everybody mallard said we got one minute three minutes later they were still waiting gotta make one call then we better get back rinker told pollock okay theyd gotten cherry cones at a breyers store in a strip shopping center rinker went to the pay phones dialed the number of her old cell phone and got a please deposit one dollar recording she dropped four quarters and the phone rang at the other end there she is levy said he licked his lips once picked up the phone and pushed the talk button clara yeah this is me okay let me see one time i was at the warehouse with john we were doing some accounting stuff and you came in and john said to you that tube top looks cheap you ought to stop wearing them clara and you said ill never wear another one in my life okay its me mallard was sitting across levys ornate desk with malone bee im and the tech leaning forward two agents behind them lucas was standing beside the desk flatfooted hands in his pockets watching he heard the beeping faintly like the beeping made by an atm then bang the phone exploded and bits and pieces of levys face skull and brains hit lucas like a bucket of thrown blood stunned by the explosion lucas staggered back unsure if he was hurt registered malones voice gone shrill oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus and then lucas losing it freaking out began frantically brushing at himself wiping himself trying to get levys body tissue off his face and chest backing away from the body saying get it off me get it off they had a panic meeting at mid night by morning everybody in the country would know about levys murder theyd had to notify the locals who leaked like crazy and media calls started coming into fbi headquarters at eleven oclock first from the late guy at the postdispatch and five minutes after that by a local cnn correspondent were gonna look like utter fools mallard said we might as well be braced for it the cell phone no way we should have allowed him to use that said lewis the aic by we he meant mallard and everyone around the table knew it we looked at it mallard snapped a technician looked at it and didnt see anything and you tell me who in the hell thought she had at kind of capability doubt that she does malone said she had to know somebody the only way shed know somebody is through contacts here in st louis the people who ran her john ross so we talk to ross tonight mallard said tell him to call around find some names of people who could have done this hes not gonna give us anything lewis groaned if he knows who did the phone then that guy can probably pin all kinds of shit back on ross ross might take care of the guy himself but hes not going to give him up to us people are gonna go crazy with this malone said we got to get her soon ideas mallard said he looked around the table then at lucas you got anything just what im doing weve got most of soulard webbed up were running the names through sally well get the rest of the place tomorrow and the next day if claras down there theres a good chance well know by tomorrow night got nothing but false alarms so far running around like a goddamn chinese fire drill said lewis bettern sitting around jerking off with a bunch of census tables and utility bills lucas said were actually doing something the agent named brown said setting off false alarms is mostly shut up mallard said to lucas you need more people lucas shook his head i think were all right weve got guys who know the area going around talking to people that they know personally i think were good we gotta get something else going mallard said he sounded desperate he was desperate lucas realized and weve got to cover dallaglio and ross malone said she s gonna do them all she did levy right under our noses shes not backing off dallaglio is going to run for it i think said lasch who was m charge of the dallaglio watch detail i called him tonight after levy to tell him and to tell him to tighten up he said that he wasnt gonna sit around like a target makes sense lucas said he could take off for six weeks a week here a week there see europe no way shed find him if he leaves and she figures it out shes gonna take off herself come back and get him later mallard said we couldnt find her the first time she took off never even got a sniff of her if she has another spot set up i doubt that well find her there either they were starting to repeat themselves lucas stood up call me if anything moves im gonna get some sleep ive talked to my guys and we want to get an early start tomorrow get people before they leave for work sally asked whatd you do with your suit threw it in the dumpster at the hotel couldnt wear it again even if we got it clean id keep smelling him lucas said he held his hands to his face im smelling him anyway malone shook her head cant believe it cannot believe it rinker and pollock were up at first light rinker got the paper off the porch levy dominated the front page she read the story and followed it through to the jump page anything good pollock asked no not really she looked back at the photo of levy on the front and was about to toss the paper when she noticed a smaller headline below the fold webster groves woman tortured to death police and beneath that the brutally tortured body of a webster groves woman was found in a roadside ditch m kukwoodyesterday by a highway crew picking up trash the woman was identified as nancy leighton who lived at the oakwood apartments in webster groves police said they are following a number of leads but have made no arrests in the murder this is the worst thing ive ever seen said webster groves homicide detective larry kelsey this woman suffered a long time before she died rinker read the rest of it no details of the torture but plenty of hints along with vows of revenge from the cops who apparently had not a single clue and then crumpled the newspaper in her hands nancy leighton an old friend now dead and dead because of rinker somebody was sending her a message and the message had been received you all right pollock asked yeah just nervous about this whole thing i guess not too late to back out no way im feeling better about it all the time pollock said should have done it five years ago rinker balled up the paper and tossed it under the sink nancy leighton no help for her now but she had one coming nancy did rinker and pollock had been up late the night before pollock had said that there was nothing in the place that she really wanted but that turned out to be not quite right theyd gone out twice for packaging tape and finally had four large boxes to be shipped to pollocks parents pollock knew about a private ups pickup spot at a strip mall south on and theyd drop them on the way out of town at eight oclock everything that could be packed was packed and all the notes that could be written to neighbors friends and the landlady had been written and theyd eaten almost everything in the refrigerator for breakfast pollock started crying when rinker carried the first box out to the garage looked around the apartment and started weeping said oh shit and went into the back and came out with a framed picture that had been hanging in the bathroom ill mail it home from memphis she said scared ah god you can still chicken out rinker said not now i finally got up the guts pollock said still she looked around like leaving a prison cell but its your cell let me tell you about my apartment in wichita they took both cars in the early light of morning a short convoy out to the interstate the arch popping up in their rearview mirrors ten miles out they stopped at the ups place and pollock went in and mailed the boxes when she came back out they stood beside rinkers car and pollock asked whatre you going to do now ive got another place i can stay rinker said another old friend if you stay theyre going to kill you not for a while yet she said clara you gotta get out rinker hugged her and said you take care of yourself patsy i wont be seeing you again i guess but you been a good friend all my life im gonna get out of here before i cry pollock hung on to her for a minute a big ungainly woman hardused and rinker started to tear up then she broke away and said one thing she went around to the trunk of the car took out a sack and handed it to pollock twenty thousand dollars for the lawyer clara i cant you shush this isnt for you this is for her she sure as hell will take it tell her you were afraid to put it in the bank and its your life savings another minute of small talk and rinker loaded up and was gone leaving pollock in the parking lot with the sack rinker didnt know if er friend had a chance or not thought she might turned out of the parking lot and headed back toward town she still had some gear at the apartment which should be okay until afternoon she looked at her watch if pollock drove like she did shed be getting to memphis around twothirty pollocks parents should have been in touch with the lawyer by now so pollock could get in to see her by three oclock lucas andreno bender and carter worked the neighborhoods insoulard and the area just west ofsoulard for most of the morning humping along from one confirmed contact to the next marking off blocks on their xeroxed city maps they worked through lunch getting hungry and shorttempered then at four oclock carter found patsy hills apartment he called just at four not particularly excited amity jenetti says a woman in the next block kind of looks like her her face does says the woman has black hair and is generally dark and the last picture of hill was blond but jenetti says the face is right and shes tall but then she says shes big you know heavy and hill was skinny as a bull snake about the right age late thirties or early forties and lives alone says the woman probably got here ten or twelve years ago i dont know sounds better than anything weve gotten so far lucas said you got a name and address dorothy pollock and the address is he had to look it up when lucas got it down he said call you back in a few minutes he and andreno were eating meatball sandwiches at a sidewalk place under a greenandwhitestriped awning at a tippy metal table with a top the size of a hubcap lucas phoned sally and gave her the information sally called back fifteen minutes later the woman is supposedly how old late thirties early forties shes twentysix according to her social security account her application is hinky we cant find anybody by that name at the listed address when she was supposedly a teenager interesting lucas said we got a drivers license and the age doesnt match the social security it says thirtyfive hills supposed to be thirtyseven but shed take years off right we got neil looking at it hes a picture maven well whats he say lucas heard sally turn away from the phone and ask somebody well what do you say neil behind sally he heard another voice said darn the picture sucks but you know what sally came back you better get over there an entry teamll meet you in the brewery parking lot in fifteen minutes damn lucas said he hung up wiped the phone with a napkin andreno said nothing huh they think its her lucas said were supposed to meet an entry team in the brewery parking lot in fifteen minutes andreno stopped chewing long enough to look at his watch so we got three minutes to eat basically were so fuckin good thats true lucas licked his fingers then cleaned up his face with the napkin gotta call carter and bender carters gonna pass a kidney stone when he hears andreno stood up bunched the remnants of his sandwich in its waxedpaper wrapper and pitched it into a garbage can fuck a bunch of sitting here being cool he said his voice suddenly excited lets go he entry team was as toughlooking as any lucas had seen big en sweating in dark blue uniforms and heavy armor carter and jnder had brought the woman whod fingered the apartment along entr wman named amy whod actua been inside the ry team leader worked through as much as amy knew they learned that hills apartment actually consisted of the converted back rooms of a house owned by an elderly woman named betty mccombs lucas and the three excops stood around and watched the team get ready mallard and malone arrived a moment later in a dodge and then a halfdozen other agents in two other cars two options the team leader told mallard and the semicircle of faces around him the first is we hit them now hard take them down the downside is we might have to take them out if the place is empty we put the door back together and wait for them to show the second option is to watch the place and catch them in the open either coming or going there are no cars parked outside right now but there could be one in the garage sally had been on the phone as they were talking and now spoke up carson got in touch with pollocks employer she called in this morning and said she was sick shes not at work can they see the street from the back of the house where these rooms are lucas asked carter said we cruised by they could see the street but not much of it they could see it especially on the north side the garage side the other side theyd be looking down a little narrow strip between the next house over so if we sent sally in with another guy the youngestlooking guy and we got into this old ladys house with some listening gear we should be able to figure out if theyre in there we could do that the team leader said and we could get a better layout from her so lets do it mallard said without the prospect of instant action the intensity faded a bit theentry team guys peeled off their armor and flopped around the place and ten minutes later when sally and a youthful blond agent named meers left for mccombss house lucas and the three st louis excops congregated around andrenos car you guys get anything to eat meatball sandwiches up at dirty bills andreno said nasty but tasty you better stick close to the can carter said then to lucas what do you think maybe lucas said they wouldnt be going out much in the daytime what about these guys he nodded at the federal entry team look like pros lucas said the ones up in minneapolis are good bender nodded everything ive heard about these guys is theyre good so we wait lucas said they waited an hour and a bit more the sun still bright in the sky but angled now and lucas began to worry about the problems of darkness then sally came back with a layout the old bat you oughta see her she said to mallard shes got a bad mouth she apparently hates people on sight she smells are they there mallard asked impatiently i dont think so not at the moment but its her its hill sally said sally was wearing an olivedrab shirt made of a crinkly cotton fabric without epaulets but with a military cut tommy set up the listening gear and its working and we put it right on the wall but we didnt hear anything they could be asleep how many rooms kitchen living room bath bedroom and a spare room but its small more like a closet one hallway you come into the living room and look straight back at the kitchen down a hall with the main bedroom on one side of the hall and the bath and the small room openlng off the other side thirty feet maybe from the front of the living room to the back wall of the kitchen one door in and out with a pushout fire window on the north side in the main bedroom theres a window on the south side they worked through it still playing the possibilities go in hard and if they werent there wait or wait ready to snap when they walked in i dont want to wait mallard said finally therere too manv possible ways for things to go wrong and weve been waiting but as he ran down his rationale for hitting mccombss house a call came in for malone and after listening for a moment she said what in a harsh incredulous tone and everyone went quiet the tone was bad news and they waited malone more puzzled than anything lucas thought after a moment looked at mallard and said the memphis police just called a woman who says shes patricia hill just turned herself in on the old homicide warrant shes with her lawyer she says shes scared and shes willing to give up rinker the memphis cops want to know what to do holy cow mallard said he looked around spotted lucas you hear that yeah lucas said i dunno does she say where rinker is malone was listening again and when lucas asked the question she nodded and said shes giving up the house i mean the house mccombss house she says rinkers there she says she was this morning lets go mallard said lets hit it wait a minute lucas said then louder wait a fuckln minute what mallard asked what if rinkers setting us up she says shes gonna start taking out fbi people what if she sent hill down there to pull us into the house without thinking about it what if rinkers out there with one of those rifles mallard pulled at a lip then goddamnit he looked at the entry team leader were gonna go in but were gonna get every cop in st louis down here first you get set up in your vans across the street and back behind the neighbors where you can see the door and windows but dont get out yet well get the cops down here and jam up every street for six blocks around if shes waiting for us there wont be any wav out the cops came in a wave running with lights but no sirens agents in blue nylon jackets met them on the streets routed them out to the perimeters nobody in or out without the cars being checked two cops on each car check the screen was set two blocks out from the mccombs house a car with a texas license plate was found at the edge of the perimeter and cops started going door to door looking for the owner another hour slipped away aint gonna help if shes on a suicide run lucas told malone she could be up in an attic somewhere the people in the house already dead looking at the front of mccombss house through a scope she got a sevenmillimeter mag off that peckerwood down in tisdale if shes any good with it if shes got a shooting rest she could poke a hole in a pie plate at three hundred yards malone shook her head she wont shes not on a suicide run not yet you know that for sure yeah shes not done with dallaglio or ross her brother killing himself pissed her off but her brothers not the same as losing her fiance and her baby she doesnt want to die yet hope youre right but somethings hinky here te house seemed so lifeless that they had little hope that rinker was mside she could be asleep mallard argued they might not hear her he said because the bedroom didnt share a wall with anything they could reach with the sound equipment with the sun almost on the horizon and long dark shadows striping across the lawns everything was finally set and mallard gave a go to the entry team the teams vans moved rolling back from their surveillance sites and the team piled out one man set up to watch the windows while the others came in from the front of the house crept under one window reached the back door lucas watched feeling the pressure then the door man moved then another guy then the door man stepped back with a monster wedge normally used for splitting wood ready to swing two guys on the sides of the house coordinated by radio pitched flashbangs through the windows and as they went off sounding to lucas like distant cannon fire the guy with the monster wedge hit the doorknob the team was inside in a second and in five seconds had secured the place empty mallard groaned okay get some guys out in the garage close the door well set up for surveillance when they were set and nothing was moving mallard malone lucas and andreno crossed the street and walked up to the house lucas nervously watching the windows in the houses up and down the street nothing happened inside the surveillance team leader said nothing they walked through the apartment looked in the chest of drawers looked at the walls checked the medicine cabinet bullshit lucas said they cleared out before hill ever went to memphis theres nothing left here but junk nothing sentimental she wasnt running from rinker cause if she was when did she have time to pack up when were they here lucas was still poking around and came up with a newspaper this mornings paper he said showing them the levy headline they brought it in this morning and she might be hurt andreno said look at this they went to the bathroom where andreno pointed into a wastebasket inside they could see a white shirt with a thumbsized bloodstain wonder what that came from not that much blood malone said we dont even know its hers got a cancun label its from a cancun hotel and its a medium which wouldnt fit patsy hill andreno said so where is she mallard asked running i dont know lucas said maybe shes got a backup spot but maybe weve just broken her out or maybe shes coming back malone said lucas said nah mallard we cant take a chance well set up here all night pull the cops out maybe shell come in better get a bigger net around dallaglio and ross lucas said better get some smart guys with them after levy i dont know a car bomb dont tell me a car bomb mallard groaned he looked around she was here this morning this morning honus johnson was working on a chest of drawers in american cherry a honus johnson chest of drawers brought in four thousand dollars in a boutique furniture shop in boston they looked so much ike the old ones in his woodworking johnson tended to use british tools like his miniature toolman hand planes which were simply exquisite in s sadistic pursuits he preferred craftsman tools from sears he rejected electrical equipment because it lacked subtlety though he always had a soldering iron handy hed really found his metier in hammers pliers and handsaws hed once cut off a mans foot with a hacksaw to make a business point for his employer his personal inclinations pretty much ruled out any deep friendships even people who knew him well and used his services were likely to wince when they saw him coming though he looked harmless enough a pinkish whitehaired gentleman in his late forties or early fifties with square capable hands and a thin oval face he wore khaki pants and striped longsleeved shirts and europeanlook squaretoed brown shoes and tended to suck on his teeth as though he was perplexed he also had a tendency to flatulence which resulted in some of john rosss associates referring to him as stinky but only very privately hed worked for ross for two dozen years a weapon much like rinker rinker spent the morning on the far west edge of the metro area at the spirit of st louis airport looking around wandering among the industrial and office buildings later that day now dressed as the dark woman she spent an enjoyable couple of hours at the missouri botanical gardens the gardens had an environmental dome called the climatron an enclosed jungle that offered much in the way of concealment and ambush possibilities she looked at it closely for a long time when she arrived at johnsons house a little after four oclock in the afternoon he was working in his backyard woodshop powerplaning cherry planks for the chest of drawers johnson really had no fear of retaliation for his past acts of cruelty simply because he was never the principal in the act like his favorite chisels and saws he was only a tool if an exquisite one in all the years hed worked for ross thered been no comebacks and he was careful almost nobody knew where he lived rinker knew but johnson didnt know that she did shed made it her business to find out when she was still working for ross if shed ever gotten on the wrong side of ross shed thought years ago she might want to take care of rosss other major weapon before he had a chance to take care of her shed had a hard time finding him johnson was not in the phone books nor was he in any of the records that ross kept in the warehouse he was paid off the books like rinker was and she saw him so rarely that there was no real possibility of following him home shed looked in the county tax statements but he wasnt there shed once managed to get his auto license number but then found out that if she tracked the car through the state she had to make a formal request for the information and that johnson would be notified no good one of the girls at the warehouse once mentioned that shed had to send some stuff to him for ross but when rinker made some careful inquiries she found that the stuff was sent to a downtown post office box shed eventually found johnsons house purely through luck johnson had built elaborate teak plant benches for john ross for rosss orchids and when the benches were delivered shed been at rosss house the two guys who drove the delivery truck had an invoice that showed both the pickup and delivery addresses she took the address back to the courthouse and looked it up in the tax and plat records johnson was there all right but his house was listed under estate of estelle johnson she parked in the street and walked up the driveway from the driveway she could hear the planer screaming inside the workshop she went past the garage vaulted a chainlink fence moving fast now slipping the silenced beretta from under her shirt to the open side door of the workshop as she came up to the door she happened to glance upward and saw a motion detector tucked in the corner and she stopped peeked around the door frame johnson was looking right at her a silentalarm strobe light bouncing off his protective glasses and he was moving to his right quickly she stepped through the door following the muzzle of her pistol he froze when he saw her his hands empty she glanced toward the wall that hed been moving to a shotgun leaned against a cabinet what had jaime told her at the ranch about the need for handguns the rifle will be leaning against a tree and thats when they will come she smiled thinking about it and johnson flinched he took a step back and tried a placating smile hello clara i no point in conversation rinker shot him in the nose and he went down twisting away his face striking the edge of the saw table he landed faceup in a pile of shavings she looked at him for a moment on the floor judged him dead but shot him again carefully between the eyes the planer was so loud that she heard no hint of the shot or of the guns cycling action he was dead for sure now the planer was still screaming the plank beginning to buck rinker couldnt see a switch so she pulled the plug and the machine wound down like a depowered airplane engine she couldnt leave johnson on the floor or even in the workshop she decided the yard was fenced but it wasnt the best neighborhood and if somebody broke in he might be found she looked around for a moment then grabbed him by the collar and dragged him to a lowboy hed used for hauling lumber she pushed a stack of planks onto the floor thought better of it in case somebody looked in and took a minute to stack them neatly near the wall then loaded his body onto the lowboy and covered it with four transparent bags full of wood shavings and sawdust she pushed the whole load out the door up the concrete walk to the back of the garage then into the garage past an eclass mercedesbenz and through a breezeway to the house she couldnt actually get the lowboy into the house because of a step she left the body and the cart in the breezeway and let the muzzle of the beretta lead her through the house she was she found the only living thing in it the house was neatly kept but had no more personality than a motel room a few woodworking magazines some reference works a television set with an incongruous nintendo console sitting on the floor next to it she checked it all out then hauled johnsons body into the house and rolled it down the basement stairs she first thought to leave it there at the foot of the stairs but then noticed a cheststyle freezer against the wall and opened it it was halffull of healthy choice microwave dinners and bags of frozen peas and corn she took a bunch of the dinners and some of the corn then managed to tug and pull the body around until she could boost it into the freezer johnson landed facedown and she had to twist his legs to get him to fit inside she slammed the lid with a few paper towels to wipe up the odd blood smear she thought everything would be as nice and tidy as honus johnson used to be and she had a new phone a new house and a new car not bad for twenty minutes work though she admitted to herself moving the body had given her the willies as did johnsons bed she was beat from the day needed some sleep but couldnt sleep with the smell of him and his body still cooling in the freezer she found clean sheets in a linen closet sheets that smelled only of detergent and crashed on the couch long day coming they wound up sitting in one of the fbi rental trucks a sixseater suburban eating snickers and milky ways drinking cokes and waiting for anything on the perimeter any sign that rinker was coming in they got nothing except distended bladders and strange looks in a shell station when they repeatedly tramped through to the rest rooms andreno gave up at nine oclock and took off at tenthirty mallard was willing to admit that rinker had flown we go back to the four main guys mallard said in frustration ross must be a target she worked for him for too long he must be her original connection dallaglio is necessary because of dichter if she goes after one shell go after the other giancati used her at least four or five times one of her best customers ferignetti is marginal but we cant take a chance if youre gonna talk to them i want to be there lucas said youre invited mallard said he looked out at the darkness across the brewerys parking lot well make the rounds tomorrow morning dont worry so much louis malone said shed gotten into a sack of cheese doodles and the back of the truck was suffused with the smell of cheddar well get her we just missed her tonight were closing in youre sure yeah i am malone said and i cant wait locking her up is gonna feel so good its gonna be hard taking her alive lucas said i think shell fight ill take that malone said and after a moment of silence i think ive got a pound of yellow cheese goop stuck to my teeth lucas lay in bed that night listening to the trains going by along the waterfront there was no good reason for it but the sound of distant trains and distant truck traffic trucks downshifting to climb a hill left him feeling moody people going places doing things while he was here in bed alone staring at the ceiling hed talked to weather and she was feeling fine although beginning to wonder how much longer hed be in st louis id just like to see you she said im getting a little lonesome id like to see you too ill give this a couple more days and then if theres nothing definite happening ill run up for a day or two fly yeah i guess brave of you hows the kid strong little thing i think he or she is gonna be a soccer player not if i have anything to do with it lucas said ive already cut down a hockey stick still thinking about an ultrasound cmon thats the easy way out youve already got a daughter two daughters would be wonderful a son would be excellent i really dont care i just pray that the kids healthy maybe come up for a day or two at the end of the week over the weekend if nothings happening a guy down here told me about a weird way to induce labor ill show it to you when i come up its too early lucas it doesnt always induce labor it has other uses after he rang off he wondered what rinker was doing she was almost certainly holed up somewhere alone or with a scared friend like hill who probably didnt want her around and might even betray her given the chance that must be really lonely the thought gave him no comfort and the night went slowly patches of sleep mixed with weary semiconsciousness he hoped as he looked at the bedside clock at five in the morning that they took rinker clean either grabbed her or killed her but ended it that the fbi ended it that he didnt have to when lucas arrived at the fbi offices in the morning still sleepy mallard gave him a cup of good coffee and said hill gave up rinkers car and license tag california plates were running them now and every cop in st louis is looking for them are you going to memphis to talk to hill i thought about it but i decided to stick hereyou ever hear of a lawyer named ann diaz in memphis no should i shes representing hill i got a call from the memphis guy this morning he talked to hill last night with diaz present hill said that rinker showed up on her doorstep threatened to kill her if sne thought about going to the police and threatened to turn her in if she didnt stay straight hill says she was so scared that she froze for a couple of days and then ran for it did your guy ask her how she managed to pack up everything in the place yeah she said that rinker went out every day and that she pretended that she was going to work watched until rinker left then ran back threw everything in her car and took off she said she packed it out of the car and mailed it to her folks and then headed down to memphis she says if we dont get rinker rinker will kill her its bullshit louis i think so but the problem is diaz shes pretty well known shes got some clout in dc connections with all kinds of feminist groups she could make hill a cause and shes tough she wont let hill give us anything thats not scripted whatre you saying hills gonna be a dry hole lucas shrugged thats the way things work now fifty years ago you could have taken her down the basement with a couple of steel fishing poles and beaten the shit out of her and after she confessed you couldve hanged her on wednesday now its just a bunch of sissies whining about civil rights thanks mallard said i enjoy being mocked before lunch lucas raised his coffee cup in a semiserious toast rinker was a step ahead of us louis but malones right its only a halfstep now we would have found her yesterday if she hadnt decided to book we would have had her you think she spotted us yeah maybe when we were going around to the houses or maybe s e spotted the guys running in after the phone calls but we were close all right so lets go talk to these assholes i want to talk to you about that about the approach about tactics the meetings between mallard and malone for the fbi on one side and the four hoods on the other side were like the israelis and the palestinians working on a deal lucas thought everybody smiling and lying like motherfuckers but still messages were sent and received both ways mallard told all four of them flatly that the fbi had tried to protect richter and levy and had failed and that they believed rinker would be back shes had a lot of time to think about her approach im not sure we can stop her without your help or even with your help he told them giancati and ferignetti denied having anything to do with rinker ferignetti said hed never met her didnt know ross except to nod to him and said he planned to carry on with business as usual he didnt have bodyguards because he didnt need them giancati on the other hand was leaving for england you seem to think that theres some reason shed be after me but i dont think so he said he was a round bald man but his fat was tough fat the kind of fat that youd wear yourself out hitting on he looked like he should smell of stubby cigars but instead smelled of vanilla all my business is on the upandup and always has been i mean over the years i suppose im gonna bump into some of these supposed hoodlums in my business blah blah blah lucas thought listening to him a wall of bland unresponsiveness but the kicker was giancati was getting out of town with his wife and nobody else knew he said and nobody would know unless the fbi called up rinker and told her if she wants me and can find me over there then god bless her because half the time i cant even find myself when im there you go there often malone asked all the time my wifes parents came from newcastle and my mother came from dover and went to school in calais the east country is my favorite place in the world blah blah blah dallaglio looked like a book editor or an accountant tall thin harried quizzical with a caterpillarlike mustache on his upper lip he did not look like a man who may have contracted a dozen hits his wife on the other hand was short rounded and loud and looked capable of doing any amount of killing they had three armed bodyguards in the house one of them a former fbi agent had known of mallard and said so mallard asked him you think you can cover him nobody will get inside of twenty feet but if rinker has rifles what can we do weve told mr dallaglio that dallaglios house was a neobaroque prairiestyle gothic charles addams out of frank lloyd wright with decoration chosen equally from the renaissance and miami beach he led them through the carved walnut double front doors through a highly rugged interior to an indoor patio around a lap pool offered them cokes from a poolside refrigerator and sat everybody down on plastic gliders i have no idea why she killed nanny he was a good man looked after his family dallaglio said if he was involved in any wrongdoing i wouldnt know about it our relationship was strictly business but under the blahblahblah he was panicked and so was his wife his wife jesse said we only met her because nanny was involved in a couple of business relationships with john ross and she worked for john and she was a friend of johns wife going back a while when they both worked at his liquor warehouse she was like a bookkeeper but she was really outgoing and thats how we knew her we were in wichita once after she quit working for john and we went to her bar it really wasnt our style but she seemed nice thats all we knew about her are you friends with john ross mallard asked well yeah sure we do business with him all the time hes in trucking we need his trucks and we need stuff delivered on time thats no big secret hes a good guy we go out with them out to dinner or maybe he has tickets to a concert or some shit like that and they invite us he was really better friends with nanny but we know him the dallaglios and mallard and malone went back and forth and when they were finished and mallard had hinted that any help wouldnt lead to further questions that is if dallaglio had some kind of intelligence connection with the local underground and if thev found her and turned her in thered be no questions asked they got up to leave as they moved toward the door lucas said could i talk to you guys for a minute i mean he looked at mallard and malone and grinned as theyd agreed without the fbi lucas mallard said as though reluctant theyd worked it through on the way to the house to dallaglio lucas has his own ways of working were not bound by anything he says just a minute to talk lucas said the dallaglios agreed and mallard and malone went outside mallard shaking his head when the door closed behind them lucas said listen im just a fuckin cop okay ive got no jurisdiction here my boss just loaned me to the fbi because i got lucky once before breaking clara loose if you talk to me theres no way anybody could take it to court he looked directly at dallaglio and im telling you no bullshit i talked to a friend of clara and shes gonna kill your ass shes gonna kill you if we dont get her and get her now if we scare her off shell just go sit down in south america somewhere and wait six months until everybody relaxes and then shes gonna come kill you she knows you set her up down in mexico that you agreed to try to kill her dallaglio put up a finger thats not true lucas continued but she knows you did what she knows might not be the truth but she thinks it is the reality of it doesnt matter because shes gonna kill you because of it cant stop her cant talk her out of it she lost her baby this is a woman who hardly had any friends that we can find who was abused from the time she was a child and then got turned into some kind of crazy robot killer and you she knows killed the only man who ever loved her for herself who was gonna marry her and her baby well what the fuck are we supposed to do about it jesse dallaglio asked angrily you cant stop her weve got all these expensive bodyguards and you can see theyre worried ive got daughters so you tell me mr chief what the fuck are we supposed to do you can hide is one thing lucas said mr giancatis on her list and he and his wife are leaving town but if we dont get her she can always wait longer than we can jesse dallaglio said so we cant hide forever youre saying is this leading up to something or is it all just bullshit what im saying is if you know anything tell me im not gonna play games with you like the fbi they want to get clara but they also see this as a chance to fuck up a whole bunch of you guys thats not my problem i got my own assholes up in minneapolis to worry about i just want to get clara thats all i want give me a name somebody i can talk to give me an old hangout give me anything dallaglio walked away slumped into a chair ill tell you everybody acts like im some hoodlum or criminal but im just trying to run a chain store just business but rinker he paused cocked his head thought for a moment and then said let me put it this way if somebody was a hoodlum and wanted to hire clara to do whatever he wouldnt hang around with her he wouldnt want anybody to even know that theyd talked maybe they wouldnt talk so the cops couldnt draw any lines so that if rinker was picked up she couldnt say well i met with nanny dichter at the balloon ballroom on october dur ing the halloween dance and we made the deal so she couldnt say shit about who what where and when you see what i mean maybe lucas said what i mean dallaglio said is that this guy might not know shit about clara rinker not really too bad for that guy lucas said jesse dallaglio asked where is giancati going back to england lucas shrugged he just said he was leaving she chewed her lip maybe thats the thing to do she looked at her husband you like the old country we could go for a couple of months but if they dont catch her dallaglio said its like he says she can wait but maybe they do catch her jesse dallaglio said id hate for you or me or the girls to be the last ones killed before they got her on that note with nothing more developing lucas said goodbye outside mallard said what not much treena ross may have known clara might have been a friend malone said huh huh what lucas asked huh nothing i dont see where that goes we already knew that john ross was a friend of rinkers im not surprised that his wife knew her i guess well its what i got lucas said ross was waiting for them behind his big desk he had a halfdozen orchids this time including one that smelled something like cinnamon he wanted to talk about levy i knew the guy sure but whats this about telephones claras no electronics wizard whered she think that up mallard shook his head we were hoping you might be able to think of something ross exhaled in exasperation i told you i never knew about her i didnt know she was a killer for christs sake im in some tough businesses but we dont kill people its easier just to buy them out and legal sounds like youre a little worried lucas said letting the amusement show yeah well guns is one thing now im thinking what if a rocket comes flying through the window a phone bomb that sounds like something the cia would do he was surprised to hear that the giancatis were thinking of running off to merry old england again huh home of the fruits and the nuts he reached out and took a peppermint candy from a crystal bowl unwrapped it and popped it into his mouth and maybe the dallaglios malone added they may go back to the old country whatever country that is you do what you gotta do ross said eventually mallard and malone got tired of being stonewalled and after another warning got up to leave lucas went into this letstalk routine mallard shook his head and went out the door so what ross asked like mallard said im not fbi im a minneapolis cop i have no jurisdiction he went through the rest of it feeling like a thirdgrader reciting to a skeptical teacher ross said i can appreciate the fact that you get off on hunting clara and i hope you get her but theres not much more i can do to help i told you that the last time there are still some people at the warehouse who knew her but i knew her as well as anyone i could tell you where her old apartment used to be i could tell you where shed go for drinks but you gotta remember that was all before wichita this was years ago and she only worked in the warehouse a couple three years did your wife know her treena yeah sure treena worked in the warehouse along with rinker could she tell me anything ross snorted she can barely remember her middle name mr davenport shes basically a great set of tits and a terrific ass being run by a brain the size of a cashew i cant imagine that she could give you anything useful on clara rinker but youre welcome to ask her shes around here someplace if thats what you think why did you marry her it gives me about three headaches a week going over that shes got these tits and i got these hormones you know what i mean i shouldve stuck with the last one number three yeah number one was probably the best number two was a rebound three was pretty good and four was another bounce it never made any sense ill think a long time about number five somebody told me that number three died tragically there was irony in lucass voice and ross picked it up and seemed to darken she was killed in a hitandrun i was in new orleans at the time good for you lucas said smiling fuck you ross said if i werent working for the fbi id pull you outa your chair and kick your ass lucas said still smiling just so youd know ross looked at him curiously you really think you could take me lucas nodded yeah ross leaned back finally shrugged and said maybe we could try it someday be kinda interesting lucas nodded and they both sat and then lucas said so for now youre just gonna sit no im not just sitting i go out several times a week we got three cars we all go different ways nobody gets out until were under cover we look at the street before we go and i got four good boys around all the time i got the best alarms ever made i can get on the tv with my remote control any tv in the house and look at any direction out of the house through cameras on the roof one of the boys has a nightvision scope that he watches with if she gets me she gets me but i dont think she can get in unless shes got a fuckin rocket how long can you wait he shrugged im a patient man more patient than clara if youre so fuckin patient what was all that about in mexico you couldve just left her i didnt have anything to do with anything in mexico of course ross said but judging from whats been in the paper id say somebody made a big fuckin mistake to use your adjective a big stupid mistake and she thinks it was you was it you ross shrugged again and smiled for the first time an unpleasant smile that said yes it was his big fuckin mistake what he actually said was i dont know from mexico what happened exactly bullshit lucas said then are you going any place public this week any place that isnt completely shut up if i told you that thatd be a leak i dont even tell my boys when im moving listen if youre going out itd be a hell of a lot easier if you told us in advance than if we have to have the cops pull over all three cars until we figure out which one youre in all the lights and sirens and so on because if youre gonna act like cheese wed like to be there when the mouse comes out ross smiled at the image then leaned forward lifted a piece of paper from his desk pad and said im going one place in public friday night theres a fundraiser for the st louis chamber orchestra at the botanical gardens im one of the pillars of the chamber orchestra and the botanical gardens for that matter chamber orchestra and orchids a goddamned refined little thug huh fuck off ross said mildly and smiled again lucas got up to leave on the way to the door a thought struck him and he went back one last thing you knew both nanny dichter and levy are you as well protected as those two nanny was a tough nut but levy was a pussy ross said i was surprised when she got to nanny so easy thats not exactly what i was asking what im asking is are you a tougher nut than nanny the question seemed to interest him he leaned back put his hands behind his head thought for a moment then said yes would you have been tougher if shed gone after you first could she have ambushed you as easily as she did dichter no thought this time no as soon as the federal people started calling even before nanny i had an idea of what was going to happen i shut down everything i couldnt run by remote control if shed called me for a meet or wanted me to go somewhere to make a phone call i would have told her to go fuck herself no i would have suggested that we meet somewhere that id control what if all the feds started running around screaming and then nothing happened how long before you would have relaxed would you do what youre doing now indefinitely the question called for more thought ross played with one of his ears tugged on the lobe and then said probably not if shed waited six more weeks and if shed been careful she would have got me huh yeah that is kind of weird ross said im almost insulted on the way out lucas ran into treena ross in the hallway she was wearing a limegreen dress and matching limegreen shoes with twoinch heels she was carrying a dog the size of a walnut that seemed to have been bred to be frightened it whimpered when it saw lucas and then ross coming up behind treena said oh theyre nice men wiener then to lucas i dont think ive met you are you working with john im a cop lucas said lucas davenport i saw you once before you were going to play tennis i remember and youre working with john thats wonderful hes not working with me ross said he wants to kick my ass really kick your ass why she looked wideeyed at lucas she was a little topheavy lucas thought but she had a beautiful oval face and green eyes that seemed to be a promise of good times he understood what ross had said about hormones never mind ross said are you going somewhere off to sophies she bent one of the dogs tiny paws toward lucas see his teenyweeny nails are all chipped they have to be recoated we were talking about clara rinker lucas said to her thats awful whats shes doing treena ross said she was always so nice when we worked together she was very lively she used to be a dancer do you have do you remember anything about her that might help us run her down lucas asked friends anything like that i was her friend and so was john and for a while i thought i was going to race her to see who got john she said and she laughed and took her husbands arm he still wont tell me if he ever slept with her she was teasing but ross snapped i didnt inow see is he lying mr lucas anyway her friends she pursed her lips and then said the only one i can think of she looked at her husband what was that indian guys name running horse or something tim runslikehorse ross said i dont think shes staying with him why lucas asked hes dead ross said he used to drink all the time and when he was really drunk hed go out in the street with his jacket and play bullfighter with cars some redneck ran over him with a chevy s oh said treena a finger going to her lips i didnt know about that three years ago ross said he was a good guy huh well too bad treena said brightly thats the only one i can think of old dead running horse let me take you out ross said to lucas goodbye mr lucas treena said riding back to fbi headquarters malone asked howditgo lucas shrugged we traded threats his wife is taking the dog to get a manicure pedicure malone said we met her then a moment later she said i think treenas running with one headlight yeah well ross seems to see something in her lucas said wonder what that might be they rode along in silence for a bit and then lucas said i dont like the phrase jackstat but thats exactly what we learned talking to these guys we found out that they might run we knew that anyway lucas said my big worry is that rinker might run malone said looking out the window we need to get her now shes not going anywhere lucas said shes too pissed about her brother she hasnt done anything about it but she will before she leaves he looked at mallard you guys need better personal security you need to talk to the aic and tell him to warn all his people dont answer the door to any strange women you gotta take it more seriously weve had experience with this with these kinds of threats mallard said were taking them seriously but you gotta look at it from her angle too the fbi is pretty frightening we look pretty goddamn tough to a crook i dont think shes scared lucas said i dont think she gives a shit about the fbi or how tough you are rinker had a bad night she was comfortable enough sleeping on couch pillows wrapped in clean sheets but the body in the basement freezer still gave her the creeps and she thought several times that the basement door was creaking open she found herself staring through the dark looking for shapes in the living room her hand near the beretta on the floor beside her not that the gun would help with a ghost in the very darkest pit of the night she sat up shed had something close to a dream and in the dream came an idea she crawled over to a lamp groped up its stem turned it on then went out to the kitchen and dug up a yellow pages she found what she was looking for under investigations there were several listings for private detectives specializing in spousal inquiries had to be divorce work and two of them had womens names attached she left the kitchen light on turned the lamp off and went back to her couch pillows to think about it dream about it and listen for noises from the basement she was out of the house by ten oclock as the dark woman with dark brown eyebrows and dark brown hair she wore a loose green longsleeved cotton shirt to cover her arms the fine blond hair and toofair skin shed moved her own car into honus johnsons garage and took his mercedes she scouted nina bennetts address and found that it was a house with a business sign on it and a black cat sitting in the porch window a home office for a notveryprosperous business rinker thought could work she thought she rolled away from bennetts and went looking for a place to meet someplace downtown she found it at the happy dragon a dark upscale chinese place that seemed to be designed for st louiss lunchtime assignations with shoulderhigh booths and bad sightlines she stopped at union station found a phone and called bennett who picked up on the second ring bennett legal services rinker tried to sound tentative i saw your ad in the phone book do you check on husbands i mean watch them we do spousal surveillance yes we usually require a reference from an attorney the usually was not stressed was made to sound inviting oh disappointment hesitation i cant hire an attorney not yet i dont want a divorce i dont want to make him angry i just want to find out maam if were going to court i wouldnt want that rinker said quickly i just want to know maybe you should come by we can talk oh i dont please wait a minute rinker clapped her hand over the mouthpiece waited for what she thought might be a minute then came back on could you talk this afternoon im very busy im getting ready to fly down to miami this evening lauv you triis afternoon bennett offered could you come here downtown yes i could oh thats great theres a place down the block the happy dragon if you could meet me there wait a minute let me look at my calendar she clapped her hand over the mouthpiece again waited a few seconds then said three oclock thatd be fine the happy dragon at three mrs dallaglio rinker said jesse dallaglio lucas had spent most of the day at fbi headquarters going through paper all the paper that the feds had put together looking for anything that might indicate whom rinker might talk to anything about the way she preferred to live andreno called to say that hed stopped by john selloss bar and apartment and sellos was still missing hes not dead the bartender got a call from him last night said he sounded really worried about what was happening to the place he told the bartender that he was still traveling and playing golf but wouldnt say where he was he called at the bar on the bars public phone right around nine oclock well see where that goes back to lucas said though im not sure what he could tell us he gave a note to sally epaulets and asked her to find out where the call had come from twenty minutes later she told him that it had come from a gas station near nashville does that help she asked no dont have to be snippy about it when lucas asked sally told him that mallard was teleconferencing with washington all of it just the fbi part she said a few minutes later an agent named leen stopped by and said that the explosive that had killed levy had been tagged and the tags indicated that it was a commercialgrade explosive generally used in quarries and most of it was sold in new england that rang no bells with anyone and lucas went back to the paper malone came back and asked why are you reading all that paper again im trying to figure out whats going on in rinkers head and i cant shes got all this carefully planned right the dichter thing then the cell phone is there some reason for the order that shes taking them in why didnt she take ross first even ross thinks hed probably be the toughest nut to crack but if shed done him first she could have gotten him malone shook her head it is possible to plan a thing and then ride the breaks maybe thats what shes doing ill tell you what though lucas said ross aint panicking hes got apian my feeling is that shes gonna go after one of the other guys before she tries for him i think ferignetti may be right that shes got no interest in him give him that giancati is taking himself out of it maybe beyond her reach so i think we ought to look really hard at paul dallaglio dallaglio may take himself out of it too if he goes back to the old country wherever that may be then we watch ross and hope she doesnt take a sabbatical and come back for them next year at six oclock he left the fbi building and met andreno loftus bender and carter at andys bar they ate cheeseburgers and curly fries and onion rings and batterdipped mushrooms and lucas said guys we almost got her but we didnt does anybody have any idea of a move we could make we gotta make some kind of move i keep thinking about the car carter said if the car was on the street locally wed have her by now i know for a fact that guys are driving up and down every street in the whole metro area looking for the car and theyre coming up dry the thing is maybe she took off the feds have put the make and tag number out all over the midwest and south and she cant have outrun that lucas said if she did theres nothing we can do about it but i dont think shes gone i just dont know how to put my hands on her comes back to her friends andreno said somebodys hiding her somebodys helping her if we can put our hands on that guy lucas talked to mallard on the phone at eight oclock i might run home tomorrow if you dont come up with something catch a plane out tomorrow afternoon spend a couple of days at home im out of ideas right now lucas goddamnit youre the only one whos had any ideas that actually panned out you cant leave for a day or two lucas said i could be back here in four hours if something breaks but something broke sooner than that mallard called back at u oclock excited words tumbling over words we spotted her the guys on dallaglios house are watching her right now were pulling people in all the way around her tightening up on her were looking at her with night glasses and we can see her watching the dallaglio place shes in a volvo they say meet you in the lobby lucas said hed been reading still dressed and he slipped on his shoes and got his car keys and ran for the elevator after a short impatient wait the elevator door opened and malone was there trying to shove a gun back into her purse gonna shoot her huh lucas asked malone grunted ive been waiting for this weird shes been so careful and now shes sitting in a car on the street watching dallaglio she pulled richter out of his shell she got weird with levy something we never even suspected and now he shook his head but it happened sometimes dallaglios place was twenty minutes out and they all went together in one of the suburbans a flasher working on the front cutting through traffic like an avalanche a heavyfooted redhaired fbi man at the wheel one of the washington crew lucas didnt like him much but had to admit that he knew how to run the truck mallard was on the radio the full time hed been on it when he ran out of the hotel a minute after lucas and malone stopped using it just long enough to explain that hed been getting ready to take a shower when the call came from the field and then got back on it with brief breaks to pass along what he was hearing ive told them to move on her whether or not were there as soon as theyre ready they go they gonna rush her theyre gonna block her front and back with trucks weve got people moving up through a yard that shes parked near but theres a dog and theyre talking to the owner about getting the dog out of there quietly before they go through when shes blocked therell be a guy pointing a shotgun through her window before she has time to move they think they can close up to fifteen feet they kept getting closer and nothing had happened the dog was hanging them up and then mallard reported that the dog was now locked in the basement of the nearest house and that the tac squad was moving in cutting through the dark yards the redhaired agent took them off the freeway and down a couple of major streets the tires screeching on the warm asphalt all of them leaning into the turn and then suddenly on a narrow street surrounded by woods he slowed and reached out and killed the flasher six blocks he said twenty seconds later four blocks then up in front of them a block away they saw another suburban pull away from the curb go down another block and turn a corner thats our guys said the redhead going down mallard said he couldnt keep the stress out of his voice im about to wet my pants this is a rental the redhead said try not to they idled along for a block paused before the corner drifting toward the curb then mallard said theyre doing it theyre doing it lets go the redhaired man mashed on the accelerator and the suburban grunted away from the curb and turned the corner and two blocks away they could see a car in a brilliant slash of light and trucks all around it and men with long guns and helmets got her mallard shouted we got her and a half hour later he said harshly angrily to lucas what the fuck is this about lucas what the fuck is this about they had nina bennett pressed against a sixyearold volvo station wagon frightened crying hands cuffed behind her back and obviously not clara rinker after some preliminary shouting the next thought was that rinker was using bennett as a diversion to approach dallaglios house and there was a rush to get a larger squad around the house but dallaglio was okay and there was no sign of rinker or of fleeing cars or anything else which brought up mallards question what the fuck is this about lucas i dont know he looked around maybe shes watching from somewhere to see what would happen she had to know that dallaglio was protected what would she gain i dont know we dont even know it was rinker malone said the woman who hired her if this even happened didnt sound like rinker didnt sound like mrs dallaglio either lucas said dryly maybe shes just pulling our chain said the redhaired agent that seemed unlikely lucas thought but he couldnt think of anything better an hour later after taking the cuffed nina bennett to the dallaglios house to confront jesse dallaglio both women agreed that theyd never met they sent bennett downtown for a formal statement and pulled everybody else back into position she doesnt have anything to do with it mallard said meaning bennett were gonna get her statement and cut her loose got a story to tell anyway private eye you dont see many of them anymore not like that lucas said she even had a bottle of booze in her car and a little on her breath malone said and she mustve smoked like a chimley the whole car reeked you said chimley lucas observed did not i said chimney chimley mallard said absently then but you know whats really strange when you think about it she smokes like a chimley and she drives a volvo station wagon i didnt think that was allowed said chimney malone said after a minute of silence the redhaired agent said did not said chimley theyd stopped teasing her about when they got back to the hotel still frustrated from the false alarm they parked got out and started walking for the main entrance under the orange sodiumvapor lights when somebody shot at them bang they were spread out walking away from the suburban walking in a line sidebyside like a publicity shot for the magnificent seven when the bang echoed off the building front and they all knew what it was and the agents went down and lucas pivoted and realized in one halfsecond that the shooter had to be at the far end of the huge empty parking lot a hundred and fifty yards north or possibly on the roof of one of the old buildings down to the right but there was no place else really and he ran toward his car thinking gogogo and flashing on the difficulty of hitting a running deer at a hundred and fifty yards hoping hoping looking north as he ran looking for another muzzle flash and then he was at his car and inside and fired it up and pulled out of the parking lot catching from the corner of his eyes the confused scrambling huddle of agents in the driveway and then he was on the street and accelerating he never saw her he thought later he thought he found the place from where shed fired the shot a spot beside a big metalsided building that would allow her to park right there that would allow her to fire and then to run back and climb inside her car in a matter of two or three seconds she was probably moving before lucas had reached his car he thought he did the neighborhood anyway gunning up and down the side streets there was an entrance to a whole nest of interstates right there and he was sure that was where shed gone and if she had shed be truly gone hed never know what car she was in if he went that way so he stayed on the down streets hoping against hope that shed gotten cute that shed tried to drive away slowly that he might see something but he did not after ten minutes he headed back paused by the metal building looking over the spot he thought might have given her the shooting stance she would have been able to rest her hand against the building and across the parking lot now a sea of flashing lights they would have been perfectly illuminated and silhouetted against the hotel goddamnit he said aloud this was the reason for sending bennett to watch dallaglio rinker had found out where the outoftown agents were staying probably by calling around to the main hotels and asking for them by name once she had the hotel shed scouted it picked a place to shoot from but she couldnt wait out there all day with a gun hoping somebody would come along by sending bennett out to dallaglios shed known that all the big shots would be pulled out of the hotel and once they found out that it was a false alarm theyd all be coming back late at night shed be in the dark and theyd be walking in the bright lights of the parking lot as he thought that he was swept by a sudden physical chill he hadnt even considered the possibility anybody might have been hit hed just run he turned back down toward the hotel a cop tried to wave him off but he shouted fbi and was pointed into the back lot he got out and started around the hotel and saw a man running toward him a big man flapping his arms like a goose trying to take off and not getting there she mallard croaked she whoa whoa lucas said and suddenly he was frightened himself whoa louis what happened she she shot malone malone was shot ah jesus how bad how bad lucas looked past him but there was nobody on the ground nothing she must be on the way to the hospital he started past mallard but mallard hooked his arm and closed his eyes and said shes dead malone had been hit between the shoulder blades mallard said the ambulance had been there in three or four minutes but she was gone by then shed never opened her eyes after shed gone down had never made a sound they put her in the ambulance and rushed her to a critical care unit but mallard had been a marine lieutenant in the last days of vietnam and had seen people shot had picked up people hit in the back and knew she was gone but youre not right a hundred percent of the time lets get over there lucas said harshly he was running a little out of control he knew but that had happened before and he recognized it lets get a car his reaction pumped a gram of hope back into mallard and mallard was suddenly waving his arms at the redhaired agent and in less than a minute they were out of the parking lot heading west mallard was hoping again but shaking his head i dont think i dont think he said over and over again i dont think lucas let him ramble mallard was in shock rinker would call him again lucas thought he had to talk t somebody about that maybe sally epaulets rinker wouldnt be call ing to crow about the shooting but shed call to talk to make the point that this was titfortat malone for gene rinker lucas couldnt imap ine that shed let her guard down but he couldnt take the chance as mallard continued to press against the dashboard leaning toward the hospital lucas took out his phone and called sally she answered and asked is it true it cant be true she was shot shes bad and louis thinks shes dead well be at the hospital in a minute oh my god her parents listen sally listen are you listening she was crying lucas realized and he really didnt have time for that stop that shit he snapped stop crying shut the fuck up that shocked her out of it and she said what rinkers gonna call me youve got to be ready to track her youve got to coordinate with st louis and everybody else everybodys got to be ready to roll as soon as you have a location do you understand youre monitoring me just like we did before but what about louis lucas glanced at mallard then said louis is out of it for now so youre carrying it okay get this set up shes gonna call tonight and i gotta stay off this phone they were at the hospital two minutes later mallard hopping out of the truck while it was still rolling into a parking space there were two agents already there outside the emergency room doors but he bulled on past them through the doors and inside lucas followed but stopped and looked at the agents shes gone said one of the agents she was gone when she got here they put her on a respirator but theres nothing to work with they say ah jesus theres one of the paramedics a paramedic had come out of the building a black man with a haved head he wore a small gold earring and had a cigarette dangling from his lip lucas walked over and said im with the fbi guys i understand you brought malone in yeah there was nothing we could do we couldnt help her where was she hit in the spine right between the shoulder blades the doc could maybe tell you better im not a doctor tell me what you think lucas said the paramedic took a long drag on the cigarette blew smoke then said it looked to me like a smallcaliber bullet a probably very small entry wound almost like the end of a pencil we turned her over to see if she was pumping blood out of her chest but there were hardly any exit wounds a couple of little cuts like like shrapnel or something i think the bullet clipped through her spine and just exploded like one of those you know those guys who shoot prairie dogs a varmint bullet yeah varmint bullet like it hit her and exploded everything just pulped her heart and lungs they stood silently for a minute or so and then the guy said im sorry lucas rubbed his nose goddamnit she a nice lady ohhh yeah in a lot of ways lucas said not ready for that kind or question the paramedic looked at him oddly and lucas realized that he had been asking a proforma question and had expected a prororma answer lucas nodded his head and said yeah she was really a nice lady lucas went inside and found mallard slumped in a chair while an uncertain doctor stood a couple of feet away looking down at him then at lucas are you a friend yeah we might want to keep this gentleman around for a little while hes got a shock problem all right ill have somebody sit with him lucas sat down and looked at mallard who had suddenly shriveled he wasnt saying anything wasnt looking at anything except the tiled floor lucas patted him on the shoulder and said just sit for a while mallard nodded dumbly and lucas got up found the redhaired agent and told him to stick with mallard the redhaired guy nodded and said i jerked the aic out of bed hes on his way to the scene so thats covered all right im going back to the hotel wait for the call if it comes the agent shook his head gotta get the bitch now before it was a sport now its a war lucas took a step toward the emergency room door then turned back when you take mallard out of here use some other door she set up this last shooting it just occurred to me that she could be setting up outside here he nodded toward the doors she knows well all be here the agent looked at the doors and then said ill get some guys to make a quiet sweep do it lucas went back to the hotel to wait took off his shirt got into some jeans tried not to think about malone couldnt help thinking about her wanted to get her back but couldnt finally used the hotel phone to call weather and told her oh my god lucas are you all right im fine i mean im fucked up but im not hurt when i left they were talking about getting somebody to do the formal identification and signoff and i just cleared out of there i couldnt stand to go look at her jesus we walked out of here a couple of hours ago we went down the elevator together and she was sure we had rinker in a box maybe you ought to come home cant now im going to get her unless she gets you shes not mad enough at me she wouldnt have gone after malone if malone hadnt been the one talking about her brother in the paper you dont know that for sure she mightve gone over the edge i gotta give it some more time but im feeling really bummed but not medically bummed he knew what she meant a little problem with clinical depression not like that then id say youre pretty healthy you should be bummed when a friend is killed just wait until rinker calls track her down get her im going to he said sooner or later rinker called a half hour later the cell phone rang and he let it ring once more then picked it up yes im all done with the fbi rinker said her whiskey voice sounded blue depressed too late for you clara lucas said theyll never quit now the guy that gets you is gonna be a hero and his career will be made for life people are going to make you into their hobby i well good luck to them rinker said this never would have happened if they hadnt killed my brother nobody wanted your brother to die malone took a lot of shit after it happened there was gonna be an inquiry yeah right a cop inquiry were they planning to raise him up like lazarus no but so what youre saying is that a memo would get written nobody wanted him to die nobody deliberately pulled a trigger on him might as well have i told you myself he wasnt right lucas couldnt think of anything to say and after a moment of silence rinker continued im thinking about getting out you think they would chase me to chile i think theyd chase you to fuckin mongolia and ill tell you what if i were you when they catch me i wouldnt give up id put a gun in my mouth theyll pen you up for ten years in a concrete box the size of a phone booth and then theyll stick a needle in your arm and kill you better to go quick i dont suppose youre thinking of going home no ill be here as long as you are my problem with you is youre lucky again a moment of silence then this fiancee of yours is she pretty goodlooking pretty good lucas said were gonna do the whole thing except not a catholic wedding because shell be a little heavy by then and besides she doesnt care for the church but we got a wildhair episcopalian place which is almost like catholic and were gonna tie the knot up with a priest and flower girls and the whole thing that was gonna be me a few months ago if youd just stuck with killing the mafia assholes you would have pissed off the fbi but you still could have pulled a disappearing act and found a guy somewhere and still had the kid not now thats all gone i dont want to talk to you anymore rinker said youre being a jerk a good friend of mine was killed lucas said im gonna get you for it me and my good luck yeah dont press it rinker said she laughed abruptly a little crazily and said im gone i guess youre tracking this call tell your friends that the next sound they hear is the telephone hitting the highway he heard it hit and in a bizarre tribute to finnish technology the phone neither broke nor turned off and lucas could hear trucks rushing by wherever it was wherever she was they didnt get her they came close one of the chopper pilots said their tracking gear put them on her they were only a halfmile out when she tossed the phone out the window but that was five thousand cars rolling along the highway getting off and on a lot of what ifs and if id justs a highway patrol cop was vectored into the area within five minutes of the first phone ring but had no idea what he should be looking for another cop spotted the phone under a guardrail picked it up said hello and then turned it off the next morning lucas and the fbi special studies group minus mallard listened to the tape of the phone conversation twenty times picking it apart word by word when she said she was gone did she mean gone as in gone to paraguay or did she just mean that she was gone from the conversation why did she throw the phone out the window she could have used it again was she cutting them off was she done talking to anyone had she just been pissed off what during the discussion it seemed that sally epaulets bryce was her real last name stepped into a coordinating role and the rest of the fbi group accepted that at least until mallard or somebody else in authority showed up lucas spent the morning reading through the fbi paper reading everything until he was sick of it somewhere in that mass of names and numbers rinker was hiding but he couldnt find her was she gone andreno called at eleven and they agreed to meet at andys for lunch lucas arrived a little after noon loftus was there and they walked to the back and ordered cheeseburgers and andreno said jesus christ i couldnt believe it i got up late and turned on the tv and thats all they were talking about it was like when reagan got shot or something so bizarre like something in a novel she called me clara did lucas said he told them about the call and then about the shooting itself and they were both shaking their heads got more than one screw loose that girl loftus said shes toast andreno said she better stay in the states if she goes to bolivia the fedsll find her talk to one of their little helpers down there and theyll put her in a basement with an electric outlet and connect some wires to her tits and there wont be any habeas fuckin corpus lucas asked them about the botanical gardens john ross is going over there for an orchestra fundraiser probably not a good idea lots of trees and bushes loftus said hedges and shit its about two minutes from here andreno said we could drive over lucas nodded its not like im doing anything else the gardens lucas thought were pretty neat if minneapolis had an arboretum that close to downtown hed probably go once a week just to look at the flowers to get into the place a visitor would park in a blacktopped parking lot walk into a ticket desk on the bottom level of a twostory building then climb a set of stairs and walk out the back into the gardens that was ideal from a security point of view anybody coming in had to climb the stairs or take an elevator which made handy chokepoints or she could come over the fence the place is huge and there are trees all the way around andreno said maybe get some guys looking down the fence line if you had enough of them its pretty big its like trying to protect a farm or a forest andreno ran into a foodservice supervisor that he knew and asked about the chamber orchestra event the food guy pointed them at the rose garden and they went that way the rose garden was laid out in a square surrounded by a hedge with a long rectangular building at the entrance and a reflecting pool at the exit lucas strolled up and down between the flowers looking for shooting lanes and decided that as long as ross stayed inside the garden the hedge would protect him from any longrange rifle shots unless she climbed a tree he thought as he stood at the garden entrance he could see that the ground rose off to the left and they went that way put a guy right here or two or three guys andreno said as they walked up the higher ground therere so many trees that shed have to get close or she couldnt see through them to shoot and if she got that close and then tried to climb shed be easy to spot they walked around for a while looking at flowers and trees until the humidity started to get to them that place over there andreno said nodding at a domeshaped building is like a tropical jungle all bamboo and palm trees and shit neat place in the winter this whole place is like a jungle i didnt know st louis was so hot we used to have a saying its not the heat its the humidity andreno said we used to say its not the heat its the assholes goddamn hot nights no airconditioning what are you gonna do youre gonna whack the old lady around thats what you get nights like this ones gonna be therell be people smacking people all over town maybe you oughta provide airconditioning as a public service lucas suggested itd be a plan andreno said seriously itd stop more bullshit than a lot of other plans on the way back to andys where andreno had left his car sally called and said the guys on dallaglio say that hes leaving hes going into hiding he says they can follow along but he wont tell anybody where hes going until hes started thats a little dumb if we knew where he was going we could sterilize it in advance did you tell him that yes but he said there was no point in trying and they were safer if nobody knew theyre not leaving until the kids get home from school theyre gonna get them packed up theyre going out tonight call around youve got the weight check the major airlines see where the tickets are if theyre going to italy or somewhere there arent many options were doing that i just wanted you to know is mallard back no they finished the postmortem and theyre flying the body out this afternoon therell be a memorial service in washington and most of us are going youre just shutting down here wont be for a couple of days and therell still be a crew here we wont need the dallaglio crew anymore and most of the rest of us have just been walking in circles anyway lucas was watching an atlanta game when sally called at eight oclock and said dallaglios about to roll me and carl and derik are heading out if you want to ride along its either that or hang myself im down to watching atlanta you got two minutes lucas got a jacket clipped a onto his hip took a halffinished beer along hid it from a primlooking saleslady in the elevator and caught up with the feds in the lobby they were already moving out the doors into a heatsoaked night lucas dropped the beer bottle into a trash can and across the parking lot where malone had been shot and into the suburban a block away lucas could see a mazda mpv van sitting on the street looking into the back of the buildings where rinker had set up with the rifle inside the van was a bored fbi surveillance crew hoping against hope that shed be back she hadnt been although they had a fortytiveish commercial realestate agent whod come over later for drinks with one of the surveillance guys glad im not in that van sally said picking up on lucass thought ive done that down in baltimore working with jack hand the redhaired agent was driving again he nodded and said onions you better believe it he ate them like apples he said they prevented prostate cancer his father died from it onions or prostate lucas asked i almost died from the onions once the redhaired man said he put them on an interstate heading west and lucas frowned wherere we going sally looked at him and then said oh were not going to lambert theres another airport out west called um spirit of st louis dallaglios signed up for a private jet a place called executive air hes flying out of there to newark and then from newark to rome to naples on commercial flights first class of course the whole family napoli said the nearly silent derik derik had a buzz cut and high dry cheekbones and looked like a member of the wehrmacht roma sally was looking at a map now and said to the redhaired agent were on sixtyfour right because if were on fortyfour well wind up down in bumfuck missouri and theres no way back the language lucas said were on sixtyfour the redhaired guy said theres a sign sally checked the sign and then turned to lucas malone was like ten years in service before i signed up she was appointed to mentor some of the younger women agents and one time she told me that i should carefully use a few words you know nothing really nasty none of the gynecological stuff but the occasional fuck or shit just to let them know that you werent a sissy she said getting treated ladylike or if you were expected to be ladylike it was the end of you she said you had to be a lady but not ladylike a point lucas said back then it was sally said ten years ago i dont think it matters so much anymore yeah youve pretty well taken over now the redhaired man said better believe sally said derik said nothing just bobbed his skinhead to sortie unseen music with a jerky beat sally got on a radio and talked to the crew with dallaglio theyre just getting out to the cars she said we ought to get there about the same time rinker had an unfamiliar weight on her shoulders the weight of death not the killing of dichter or levy or malone or even of all of them together but rather the killing of honus johnson shed thought about it as she waited for johnson to come lurching out of the basement like a frozen frankenstein to stand over the couch while she was half asleep waited for the sound of the freezer lid opening was sure shed heard it a halfdozen times one of the few literary experiences of her young life had come with a stephen king novel carrie which had scared the shit out of her as she sprawled across the bed in her apartment alone reading the feeling now was the same but even more intense there really was a frozen dead man in the basement and he really hadbeen a torturer who would come back from hell with a bloody machete she analyzed it as shed been taught in her college psych classes back in wichita and she decided that her problem was not so much the dead man in the basement as the fact that she hadnt left him behind in all her other killings shed almost instantly walked away from the bodies in a couple of cases shed had to move them but shed been done with them in a few hours at most shed been able to escape what shed done put it behind her and out of mind this one she was stuck with at least for a few more days he was riding on her shoulders as she drove west into the setting sun she looked a little like a fashionable female johnny cash she thought thin black longsleeve shirt black jeans dark blue running shoes from which shed carefully torn the reflective patches in the backseat she had a black silk scarf and a black baseball cap when she had it all on she thought shed be invisible in the dark theyd been in the car for fifteen minutes when sally took a radio call then looked at her map theyre ahead of us about three miles she said after a minute four vehicles two of ours and two of theirs theyre staying on the speed limit so if we can step on it a bit well catch them they caught them a couple of miles east of the airport rolling off the interstate and down onto a country highway when dallaglio gets out of here everything will come back to ross unless shes really after ferignetti too but ferignettis so sure that she isnt that i kind of believe him sally said so its ross if shes really after ross lucas said as they came up behind the trailing federal suburban they were all slowing down and a quarter mile ahead lucas saw another suburban take a left turn off the highway into the airport he could see the control tower like a lighted diamond in the dusk atop a black cylinder and all around it low brick lightindustrial warehouse and office buildings a boulevard led into the airport with the tower off to the right but nothing that lucas could identify as a terminal until they drove past a mounted military plane which lucas thought might have been a phantom and reached a tintersection at the end of the boulevard the redhaired agent said thats the terminal pointing at a building at the top of the t in the headlights all the other trucks had taken a left following signs to executive air two hundred yards up the road a brilliantly lighted hangar stood off to the right with an executive jet inside another jet with a fold down stairway leading to an open door sat on the pad outside the hangar derik whod said virtually nothing during the trip muttered looks like a tv stage a soundstage they oughta kill the lights lucas said man this looks like this looks bad the lead truck had already stopped next to the jet and a couple of agents hopped out then the second car pulled up a lincoln and lucas said to sally urgently tell them to keep dallaglio in the car keep him in the car she lifted the radio to her mouth as they stopped at the end of the lines of vehicles and lucas popped his door and climbed out and shouted at the agents keep him in the car and then he said to derik whod scrambled across to get out with him aw shit the dallaglios were all getting out father mother daughters wandering around in the brilliant light like so many lost mice lucas said to derik cmon and hurried forward the redhaired agent was coming around the front of the truck to go with them and a couple of agents from the trailing truck were getting out and for a few seconds it was a very pretty missouri evening too hot and humid but not a bad night to sit around a backyard swimming pool with friends and a few fruitrum drinks with little brightly colored paper umbrellas a night like that then paul dallaglio stepped into the space between his car and the lead fbi truck the agents coming up from behind him he stood there for a couple of seconds then turned to say something to his wife did a little dance and fell down an instant later they heard the bang and then a ripping sound as rinker opened up with the ar and everybody went to the ground and bullets cracked through glass and metal and tires and ricocheted off the sides of the hangar and the jet dallaglio on the ground made a humping motion and lucas in a tiny corner of his mind as he pushed himself behind a wheel and dug for his weapon wondered why the hell he was making the humping move and then realized that bullets were tearing through dallaglios body lucas could smell gas and oil and dirt and could hear people screaming the girlish screams of a child and then one of the agents was up and behind the suburban and was banging away with what sounded like a and lucas pushed up and picked up a muzzle flash and thought that unless the agent was holding about four feet above the flash at that distance hed be wasting his ammunition he didnt think anything more about it but simply lifted his and started banging away holding very high rinker was shooting from the side of a singlestory warehouse or office building to their left little sparkles of flame followed by the sounds of bullets tearing through sheet metal and in the dark it was hard to figure the range a hundred yards maybe a hundred and fifty maybe even two hundred he thought he held four feet high and banged away with no hope of hitting her hoping simply to dislodge her then the bolt of the banged back and open and lucas dropped the magazine and slapped in another his only spare and another gust of bullets spattered across the parking area and he could hear more people screaming but couldnt tell what they were saying someplace in there he felt the tires go on the other side of the suburban and yelled at derik shes taking out the tires so we cant chase her she must be driving we gotta block the road derik scrambled back to the suburban that theyd arrived in and screamed something lucas didnt understand to the redhaired agent who was behind another vehicle the redhaired man looked back wildly shouted something then dug in his pocket found some keys and threw them at derik derik crawled into the suburban and lucas on hands and toes scooted over to that vehicle derik was lying across the front seats and when lucas heard the engine turn over he climbed through the back door and said what are we doing gonna back it up derik grunted cant see shit hold on lucas peeked over the top of the backseat he couldnt see any more muzzle flashes from rinker but the agents were still pouring fire into the dark derik kneeling on the passenger seat locked the steering wheel in place with one hand and with the other shifted the truck into reverse then reached down and pressed on the accelerator they started backing fast wobbling and lucas risked another peek and said youre doing fine doing fine faster though faster hold it straight they backed up a hundred feet running on two flats lurched twice into the curb and then cut an angle with the building where theyd seen the muzzle flashes and were out of her line of sight lucas shouted whoa stop and the suburban lurched to a stop and derik shouted what but lucas was already out of the truck he jerked open the driversside door and shouted let me in derik pulled back and lucas gunned the truck in a circle climbed the far curb onto the grass bounced around cut back into the street and headed back toward the entrance boulevard the flats slapslapslapslap outside the open passenger door then derik managed to get up and he pulled the door shut and lucas pushed the truck up to forty and they bounced down to the exit and lucas cut across it nothing happened the gunfire was dwindling and lucas realized that he hadnt heard the stuttering bursts from the automatic weapon shes running he said where is she there must be another way out you hang here im gonna try to get back hang on a minute theyll freak out and shoot you if you just come running up derik said he slipped a radio from his pocket and got sally davenports coming back on the road tell every body hes running up the road she acknowledged and derik nodded at him go lucas gun in hand ran back up the road toward the terminal then to the left toward executive air nobody had touched the lights and the whole place still looked like a soundstage and more than that they had music bonnie tylers total eclipse of the heart was bleeding out into the night through speakers in the open hangar lucas thought as he ran toward the island of light most of the agents and the dallaglios were still huddled behind the four vehicles of the original convoy three people were flat on the ground and somebody had dragged dallaglios body behind one of the suburbans sally and the redhaired agent were both missing and when lucas came up he shouted wheres sally and somebody shouted back they went after her and pointed into the dark lucas said ah man and ran that way as he came up to the first building he shouted sally she called back this way this way he went that way and found sally and the redhaired agent both armed with long guns working their way between the buildings anything no we think i think she ran not in a car lucas said we had the road blocked and we didnt see anyone going out ahead of us she must be on foot she must have a car ditched outside somewhere dallaglios dead said the redhaired agent no shit lucas said anybody else two guys wounded leg wounds she was taking out tires goddamnit lucas said maybe what the redhaired agent laughed ruefully and said i was gonna say maybe we could get dogs he looked off into the dark and said fuck me dogs sirens ambulances and cop cars they started back between the buildings toward the road walking at first then breaking into a trot the two wounded agents were still on the ground each with an agent sitting next to him another agent and two bodyguards sat next to dallaglios body and jesse dallaglio sat on the ground a few feet away making a keening cry that lucas thought might have been romantic to read about but in practice sounded like a broken dental drill the girls were out of sight and lucas thought they were probably back in the lincoln where they wouldnt be able to see their father the first of the ambulances arrived and the paramedics looked at dallaglio and then went straight to the two wounded agents who were loaded into the first ambulance and sent on their way another ambulance came up and they also looked at dallaglio and then one of the paramedics lifted jesse dallaglio to her feet and led her back toward the lincoln and the girls lucas had nothing to do but stand around he wouldnt be working with the crimescene people except perhaps to identify the spray of shells as coming from his gun sally was walking around saying a few words to each of the agents then came back to lucas and said she had a machine gun probably got it from baker lucas said he neglected to mention it probably an illegal conversion what were we supposed to do what could we have done nothing you may get some shit but theres nothing you could have done except lock dallaglio in his basement they were looking at jesse dallaglio who stood next to the lincoln talking through the nowopen back door the paramedic was still supporting her poor kids sally said lucas was staring at the dark sky past the lighted diamond of the control tower he didnt respond and after a minute sally asked what huh something i think clara just screwed up yeah tell me well lucas said think about what just happened rinker had never had any intention of driving out of the airport shed seen too many car chases on television the kind where the guy never escapes from the helicopter shed walked in found a spot behind a low concrete drainage wall where she could prop the gun shed dug up a square of sod to use as a rest and it worked perfectly when the convoy arrived she waited patiently until dallaglio got out in the open then nailed him with a single shot a round of hollowpoint then flipping the selector switch she sent the rest of the thirtyround magazine into the body and at the row of vehicles concentrating on the tires the agents and bodyguards scattered like dust and when the magazine ran out she slapped in another and fired carefully spaced bursts at each of the trucks and cars halfway through she became aware of return fire but never heard or felt anything passing close by never felt threatened as she was showing nothing but three inches of forehead and rifle then one of the trucks began backing away and out of sight time to go she hastily hosed the rest of the magazine into the line of trucks then turned and ran she ran down the length of the airport invulnerable in the darkness she ran across a beanfield down the rows of thighhigh plants letting the rows guide her back toward her car feeling the kind of excitement shed felt as a kid playing war in the fields around tisdale she ran almost a mile in all the last part of it across a golf course and took she thought about seven minutes to do it when she got to the car she tossed the ar into the backseat and eased the car out of its parking spot and up a narrow lane through a residential area just before she lost sight of the airport she stopped for a last look there v ere ambulances coming in now and she could see tiny dark figures dancing in the splash of light paulo she said aloud thats another one for you i sally and lucas got back to the fbi conference room at midnight washingtons gonna call tomorrow theyll want to pull the team she said the perception is weve screwed this to the wall even before malone can you stall for a few days lucas asked as derik wandered in carrying a sixpack of diet coke in plastic bottles i think we can bag her derik dropped them on the table and gestured and lucas took one derik said sally said were working tonight and you think we can get her yeah wheres that redhaired guy hes with patrick theyre old pals patricks the guy who got it in both legs broken bones sally said gonna be tough derik said to lucas lay it out how do we get her okay lucas said first rinker knew exactly where the dallaglios were gonna be and when she knew she knew exactly which jet company and it seems to me that she knew that there wouldnt be a security sweep of the place ahead of time which means somebody is talking to her sally said thoughtfully thats right somebody tipped her and the person is close to the dallaglios second i keep thinking that there had to be a reason for the order that she killed these guys in she took dichter first because he was going to be the hardest except maybe for ross so she tricked him lured him out before he really knew what was going on when he might have thought he could still talk his way out of it and she set him up so he felt safe and bang then she took levy because she had another trick figured out the cell phone then dallaglio because she had a source of information that could set him up and she knew ahead of time weeks ago that she could do that its all very logical we really didnt have a chance to step on any of it how about ross sally asked we dont even know that shes going after ross thats kinda my point ross doesnt seem to be all that worried hes like ferignetti careful but maybe not as worried as he should be maybe hes in on it sally said maybe this whole thing is a way to eliminate competition itfeels that way lucas said but the whole thing was touched off by paulo mejias killing how does that fit did the other guys go after her and ross try to help her out our problem is we dont really have rinkers story or paulo mejias we dont know what they expected or felt i mean mejia had a guy with him who was carrying a goddamn mac why was that did they know something maybe wait a minute lucas said hang on one thing at a time so we know something rinker was tipped by somebody close to the dallaglios so if we get with jesse dallaglio as soon as she can think again she should be able to figure out exactly when they knew what time they were leaving for the airport probably sometime this morning thats the first we knew that they were moving so somebody was tipped after that and she should be able to point us at every single person who knew they were all penned up inside the house we should be able to get the phone records of every person in the house and all the house phones see where they went sally said thats good we could have all of that in a couple of hours what well have is a few names and most of them we should be able to eliminate immediately so by tomorrow morning we should have the name of somebody who can get in touch with rinker or who rinker gets in touch with and they wont know that we know if rinker calls whoever tipped her off she wont be running shell talk for awhile we can move on her in five minutes sally said have the choppers scattered around we can do all that derik said so weve got to talk to jesse dallaglio tonight lucas said as an afterthought does ross know what happened at the airport yes i called the team leader out at rosss and had him go in and tell him they know maybe lucas rubbed his nose thinking you know what id do id check to see if the dallaglios used a travel agent or somebody outside the family to set up the trip they almost had to you cant just call up one of these jet services and drive out and go they want to see the money or they want a guarantee you think a travel agent well when we first got onto rinker up in minnesota we were never able to track rinker when she was traveling it was like she was invisible i wouldnt be surprised if all these mafia guys like to keep their travel private maybe its somebody rinker knew from when she was traveling to kill people maybe theres a connection if it is something like a travel agent and we can figure it out we could maybe get ross to book a trip sally said you know have him be sneaky about it tell the agent to book him out of someplace like springfield and then just saturate the airport before he comes in shed have no way to know that we were onto her that could work lucas said derik said at least were being whatever that word is lucas said what word you know proactive sally said so lets proact our asses over to dallaglios place and talk to jesse dallaglio lucas said a doctor was leaving the dallaglios when they arrived a tall slender woman in what would have been a tweedy dress if it hadnt been ninetyeight degrees outside and it still looked like tweed even if it was some kind of light knotted cotton sally identified herself and said did you put them asleep the children were exhausted i gave them sleep aids theyre with their mother the doctor said i left some sleep aids for mrs dallaglio but i dont know if shell use them she was resistant inside the house one of the bodyguards still wearing bloody pants said mrs dallaglios back with the kids in the bedroom well wait lucas said and there are ten guns around the house now youve probably got time to get cleaned up if you want the bodyguard looked down at his pants gonna burn these sons of bitches he said he looked around im gonna do that get cleaned up ill be back in ten minutes as he was going out the door he added what a night a second bodyguard came padding down a hall as they stood around the living room saw them and said the kids are asleep jessell be with you in a minute more like five minutes but when jesse dallaglio came out of the back shed managed to pull herself together her eyes were still puffy and red from crying but the first wave of the shock had passed lucas had seen it before women recovered faster than men from the death of a spouse lucas believed that both men and women expected the wife to live longer so that women were somewhat braced for the departure of a husband while a husband in most police cases was absolutely unprepared unless of course hed done the killing himself when that was a possibility most homicide cops liked to take a quick hard look at the husband to see if he was either too pulled together or too demonstrative most innocent husbands simply dropped into dumb shock and stayed there for a while it was an attitude not easily faked im better dallaglio was telling sally the girls are sick and theyre terrified but theyll be okay the doctor gave them some sleeping pills what did you v chief davenport had an idea that we felt we had to look into sally said could you tell us when you decided for sure to go with executive air and when you decided what time youd be leaving she looked from sally to lucas to derik then back to lucas as her hand came up to her mouth oh my god how did she know wed be there lucas nodded thats what we were wondering dallaglio turned away from them all and stared at a wall for a moment thinking then back to lucas exec air had a problem we have a deal with them we get a rate but they only manage three jets and all three of them were out two were coming back but they didnt know until two oclock when theyd be in and when they could have one of them turned around they told paul to call at two and thats what he did they told us to be there at nine oclock or a little after so you didnt know when youd be leaving until two oclock thats right who did you tell outside the house pauls friends your friends your daughters friends again dallaglio turned away thought and turned back paul told at least two people the karens we call them the karens its karen slade and karen english theyre the two assistant vice presidents at work theyre pauls assistants but i dont think either of them was around when clara was here maybe karen slade but shes a dear friend of both of us her and her husband it cant be karen sally was making notes did you talk to anyone i called my sister janice she lives down in little rock but it wouldnt be her the kids wed have to wait until tomorrow but i dont think they called anyone theyre not really old enough to have telephone friends yet i mean justy does in a way but its the girl down the block and we hardly know her parents i would be amazed if clara rinker knew them the bodyguard whod been wearing the bloody pants came back his hair damp wearing a fresh shirt and pants jesse looked at him and said sy could you get james and check out back we just heard a noise we were about to go look well check sy said and he walked through the room into the family room where they heard him talking with the bodyguard named james and a minute later they heard a door sliding open jesse dallaglio dropped her voice the people we really dont know in the house are the security people there are eight of them four of them came out to the airport with us for all the good it did us and they were here all the time every one of them has a cell phone and paul told them this afternoon that wed be making a run for the airport two of them were coming to newark with us they were going to stay with us until we got on the plane tomorrow morning lucas looked at sally who said we can talk to their boss and get the cellphone numbers without them knowing about it youll have to use some pretty harsh language with the boss so they wont be tipped we can do that derik said okay lucas said back to dellaglio now who else the karens your sister the security guys how did you make the travel arrangements a travel agent american express dallaglio said we have a platinum card and they have one of those callup bureaus somewhere they knew but how would clara get into that i mean its not like we even talk to the same person every time its always somebody different lucas said to sally okay heres something dumb check the phones here see if theyre bugged rinker did that thing with the cell phone with levy maybe shes got a highpowered phone tech working for her she does sally said we already know that she made a note and said makes me a little nervous to be talking here lucas said to dallaglio think anybody else think of every phone call you made that paul made she thought for a minute then shook her head we were really running around getting ready we were gonna be gone for maybe a month or even more i you know paul called the wall street journal guy i think the delivery guy and canceled the paper i think he said something about it we should get the call records and go over them sally said just to make sure gotta talk to the karens lucas said gotta do that tonight they talked to the karens separately shaking them out of bed giving them the news about dallaglio they both appeared to have been sleeping soundly lucas had worked enough homicides to believe that sound sleep came with an innocent mind if either had killed dallaglio she would have been on pins and needles to know what happened or would already know and only masterful actresses could have played the shock on their faces when sally gave them the news both said that dallaglio had warned them against telling anyone else about the trip both said that they had obeyed the order hadnt even talked to each other about it when the interviews were done lucas said we need to look at dallaglios phone records these two didnt have anything to do with it a hasty conclusion sally said they were standing under a lush smallleaved oak tree in one of the karens front yard we dont know enough i know enough lucas said neither one of them suspected the killing was coming or if they did they were good enough actresses that well never figure it out either way its time to move on derik should have the phone records by now sally said she looked at her watch its two am you want to keep running im just getting under way lucas said grinning at her in the dark love this kind of thing tearing around in the middle of the night maybe we oughta find some caffeine when they got back to the fbi office derik was waiting with an unhappy surprise we got the phones for all the security guys there were quite a few calls but the numbers check out unless rinkers working at a pizza hut there was another number we didnt expect he pushed a piece of paper at them the paper was a list of numbers and one of the numbers was circled in red thats an unlisted phone it goes to john ross the call was made at pm from dallaglios home office somebody called ross yeah probably dallaglio theres a phone call from that home office number to dallaglios mothers home and that lasted twelve minutes then one minute later another call to executive air which we figure was arrangements on the plane and one minute after that the call to rosss which lasted for two minutes we think it was dallaglio working down a list lucas nodded that seemed likely he tapped the executive air call i wonder if rinker used those guys if thats how she got around has anybody looked at executive air sally shook her head no we can but that could be quite a few people so get one of your paper experts to do it find out who works there crossreference them against rinkers known work record check criminal backgrounds see if there was any kind of link between executive air and the assholes the mafias or whatever they are sally nodded theres still the problem of ross that he might have set it up we should talk to mrs dallaglio again see if there was any kind of competitive thing going on think shed tell us why not shes not a hood we cant hang her she doesnt know nuthin about nuthin too late now sally said lucas turned to look at the wall clock ten after three first thing tomorrow he said they agreed to meet in the hotel lobby at eight oclock theyd had enough for the night derik said he had a few more things to do that hed be another fifteen minutes and lucas and sally walked out to the stairs on the way down lucas stopped said goddamnit what i gotta go back i need to talk to derik ill catch a ride back with him something important a coup probably not another detail to check back upstairs he asked derik how long it would take to get all of rosss phone calls for the past two months since the shooting in mexico both outgoing and incoming with ids on each phone we practically live in the phone company computer he said i could call a guy get them here in a half hour call the guy and ill need all of patricia hills calls from the same time im gonna get a coke maybe spend a little time here lucas got a coke from the canteen and when he got back derik said we know six phones that he uses personally were getting lists for all six theyll come up here and he showed lucas how to manipulate the mail feature on the groups main computer how long he said hed run them right away the rumor is getting around that were in trouble so our guys back in washington are doing everything they can good enough lucas sat down and stretched you can take off if you like i might if you can handle this you could call me at the hotel if you have trouble should be okay i get along with computers you were davenport simulations somebody told me used to be got bought out by the current management lucas said hope you made a shitload of money lucas nodded i did pretty much right there in the middle of the dotcom thing but the companys still around right doing all right yup im out of it dont even own any stock but from what i hear theyre doing okay derik fussed a bit then left leaving lucas in the quiet conference room he checked the computer every few minutes then found that he could sign onto his home isp and get at his email that sucked up a half hour deleting the fast money and pornography offers checking a few of the porsche aftermarket companies then it occurred to him to check boat companies because the fbi computer was so quick and he started downloading photos of shallowwater boats from maverick and then he got onto the boston whaler and hurricane sites went out to look at cdory and a few more by the time he got back to the official mail it was after four when he checked the mail he found lists for the six phones that ross was known to use he took a while to figure out the formatting then started with the longest list which showed more than a thousand calls on the fourth list linked to the unlisted office phone he got lucky a phone call went into rosss office at three oclock from los angeles from a bp station there was another three oclock call from sacramento then another from someplace in wyoming a longer one another from kansas three more from st louis all at three oclock in the afternoon all from gas stations rinker was calling ross lucas would bet on it there was one good way to confirm it he pulled the hill list to see if he could find a duplication a call to hill from the same time and place as a call to ross but there were none he took a turn around the office was he on the wrong trail the line of calls coming across the country was so good and at exactly the right time but then ross was in the trucking business and was also in the organizedcrime business he would get calls from phone booths at interstate gas stations he walked around the room a couple of times trying to figure a way to confirm the calls and began to worry that he was locking in a problem he saw with other cops all the time the sure sense that something was just so when it wasnt something that felt so good that it had to be you could build a great logical case out of pure bullshit and it happened too frequently he circled the question and couldnt make it work ross and rinker were into something he couldnt quite figure he felt stupid and that made him angry fuck it he said and he walked out of the room down the hall had the guard call him a cab and ten minutes later the cab arrived at the fbi building with unnatural celerity walked into the hotel he could get three hours of sleep if he was lucky he expected to wake up pissed off and tired and he did at sevenfortyfive he called sally in her room when she answered with a song in her eyes he assumed that from her chipper voice he snarled ill be way late and was asleep again when his head hit the pillow ross rinker rinker ross had to be still think it was he grunted feels too good if it was ross then shes gone shes done everybody maybe we ought to brace ross about it see what happens lucas said hes a smart man hell tell us to go have sexual intercourse with ourselves hes going to this orchestra thing at botanical gardens this evening im gonna crash the party take andreno along if hell go watch him see if we can make him nervous maybe we ought to take a few people along you coming if i have time she said i did bring a nice little red party dress just in case then she clouded up i wish malone were here she was really good at this lucas slept until one oclock hed never had trouble sleeping late and into the afternoon even though he often had trouble getting to sleep at midnight he felt decent when he got up he took his time shaving and in the shower lingered over a sandwich and the newspaper and at two oclock walked into the fbi conference room thinking rinker ross ross rinker sally was there and said mallard called hes on his way back washington is going to pull us in a couple of days he thinks but were okay if we can come up with something anything theyre not going to do anything public especially after malone went down but it doesnt look good for the hometown kids rinker and ross lucas said let me tell you about the phone calls he told her but pointed out so many shortcomings with the concept that she said id have believed it was rinker if you hadnt talked me out of it with sally the redhaired guy derik and a halfdozen others lucas argued the question of the phone calls from the coast and found the group divided almost fiftyfifty with a oneman majority in favor of the calls coming from rinker they all went back to the paper looking for more ties one guy said suddenly we ought to have a few people there tonight you know like a crew weve got a crew escorting ross sally said more than that we need more than that the guy said excited by an idea think about this if nothing happens to ross wed be suspicious but what if hes shot at and missed what if hes rescued before he can be killed by his security guys you mean a faked hit yeah oh god somebodys head hit the table with a hollow thump followed by a groan everybody was looking at the guy who suggested the fake hit who said what then somebody started to laugh and the laughter rippled around the room and finally sally said you got one thing right we need more people there well work it out lucas called and reno and asked him if he wanted to go to the botanical gardens party would this be like a date andreno asked of course not lucas said im engaged to be married all right but nothing below the waist then they hooked up for dinner a place called brownies ate shrimp and salads and andreno wanted a blowbyblow account of the shootout at spirit of st louis hell of a thing he said when lucas finished i was in two shootouts when i was on the force and i cant remember shit about either one of them but there was like a total of four shots fired this was like a war one of the agents said something to me after malone was shot lucas said he said something like it used to be a hobby now its a war but he thought itd be us making the war the waitress came by to check the state of their drinks they were okay but she chatted for a minute making serious eye contact with andreno when she was gone lucas asked you know her not yet i felt like a goddamn cuckoo clock or something sitting here and you guys got this liplock going over the salads you got relationship cooties andreno said women can pick those up in one second they know youre hooked up with somebody else lucas nodded looking after the waitress nicelooking woman though i could get used to this place st louis except its so fuckin hot andreno shrugged you get a pool you have a pool no but im used to it i like it the heat better than six months of ice storms i was up in minneapolis in august once my old lady at the time had relatives up there and she wanted to visit and they said come up for the state fair so we went up to the state fair and i almost froze to death i was walking around in a golf shirt and slacks and it was twelve degrees or something twelve is a little cooler than wed expect in august lucas said you know what i mean i like the snow lucas said i even like blizzards i go up north in the winter got a couple of sleds they talked about their towns until it was time to leave as they were walking across the parking lot to the porsche andreno said wish i had a gun got a knife yeah but that wouldnt i wasnt thinking you could stab her lucas said but they got all those trees in there i was thinking you could cut down a big stick ah i could hit her with the stick right wish i had a gun they parked in the lot in front of the botanical gardens and took a walk around it looking she knows your porsche right maybe probably if she remembers it andreno kept looking at the houses on the other side of the street whatre you thinking suppose shes scouted the place and she spotted a house with some old lady in it shes got these silenced pistols right so she goes up to a house say a hundred and fifty yards away two hundred yards plugs the old lady when she answers the door and then just sits there and waits with that machine gun or the sniper rifle she used on malone maybe parks her car in the back so well never see her when she pulls out ross gets here and she nails him walking across the parking lot just like with dallaglio lucas considered it then said look she had months to work this all out one thing she always did was her planning the way she got at people isolated them then killed them shes never expected we really didnt expect her last night but now that shes done that and malone shes got to think that were ready for rifles so maybe she wont use a rifle but the goddamn things scare the shit out of me never see it coming whack and youre dead before you know it they walked along for a minute and he added man that mustve been something last night i wish i couldve been there as long as i wouldnt have gotten shot that fbi guy they say he could lose a leg thats not the word anymore lucas said the word is hes gonna be okay all right still this fuckin woman ought to be in the cia or something they could use her lucas looked up and down the street id say we could put a squad at the far end but then itd just scare her off if shes coming id rather have her come and fuck a bunch of rosses he knows what hes getting into and yeah fuck him andreno shook his head thats harsh man he looked down the street again just like standing naked in the window they went up the steps and inside showed their ids to a guard went up the interior steps and out the back past the lighted fountain to the left on the other side of a long low redbrick building a group of waiters were setting up tables and lighting mosquitorepelling tiki torches they turned that way down more stairs up a sidewalk edged with buttonsized red and blue flowers a woman in a blue dress and matching shoes pearls and carefully coiffed blond hair was supervising the waiters she saw them said something to a waiter then hurried over im sorry this is a private party she had a perfectly sculpted nose and it was quivering like a rat terriers were cops andreno said laconically he snapped his gum were making sure theres no problem tonight problem she looked from andreno to lucas what kind of problem a woman named sally from the fbi will be here in a couple of minutes lucas said looking back at the entry building shell explain it all were making a routine security check we hear one of the cellos could do something crazy she wanted more her nose quivering even more fiercely as they put her off and wandered past a rectangular bed of red and gold chrysanthemums past a pool then through a hedge into the rose garden strolling with their hands in their pockets looking at the flowers rinkerd have to be thinking about climbing a tree lucas said finally as they walked out the far side of the rose garden and stopped under a crabapple tree there wasnt much contour to the land but there was some and the higher ground was to the left and was covered with trees rossll be okay as long as he stays in the rose garden the fedsll have three teams covering out there they all rented tuxes theyll come in one at a time and once they get out in the dark you wont be able to see them you really think something is gonna happen i think i dont know these things get a rhythm if i were rinker and if i were going after ross id go after him soon not because i had to but because i couldnt stand not doing it getting it over with being done but if shes not going after him something happen something to put a period on it if ross gets here and hes walking around free as a bird slapping people on the back happy then id be inclined to think that claras on her way to paris but if hes walking around keeping his head down and his shoulder blades pinched together itll be interesting to see off to the right they could see the glassandsteel climatron dome with more pools in front of it they wandered down that way cant see much from here too many bushes andreno said other side would be better lucas agreed from a shooting point of view they paused next to a pool a few feet from the corner two bronze statues naked dancing women hung over the water look at the knockers on that one andreno said lucas had to laugh because the same thought had trickled through his mind look at the knockers on both of them they walked ambled hands in their pockets rankers not gonna be here andreno said after a minute or two a she doesnt know about it b hes too protected she fooled us on levy she fooled us on malone she fooled us on dallaglio she shouldnt have been able to do any of those things we knew she was smart but she was a lot smarter than we were ready for lucas said she doesnt miss anything andreno looked past him theres sally and jesus theres mallard he looks like he was hit by a truck man i just i think if somebody killed weather my fuckin head would explode lucas said lets go talk to him what is it that the feds kept saying showtime mallard was physically shaky brutally unhappy im here for today and tomorrow the funeral is day after tomorrow are you up to speed on what were doing lucas asked yes sally sort of turned out to be an executive i hadnt seen that before lucas grinned at him a small wan smile everybody else did there wasnt even any discussion she just took it over good for her mallard said he was wearing a tuxedo as were the other agents that lucas could see and a few men who werent agents he and andreno were wearing sport coats and slacks and loafers lucas felt like a radish at a convention of tulips you think shell show up cant figure it lucas said im getting the feeling from what weve seen so far that she started planning her moves right after she was shot down in mexico shes had a couple of months to think about them and to have her show up and start blazing away thats out of character thats what she did last night mallard said but we didnt see it coming last night lucas said the thing about last night we could only see it later is that she had a source of information that could feed her the dallaglios in a hurry somebody who could actually call her or who she could call i actually thought running was a great idea from the dallaglios point of view once he was out of sight she was out of luck but she knew where and when he was going exactly sally told me about the phone idea the calls to ross and here she comes lucas said sally was wandering toward them wearing a tight deep burgundy dress that started low and ended low below the collarbones and down to the ankles slits on the sides she was carrying a small black purse that lucas decided must hold her pistol because she couldnt have gotten a pencil under the dress without it showing as she came up lucas said nice purse she smiled at him didnt think i could clean up did you i thought you might he said weve been talking about ross and what the hells going on here if she comes in i think well get her weve got teams moving all through the place lucas looked away staring at a pink rose trying to work through it they looked at him waiting and finally he said i cant nail it down cant figure what shell do next ive been stymied before because i didnt know what i needed to know but ive never felt stupid shes got me feeling like a moron well see mallard said he patted lucas on the shoulder and said with a wan smile dumbass more people were arriving men in tuxedos women in party dresses a small pop orchestra set up in front of the brick building that acted as a backstop for the party a dozen longhaired men and women who started off with an even more orchestrated version of air supplys making love out of nothing at all as if the original werent bad enough lucas started away after the first few bars and sally said after him dont like music anytime they start by playing air supply theres a risk theyll move on to the hooters lucas said sally said my you listen to rock n roll its not rock n roll its rock its the music i grew up with just like you she looked at him doing a readjustment and said i guess you always think that people older than you listen to like big band or something jazz jesus sally the first music i can remember was the stones mick jagger was probably in high school when i was born yeah but she looked past him the rosses lucas moved away more quickly far out to the edge of the rose garden watching the rosses as he moved john ross was wearing a europeanstyle notchless tux black on black treena was wearing a creamcolored dress with puffs along the edges that managed to look both expensive and tacky like a versace knockoff for eleven ross shook hands with a few people and seemed to be accepted if they knew he was a hood they at least appreciated his support for the performing arts lucas was watching when he saw movement on the roof of the building behind the orchestra a head then a head and a man with a radio the redhaired guy with another man lucas lifted a hand to them and the redhaired guy mimed a rifle good andreno came over with a plastic plate full of finger food better get over to the table the best stuff goes fast the pate is recommended with them little round yellow crackers give me one of yours lucas said he tried a little yellow cracker and the pate which was recommended but he didnt have much of an appetite the night seemed to be getting warmer rather than cooler and a large number of goodlooking middleaged women were showing ingenious displays of skin lucas and andreno began to move with them clockwise around the rose garden like migrating geese the rosses were on the far side of the clock and they kept it that way although ross caught lucass eye once and shook his head a shallow dour smile locked on his face the clockwork continued around and around the rose garden as slow as a minute hand people clumping and talking but always seeming after a few minutes to move more people showed up and as the crowd got denser there was more of the highpitched feminine laughter that seemed to accompany a crowd of tuxedos and party dresses rich people and wannabes preening themselves lucas checking the women anybody close to the height and build of rinker there were several of them but none was her at eightthirty the party was near its peak the promenade continuing at the heart of the clock face lucas realized after a while were the principals of the orchestra the conductor the president a couple of violinists all with shaggy longish hair and cultivated manners a kind of gardened drollness that led to heavy lids and rolled eyes then andreno said i think im in love lucas looked and said jesus christ shes fourteen but she thinks like forty you want some purple fish eggs this party is too good for you thats possible did i ever tell you about the time the prince of england came here and i was supposed to be security and i was wearing this tux but my jockey shorts kept riding up in my ass crack and were strangling my balls lucas listened with mild amusement and then realized wheres ross andreno stopped in midsentence looked around and said three minutes ago he was under that crabapple tree they both looked toward the top of the garden the end away from the brick building there were two men standing under the tree talking but neither was ross treena ross was also gone maybe in the can not unless theyre peeing in the bushes lucas said they were both moving passed sally and mallard as they went by lucas said ross is gone you see him they both looked and fell in with lucas and andreno and sally said shit he was right there the four of them continued to the top of the garden to the two men under the crab apple lucas asked have either of you seen john ross and his wife its pretty urgent one of them said yes i think they went to look at the orchids in the climatron treena had a flier of some kind a special orchid display they all looked that way and saw treena ross stepping through the door into the climatron with john ross a step behind lucas shouted at them ross wait but ross was gone the door was closing and lucas started running as hard as he could down the sidewalk running hard andreno falling behind sally a couple of steps behind andreno handicapped by heels mallard behind that sally shouting into a radio something unintelligible and then as lucas came up to the door he saw three flashes muzzle flashes and heard faint screaming and he shouted she got him shes inside spread out block the place and he was through the door the climatron was literally a jungle bamboo and palms and ficuses and probably a fuckin cockatoo he thought once inside treena rosss screams were shrill and close by but he couldnt see her he was on a pebbled sidewalk and he drew his and ran down the sidewalk following a curve around to the right and then back toward the center as he came around the curve he saw treena ross backed against a low wall of bamboo a body at her feet her cream dress blotched with blood she saw lucas coming and screamed she went that way she went that way shes in the trees shes in the trees she shot john call an ambulance andreno was right behind him and had a telephone out and was calling an ambulance and lucas said stay here with treena but andreno caught his arm and said we gotta get out of here man we gotta get outside shell kill you in here youll never see her but we can pen her up inside lucas looked around and then knelt next to john ross and rolled him he was dead three shots to the back of his head at close range massive exit wounds on his face and forehead lets go he said to andreno you dont have a gun get mrs ross out of here and he ran back to the door and outside and started shouting seal the building seal the building spread out and seal the building mallard and sally and derik were already moving derik going right with lucas and mallard and sally going left two more tuxedoed men running through the crowd more guns coming rinker had had time to get out if she was set up for a fast escape lucas thought but not a lot more time than that if shed slowed down if shed frozen they ran around the building past another exit and lucas shouted over his shoulder to derik block this block this and derik pulled up and lucas continued around there was another exit on the back and as he came up on it he saw sally coming from the other direction what he shouted we maybe got her inside didnt see anybody running get more people get everybody here ross is shot ross is dead and sally was on the radio and everybody lucas could see was running and they tightened the choke hold on the climatron and then an agent shouted window weve got a broken window lucass heart sank but he ran that way to the far back side of the dome where it sat above the landscape on a concrete retaining wall above the concrete wall one of a band of windows appeared to have been broken out goddamnit lucas looked around somebody give me a step one of the agents holstered his gun and made a step with his interlinked fingers and boosted lucas up the wall lucas did a pushup onto the top then reached down to the window a womansized hole had been knocked in the glass from the inside shed cut herself doing it he thought there was a smear of blood on the glass i think shes out he shouted down shes bleeding we need to block this place just in case shes inside and then spread out in the park see if we can push her shes close lets go lets go sally had them organized in fifteen seconds and they began moving in a wide band behind the climatron spreading through the dark jogging looking for anything in front of them lucas stayed back looking at the jungle inside the dome he didnt want to punch out any more glass and he eventually dropped back down the wall and ran around to the front treena ross was sitting on the ground andreno beside her stay with her lucas said and he went inside the dome the door moved again behind him and derik was there with his pistol we cant do this lucas we need a team with armor if shes in here shell kill at least one of us and maybe both of us lucas thought about it ten seconds fifteen seconds so curious that rinkerd let herself be trapped in here if she had but then she hadnt expected a massive number of cops come on lucas said he started into the dome goddamnit derik said i gotcha covered lucas said he hurried down the path through the jungle saw a pistol lying on the path near a fake cliff and waterfall called gun and went on trying to get his bearings he finally clambered through a hump of bamboo toward the back glass where rinker had broken out derik followed scuttling this way and that his weapon pointed in the air looking for movement in the trees lucas squatted next to the broken window and as derik came up he said you dont have a flashlight ive got one of those things for your car keys to see the lock gimme lucas shined the tiny light on the window at the bloodstain and then handed the light back to derik and said come on and stuck his pistol in his holster what shes not here but i want you to pretend that she is i want you to go out and get andreno and tell him to step inside to talk to me tell him were hunting her down that shes maybe cornered in the basement but get him in here you stay with mrs ross okay okay but dont ask questions and when youre talking to andreno you gotta be really excited get him in here you think dont ask questions derik went out while lucas waited just inside the door a moment later andreno hurried through lucas caught his arm is the ambulance coming yeah i can hear it i want you to get out there and scoop up treena rocs and carry her toward it but you gotta separate her from her purse and if she says something turn around to me and yell bring her purse and then keep going okay what are tell you in a couple of minutes just get her and run her out to the rose garden or out to the exit tell the paramedics that shes in shock but you gotta separate her from her purse just for a minute and we gotta do it while people are still running around like chickens come on go andreno nodded and turned and ran out the door lucas stepped out with him and heard the sirens saw the cluster of faces around the crabapple tree hell of a fundraiser he thought they ought to get a nice chunk for this one lots of publicity for sure treena ross was still on the ground andreno scooped her up stepping on her purse as he did it straightened up and started running toward the exit a hundred yards away lucas heard treena say my purse my purse andreno staggered with her weight half turned and called somebody bring her purse lucas picked it up and as andreno continued to run opened the purse and found the cell phone inside he turned it on punched through the menu found the phone number and scribbled it in the palm of his hand then he turned it off dropped it back in the purse and ran after andreno he caught them halfway to the exit heard treena saying i can walk i can walk lucas dropped the purse in her arms and andreno puffing put her down and said youre sure you gotta have the paramedic check you a group of women had ventured their way from the crab apple and andreno called could some of you take care of treena ross get her to an ambulance my husband treena called my husband the helping women closed around her and lucas and andreno headed back to the climatron what the fuck was that about about goddamned killed me carrying her shes no lightweight cmon lucas led him at a run back to the dome found mallard and sally together both talking into phones lucas waved them off and they both rang off and mallard said we have more st louis cops coming shes not in there then he thought again but let them come in and tear the place apart what we really need though he turned to sally and said urgently can you get those choppers now fifteen minutes she said they can be turning by the time we get up to lambert then lets go tell me whats happening mallard said he wasnt moving fast enough lucas said i dont have a lot of time to explain this because weve got to get up in the air but the big surprise tonight was rinker was here all right but way before we were tonight maybe or late this afternoon more likely remember those phone calls coming across country at three oclock they were to treena ross whose marriage was going down the tubes treena had to be worried about that because one exwife already died in a hitandrun she might have known too much about rosss operation just to walk away he might not let her walk away any more than he let rinker walk away so who mallard started then treena ross killed him thats right lucas said she got a gun from rinker and carried it in or rinker left it for her in a bush or something inside the dome then rinker came here a while ago knocked out that window and left some blood behind when you do a dna on the blood itll be the same as on that shirt i promise you thats why we found the bloody shirt at patsy hills place with the mexican label in it and we found a gun inside the dome derik and me and i promise you itll be the same gun that killed dichter and its the gun that killed ross so treena ross has a perfect alibi absolutely unbeatable and ross is dead and we never saw it coming because we were waiting for rinker to show up so was ross everybody was but theyd had it set up for long time and the call that dallaglio made to ross before the airport ambush yeah either he actually talked to treena leaving a message or he talked to ross and ross told treena and treena tipped rinker treena probably even knew that they used executive air when they were going out of town so rinker could have scouted the place way ahead of time jesus and you think theyll talk now treena and rinker bet on it and i got the number of the cell phone in treenas purse ill bet you anything that the phone was stolen and that rinkerll be calling to make sure everything is okay or treena will call her if were in the choppers go mallard said lets go as they ran toward the exit and sally started working her phone to call the choppers she asked howd you know ross was shot in the back of the head if you know the situation inside the climatron thats not right unless he walked in backwards but the main thing was the blood on the window lucas said what about it it was bonedry dry itd been there for a while a hell of a lot longer than five minutes rinker hasnt been here for two hours as sally said the run to lambert with flashers and an occasional burst of siren for the recalcitrant took a little more than fifteen minutes plus another two or three to make it down the frontage road to the helicopter facility they had three choppers none of them turning a blade yet mallard climbed out of the lead truck and ran inside the chopper hut and they could hear him screaming nine men pilots copilots and technicians hurried out the side heading toward their aircraft pulling on helmets two people per chopper mallard yelled who wants to go with who sally said ill ride with lucas hes lucky go go they were airborne over st louis twentyfive minutes after they left the botanical gardens and spread themselves under instructions from mallard along mallard himself hovered over downtown with andreno while lucas and sally waited west of forest park where they could see the lights of the inner belt highway and the third chopper waited out beyond the outer belt way west were good eastwest but if she goes northsouth itll take a while to get there lucas shouted at sally not long sally said shaking her head and if shes along the main stem here well be on her in a minute one of us will her phone rang and she put it to her ear listened shouted a few words clicked it off and said treenas phone is listed to some guy from a place called crestwood the phone doesnt answer just an answering machine and the cops are on the way if the place has been broken into were good were good lucas said believe it the technician riding behind the pilots was looking at a computer screen that seemed to combine a local map and a radio receiver he spoke occasionally into a radio and thats the way it was for thirty minutes sitting up in the sky watching the cars below not talking much because of the noise sally said once its pretty when you can see everything from the missouri back to the arch wheres the missouri the line out there to the north and over to the west you can see the curve looks like it really should have come into the mississippi way to the south but made this big jog at the last minute makes a peninsula out of st louis almost yeah you seem pretty calm for a guy whos famous for hating airplanes lucas said helicopters dont bother me for some reason none of it has anything to do with logic its then the phone rang and the computer screen lit up and the technician started talking fast to the pilots and the chopper dove for speed and took off east lucas shouting what what somebodys talking cell phone to cell phone mrs rosss phone is downtown but the second one is just east of us its moving weve got the cell im tuning her in im tuning her got her where is she she s moving shes moving then he was talking to the pilots on a mouthpiece and the pilots were talking back and the chopper made a big cut left coming around coming around dropping heading back west slowing we got some cops coming in see that group of cars that group right there shes in there i think four or five cars the cops are a mile out we got her we got her rinker was in the benz had been talking with treena ross who was weeping grieving for her late husband when she heard the chopper rinker had lived in bad parts of st louis long enough in her younger years to know what it was a kind of strange flapping sound as if somebody were beating his chest with open palms she said cops and hung up and rolled along for a moment despair creeping into her heart hoping that treena knew enough to get rid of the phone thinking quickly of davenport and then she saw the lights of a shopping center up ahead a thin glimmer just a possibility of hope and she suddenly floored the accelerator and cut through traffic and let it run out the car gaining momentum at a ferocious rate toward the gaping mouth of what rinker hoped was a parking ramp had to be a parking ramp or a tunnel or something she said aloud parking ramp please god parking ramp she was no more than a minute away lucas saw her take off moving through traffic like a brokenfield runner shouted shes onto us get on top of her get on top of her a pilot gave him a thumbsup and took the chopper into a scream ing drive but they gained ground only slowly and then actually seemed to lose some and lucas realized that rinker must be pushing the black car into the hundreds like a black comet surging along the street as though to catch the deadwhite light of its high beams the tech was talking into his microphone describing the car describing the action giving updates on the map as they finally started closing then they saw the tunnel or whatever it was up ahead and lucas said shes heading for that tunnel thing parking structure the copilot shouted its the parking structure for the shopping center get us down get us down right in the mouth of it shes gonna beat us there get me out and then get back up and look for her running and to sally as they dropped annie get your gun rinker saw the chopper at the last minute right above her almost ahead of her at the entrance to the tunnel but she squirted past it j ammed on the brakes was thrown into the steering wheel got the speed down enough that she could cut right into a parking bay and saw at the far end three people walking along with shopping bags one of them a man jingling his car keys she went that way laying on the gas again the family had seen her coming and knew she was moving too fast and instinctively flattened themselves against a minivan and she jammed the brakes again and hopped out and started toward them and then something hit her in the butt something like a baseball bat and she went down lucas was out and running into the tunnel saw the benz cut right and ran harder sally dropping behind came around a pillar into a parking bay and saw the benz down at the end and rinker climbing out without thinking he tracked her with the and fired a single shot and amazed himself when she went down rolled and then she was crawling and back up and she was standing next to three civilians two adults and what seemed to be a child a tenyearold girl maybe and rinker was screaming at him go the other way run the other way lucas shouted give it up give it up rinker shouted back run the other way davenport run back down the tunnel or i swear to god ill kill these people ill kill all three of them right in front of your eyes lucas slowed still moving up and shouted clara youre hurt give it up clara and sally closed up and shouted rinker then horrified they saw rinker point a pistol at the head of the largest of the adults and pull the trigger the man twisting and bouncing off a car going down as the shot echoed through the parking garage and rinker pointed the gun at the woman and she screamed mom goes next davenport and then the kid mom goes next run now or ill pop her she pointed the gun at the mother who lifted her arms to her face and shrank away screaming herself she backed up and tripped over her fallen husband and half fell and rinker screamed here she goes lucas shouted were going and he grabbed sallys arm and rinker screamed run or ill kill her ill kill her run out the tunnel run they ran when shed shot the man hed dropped his keys and rinker pointed the gun at the mother and said wheres the car wheres the fuckin car and the woman pointed at the dodge minivan and rinker dragged her leg to it her leg wasnt working but she hopped and dragged and popped the door on the van and screamed get in get in or ill kill you get in the mother and kid got in and rinker screamed at them to lie in the footwell on the passenger side and they crawled into it and she cranked the engine and eased out of the parking slot and accelerated away then slowed took a corner took another and was on the street driving out a helicopter hung overhead but it stayed behind her and then another one came in and then she was on the next street and she saw a man behind her running and realized that it was davenport and accelerated turned a corner accelerated again two blocks turned again and again davenport long gone now said to the woman in the footwell her voice like a chain saw as ugly and vicious as she could make it you stay on the fuckin floor or ill blow your motherfuckin brains out you stay there you hear im gonna stop and ill be right outside the car the woman whimpered as she pulled the car off the street she probably wasnt more than ten blocks from the shopping center but davenport had seen the van she thought and she had to get out of it there was a bar off to the left and a man was walking out toward a lonely orange pickup truck that appeared to have been handpainted she pulled in beside it said you stay down hear or ill fuckin kill you she pulled herself out of the truck felt her feet mushing as though she were wading in pudding realized that one shoe was full of blood that her butt was wet with it and dragged her leg around the back of the truck to the driversside door where the man was just getting in she came up and he said a little startled hello and she pointed the gun at him and said get in oh hell yes he got in and she said crawl across make it fuckin snappy he crawled across and she said drop the keys on the drivers seat he did and she shot him in the head and he fell back dead against the window she shouted at the minivan i told you to fuckin stay down and fired another silenced shot through the vans window shattering glass but hitting nothing else and as the mother cried out rinker crawled into the truck fired it up backed it out and started away three blocks out watching the mirrors she hadnt seen any sign of davenport she took a corner and stayed on back streets driving a checkerboard pattern away from the shopping center once down a larger street she saw the lights of a squad car flashing back toward the shopping center and she crawled on she thought about trying to make it back to honus johnsons but then realized that they had the benz and theyd be over there she had to do something a wave of nausea crawled through her on the front edge of a bigger wave of pain and she thought im shot jesus im shot she didnt remember hearing a shot but she remembered falling down and then seeing davenport a stop sign came up and she stepped on the brakes a little too firmly and the dead man beside her slumped forward into the footwell another wave of nausea she realized that even if she wanted to go to johnsons she wouldnt make it had to find a place had to think lucas ran until the van turned out of sight then ran some more pulling his phone from his pocket as he ran called sally to tell her about the van but sally didnt answer the phone and he ran some more and called mallard who did answer and told him about the van and he heard the choppers lifting higher and then one moved over him and hit him with the spotlight and he waved it off and it held him for another ten seconds as he waved frantically and then it drifted away nothing was working he never saw the van after it turned and finally a cop car caught up with him and he flagged it down and the cop had no idea that anything was going on but got on his radio and nobody he called knew what was going on but lucas got a lift back to the shopping center where an ambulance was screaming out of sight and sally covered with blood said the guy in the garage was shot in the ear and was squirting blood and i and i and i okay okay lucas said shes in a dodge van a dark van maybe dark blue mallard came up and said a woman in a van theres a woman in a van at a bar who said her husband was shot lets go lucas said thats her and they went roaring off in two more cop cars a night for roaring off lucas thought and on the way sally said you hit rinker hard i saw her go down and theres blood all over the place shes gonna bleed to death if she doesnt get to a hospital what color was the blood what what color was the blood dark or bright red or was there any green stuff in it just purple why real bright red is lungs but i dont think i hit her that high green is guts if its nothing but purple it may just be meat if its just meat she could stay out if i hit her anyplace in the body cavity though shell need a hospital im shooting speer lawman jhps at the bar the mother had collapsed and the young girl seemed to be drifting toward a trance state lucas said we gotta get these people to a hospital and the bartender said ambulance on the way and sally told the woman your husbands not dead hes on the way to the hospital but hes not hurt bad he was only shot in the ear and hes gonna be okay the woman shook her head and curled into a tighter ball lucas stepped away and looked down the street and said were losing her we had her were losing her right now mallard pulled together all the local police forces and had them do a grid search starting around the shopping center checking parked cars any car that looked unusual or outoftheway looking for blood the id came back on the benz and they went for honus johnsons house and pounced on it with a full entry crew but there was nobody home nobody alive they eventually found johnson in the freezer and the california car in the garage and they got rinkers clothes and her guns but no money no passport no paper mallard frenzied crazy said im not sure where were at it all comes down to how hard you hit her i cant tell you that lucas said i knocked her down and she got right back up i might have hit her in her left leg because she was dragging a leg but im not sure lot of blood sally said again lot of blood they went after treena ross but when rinker shouted cops she hadnt immediately dumped the phone shed used it to call her attorney and her attorney had come down to the hospital where mallards agents had picked her up when mallard lucas and sally showed up at the hospital the attorney said to mallard is it true that you were eavesdropping on conversations between my client and myself they had been of course theyd stayed on the phone from the time rinkers call came in through the call to the attorney mallard had nodded and said yes thats a violation of bullshit i have a law degree sir and it wasnt a violation of anything if your client doesnt wish to tell us what really happened inside that dome tonight well see thats shes charged with premeditated murder and well recommend that the state seek the death penalty so what do you want to do charge her the attorney said or we walk now either way she says nothing then well charge her thats certainly your privilege they smiled at each other nodded and mallard said ill go make the call later that night he said to lucas i dont think well get treena we were focused on rinker and we didnt process her right we didnt keep her under control what happened well we got the phone and she says the phone was her husbands she was carrying it because he was wearing a tux and didnt have a place for it and we took tape samples from her hands and arms looking for nitrites and didnt find any i think she used a plastic bag or a piece of cloth to cover her hand and sleeve when she fired the gun she was wandering around in the hospital before we put a hold on her she was in the ladies room and she might have flushed it she had nitrites on her face but she says that rinker fired the pistol right past her so they would be there smeared prints on the gun grip clear ones on the barrel and at least one of the good ones belongs to rinker wellthoughtout for a long time mallard agreed for weeks and they pulled it off if we take her to trial theyll have rinkers gun theyll have rinkers blood on the glass theyll have our whole investigation and chase with rinker and rossll say the phone calls went to her husband all weve got is that last phone call and rinker called her unfortunately and i listened to the tape all doubletalk i mean it sounds good to me but it wont be enough it especially wont be enough when they get rosss character into it and they show that the third wife was killed in an unsolved hitandrun lucas was convinced so treenas out of it he nodded yes and she knows it if she had any little thing about rinker maybe we could deal with her especially since were not going to get her anyway mallard shook his head shes not gonna deal the whole thing was i feel like a moron thats what i feel like lucas as soon as we clean up here im going to malones funeral and then im going home for a while and just sit and think what about rinker fuck her i hope she dies of blood poisoning rinker got on and headed southwest drove for fifteen minutes before the pain dragged her off the highway feeling faint she took an exit at random spotted a hotel turned into its parking lot and parked the truck she pressed the dead man into the footwell found an army blanket behind the seat and threw it over him then moving ever so slowly she did a survey of her assets she had money id two passports both good a black wig and a hole in her butt that continued to bleed she also had a small toolbox a battered leather briefcase and a brown sack with a grease spot that might have contained a lunch she had a dayold newspaper when the dead man rolled off the passenger seat hed exposed a copy of the postdispatch the news section looked unread and rinker had heard that unread newspaper pages were virtually sterile she pulled out the middle section ripped then unbuckled her slacks touched the wound a few times wasnt sure she should be pleased or frightened that she couldnt feel much other than the basic pain then in the light of the trucks overhead lamp made eightinchsquare pads of newsprint and pressed them onto the wound digging into the toolbox for a roll of duct tape she wrapped her leg and thigh with half the roll of tape an awkward unprofessional mess but it held she felt sleepy and that worried her even with the pain in her butt starting to come on she felt sleepy struggled to stay up dug into the briefcase and found a cell phone everybody had a cell phone she took the mans wallet out and looked at his id and the cards inside a couple of notes no pictures she checked his left hand no wedding band single she thought maybe nobody to come looking right away fought the sleep kept coming back to the cell phone finally she decided she had no choice one more risk to run she dialed got an interrupt and wound up talking to an operator before she got it right then she dialed again and heard it ring and then a mans voice said si she switched to spanish this is cassie mclain may i speak to papa they talked for less than a minute and then rinker hung up and after a few moments as she reconstructed it later she passed out she woke again later terribly thirsty but there was no water in the truck and when she moved a wave of pain tore at her that goddamn davenport hed shot her in the back while she was running away hed had no call to do that she wasnt even looking at him she passed out again and only woke when a bright light hit her in the eyes a man said in spanish are you alive yes i have a car hed had to lift her out of the truck and place her in the front seat of his cadillac the front seat was covered with plastic garbage bags so she wouldnt make a mess when hed transferred her shed passed out again just for a moment and when she came to he was wiping his bands on paper towels still alive yes but very weak now where are we going carbondale illinois maybe two hours ive never been there what time is it five oclock the sun is just coming up and she passed out again some time later the man backed into a onecar garage in carbondale woke rinker who was only fuzzily aware of it and carried her into a house and put her facedown on a firm bed a mans voice said im going to give you a shot the feds wouldnt have found the orange pickup for a week if the hotel hadnt been feuding with a pancake house the pancake houses parking lot was too small so people parked in the hotel lot and the hotel people got pissed and required guests to put parking tickets behind the windshields of their cars if a car sat too long without a ticket it was towed the orange truck didnt have a ticket and the hotel security guard had seen it parked in the lot when he came in that morning so in the middle of the afternoon he finally checked lucas went out with mallard and they looked at the dead man in the footwell and at the bloodsoaked front seat and talked to the cop whod decided that it might be related whoever was driving was shot in the butt in the left cheek and it wasnt the dead guy and i saw your bolo this morning and thought id better have my guys give you a call done good lucas said he looked around the question is whered she go from here no blood on the ground the cop said the local crimescene crew had taped off the area and were going over it looking for anything relevant she probably didnt walk because she was really pumping it the seat is soaked with blood somebody else then she grabbed another car mallard asked lucas shook his head no she got help why would she grab another car this one was good enough and grabbing another car would just be another problem with no predictable outcome especially if shes wounded so shes hiding got more friends than we thought lucas said your report said she didnt have any and now we know of two who were willing to risk their lives on her yeah well ill write a memo they walked around watching the crimescene people for a while but mallards attention was drifting and finally he asked you getting out of town lucas nodded i have no more ideas i mean i do but none are relevant at the moment coming to malones funeral nope wouldnt help her and would bum me out worse than i already am i liked her sod i mallard said he slapped lucas on the back lets go when rinker woke up she was lying facedown on a white sheet her legs were spread a bit as were her arms and her cheek was wet drool she realized she tried to move but found her arms and legs restrained near panic she pulled her head up and saw a piece of paper a few inches from her eyes it said in large block letters call out hey she called her voice weak hey and a womans voice from somewhere else said coming and a second later a brownfaced woman with a red dot in the middle of her forehead squatted up beside the bed her face a few inches from rinkers youre taped down so you couldnt roll over and pull the saline out the woman said we didnt have anything better let me get the tape there was a strippingtape sound and one hand came free then her left foot then her right foot and her right hand she started to turn saw the saline bottle on a hook over her head and the woman put a hand on her shoulder dont move too much she said youre all taped up and youve had some analgesics but its going to hurt do you have to urinate rinker thought about it and shook her head no but i could use a drink of water how long have i been here you got here this morning this is the afternoon about four oclock my husband is a doctor at the university and this is our house how bad the woman smiled sympathetically its never good but the wound was confined to your buttock she enunciated buttock perfectly with a bit of a british accent and rinker nearly smiled it reminded her of a favorite monty python so it will hurt and even when you are healed you might not be able to run as fast or climb as quickly as you once did and of course there is cosmetic damage there will be a scar but you are in no danger now thank you very much rinker said the woman nodded but said nothing more and after a minute rinker asked so what do i do just lie here with my butt in the air until it heals youll have to uh lie there for a while certainly we have been told to purchase a television set and some video games if you wish to have them a tv would be good rinker said i dont need the games can i prop myself up you can but i promise you its better to lie flat the woman said then she said my name is rayla my husband is geoffrey he will be back soon and well go to best buy for the television could i get water oh my goodness yes i forgot rayla said jumping up would you like juice we have papaya mango would you like a fish sandwich do you have an internet connection yes we do geoffrey was a charming man but she could never quite figure out how old he was something between twentyfive and fortyfive she thought he had a smooth brown oval face and a soft manner that fit well with a doctor but not so well as an accomplice to major crime they never talked about crime though he knew who she was and called her clara rather than cassie he said that the costs of her care had been fully funded he brought in a television with a dvd player and for three days she watched tv and thought about things on the fourth day she made her first trip away from the bedpan to the toilet where she learned how hard it was for a woman to pee while sitting on one but tock and holding the other one carefully clear everything got squished together on the sixth day she started a rehab program that featured five colors of rubber tubing that geoffrey brought home from the hospital she had to stretch against the rubber tubes and could barely move the thinnest size after a week when she was feeling stronger and the thinnest tube wasnt stiff enough he moved her to the next size and again he could barely move her leg as she waited to heal and practiced walking she watched tv and roamed the internet and thought about things some more she thought about paulo and the baby the recovery process was quicker easier than the recovery in mexico but the smells and the pain brought paulo back and the baby she thought about those bad years the years shed always tried to blank out when her brother and her stepfather were abusing her abusing her and comparing notes on how well shed done shed run away and shed tried dancing nude and shed been raped by a fat man and shed killed that man with a tball bat and then shed been picked up by john ross whod taught her to kill for money and shed saved her money and had bought a bar and had been successful and had gone to college to try to understand herself shed learned about herself in school she might have avoided all this if the killing hadnt been so easy and profitable she never thought about the dead people she only thought about the money it had seemed like her right to kill after all that had happened to her then davenport shed feared the federal people in a theoretical way like you fear dying in a plane accident ross and his friends had heard rumors that there was a file on her but that the file was almost empty then davenport had come along and somehow had screwed everything shed lost her bar lost a friend almost lost her life shed been driven to mexico and the disaster that followed nothing theoretical about davenport she didnt cry about it she might have but she didnt she set her jaw and she thought about davenport she knew something about him one solid fact shed have to heal before she did anything but she had time and a half weeks to be exact a saturday in october davenport was the devil and had to be dealt with five the bride was blushing in white and big as a house and finally said she had to go off to the bathroom to get the goddamn leg strap right sloan lucass oldest friend on the police force leered at her and said so you show a little leg youre among friends she said dont hold your breath pervertboy and went off into the back shouting over her shoulder and dont start without me lucas waiting at the back of the church pulled at the collar of his dress shirt plucked at his tie del had been in the whatd he call it the nave the main part of the church drinking what lucas hoped was a cream soda now he came up and asked nervous of course im fuckin nervous whatd you think lucas snapped then quickly sorry im not sure this is gonna work out i thought about it all night i was one inch from canceling the whole thing he looked at his watch and said one minute wheres that fuckin marcy sloan said she just went down to the can and lucas said to del i met this guy down in st louis who told me about this time he had to wear a tux and it kept dragging his jockey shorts up the crack of his ass and i swear to god right now rose marie roux the chief of police went by and said i think im more nervous than you are lucas grinned at her a tight grin if i was losing my job next week id be nervous too what if something happens and queers the deal with the state one big lawsuit thats what would happen del prompted him the guys shorts kept dragging up his ass lucas tried to pick it up and said yeah and he said swanson an old homicide dick came by and said this is the most fuckedup wedding ive ever been to and my wifes family is a bunch of polacks thank god your wife isnt sloan said where in the fuck is the bride lucas snarled tom black a semicloseted gay homicide detective came out of the nave and said look at the women in there theyre having a great time theyre gonna be breaking out in fistfights if you couldnt get laid at this wedding you couldnt get laid del said then he glanced sideways at rose marie and said no offense no problem the chief said taking a drag on a fresh marlboro cuts both ways wheres that fuckin sherrill lucas barked christ what your earpiece is hanging down your neck sloan said thing is covered with somebody elses ear wax lucas said looker j ing at the earpiece he plugged it in and saw marcy sherrill coming where in the hell gun wasnt working out i thought id hold it like this like a little black clutch purse she said holding her revolver in both hands like youre gonna need that lucas said then he turned and shouted into the nave all right people were gonna do this everybody sit tight unless youre part of the porch group then to the people gathered around him everybody ready porch people porch people lets do it reverend lead the way del put down the bottle of what lucas hoped was cream soda adjusted his choir robe picked up a cigar box which everybody agreed looked a lot like a bible the prayer books had been locked up by some mistake and led the way through the churchs double doors marcy all in bridal white her revolver clutched like a purse put her arm through lucass arm pulled it tight and said i always dreamed of this day and lucas said enjoy it while it lasts man you look like fuckin moby dick you look a little like shamu the killer whale yourself she said i think its the black and white that does it the trouble in st louis seemed almost like a dream treena ross had been indicted for her husbands murder and the local cops had chased down every story of an injured woman that they could find three days after ross went down lucas returned to the twin cities and the whole episode drifted off into the past another complicated memory mostly bad weather had been happy to get him back the wedding planning had been completed the invitations ordered and the house had taken a big step toward completion getting through daily life pushed aside any speculation about clara rinker though lucas was careful not to pattern himself clara he thought would come sooner or later hed half expected her to call as she had after their last collision but she hadnt the silence intensified his apprehension rinker sat behind the wheel of the red jeep cherokee and looked across the valley at the front of the church a halfmile away a beautiful view she thought in the brilliant sunlight with the pale blue skies the white new england style village church sitting on the edge of the valley surrounded by maple trees in blazing orange fall foliage with strips of yellow aspen above and below the clutch of maple around the church a place to get married she thought theyd been in there for a while she looked at her watch forty minutes now what were they doing maybe theyd written long vows or something as she was thinking that the church doors popped open and a man stepped out into the sunshine and then two more a woman in white go she grunted she pulled the cherokee out of the notch in the trees and turned down the narrow blacktopped street there was another notch a hundred and fifty yards out from the front of the church but on a busier street she wouldnt have been able to wait as it was she was taking a risk shed wrapped the rifle in a blanket and shed simply pull over to the side of the road as if she were having a problem and then shed walk back into the line of bushes and take her shot and drop the rifle and go the car to the curb hopped out grabbed the blanket and carried it past a bush to the steel barrier that overlooked the creek at the bottom of the slope she could still be seen from the road but again shed have to be unlucky she was moving fast now looking at the penguins on the porch step the guys in black and white standing stiffly beside the woman in white at the center and the priest she lifted the rifle and slipped the safety and pulled down on the porch rinker never felt death coming for her she never felt pain never saw a shining light leading her away death came without a whisper and she was gone her backup car was a halfmile away shed be in the second car and traveling in a few seconds more than one minute after she fired the shot shed timed it shed done all her research shed monitored the startribune on the net had found davenports wedding announcement along with a couple of pieces in the local gossip columns shed confirmed it with the church and then had scouted the church and above the church she found a snipers nest as though it had been created for that specific purpose the only little piece of dissonance was that she thought she remembered davenport saying that the wedding would be in an episcopalian church and this one was a lutheran but maybe she misremembered besides it had all been confirmed now it was all coming together the shooting point was just up ahead a stand of oaks next to the guardrail over the valley she jerked marcy reached up and tapped her earpiece and lucas looked at her irritated and said its not and then other radio people began shouting a weird mishmash of language everybody with an earpiece looked up at the valley wall into the notch and saw a green coat and then heard the shot a hard sharp whap then silence and then a lone mans voice in the earpiece harsh but steady shes down rinkers down lucas could hardly believe it he gaped at the hole in the trees the snipers nest so carefully cultivated and saw people running toward it people with guns then black began yelling something and they all ran for their cars or waddled in the case of lucas sherrill and del who were wrapped in body armor sloan drove lucass tahoe and lucas in the backseat pulled off his jacket and shirt and struggled out of the armor marcy was saying goddamnit undo me undo me her dress was held on in the back with velcro and lucas pulled it down and helped her out of the armor straps underneath it she was wearing a tshirt and shorts anything more had made her look too big she said throw me my stuff and lucas tossed a pair of jeans and a longsleeved shirt to her and pulled his own shirt back on marcy said to sloan dont look but sloan looked anyway and said hell youve got underpants theyre no different than a swimming suit and she said yes they are theyre intimate and you looked for which i will get you and sloan said yeah but if i didnt look youd be insulted shut up everybody lucas grated marcy was about to come back with something snappy but looked at his eyes and shut up and finished dressing and sloan drove they had to go almost a halfmile to cross the valley and the creek then a halfmile back to cover the hundred and fortyeight yards between the best shooting spot and the churchs porch where the wedding party had posed lucas was churning both excited and sick a strange dread that had settled over him when he first walked out on the church steps when they arrived at the road above the creek a halfdozen st paul cops were clustered along the barrier with two minneapolis cops including an iowa kid whod become the departments designated hitter he was carrying a rifle over his shoulder a personally modified remington mm magnum he was a gun freak the iowa boy lucas might have worried about that peculiar interest if he wasnt a little bit that way himself they climbed out of the tahoe still tucking and buttoning and lucas walked toward the form of the redheaded woman on the ground a small body in a patagonia jacket and jeans now absolutely still a purple stain on the jacket between the shoulder blades she looked very small and very quiet he thought like a poisoned chipmunk the iowa kid said i had to take her she was moving too fast if id waited one more second she would have shot one of you guys okay lucas said he squatted next to rinkers face and took a good look thats her he said he stood up thats her was shaking her head but then she looked up a questioning look crossing her face and then she said jesus lucas youre all teared up are you okay ah its just the fuckin allergies or something he said he wiped his eyes with the heels of his hands man clara rinker huh clara rinker more people were arriving to take a look black stuck out his hand but lucas pretended not to see it and moved away rose marie clutched his upper arm then let go del said goddamn goddamn a few minutes after the shooting lucass cell phone rang and he plucked it out of his pocket and heard mallards voice she didnt show did she yeah she did lucas said looking back at the growing cluster around the body shes dead a long silence at the other end then mallard his voice hushed asked you arent joking no she showed right in the slot we had no time to take her our sniper nailed her from up on the ridge single shot centerofmass looks like it clipped her spine and heart more silence then oh fuck silence then are you okay im fine she never got a shot off thats not what i meant yeah yeah listen let me get back to you were still standing here we got stuff lucas was watching the crimescene team when marcy came up marcy liked to fight but never looked happy around a body she rinker was buried in st louis treena ross who was out on bail and who would probably never go to trial took charge of the funeral no way shes gonna be buried in flyspeck or whatever its called she told lucas in a phone call she hated that place well bury her here and the people from the warehouse can come and say goodbye lucas was of two minds about going but finally on the morning of the funeral flew into lambert and was picked up by andreno who insisted on carrying lucass bag out to the car and said this is the most amazing thing i ever heard of davenport i couldnt believe it when you called the funeral was done from a funeral home chapel with treena rosss unitarian minister presiding mallard was walking across the parking lot when they pulled in and he waited for them end of a part of my life mallard said i looked for her for ten years this will be the first time ive ever seen her when i knew it was her i didnt know that time in wichita he and andreno stepped toward the chapel but lucas hung back ill wait for you guys here i dont want to see her and i dont want to hear what the minister says youre just gonna stand here andreno asked ill go to the cemetery lucas said i gotta go in mallard said he sounded glum so i can see for myself you okay andreno asked yeah but different i keep thinking it was worth the trade malone for all the people who wont be killed who might not be killed but i dont feel that way malone was malone all those other anonymous people are just police reports lucas said lucas waited in andrenos car with the windows down october and still too warm in st louis but then it was warm in st paul too almost seventy the day before twenty people came to see rinker buried and lucas suspected that there were st louis fbi agents somewhere out on the edges making movies he didnt care about that he just wanted to get it done when mallard and andreno finally came out of the funeral home chapel andreno said wasnt bad they all three rode to the cemetery together and mallard asked lucas whyd you come i kind of liked her lucas said all the time ive been a cop ive divided assholes into two groups people who were assholes because they wanted to be people who made themselves into assholes and people who were made that way by life rinker never had a chance but she kept trying you sound like national public radio mallard said they fell into the short line of cars going to the cemetery fuck a bunch of public radio lucas said rinker was twisted and tortured by people a hell of a lot worse than she ever was and nobody did anything about it and she was probably getting out of it when we came along i think if shed never come to minneapolis shed probably be out of it now andreno shook his head ross never would have let her get out if shed tried to get out hed have had her killed the first chance he got they rode along for a while then mallard said youre really bummed out lucas i bum myself out i keep thinking that for everything that was bad in the woman there were all these good things and one of the good things was she was a romantic she believed in love and marriage and babies and working hard and standing on your own you know why we got her because she could never have seen that somebody would be cynical enough to fake his own wedding for the sole purpose of setting her up to be killed you didnt exactly yes i did i thought that if she showed there was maybe a two percent chance of taking her alive i set her up to be killed and she was more silence then mallard said good fuck her she killed malone and thats your last word on it it is fuck her youre a hard man andreno said and he wasnt smiling at the graveside the mourners dropped dirt on the coffin while lucas mallard and andreno hung back treena ross cried wiping her nose with a big white hanky she was still crying when the service ended and people began to drift away she walked past lucas and mallard as they headed to their car and she called hey fbi they looked at her and she said i was never that stupid you know lucas nodded and couldnt suppress an acknowledging smile we know when everybody else was gone lucas and andreno dropped handfuls of dirt on rinkers coffin at the bottom of the grave mallard watched he hadnt had much to say after lucass pronouncements on rinker and when lucas and andreno came away from the grave site he said ill leave you here ive got a ride downtown okay they shook hands and mallard said you done good lucas you ever need a job ill call lucas said andreno dropped him back at the airport and said well im probably not as bummed out as you are because i never knew her but im gonna have a hard time getting back to the fuckin golf course you ever do any undercover work lucas asked andrenos eyebrows went up from time to time i make a real good traveling salesman for some reason you know about my new job you could be getting a call andreno nodded and said lucas id owe you more than i could tell you back in st paul that night weather asked if he were feeling better hed been shuffling around with his hands in his pockets hangdog and moody shed been playing something light on the piano maybe chopin and hed been watching the tag end of a meaningless football game im okay really he said okay for the real wedding sure two weeks im up for it and the house the house is looking good if we could just get the goddamn parquet guys to put in the trim calm down yeah he took a deep breath and exhaled looked up at her perched on the arm of the couch i wouldnt want to do this again run into another rinker i dont think there could be another rinker weather said she bounced and smiled and said ouch what the kid just kicked me lucas put a hand on her belly matt or maybe sam new testament or old emilie spelled with an ie like the french do or annie with an ie like the english but never clara never clara lucas said claras gone
