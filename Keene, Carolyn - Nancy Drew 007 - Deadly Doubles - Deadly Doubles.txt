chapter one when is that phone going to ring nancy drew stalked out of her bedroom and across the hotel suites living room she paused in the doorway of the bedroom on the far side where her two best friends were unpacking its twenty minutes to two right now george fayne said groaning she glanced from her watch to her cousin bess marvin who was sharing the room with her if that woman doesnt phone in the next two minutes were going to miss the opening tennis match it was a hot summer afternoon half an hour earlier bess george and nancy had checked into the twobedroom suite at the alexandria virginia hotel george an avid athlete had recently been concentrating on her tennis game and at her urging the other two had come with her to watch the international womens semipro tennis tournament it was being held at loudon college not far from washington dc senator kilpatrick did phone at one as she promised nancy said the desk clerk gave me the message it wasnt her fault we got caught in all the airport traffic marilyn kilpatrick was an old lawschool friend of nancys father when she had heard from him that nancy and her friends were going to be in alexandria she had asked nancy to run an errand for her and nancy had felt that she couldnt very well say no if she said shell call back and asked me to wait shell call nancy added traffic jams wouldnt have been a problem if wed flown down yesterday the way we planned george pointed out instead of going to that meettheplayers party last night we were still in river heights waiting for your topsecret phone call from the senator she pulled off the khaki shirt shed worn for traveling and tossed it onto her bed you know something im beginning to have a lot more sympathy for ned nickerson sympathy for ned nancy exclaimed frowning why then her brow cleared oh you mean because he wasnt able to come to the tournament with us no she means because even ned cant be sure that a mystery wont mess up plans youve made bess put in only half laughing right george began rummaging in her suitcase for a tennis crewneck im sure its great for ned to be famous detective nancy drews numero uno guy but never knowing when a mysterys going to spoil a romantic moment must drive him crazy nancys blue eyes twinkled ned manages and look whos talking about making boyfriends feel insecure bess small blond and curvy was famous for the speed with which she collected and then dropped goodlooking boys ned knows hes my main man in any language nancy went on more seriously but why do i have to keep telling you that senator kilpatricks errand has nothing to do with a case is that why youve been carefully avoiding telling us what it is about george asked bluntly nancy reddened all at once senator kilpatricks warning rang in her ears tell no one the senator had said despite the muggy summer heat nancy felt a chill bess gave her an odd look but changed the subject deftly that numero uno bit means george is brushing up on her spanish in case she meets that central american tennis star the tv reporters are making such a fuss about teresa montenegro isnt central american shes from san carlos george corrected her thats in south america and shes not a star not yet nobody outside of san carlos has had a chance to see her play till now but shes supposed to be really great i cant wait to watch her if we ever get there you mean bess began to wriggle into a lavender knit miniskirt then she giggled ten to one nancys mystery interferes come off it you two nancy protested managing a laugh im meeting somebody to pick up something for the senator and thats all suuure george drawled the ladys only got an office and a staff in dc right across the river from here but she absolutely had to talk to nancy drew last night and shes positively got to have nancy and nobody but nancy run this errand and theres no mystery involved whore you trying to kid this is a simple job quick and easy and no mystery nancy shook her head vigorously hoping her redgold hair hid her blush as she remembered senator kilpatricks words on the phone last night find a way to get into the locker rooms but dont let anyone find out what youre doing the real mystery nancy continued is why bess marvin whos allergic to exercise is in such a hurry to see a tennis tournament if it were a mens tournament wed understand george agreed she looked at her cousin who was knotting a bright print shirt at her midriff i suppose you think thats a tennis outfit she added rolling her eyes youre here to watch the tournament and pick up tennis pointers im here to watch the tournamentwatchers bess said unruffled if you must know im looking for a better grade of boyfriend one with something in the brains department nancys eyes met georges with shared amusement besss most recent great loves had been a rock musician and a skier falling for a brain would be a nice change you two take a cab out to the tournament nancy said generously itll be my treat ill drive the rental car out and meet you just as soon as senator kilpatrick has called that way you wont miss anything really great bess dashed out of the bedroom taking a brief look in the mirror as she passed it if i gain one more pound i wont be able to get into this skirt again she said mournfully worry about that later george said i want to get out there and see teresa montenegro see you later nancy okay sure nancy answered absently as the two girls left the mention of teresa montenegro the san carlos player had made last nights conversation and her own secret mission flash vividly back into her head secret mission what made me think that nancy wondered startled her friends were right she did have mysteries on the brain nancy crossed the suite and went into her bedroom she stared at her reflection in the bureau mirror only half seeing it the small travel clock shed set beside the bed ticked loudly two oclock a quarter after half past when the phone on the bedside table finally rang nancy leaped for it so quickly that the little clock went crashing to the floor senator kilpat a womans voice interrupted evenly miss nancy drew this is senator kilpatricks office calling the senator has asked me to tell you the meet has been postponed until nine oclock this evening same instructions as before you are to contact the senator immediately afterward and report what happened thank you the phone went dead not a meeting the meet that was government talk secret service or cia talk as nancy changed clothes rapidly her mind reviewed the instructions senator kilpatrick had given her pick up your special pass at the hotel desk i sent it over by messenger its a government pass and it should get you through security and into the womens locker room if the guards give you a hard time have them call my office but it would be better if you could get in there without anyone noticing your father says you have a blue denim miniskirt i imagine you have a plain white tshirt dont you wear that and do you have some kind of distinctive belt you can wear a bright red one yes that would be good ill see that the courier is notified that that will be your identifying mark after you receive the information packet go back to your assigned box seat and stay with your friends for the rest of the match as soon as you get back to your hotel call my office and insist on speaking directly to me ill alert my staff to connect us at once thats what the senator had said well there was no need for the special outfit till that night so nancy thrust it into a small duffel bag that she used as a purse and changed into shorts and a knit top in tennis white with a pale blue stripe then she ran out of the suite and toward the elevator if she was lucky she could just miss the commuter traffic that would soon clog the highways the elevator took nancy directly to the basementlevel parking garage soon she was out of alexandria and heading west toward the rolling virginia countryside she came to the great shopping mall at tysons corner loudon college was only a few miles farther and didnt the brochure say theres a service road to the college somewhere nancy thought the road to her right had to be it a wide dirt lane beneath a stand of towering catalpa trees soon nancy was entering the college grounds the parking lots near the stadium were filled but she finally found a space near the dirt lane she locked the car carefully and threaded her way through the acres of parked cars toward the grandstands the sun was high in the sky and a faint breeze stirred the heavy air nancy glanced at her watch she was pleased to realize that shed probably missed only part of one match she flashed her pass at a guard and asked for directions then as she turned the corner around the first of the gray stone college buildings she paused the stadium was across a road and to the left but maybe there was a shortcut through the building so she wouldnt have to take time to circle the two beyond yes nancy could see another set of glass doors on the opposite side of the ground floor she pushed open the door nearest her and started into the cool dimness se√±orita this area is players only a dark goodlooking wiry young man wearing tennis clothes caught her arm but as nancy spun around startled he let go quickly oh im sorry im the one who should be sorry i didnt know this was offlimits nancy smiled whats the best way to get to the courts for a moment the athlete just stood and looked at nancy blankly then he shrugged oh go ahead cut through here and youll get there faster just dont tell anyone i said you could do it right right nancy smiled again and pushed through the other set of doors as the doors banged shut behind her hands closed roughly on her shoulders for a split second nancy thought it was the young athlete playing a trick on her then she knew with horror that it was no trick she twisted around trying to get a look at her attacker the man thrusting a gag into her mouth was middleaged he wore a dark foreignlooking business suit so did the other two men who held her tightly it all seemed to be happening in slow motion this isnt real nancy told herself dazedly but it was real she was being kidnapped and the method was fast efficient and effective nancy struggled frantically as she was pulled into the bushes and her hands and feet were bound with ropes she was thrown like a bundle over a brawny shoulder and a concealing blanket was tossed over her nancy knew struggling was useless she went limp and concentrated hard the men were speaking spanish they were heading toward the parking lot nancy recognized the sound of the gravel they were walking on as her kidnapper swung her upright nancy caught a glimpse of the car it was a limousine long and dark and the windows were tinted glass a rear door was jerked open and nancy was thrown inside one of the men started to climb in behind her nancy kicked she kicked with both feet since her ankles were bound together and she heard an agonized groan before she could lash out again another man wrenched open a front door then he leaned over the seat back and pressed the muzzle of a gun against her forehead he snapped out some rapid orders in spanish nancy didnt understand much of what he said but suddenly a blindfold was tied around her eyes and another strip of cloth was tied around her mouth then one word came to her loud and insistent muerta that was spanish for dead the warning was terrifyingly clear chapter two nancy lay helplessly across the backseat a moment later the seat sagged one of the men had sat down next to her the gun at her forehead was shifted to her temple doors slammed an engine roared to life the limousine jerked into motion with unbelievable speed nancy held herself motionless like a crouching cat preparing to spring but she couldnt spring not yet she had to be ready she had to stay alert and not give way to panic she had to force her senses to be aware of every detail of the terrifying ride it was astonishing how much nancy could notice even with her eyes tightly bound the cars ride was very soft and springy in spite of the fact that they were hurtling along the dirt lane she figured that they were on the lane because the car was rolling across the same ruts shed driven over earlier and occasionally she could hear stones fly up to ping against the undercarriage of the car then the limousine was jerked abruptly onto a much smoother road although the windows were shut and the air conditioning was on nancy was able to hear the sound of air rushing past the windows and the zoom of other cars shooting by that must mean they were on the interstate they had turned left at the end of the lane that meant they were heading toward alexandria nancy concentrated hard counting in her head how long was the ride taking compared to her drive to the college could she estimate the cars speed and therefore the mileage the limousine came to an abrupt stop then made another left turn it was heading toward the potomac toward washington it made another turn this time to the right and was caught up in the roar of commuter traffic nancy thought they might be on route or the belt parkway then with a rush of terror nancy heard the roar of jet engines close at hand the airport theyre going to take me on a plane nancy thought with panic but the jet sounds receded a metallic rumble underneath the wheels seemed to indicate that the limousine was crossing a bridge into the capital itself the limousine rattled over cobblestones and drew to a stop a rush of fresh air and the lightening of weight on the seat told nancy that a back door had opened and her seatmate had climbed out the next thing she knew she was being dragged out and stood up something cold touched her ankles and then the ropes around them were removed still gagged and blindfolded her arms bound nancy was half pulled half pushed across an expanse of gravel and through a door footsteps echoed hollowly on cement there was an ammonia smell in the air and once when nancy stumbled her face brushed against something that felt like a cardboard carton were they in a warehouse a hand knocked on a metal door the door was opened and nancy was dragged inside the voices of nancys captors speaking in spanish became deferential theyre speaking to their boss nancy realized but what are they saying the spanish was so rapid so staccato that she could only understand one word in ten suddenly she was dragged over to a window nancy knew it was a window because she could feel the warmth of sunlight against her cheek hands grasped her face roughly turned it this way and that fingers ran through her hair abruptly she was released so abruptly that she lost her balance and fell painfully to the concrete floor before nancy could scramble away a new set of hands grabbed her somebodys knees pinned her down as her ankles were tied again this time with something cold and harsh after that nancy was ignored something was wrong she realized instantly with a cold fury her captors boss was yelling at them in rapid spanish nancy recognized one or two insults that brought hot color to her face fortunately no one seemed to notice she was virtually forgotten until suddenly she was picked up and swung like a carpet roll over somebodys shoulder again the thugs rushed nancy back outside and dumped her in the car again the car jerked to life nancy forced herself to remain alert and clearheaded but she could hear only an occasional word from her abductors at least there was no gun at her head this time or could that be because there was something worse in store how long the second ride was nancy couldnt guess she wasnt concentrating as hard as she had the first time and it seemed that the driver was retracing his route there were the sounds of traffic and the sounds of gravel then the limousine lurched off the road into what a field the car slowed a back door was opened although the car was still moving nancys bound hands were pulled away from her body roughly something hard and cold touched them something stung her flesh a knife but it wasnt meant to hurt her it was cutting her bonds suddenly with brutal force nancy was pulled up and then pushed toward the open door she fought back with her freed hands bracing her feet against the back of the front seat voices were raised in spanish one phrase leaped out they could be twins then a hand pushed the hollow of nancys back with professional accuracy she fell rolling and jouncing onto hard ground that seemed to leap up to meet her doors slammed and the car roared away nancy was rolling and rolling over rocks and grass at least she wasnt on a road she didnt try to stop herself until she was sure the limousine was far away then shaking she sat up as best she could and pulled the blindfold off her eyes she was sitting in the middle of a field and above a rim of evergreens rose the banner of loudon college nancys heart which had been pounding began to calm down at least her captors had had the decency to return her to where she had been snatched from clearly it had been a case of mistaken identity but who could the intended victim have been it was not the time to think about that the sun was already low in the sky with stiff fingers nancy worked the handkerchief free from her mouth and spat out the gag that had been thrust inside her mouth was dry and raw and she could hardly swallow then she attacked the bonds around her ankles no wonder they had hurt they were made of thick wire the ends twisted around each other and were so tight that her ankles had already swollen slightly around them at last nancy was able to pull the wires free she folded them carefully and looked around her purse what had become of her purse the dark blue pouch with its shoulder strap lay only a few yards away so it too had been thrown out of the car nancy tried to scramble to her feet but her legs wouldnt hold her the welts where the wires had been throbbed agonizingly she crawled over to the small duffel bag and zipped it open her eyes narrowed the bag had been searched nancy knew very well she had put her car keys in her change purse but she pawed through her bag and found them loose on the bottom those men seemed like pros but they were either new at this or careless she thought nothing inside the purse had been taken nancy stowed the wires gags and blindfold inside and zipped the bag carefully then with difficulty she pulled herself up by holding on to a nearby tree i have to make sure i look all right before i see anybody she decided if she walked slowly she could manage gingerly nancy made her way out of the field and then along the lane and through the parking lots leaning against cars for support she checked her watch and was startled to see that it was only a quarter to five the afternoon tennis matches were still going on a glance at her reflection in a glass door brought nancy up short she was a mess she was looking in the same door shed gone through an eternity earlier and she saw what shed missed before steel letters on the wall beside the doors hollins gymnasium this must be where the players dress and if theres a locker room there are showers nancy thought with relief she opened the door the two security guards she saw scrutinized her government pass carefully before waving her on nancy made her way along the empty corridors until she found the locker room and the showers safely in one of the stalls nancy pulled the heavy plastic curtain shut and stripped off her clothes she showered quickly trying to keep her hair dry then bathed her injured ankles in cold water for several minutes afterward she dried off with a towel shed grabbed from the supply table and dressed again fortunately shed been wearing cotton socks and when she pulled them up the swelling in her ankles didnt show much after applying a dab of lip gloss nancy made her way outside forcing herself to walk as normally as possible nancy went slowly toward the tennis courts she followed some other spectators down a flagstone path to the entrance gate then she saw something that made her stop abruptly she was so startled that it took a few moments before she realized what the woman at the gate was asking what oh yes i have a boxseat ticket its here somewhere even as nancy searched through her purse and handed over her ticket for the afternoon matches she was staring at the large display board next to the entranceway it was covered with pictures of tournament players one of them was an action shot of a player leaping into the air to return a lob except for a difference in tennis style and slightly darker hair the girl in the photograph could have been a mirror image of nancy herself the realization struck nancy all at once she had been snatched coming out of the players dressing area wearing clothes that could easily have been mistaken for a tennis outfit she had been kidnapped in error mistaken for someone else and that person very likely was the young athlete pictured flying into the air to smash back her opponents shot nancy the loud voice was unmistakably georges and right on top of it came besss nancy where have you been we were worried sick her two friends were hurrying toward her from the grandstand bess has been having a fit george said anxiously especially after we phoned the hotel and the woman at the desk said she thought youd left a couple of hours ago what happened around them people were staring curiously something came up tell you about it later nancy said quickly it wasnt the place to share her experience particularly if her suspicions were true the best place for nancy and her friends was in their box seats where theyd be in full view of the crowd and where nancy would have a good view she intended to keep a sharp eye out for the reappearance of her kidnappers lets go watch the tournament she said brightly how much have i missed any cute guys around bess nancy hoped the question would divert bess from any probing questions of her own never mind that right now george interrupted teresa montenegros first game will start any minute i dont want to miss it she hurried the other two to a corner aisle and up the open wooden steps to their end box boy was i glad to see you bess chattered settling into her seat with all the security guys prowling around this place i was beginning to be afraid which is pretty silly isnt it she finished laughing shh someone in the box behind them hissed loudly nancy turned toward the court her mind was racing all the security guys prowling around what did that mean as everyone else watched a wellknown american player walk briskly onto the court nancy caught georges arm and whispered the question to her because of teresa george whispered back her countrys a dictatorship you know i overheard somebody say theres been a bomb threat here nancy asked shocked george nodded there even were people picketing in front of the tennis stadium this is the first time san carlos has ever sent an athlete to an international competition some big shot from her governments coming to dc this week just to watch and a lot of people dont like it with effort nancy kept her face from betraying anything the san carlos diplomat wasnt just coming to watch teresa play he would be here to meet with senator kilpatricks topsecret committee that was what the senator had told nancy on the phone the night before all at once a roar went up from the crowd followed by loud applause a slender figure of about nancys height was walking onto the court nancy saw the girls eyes flick back and forth apprehensively as she moved past the rows of spectators her light brown shoulderlength hair caught the last rays of the sinking sun thats teresa montenegro george said excitedly hey she looks a little like you nan dont you think her mother was irish you know thats where teresa got her light hair and blue eyes as george chattered on a chill ran down nancys spine she had never seen teresa before but somehow she knew what she was thinking knew the way she would leap in the air to return a highbouncing shot and knew why she was afraid teresa montenegro was the girl in the photograph the girl who was the image of nancy drew chapter three nancy this is incredible bess suddenly exclaimed turning to nancy teresa montenegro is almost your exact double almost nothing george said now that i look closely she could be your twin sister nancys gaze never left teresa as she responded we look enough alike to confuse anyone even professional afterward nancy was able to remember very little of that first match she watched teresa play her eyes were too busy scanning the crowd for possible threats her mind was too busy piecing things together first im abducted and then im dumped because a mistake was made nancy thought no thats not first first theres senator kilpatrick and her mysterious committee and the senators calling me to do a secret errand then the snatching now heres teresa looking like me and looking scared and the bomb threat teresa had to be the connecting link between the pieces i have to see teresa and fast nancy decided as soon as the match ended with teresa winning nancy began pushing her way out of the box before she was at the bottom of the wooden staircase george and bess had caught up with her whats going on talk george ordered not here keep up with me till we find an open space nancy started to run toward the gym with the other two close behind find out if teresas gone in there yet nancy told george who took one look at nancys taut face and obeyed without being told bess slid the binoculars off nancys arm and began to watch the approaching crowd teresas just leaving the field with a cute guy theyre walking this way she reported just as george reappeared great then we have a few minutes nancy led them a short way from the gym to a deserted patch of open lawn in a low voice and with as few words as possible she told them about her abduction and her suspicions george whistled have you called the police yet youve got to she said when nancy shook her head even if teresas not in danger somethings going on you can identify those men from the way they acted i think theyre professionals but theyre inexperienced or theyd have made sure who i was before they grabbed me it might be a good idea to let senator kilpatrick know what happened before i call the police nancy broke off her eyes narrowing teresa and her companion had reached the road they crossed it so deep in talk that neither of them looked up just as well nancy thought the cute guy was the stunning darkhaired darkeyed athlete who had let nancy cut through the gym building earlier but instead of entering the building teresa and the young man veered around it and headed toward the parking lots nancy turned to bess and george i have to warn her you two meet me back at the hotel theres a shuttle bus from here that you can take okay she sped off after teresa and her companion by the time nancy reached the parking lot the two athletes were already ahead by several rows of cars nancy saw a group of fans stop the san carlos girl for autographs almost immediately the man with her pulled her away from them then still holding her he began to run toward the next lot another abduction nancy picked up speed suddenly as they stopped beside a blue car he released teresas arm teresa abruptly turned to throw her arms around his neck nancys mind eased a little from the way the two were kissing it was clear that they were in love it was also clear that they were in a hurry and she thought teresa looked a bit frightened he unlocked the drivers door and instead of going around to unlock the other motioned for teresa to climb behind the wheel and then slide over she obeyed as the man climbed into the drivers seat nancy began to run she was able to reach her rented car and gun the motor before the athletes blue car nosed its way to the lot exit but instead of turning toward the main road it swung into the lane heading straight toward nancy it passed her and zoomed down the dirt road traveling at high speed nancy swung her car into a tight threepoint turn and took off after them the two cars bounced onto the highway and headed in the direction of alexandria soon they were swallowed up in homebound traffic nancy began a skillful game of cat and mouse trying to stay only one or two cars behind the blue car she couldnt afford either to lose them or to alarm them they passed the tysons corner shopping mall and the skyscrapers of crystal city national airport loomed ahead of her then lay behind at last the blue car was rolling exactly at the speed limit along washington street it turned a corner with a screech of the wheels and swung into the driveway of the very hotel where nancy and her friends were staying nancy followed the car into the underground garage and parked several spaces away was her raincoat still in the backseat it was she pulled it on and thrust on sunglasses they might look ridiculous but theyd keep teresas companion from recognizing her what nancy had to say to teresa she meant to say in private her hopes of getting into the elevator with the two athletes were defeated the young man pushed the close button as soon as he and teresa were inside but nancy had noticed the mirrored back wall of the elevator car and she watched which floor button he pushed hoping that the elevator would get held up at the lobby she tore up the emergency stairs and was loitering in the thirdfloor corridor as the two stepped out they hurried down the corridor and around a bend as she pretended to unlock the door to one of the rooms nancy saw them exchange a few words they seemed to be arguing teresa shook her head then she rose on tiptoe to kiss the young man hard broke off to unlock her door and slipped inside the handsome athlete strode rapidly down the hall toward nancy as soon as he passed her nancy ran to teresas room pulling her glasses and raincoat off as she did so she knocked sharply after a moment a guarded spanishaccented voice replied who is it housekeeping i have your extra towels nancy was glad shed noticed that the hotel didnt provide many she hoped that through the peephole her knit top would look like a maids uniform to teresa after what seemed like minutes nancy heard the sound of a deadbolt lock being thrown a chain clinked then the door opened wide enough for a stack of towels to be passed through nancy and teresa looked straight into each others eyes teresas expression turned from surprise to fear and then to shock as she realized the strong resemblance between them at that moment a loud yell came from the direction of the elevator it was followed instantly by the rapid fire of an automatic pistol chapter four instantly nancy shoved teresa back into her room and slammed the door shut im a detective i work for the us government nancy spoke in spanish as rapidly as she was able if she didnt quite work for the federal government working for a senator was the closest thing to it stay inside lock the door and dont open it till i come back and say its nancy its okay she saw comprehension flood teresas face and as she dashed off she heard the door lock nancy turned the corner and came to a complete stop in front of the elevator the corridors in both directions were empty the red lights on the plaque above the elevator showed that the car was going down down all the way to the garage level before it stopped it was too late to catch whoever was on the elevator nancy scooped up the house phone on the console table opposite the elevator door this is an emergency send someone from security to the third floor right away as she dropped the receiver nancy detected a faint moaning her heart pounding she traced the sound to a room scarcely fifteen feet away should she wait or take a chance if someone was wounded there was no time to lose nancy hammered on the door then tried the handle just a minute miss a heavy hand closed on nancys shoulder as she jerked around the burly man produced his badge security suppose you explain whats going on quickly nancy identified herself im a guest on the floor below i phoned for you because i heard shots right here by the elevator im sure and i just heard moaning from beyond this door theres no moaning now the house detective answered skeptically sure enough the third floor was as quiet as a tomb from the second floor are you what were you doing up here anyway visiting a friend nancy said briefly and i did hear shots rapidly nancy scanned the walls and floor around the elevator suddenly she dove beneath the console table look at this she exclaimed as she straightened up its a spent bullet a ninemillimeter isnt it the detectives eyes narrowed you heard moaning as if somebodyd been hit im not sure it was very weak but there doesnt seem to be any blood around here the detective knocked on the door security im holding my badge up to the peephole for you to see open the door or im coming in with a passkey the door opened slowly oh thank goodness ive been so frightened a small whitehaired woman said weakly i tried to call the front desk to tell them but my hands were shaking so tell them what nancy asked gently why about the kidnapping the little woman stopped gasping for air nancy steered her to a velvet chair as the detective went to the bathroom for a glass of water drink that and try to tell me im sorry maam but it may be important yes i know the woman sipped some water then went on im mrs sherman mrs john sherman from atlanta i was taking a nap before dinner and i heard pushing and shoving coming from the hall outside then somebody screamed i suppose i shouldnt have but i i opened the door a crack i was afraid it was children playing you know and that one of them was hurt so i looked out mrs sherman swallowed hard thats when the shots came and i saw three men no four one of them had the gun he was pointing it at a nice young man while the two others were shoving him into the elevator she spread her hands i would have helped him if i could but it was happening so fast they fell into the elevator and the door slammed and then i i started having a dizzy spell the detective strode to the telephone this is dixon there are a couple of patrolmen having coffee in the coffee shop get them up to room threetwentytwo pronto he ordered then he turned back to the woman and took out a pen and notepad do you think you can describe the men you saw oh my yes mrs sherman said firmly one of them was your size and the other two were a little shorter they were in their twenties i would say the bigger one the one with the gun was older they all had olive skin and one of the young ones had a small mustache the other had a scar on his face they were wearing dark pinstriped suits nancy almost gasped the descriptions fit her own kidnappers exactly and the victim dixon prodded mrs shermans eyes filled with tears he was such a nice young man one of the tennis players i think at least he wore whites and some kind of badge beautiful dark wavy hair nancy recognized the description even before the woman added ive seen him before with that tennis girl whos staying down the hall first an attempt to kidnap teresa now a successful kidnapping of her boyfriend now what do i do nancy wondered perplexed tell what i know or wait till ive talked to senator kilpatrick for all i know national security could be involved before she could decide the room exploded into action two young patrolmen arrived pushing her way between them was a forceful middleaged hispanic woman what is happening i am se√±ora ramirez chaperon for the san carlos entry in the international tennis tournament and i demand to know if there is danger i cannot allow my charge to stay here at that everybody began talking at once the police took down nancys story or as much of it as shed revealed to the man from security one of the patrolmen went up to the room on the other side of the hotel where roberto teresas boyfriend was staying detective dixon and mrs sherman tried to calm se√±ora ramirez the police demanded to see teresa se√±ora ramirez demanded that the police first provide an official spanish translator and somebody from the san carlos embassy then she took off in the direction of teresas room while the police made the necessary phone calls nancy discreetly left the room not waiting for the elevator she ran down the emergency stairs two at a time to the second floor george and bess jumped up as nancy entered another kidnapping this time its teresas boyfriend i have to call marilyn kilpatrick nancy said as she ran for the telephone before she reached it george had dug into nancys purse and brought out the telephone number the senator wasnt in her office she was in conference somewhere and whoever answered the phone did not know when or where she could be reached tell her nancy has to talk to her soon nancy said urgently she didnt feel secure about leaving a more explicit message i think youd better deal us in george said quietly as nancy put down the phone i think so too even though im not supposed to without permission nancy took a deep breath im supposed to receive a message from a courier in the hollins gymnasium locker room originally it was for this afternoon then the meeting was changed to tonight i dont know what its about but it has to do with san carlos senator kilpatrick is involved in a secret toplevel diplomatic mission george whistled do you suppose it has something to do with the attempt to kidnap teresa she asked i think so teresas staying in a room one floor above us but facing the back at least the police are with her nancy glanced out the window no theyre not those two down there by the patrol car were the ones who talked to me but theyre leaving and they dont have teresa or se√±ora ramirez with them nancy stopped thinking bess stay here in case the senator calls tell her what happened george come with me the sooner we get some answers from teresa montenegro the better nancy and george ran for the emergency stairs they were running so fast that george crashed into a dark figure who was on her way down it was se√±ora ramirez out of breath and distraught she grabbed nancy and began shouting at her in spanish please speak more slowly nancy pleaded also in spanish se√±orita montenegro she is my responsibility and she has tricked me nancy finally understood that teresa had asked her chaperon for some aspirin while the older woman was in the bathroom getting it teresa had slammed the door shut on her and run out she is going for the car i have rented i know it she took the keys well get her come on george nancy shouted they sprinted down the stairs and headed for the parking garage leaving se√±ora ramirez behind the garage was dim with shadows lit only by a few overhead bulbs and the twilight coming in through the exit and entryway split nancy whispered gesturing for george to take the left side george nodded her tennis shoes made no sound as she ran a banner hung over the center parking area it read international womens semipro tennis tournament someone was doing a good job of promotion nancy thought briefly as she threaded her way to the right lane something moved was it yes it was teresa furtively hurrying toward a car nancy started to run then all at once a car engine roared to life nearby headlights glared blindingly and nancy saw the great shape bearing down on her and on teresa with a burst of speed nancy flung herself at the girl from san carlos knocking her down teresa screamed at the same moment nancy wrapped her arms around teresa tightly and jerked to the right the two of them rolled over once twice as the car screamed by in a dark blur just inches away from them nancy george shouted here nancy called back in that split second she must have let down her guard suddenly teresa broke free kicking nancy away and leaping up as she did so the dark sedan suddenly whipped into a turn and bore down on her again with incredible power nancy scrambled to her feet but there was no way she could reach teresa in time chapter five teresa froze paralyzed in the blinding light suddenly a figure leaped into the air georges strong arms caught at the tournament banner it broke away coming down with her and was flung onto the front windshield of the sedan the car swerved crazily to the left it bounced off the front fender of a sports car and tore erratically toward the exit the banner slid off in a little heap as the sedan burning rubber roared up the ramp and then vanished suddenly the garage seemed very silent the only sound was the gasping sobs coming from teresa lying crumpled on the floor nancy and george ran to her but she shrank away from them like a wounded bird its all right im nancy nancy drew nancy murmured reassuringly stroking the hair back from teresas frightened eyes teresa nodded recognizing nancys voice there was a large bruise like a rope burn on her cheek she must have skinned it on the concrete when she fell george an expert firstaider checked teresa for other injuries no damage except bruises she reported no thanks to whoever was driving that car nancy said grimly teresa somebody tried to kidnap me this afternoon yes probably mistaking me for you she said as teresas blue eyes widened why is somebody trying to kill you teresa jerked her head away pressing her lips together georges eyes met nancys the same guy who shot at your boyfriend they got him you know george said brutally thats what the racket was in the hallway nancy told me if you wont talk to save yourself how about him were on your side she went on more gently as teresa cried out nancy can help you if youll let her nancy put her arms around teresa as she struggled to sit up find se√±ora ramirez and tell her teresas safe nancy told george in a low voice and brief the house detective his names dixon george nodded and left for a few minutes there was no sound except teresas ragged breathing dont you think you owe me at least some explanation nancy asked presently after all i almost got killed twice today because of you as she hoped that approach brought a response i am so sorry i do not know really teresa swallowed hard it is how do you say a night scare nightmare nancy supplied teresa you must think there has to be a reason no answer why were you running away from the police from your chaperon she repeated the words in spanish because teresa seemed too distraught to understand not running away roberto you said roberto is dead he cant be george didnt say that he was kidnapped probably by the same men who grabbed me there was a witness and there were shots fired roberto may have been killed but we dont know yet teresa dont you think youd better teresa was shaking her head violently no there was a phone call she stopped abruptly teresa tell me nancy needed the facts before the police showed up and chased her away teresa looked at her for a long moment then she nodded someone called she whispered not roberto it was a message from roberto in english or spanish spanish it said roberto was hurt and needed me he wanted me to come to get him where teresa gave an address in alexandria i knew se√±ora ramirez wouldnt let me go she was hired especially to watch out for me on this trip and she is very strict she thinks i should have my mind only on my tennis game so i i tricked her didnt you realize how dangerous it could be teresa just looked at nancy in my country there is always danger we have a dictatorship very harsh and often there are troublemakers from outside she shrugged roberto needs me i must go not now you cant nancy said firmly ill go as she said it she remembered with a start that she also had to meet senator kilpatricks mysterious courier soon nancy knew she needed to make sure teresa was safe then go after roberto before it was too late with relief she saw dixon and one of the policemen coming toward them well take over now the policeman said he and the house detective led teresa away nancy returned to her suite where george and bess were anxiously waiting were going with you bess said promptly when nancy described her evening plans somebody has to be here in case the senator calls ill stay this time george said what youd better do is order in some pizza for around ten oclock nancy suggested changing rapidly into the requested tshirt skirt and red belt looks as if none of us is going to get any real dinner come on bess with bess holding a map and acting as navigator nancy cruised through the factory area on the outskirts of alexandria looking for the address teresa had given either you heard her wrong or teresa was supposed to meet her boyfriend in the potomac river bess said at last maybe thats exactly what somebody had in mind nancy answered wed better head for the tournament bess go to your seat and stay there something dangerous is going on if i dont show up by ninethirty send help an amber moon was shining as they drove into the loudon college parking lots nancy was fortunate to find a space close to the gym she went with bess to the box and leaned well forward in it directly into the stream of light coming from nearby floodlights it seemed a good way to advertise her arrival to whoever was watching for a girl in a denim miniskirt and a red belt at ten minutes to nine nancy made her way to hollins gymnasium and used her pass to get in fluorescent lights glowed in the corridors but the place seemed deserted nancys running shoes squeaked spookily on the stone floors cautiously nancy entered the locker room she was glad shed been there earlier for that stolen shower she knew her way around knew the hiding places to watch out for or to take refuge in the locker room was like all locker rooms dim full of discarded clothing the smell of disinfectant and athletic equipment the sound of water dripping from a faucet somewhere nancy sat down on a gray wooden bench that gave a good view of all the doors and waited the overhead clock obeying some classsession programming rang noisily at and again at no one came at twentyfive after nine a door squeaked distantly nancy stiffened then she relaxed it was no courier apparently a match was over and players and their chaperons were returning they went directly to the shower room ignoring nancy casually nancy left the locker room and hung around for a few more minutes in the light directly outside the entrance of the gym id better get back to the box before bess sends out the marines she decided clearly something had interfered with the scheduled meet and senator kilpatrick would have found a way to notify me here if shed known nancy thought she found bess and they headed for the parking lot it was a good halfhour before they were able to get out of a traffic jam if we dont get there soon that pizzas going to be stone cold bess grumbled as they barreled toward alexandria that will ruin your appetite nancy asked absently instead of rising to the bait bess looked at nancys anxious face and remained silent when they entered the suite george made the same comment its tenfortyfive the pizzas going to taste like wallpaper paste by now and i ordered all the good stuff turns out theres a neapolitan pizza place nearby she stopped abruptly somethings gone wrong hasnt it i hope not nancy said soberly whoever was supposed to meet me didnt i dont know what scared him off any word from the senator or teresa nope george responded she went to the phone and ordered another pizza they were still eating sitting crosslegged on nancys kingsize bed when midnight came the senator wont call now nancys shoulders sagged be glad under these circumstances no news is good news george pointed out she sank her teeth into onions and pepperoni what id like to know she went on around a mouthful of cheese is why somebody snatched teresas guy just to have a reason to lure her to the garage or did they really want to get her to the river it could have been a failsafe setup nancy said thoughtfully if the first guy didnt run her down in the garage he or a buddy would have a second chance over there believe me nobodyd have known till morning that neighborhood was dead nancy shuddered at her own choice of words what id like to know is why the police arent doing anything the others stared at her think about it nancy insisted they dont know that i got snatched but they do know roberto got snatched with bullets bouncing around and that somebody tried to run teresa down in the garage george whistled i see your point have we ever known a situation like that when the place wasnt immediately crawling with cops especially considering the protests the bomb threat and the fact that a foreign sports figures involved especially considering there are topsecret talks involving the san carlos dictatorship going on nancy added silently to herself she had a lot of questions to ask senator marilyn kilpatrick at last nancy and her friends fell asleep before nancy knew it she was awakened by a brisk knocking at the main entrance to the suite nancy propped herself up on one elbow noting that the hands of her clock stood at ten minutes to six nancy jumped out of bed and ran to the door in her blue nightshirt whos there she called softly marilyn kilpatrick a distinctive familiar voice replied quickly nancy manipulated the chain and deadbolt lock and senator kilpatrick slipped inside nancy beckoned her into her bedroom sorry i didnt mean to scare you but i also didnt want to be seen coming here senator kilpatricks auburn hair was as smartly styled as always but there were circles under her dark eyes for once she looked every bit of her fortyeight years what happened last night why didnt you get the packet for me tell me quickly a lot happened and no the courier didnt meet me nancy pulled on a robe as the senator sank down in a chair in a few accurate sentences nancy briefed the politician on the events that had occurred then she looked squarely into the dark eyes you brought me into this i think ive earned the right to be told more otherwise i could make a wrong move youre right the senator walked to the window and stood looking between the cracks of the blinds that nancy had lowered then she turned there ought not to have been any danger to you or anyone else but the information exchange is far more important than ive been free to tell you what im going to tell you now i should not be saying to anyone who doesnt have top security clearance im trusting you because i trust your father it has to do with a possible revolution in san carlos doesnt it nancy guessed senator kilpatrick nodded my committee is mediating between representatives of all the different political groups in san carlos were hoping to avert a bloodbath someone were not sure whether from san carlos or an outsider does want one ive been able to arrange for some very dangerous information to be smuggled to me thats why i needed you not just because im carson drews daughter because i look like teresa montenegro nancy said yes truly i didnt think either of you would be in danger i thought that the fact that you resemble teresa would give you easy access to the gym and if anyone saw you and the courier together no one would think anything of it the pieces started to fall together roberto was the courier wasnt he she said the senator nodded again and now we dont know where either he or his smuggled information is if it falls into the wrong hands she didnt finish who is roberto really hes teresa montenegros tennis coach also her boyfriend or at least he has been for the past three months he was the one who persuaded her to sign up for this tournament hes also a leader in the underground freedom movement in san carlos i dont know whether shes aware of that he may have felt shed be safer if she wasnt senator kilpatrick paused im sure you know about the bomb threat and the protests what you dont know is that the san carlos dictatorship has drawn up a hit list on it are the names of six people now in the united states who are actively working to overthrow the current government unless i get that list and get it to the fbi within the next few days those people will start to die chapter six nancy gasped there has to be a way to protect those people cant the fbi they cant do anything without the list of names senator kilpatrick said starkly nobody can thats the terrible truth did roberto have the list on him when he was kidnapped nancy asked im sure hes too shrewd and too aware of the danger to be carrying the list till he was on his way to meet you the senator replied even then it probably wouldnt have been recognizable and readable in code nancy thought whether hed give it away after he was captured the senator stopped speaking for a moment and her face turned pale that i imagine will depend on his strength during revolutions couriers have often carried secrets with them to their graves she was talking about torture nancy felt sick arent the police doing anything to trace roberto this is a classified government matter senator kilpatrick said bluntly its not for the local police she rose however the government agencies can call on them when necessary im going to arrange for you to have a police bodyguard nancy groaned and the senators lips curved slightly he wont be obvious i think youll like him im going to request a plainclothes detective whos been assigned special duty with me before hes a gogetter just out of the police academy hell fit right in with you and your friends two things nancy said resolutely i cant keep my friends in the dark about this theyve been pulled into it theyve got to know whats happening theyre totally trustworthy theyre smart and theyre experienced at helping me but they wont be able to know how to help unless they have the whole picture after a moments thought the senator agreed whats the other thing she asked just how much danger do you think im in nancy wanted to know not much i hope youre too visible now those goons who snatched you by mistake wont try that again if theyd wanted to kill you theyd have done so then which means nancy said thinking aloud that theyre not worried about my being able to identify them theyve probably been imported from san carlos or from some other link in the terrorist network ill find out whether it would be useful for you to look at mug shots or help a police artist make a composite drawing even if the men were imports they may be known by the fbi or the cia or interpol the international police organization what do you want me to do in the meantime nancy asked do exactly what youd be doing anyway go to the tournament i have a box there myself ill meet you there and ill bring along a young staff assistant i want to fix you up with im sure you and dan can make that look authentic if required the senator rose any other questions nancy shook her head good senator kilpatrick slipped out of the suite after carefully surveying the corridor for onlookers by that time george and bess were quietly moving around in their own room nancy knocked on their door phone down and order up breakfast will you she asked ill come fill you in as soon as ive showered half an hour later they were once again having a mealtime conference this time on georges bed bess and george looked somber as nancy reported her conversation with the senator poor teresa bess said softly think how she must feel robertos both her boyfriend and her coach think how shell feel having to walk out there on that tennis court today george said realistically all it would take is a sniper up on top of the grandstand bess repressed a shudder following instructions the three girls drove out to the campus as if nothing unusual were going on the united states flag the flags of the players countries and the loudon college banner fluttered bravely against a robinseggblue sky the souvenir stalls and food stands were selling their wares people were laughing and talking and watching players warm up on the side courts a few tiredlooking protesters waved their signs in the background under the watchful eyes of the campus cops there didnt seem to be any more security forces around than usual is the fbi here undercover nancy wondered while george strode off to case the players as she put it nancy and bess went to their box to nancys surprise there were marilyn kilpatrick and a brawny deeply tanned young man nancy hello senator kilpatrick said warmly your father told me you were going to be here so we stopped by to say hi this is my staff assistant dan prosky nancy performed introductions bess took one look at the handsome young undercover detective and turned on all her charm meeting senator kilpatricks suddenly dancing eyes nancy knew that the planned script was about to be rewritten apparently bess was going to be the one dan would fall for and nancy didnt think either of them would have to do any pretending not that she minded george returning from her survey also sized up the situation promptly superjock she muttered knowingly as dan led bess off for yogurt shakes nancy grinned since when have you looked down on athletes she teased only when they have such huge egos they think their muscles automatically make them supermen something tells me thats the case here how come hes leaving you alone in the box in case somebodys trying to meet me nancy was wearing her meetthecourier outfit with the identifying red belt just in case anyway she said glancing around im not exactly alone it was hard in the atmosphere of cheerful excitement to believe that a dangerous terrorist game was going on under cover of the tennis matches dan and bess came back and the first match of the day between canadian and japanese players concluded nancy checked her program teresa wasnt scheduled until the afternoon i think ill wander around awhile she said mind if bess and i come along dan asked promptly of course not nancy replied but once they were out of the area of the stands nancy turned to face them look the person who was supposed to meet me may find a way to show up or someone else may come instead but no one will come near me if im not alone can you keep up the surveillance from a distance sure dan said there was a new note of respect in his voice for the rest of the morning nancy prowled the area behind the bleachers and around the gym she carried a small camera and snapped pictures both as a cover and in hopes of capturing clues the morning matches ended the crowds streamed toward the parking lots and food stalls nothing had happened nancy bess george and dan ate salads and drank iced tea in a pleasant outdoor restaurant a few players and their coaches appeared there also but not teresa afternoon came it was time for teresas second match nancy and her friends watched the action closely shes good dan said wouldnt know her mind was on anything but the game would you georges eyes narrowed shes not at top form she was better yesterday there arent so many slashing serves today all the same teresa was able to maintain a slight margin over her opponent a young german woman what was remarkable was how she was able to do so with her distinctive style teresa seemed to thrive on difficult shots she would miss easy returns and fall behind then rescue herself just in time with a dazzling display of driving shots from the back corners of the court and of course there were her flashing leaps and powerful slams well we may look alike but our games are certainly different nancy whispered to george shes much much better than i am thats for sure you do okay yourself george said consolingly the match had almost reached the end of the second set when nancy became aware of three figures making their way up the wooden stairs to the row of boxes a middleaged woman with auburn hair senator kilpatrick followed by two men in dark suits who nancy assumed were from the secret service the senator stopped at the entrance to the box and spoke in a low voice nancy i need to speak to you alone without a word nancy rose at a signal from the senator dan bess and george remained in the box the senator led the way straight to a small concrete building just inside the players restricted area it was empty except for a file cabinet a desk and a few chairs the tournament committee uses this as an office senator kilpatrick said noticing nancys surprise after checking the room the senators guards shut the door and took up posts outside leaving nancy and the senator together nancy was beginning to feel uneasy somethings happened senator kilpatricks eyes were anguished but when she spoke her voice was absolutely level and emotionless ive just been over at the hotel where one of the san carlos delegates to my committees conference is staying security people there found a body in the hotel garage it was roberto hes been murdered chapter seven for a moment the closeness in the room made it hard to breathe distantly applause and roars of approval came from the tennis courts somewhere near at hand a bird was singing then a faint breeze came through the window and broke the spell nancy wet her lips how was he killed in the hotel gunfire senator kilpatrick shook her head he was strangled with a rope sometime during the night she paused the medical examiner said there had been torture then he might have given away the list its possible the senator said quietly all at once despite the summer heat the room was very cold poor teresa nancy said at last whos going to tell her senator kilpatrick looked at her directly we are on behalf of our government im going to assure teresa that well help her return home or remain here for the rest of the tournament as she wishes you saved teresas life i believe she trusts you definitely more than she trusts anyone else around here i want you with me when i tell her that she has to be questioned you dont think teresa had anything to do with robertos murder nancy exclaimed i have no reason to think so but she may be the only person who can give us clues that will prevent more murders she doesnt have diplomatic immunity to protect her from being questioned if shell consent to it willingly it will avoid a lot of unpleasantness for all of us in other words nancy thought the government wants me to persuade teresa to spill the beans whatever they are if she did it might save teresa herself from further danger nancy stopped short had someone intended to kidnap teresa as a lever to make roberto talk or had it been the other way around that was something shed have to think about later at the moment teresa was playing her heart out on the field while united states government agents waited ill help you tell her if you wait till her match is finished nancy said firmly theres no reason to spoil that senator kilpatrick agreed we dont want to attract attention anyway youve met teresas official chaperon havent you point her out to me i want to make sure shes not around when i talk to teresa the request would have seemed unkind but nancy remembered the overprotectiveness she had seen yesterday in se√±ora ramirezs behavior she probably wouldnt let teresa say more than two words nancy thought nancy and the senator went back to the playing area escorted by the secret service agents the match was nearing its close thats the woman nancy whispered pointing with her program toward a blackdressed figure in the stands had se√±ora ramirez already heard about robertas death or did she always look as though she were in mourning senator kilpatrick spoke quietly to the nearest agent within seconds two businesssuited government men were edging their way toward teresas chaperon as the match ended another win for teresa amid a roar of applause nancy saw the two close in around se√±ora ramirez and steer her toward an exit at the other end of the grandstand teresa came striding toward the path to the gymnasium shouldering her way almost obliviously through a throng of wellwishers she was wiping her dripping face with a towel and the look in her eyes was remote nancy stepped in front of her she had to speak twice before teresa heard her oh nancy yes did you enjoy the match teresa asked in spanish that was not the real question she wanted to ask and nancy knew it no i didnt nancy said directly and she saw teresa flinch she tucked her arm through one of teresas as senator kilpatrick did the same on the other side this is one of our american senators and a good friend nancy said gently we need to talk to you secret service men were deftly surrounding the three women and moving them in a unit toward the little concrete office as soon as the door was shut teresa looked at nancy her eyes were dry muerto hes dead isnt he she asked nancy nodded yes he is im so sorry teresa we need your help to catch robertos killers senator kilpatrick will explain about it first i must know how he died teresa said she listened stoically as the senator recited the story i do not know why it happened she insisted as the senator questioned her gently all the time in my country there is killing i did not think that could happen here could the other killings in your country have anything to do with your friends death senator kilpatrick pressed could they be connected to robertos murder the older woman repeated the question in spanish to make sure it was understood teresas eyes flashed no all roberto cares about is tennis and me she was speaking in the present tense nancy noted with a pang the realization must have struck teresa too for the girl suddenly froze her eyes widened then abruptly she bent over sobbing give me a few minutes with her nancy whispered to senator kilpatrick the senator nodded and slipped out nancy wrapped her arms around the slight shaking figure and helped teresa into a chair she knelt beside her holding her i am sorry teresa said at last straightening up again dont be you have a right to cry nancy said teresa shook her head faintly what you ask about roberto he has been my tennis trainer for three years but my what do you american girls call it boyfriend nancy suggested my boyfriend three months only three wonderful months we talk about so much never about politics never about governments teresa glanced at nancy since i am young i have love for him why should we talk about politics what did you talk about he was so kind teresa said vaguely so romantic he gave me a book of poetry just before we came to america senator kilpatrick came back in followed by her bodyguards and at once the atmosphere became businesslike the authorities which ones nancy wondered had already searched robertos locker in the mens gym and his hotel room now said the senator they wanted to search teresas too just to see if hed left anything there that could give a clue her chaperon was currently being questioned but teresa could ask to have her present for the search if she wanted teresa shook her head i prefer to have nancy drew the secret service men exchanged glances and shrugged together they went to the hollins gymnasium locker room where teresas belongings were searched then they drove back to the hotel where her room was searched an agent found the book of poetry in spanish with its spanish inscription signed by roberto he put it down looking bored there could be a clue in that nancy said to him quietly when teresa could not hear if there are any coded messages around well find them the agent said condescendingly it doesnt look as though your south american friend needs you anymore we want to have her take a look at some photographs at our office and the lawyer her embassys sending over will be all the moral support she needs nancy bit back the retort she felt like making she gave teresa a last compassionate smile and went downstairs to her own suite bess and george were there waiting for her bess has been making time as usual george said dryly after nancy had told them what had happened and confessed how little she really knew bess blushed i just told dan how wonderful it must be to have a really significant job like the one he has and to know whats really happening behind the headlines dont laugh she said hastily as the others grinned im not just leading him on i really like him good looks and brains for a change but i thought i ought to use mine and do some detecting too what did you find out nancy asked bess pulled off her sundress and carefully laid out a less casual outfit while she answered nancy i got a lesson on south american politics that presidentforlife in san carlos really is bad news hed probably arrest someone for looking at him crosseyed and so many people have simply disappeared that the place is on the edge of a real revolution and our governments going crazy because theres no knowing which political group will take over meanwhile back at the palace the presidents bought himself some terrorists to eliminate the leaders of the opposition and there are probably other terrorists trying to eliminate him you cant tell the players without a scorecard george murmured bess nodded according to dan the players are switching sides all the time he says that every time you blink people change loyalties there well im first for the shower bess continued heading for it you two had better get a move on dans picking us up for dinner in half an hour and hes bringing along two more bodyguards whos going to protect us from them or them from bess george wondered aloud bess was right dan was good company he was intelligent shrewd and funny and so were his friends they ate dinner in a greek restaurant and afterward there was music and dancing it was a fun evening or it would have been if nancy could have gotten teresa off her mind but she was still thinking about her when the young men returned the girls to their hotel want us to see you into your rooms dan asked thanks i think well be safer if you dont bess answered with a laugh the men walked the girls to their door anyway and waited until they were safely inside george bolted the door that was a nice evening i think ill check with the front desk to see if there were any phone calls while we were out nancy said heading for her own bedroom she flipped on the light switch as she entered then she screamed chapter eight the scream brought nancys friends running they froze appalled their eyes following the direction of nancys pointing finger there was a message but it hadnt come by phone and hadnt been left with the front desk it lay in the center of nancys bed in the tightly locked suite it was a doll an eightinch redheaded doll with a teenage figure dressed in an abbreviated blue bikini the dolls head lolled sickeningly to one side a red cord was knotted around the broken neck a note was attached written with a bloodred marker go home se√±orita this could be you nancy recovered quickly and approached the bed as bess dove for the phone bess frantically punched numbers then spoke in a rush dan get back up here fast she dropped the receiver with a clatter that made them all jump so he just happened to give me his beeper number bess said with a forced smile as nancy eyed her its a good thing he did she reached out toward the broken doll dont touch it nancy jerked besss hand away there may be fingerprints footsteps came pounding down the corridor they sure didnt waste time waiting for the elevator george commented opening the door carefully with her hand wrapped in a section of her skirt so she wouldnt leave prints all at once the room was full of very stern plainclothes detectives dan borrowed nancys small camera to take pictures as his friend joe phoned for reinforcements the girls werent allowed to touch anything in the room until a fingerprint expert had arrived when he came fbi agents were with him where are we supposed to go nancy demanded when the fingerprint man refused even to let her sit on the edge of the bathtub if you have any sense youll go back home dan told her flatly this is no mess for nice girls like you to be mixed up in teresas mixed up in this mess nancy replied with conviction im not leaving until shes out of it there has to be some way i can help her and im not going home until senator kilpatrick has that hit list in her hands she turned to her friends theres no reason you have to stay here though why dont you phone home im sure dan can find someone to take you to the airport no way george said gruffly as bess nodded loyally all for one and one for all nancy whispered thanks guys theres one thing you are going to do whether you like it or not dan said reaching for the phone as the fingerprint expert finished with it im under orders to protect you so im moving you out of these rooms i happen to know the governments paid the hotel to keep the rooms on either side of teresas empty he added as he punched the button for the hotel manager nancy was about to protest but she stopped abruptly that location would be perfect within minutes the three detectives were helping the girls carry overnight bags up the emergency stairs no one will know youre in here dan said with satisfaction as soon as hed checked out the new twobedroom suite i told the manager were using these rooms for a stakeout well move the rest of your things up tomorrow in the meantime you can lie low he thumped the pillows on the livingroom sofa and ill spend the night right here to make sure nobody bothers you nancy nodded silently she had her own plans in mind plans that would be blown if dan spent the night on the sofa hed see her leaving the suite then her brow cleared as a thought struck her if this suite was set up like the one theyd just left id really like to freshen up nancy said demurely did anyone bring a blowdryer i think i brought mine said bess picking up her bag lets get everything sorted out in here nancy said leading the way to the far bedroom and firmly closing the door what was that all about george demanded suspiciously nancy put her finger to her lips turn on the dryer she whispered i dont want dan to hear us then followed by george and bess she tiptoed straight to the phone she punched the number of teresas room on the second ring teresa answered her voice a tight whisper its nancy are you alone no but se√±ora ramirez is asleep in the other room teresa replied softly well im in the room on the other side of you we just moved in here as soon as i put down the receiver ill unlock the connecting door on my side you lock the door between you and se√±ora ramirez and come in here in less than a minute teresa stood in the connecting doorway her eyes were swollen with weeping and she looked very frail in her thin nightdress have you heard any more about roberto she asked immediately nancy hurried her inside we have to talk softly our bodyguards in the room just outside this door didnt the government assign anyone to guard you teresa shook her head now that robertos dead they think im not important to the assassins she said simply im not so sure nancy sat on the bed opposite teresa and took her hands i want you to think very hard tell me everything you can remember about robertos movements from the moment you arrived in washington bess flicked the record button on the little cassette player she often brought along on trips george took the memo pad and ballpoint pen from the bedside table teresa stared at the connecting door as if it were a tv screen on which she was watching a documentary of her journey so much was new i have never been out of my own country before so i remember the plane came in which airport nancy asked quickly i dont know near here there was a lot of traffic and we could see the dome on your capitol national airport nancy thought good it was only a mile or two away we come out of the plane into a corridor like a tube then we go through a waiting area we dont stop at all and down a wide corridor with windows then we come to immigration they ask a lot of questions about why are we here and stamp our passports the man was nice teresa said with some surprise he wished me luck in my tournament then what nancy asked teresa described a routine the girls all recognized down an escalator waiting endlessly for luggage to be unloaded finding luggage carts and suitcases and in teresas case tennis rackets then the long ordeal of customs inspection the inspectors had been very thorough with teresa and roberto and se√±ora ramirez they had taken away the fruit teresa had brought with her and the flowers shed been given at the san carlos airport then the party had gone into the main lobby they had not yet separated at all not even to go to the rest rooms at that point teresa said roberto had noticed how much se√±ora ramirezs feet were hurting and had suggested she sit down all at once nancys ears perked up where did roberto leave se√±ora ramirez she asked breathlessly he left both of us teresa corrected her and went to find out about the car we had arranged to rent it took him a long time i think but did he go anywhere else teresa frowned i do not think so it was a very long day she confessed we had been traveling since dawn nancy jumped up her eyes shining at last there was something she could do bess go into the sitting room and turn on the charm she commanded were going to the airport and wed better have dan with us what the airport now george said why nancy i have a hunch that roberto may have left the list there somewhere and i want to find it before anyone else does in a few minutes nancy bess george and dan were in dans car with dan at the wheel apparently bess had been very persuasive teresa had begged to go with them but when nancy had reminded her of her tournament match the next day she had returned reluctantly to her own room dans small station wagon reassured nancy so did his own brawny presence no one would connect him or his car with san carlos or with nancy drew particularly since nancy was wearing besss sundress and georges battered baseball cap both brought by dan from the downstairs room then why nancy asked herself as they rolled up the exit ramp from the parking garage do i suddenly feel as if somethings about to happen she found out all too soon as the station wagon turned into the street and headed for the corner a car parked near the curb came quietly to life it pulled in behind them as they halted for the stop sign then turned left just as dan did were being followed nancy said quietly chapter nine not for long dan replied grimly he started cruising at a slow speed then as they approached a traffic light he slowed down even more the light began to change swiftly dan slammed the wagon into gear and shot through barely missing being hit by a sports car that had jumped the signal in the other direction the sports car was not so lucky dans pursuer smashed into its right side and was then penned in place by the flow of traffic from the cross street nancy watched fascinated as dan roared away car pursuing police officer in accident on comer of washington and queen dan snapped into his car radio pretty smooth george commented admiringly as dan proceeded to execute a complicated series of turns and cutthroughs that brought them onto the service road to the airline arrivals building dont try a maneuver like that unless youre a cop on a chase and even then youd better have a darn good reason dan answered grinning he parked in shortterm parking and the four threaded their way through sparse latenight traffic into the terminal there they played back besss cassette recording and went over the careful notes george had organized so as to retrace robertos and teresas steps dan even got permission to go up to the actual tunnel through which the three travelers from san carlos had deplaned nothing here dan remarked after searching every inch of the tunnel you find anything only a piece of a baggage claim ticket nancy turned it over to him its from an afternoon flight today not much use they searched the waiting area and worked their way down the corridor still without discovering anything dan arranged to have the customs and immigration officials who had been on duty at the time available for questioning in the morning the fbi boys will probably insist on doing that themselves he said enviously at last they reached the main concourse again nancy looked around where are the car rental counters she asked over there dan said pointing then ill bet this is the sitting area teresa mentioned its the closest one now if we could just figure out where roberto might have gone while teresa and se√±ora ramirez waited here hed have to be out of their sight for a while so he could look for a hiding place nancy stood back as dan began a careful search alerting an airport security officer as he did so bess and george also began to search under dans direction while nancy just stood thoughtfully the others glanced at her curiously but she ignored them there were times when working with her brain could bring faster results than hunting for clues hed have known he wouldnt have much time nancy thought hed do what im doing stand still for a minute and look around what would he have seen the chairs the standing ashtrays they might be good places to leave something for pickup by a contact but the meet had been planned for the tournament not the airport past the sitting area were a small coffee shop which dan was checking and a novelty store in the window was a large poster for the tennis tournament whoevers doing promotion for the tournament hasnt missed a trick nancy reflected remembering the banner in the parking garage she sauntered over to look at the array of washington dc souvenirs in the store windows i wish i had a picture of roberto with me to show the store owners she thought shed have to come back with that later after finding out when the same clerks would be on duty where else could roberto have gone to quickly out of sight of teresa the restrooms negative dan reported emerging from the mens room it seemed unlikely that roberto would have risked going into the ladies room but nancy checked it just in case also negative there was nothing left to investigate but the baggage lockers themselves they could only be rented for twelve hours at a time roberto would have to have planned a trip back to the airport twice a day to check the merchandise somethings not adding up nancy thought frowning im sure the airport was the only place roberto could have hidden the hit list unless he had it on him when he died he couldnt have or bodies other than robertos would have started turning up by then dan and bess had returned followed soon by george pretty smart to advertise the tennis tournament out here george said nodding toward the novelty store should bring in a lot of tourists nancy only nodded she was still lost in thought bess slipped an arm around her come on danll drive us home he says the fbi will go through this place thoroughly first thing in the morning they headed for the car it was waiting locked tightly just where dan had left it before unlocking it dan went over it from top to bottom with an electronic beeper just in case he said tautly though a listening device would be more likely than a bomb dan unlocked the car and they climbed in quickly he paid the parking fee at the exit gate and began driving around the spiral of roads that led to the memorial parkway there werent many cars at that time of night hey thats the second time that big gray cars changed lanes with us bess said suddenly nancy sat up straight what big gray car bess pointed dan stole a glance over his shoulder and his eyes narrowed ive seen that car before tonight ive seen it before too nancy said if its not the one i was kidnapped in its the spitting image of it car rental company license plates dan noted he read them out to george who wrote them down then he radioed in to the police okay dan grinned humorlessly lets lose em he put on a burst of speed the gray car fell behind nancy remembered the speed it was capable of and felt a twinge of apprehension but the car made no move to catch up with them and her tension eased almost home dan said reassuringly to bess who cuddled close to him by then the parkway was practically deserted that shows how late it is nancy thought drowsily suddenly lights flashed in her eyes no not lights mirror reflection nancy sprang up in the seat just as the big car bore down on them ominously close what dan yelped as the headlights turned to high beams hit him right in the eyes the gray car struck them from behind and the little station wagon swerved with a sickening lurch dan fought desperately for control but before he regained it the killer car struck again ramming the wagon toward the guardrail the lightweight wagon leaped into the air and then crashed through the rail it plunged down the steep embankment with nancy and her friends inside chapter ten what do you mean you almost got killed in a car crash neds voice shouted through the telephone receiver into nancys ear it was three am two hours after the accident in that time nancy and her friends had been rescued by patrolmen in a passing police car who had seen the wreck dan had succeeded in convincing them that it was all a classified government matter unfortunately that had involved notifying senator kilpatrick while dan was getting chewed out by his superiors senator kilpatrick was on the telephone to nancys father who chewed her out for putting his daughter in such a dangerous position then carson drew had spoken to nancy dad im all right nancy had insisted dan did a wonderful job of getting the wagon under control he got us out before the fire could start were all just fine nancy said rubbing one of several bruises things are far from fine her father had interrupted marilyn finally told me the whole story im flying down tomorrow soon after carson drew got off the phone the much needed call came through from ned nancy almost cried she was so tired and so glad to hear his voice but the note in hers only made ned more worried im coming down with your father ned said immediately ned you really dont need to ill take care of myself i promise and if i dont dan will the way he did tonight exactly who is that character ned asked suspiciously nancy laughed a very smart gogetter jock whos a whiz kid for the local police and who i think is angling for a job with senator kilpatrick youd like him and he nancy added with emphasis likes bess she was relieved to hear ned laugh okay i get the message maybe im going overboard worrying but i love you i love you too and thanks for worrying ill call you if i need you i promise how about calling cause you want me ned asked nancy laughed and put down the phone feeling much better the next thing she knew it was nine am and bess was shaking her awake the senators on the phone nancy struggled to a sitting position still halfasleep where is everybody george took the bus to loudon to watch teresa warm up for the afternoon match dans gone out to buy a newspaper hes already brought us breakfast he didnt want room service to know anyones in here nancy come on the senators practically spitting bullets nancy reached for the phone about time the senators husky voice said crisply i want to see you at the tournament be there by tenthirty has anything more happened nancy demanded i cant talk the senator hung up you look awful bess said frankly reappearing with a container of orange juice and a bag of doughnuts what do you expect after we sat up talking till five nancy bit into a doughnut eyeing bess i must say youve recovered remarkably and you got even less sleep ill bet dan must be good for me bess said nancy go back to sleep for a little longer you dont have to go to the tournament this minute teresas got a whole gang of bodyguards you mean the government finally came through not ours hers bess said robertos murder also made the headlines down there the san carlos governments calling it a provocative international incident their people are keeping surveillance on teresa and our people are keeping surveillance on them scratch the sleep nancy said resignedly im taking a shower and going out there by tenthirty she was out at loudon college just in time to join george and watch the end of teresas workout this place is really crawling with cops today george reported all types and all nationalities things are getting sticky tell me about it nancy retorted glumly thinking about the hit list if you ask me george said decidedly robertos death was deliberate political murder i agree said nancy but by which side we dont even know for sure whether forces inside or outside san carlos are responsible one thing was certain keeping everything hushhush was rapidly becoming impossible nancy looked around casually two college security guards were talking together at the far end of the court another stood near nancy three us government men were wandering around looking out of place in business suits several latin men were also gathered nearby they were leaning against the wire fence watching nancy and george those must be the guards bess had spoken of nancy shuddered she was beginning to wonder what fate teresas government had in store for her the papers that morning had been full of rumors about how cruel and totalitarian the dictatorship was buenos d√≠as nancy teresa came toward nancy and george wiping her forehead with her wristband she looked sad but composed how about hitting a few with me george she invited ill get my tennis shoes george said gladly soon the two were exchanging rapid strokes your friends in seventh heaven isnt she a voice said behind nancys shoulder nancy spun around senator kilpatrick stood there elegant in a white linen dress and large brown straw hat beneath its shade her eyes were steely whats wrong nancy demanded alarmed plenty in my opinion dont worry i dont mean with you come have an early lunch with me nancy followed the senator to a small tent plasticwalled and airconditioned that opened off the main dining tent iced tea salad and dessert were waiting but the tent was empty and the senators own bodyguards stood outside somethings going to happen isnt it nancy asked im furious about what isnt happening the senator corrected her im fully aware that this is a sensitive situation but its difficult to have a straightforward meeting with the representatives of the san carlos political factions which im supposed to be doing right now when im not allowed to mention robertos name of course the people from san carlos want to know whats going on and what can i say especially when roberto was known to be an opponent of the san carlos regime and of us foreign policy there senator kilpatrick continued that was the reason he was smuggling the list to me rather than the cia he met me when i was on a factfinding mission in san carlos a few months ago and he trusted me he suspected that people in authority in both our governments were if not aiding and abetting government terrorists at least closing their eyes to them i dont know if he was right but its terrible not being able to investigate it and the killings could start any time nancy added gravely the senator nodded ive just learned from a private source that a wellknown hit man flew into mexico from san carlos yesterday hes already left mexico supposedly for the bahamas but the plane makes stops at some american territories on the way you mean he could be on the mainland already right times running out what do you want me to do nancy asked i guess im hoping for a miracle marilyn kilpatrick said frankly your father says youve produced those before im hoping youll bring a fresh eye to this case and a mind thats not bogged down in politics and routine there must be a way to stop the assassinations there has to be nancy hardly realized she was thinking out loud every criminal makes a mistake sometime and roberto was no fool he knew he was in danger so he must have planted that list somewhere it could be found if he was taken care of if only we had a little more time but time as the senator had said was running out they finished their lunch beyond the plastic wall nancy saw george talking with some of the other players from the glow on georges face nancy guessed they were complimenting her on her game lets go join her senator kilpatrick said following nancys glance they went out and followed george to the grandstand just as george reached the gate in the high wire fence a man came through it heading toward the stairs to the boxes nancy gasped what senator kilpatrick said instantly hes one of the guys who abducted me call security nancy tore off passing george as she did so immediately george came running after her she and nancy raced up the steps and into the narrow aisle that separated the front and back rows of boxes at the far end the man was sliding into a bleacher seat next to a man in a hat who was reading a newspaper the newspaper was lowered briefly i dont know him but the first guys one of the ones who snatched me nancy whispered to george get down he knows you by sight remember george whispered back i can pass for just another player as nancy ducked george began sauntering along the aisle she had almost reached the two men when the one in the hat folded his newspaper and looked sharply in georges direction nancys heart lurched he was one of the ones who had been leaning against the fence watching teresas workout he had seen george there with nancy george must have recognized him at that same moment she half paused then changed direction heading up the rows of bleachers as she did so the two men also rose and began to run after her so did nancy if she can just get to the exit stairs nancy thought if senator kilpatrick just brings help in time there was no time everything was suddenly happening at high speed george was running the men were running after her and nancy was pounding after them kicking off her sandals as she did so barefoot panting she scrambled after her friend who was by now on the top row of bleachers george scrambled into the announcers booth seconds later one of her pursuers was there too nancy stumbled and went down hard on one ankle she jerked herself up in time to see george hurtling out the other side all at once the second pursuer stopped something glinted in his hand there was a faint crackpop he was shooting with a silenced gun straight at georges head as nancy stared in horror george did the only thing possible with a gymnasts skill she started climbing the pole that supported the electric scoreboard up and up georges only chance nancy knew was to make a run for it along the top of the billboard if she herself could distract the pursuers gritting her teeth against the throbbing in her ankle nancy pulled herself upright and began to make her way rapidly along the aisle there were two more faint cracking sounds but no bullets whizzed past nancy she whipped around to see george midway across the top edge of the scoreboard lose her balance and topple helplessly toward the ground far below chapter eleven somebody screamed nancy didnt wait to see who she threw herself down and rolled under the bleacher seat dropping to the ground it was not a long drop she looked around at once expecting to see georges crumpled figure george was nowhere to be seen several sets of legs raced along behind the bleachers and then stopped abruptly nancy crawled out and looked up as the other spectators were looking high above a figure clung to a slanting beam the bleacher support had broken georges fall george was all right or at least right enough to grab the beam and hang on tight now she was working her way to safety as onlookers held their breath instinctively nancys gaze swung higher the pursuers were no longer using george for target practice they were fleeing frantically as security guards closed in the guards were too late the assassins got away but at least youre okay nancy cried running to hug george george grinned weakly it takes more than that to get rid of me she brushed herself off gingerly wincing as she did so college officials insisted on having george examined by the tournament physician before theyd let her leave then senator kilpatrick herself took george and nancy back to the hotel in her government limousine i hope this thing has bulletproof windows george joked to nancys secret relief the bodyguarddriver answered quite seriously that it did instead of pulling up at the hotel entrance the driver drove directly into the underground garage the second bodyguard stepped out and checked carefully before allowing the senator and her guests to leave the limo they went directly into the elevator accompanied by both guards and took the elevator first to the top floor then down to nancys using a special key to keep the door from opening at an earlier stop again one guard stepped out first and looked around before motioning to the others to follow he was also first around the bend in the corridor and immediately he flung out an arm to hold the women back theres a guy hanging around outside the drew suite and he looks like he means business nancy was already peering cautiously around the corner a handsome man with a distinguished touch of gray at the temples was pacing in obvious fury nancy let out a glad cry and tore down the hall before the guards could stop her dad carson drew caught her in his arms and held her tight all he said was lets go inside in a controlled tone that nancy knew too well quickly she unlocked the door and they all entered carson drew turned on the guards immediately i wish to speak to these ladies alone could you please take up posts directly outside the door the authority in his voice carried weight so did the faint nod senator kilpatrick gave the bodyguards obeyed carson drew bolted the door behind them and then swung around what do you think youre doing risking the lives of private citizens like this it was marilyn kilpatrick he was shouting at not nancy i agreed to a courier mission now theres been a murder and these girls are attacked in broad daylight i heard what happened at the tournament he snapped as nancy started to speak it came over the radio in the lobby and theres a pack of reporters down there waiting to ask questions dad dont you think you could ask george how she is first instead of yelling nancy asked diplomatically carson drew caught himself im sorry he said how are you george is there anything i can do im fine thanks but i think ill go soak my aching bones in a nice hot tub george vanished discreetly nancy and senator kilpatrick exchanged glances dad have you had any lunch yet nancy asked not waiting for an answer she went to the door and asked the guards to order something up behind her carson drew and the senator began to exchange words carson believe me there was no way i could have foreseen that nancy would be in danger or george or teresa montenegro for that matter something in marilyn kilpatricks voice made nancys father grow sober and attentive no one knew roberto was going to try to smuggle that hit list to me no one other than the san carlos dictator and his hit squad knew the list existed except this roberto nancys father retorted with irritation roberto knew because he was a member of an underground group trying to overthrow the dictatorship a moderate group she stressed he found out somehow and got in touch with me because wed talked when i was down there some months ago he was afraid if the word leaked out to the more radical rebels or here in washington somebody might decide that the people on the list were expendable for propaganda value he knew hed be putting his life on the line smuggling the list to me and he lost his life but he didnt think teresa would be in danger a young female tennis star shes one of the best publicity gimmicks her government has so i thought nancy would be perfectly safe posing as her for the few minutes that the contact would take but teresas not safe nancy said aloud why and why did those guys shoot at george just because she played a practice game with teresa none of this makes sense then she gasped suppose they werent at the stadium to follow any of us suppose theyve decided teresas expendable what you said about the people on the list wouldnt the murder of teresa montenegro while shes in this country and youre having those secret peacemaking sessions be the biggest possible provocation against peace especially if the other side and the us government could be blamed please call the fbi and have them search the stadium in the shocked silence that followed they all heard the door of the other bedroom open bess stood in the connecting doorway her face was glowing but her eyes were anxious what have you been up to nancy asked with effort or should i say you and dan weve been driving around sightseeing but bess stopped and her glow faded what is it you know dont you george was shot at and she fell off the top of the scoreboard in the process nancy said rapidly dont worry shes only bruised and shaken then she paused and looked at bess curiously what do we know im upset too give me a minute to catch my breath bess sat down on the bed locking her hands together dan took me for a romantic drive around the tidal basin she said wanly as the others waited past the monuments and the capitol you know he had the morning off because of the business with his car last night we ordered him a new one brown she added irrelevantly in the meantime hes using a car from the police car pool all in all you two managed to have a pretty good morning senator kilpatrick said dryly it started out that way i like dan bess wailed i really do hes strong and funny and sensitive he says just the right things or at least what you want to hear now george appeared in the connecting door wrapped in a terrycloth robe and turban george thats not fair bess swallowed senator when he saw there were guards here he dropped me off and went to find you we heard on the police radio that the airport police collared a pickpocket at the airport last night he tried to bargain his way into a lighter charge by supplying information he saw somebody arrive on a plane from the bahamas somebody called el morro bess wasnt finished speaking but at that moment a cry burst from the senators lips they all looked at her but it was to carson drew she turned carson that mans one of the most wanted terrorists on interpols list he has a reputation for eliminating anyone who stumbles on to any clues to his existence whether his current employers want him to or not im sure he was one of the men who tried to kill george chapter twelve nancy i cant help worrying about you im your father carson drew said with a faint smile then his face grew serious im proud of you for many things and one of them is the way you never let personal sacrifice or danger deter you from doing what you believe is right or from helping someone who is in need i admit there are times when i want to jump in and protect you from the consequences and there would probably be more of them if i always knew what you were up to while you were up to it i guess now i rely on my respect for your good sense and judgment the trouble is i also know that all the sense and judgment in the world cant always save us from the consequences of other peoples actions i know nancy whispered thats the way ive felt over robertos death so helpless and so responsible for not having been able to protect him from it the drews were alone in nancys hotel bedroom senator kilpatrick outraged that the news of el morros presence in the country had not reached her sooner had been driven to her office in search of further information she had left one of her bodyguards on duty he was outside the door to the suite now bess was fussing over george in the other bedroom dont feel guilty carson drew said sternly youre a human being nancy not a computer or a comicbook heroine even computers can only act on the data that they have can you think now of anything youd have done differently with roberto given what you knew then nancy shook her head then if you gave it your best shot thats all anyone has a right to expect of you even yourself carson drew tilted nancys chin up making her look at him i meant what i said about being proud of you i do understand why you do what you do and i approve nancy hugged him just as her fathers arms tightened around her in response the telephone rang ill get it bess called and then nan pick the phone up quick the voice that came to nancy was barely distinguishable as teresas i must see you alone can i come to your room right away of course ill unlock the door between no go to your window quickly the phone went dead what is it carson drew asked at once its teresa shes in trouble and if she sees you she wont talk dad go to your own room fast nancy fairly pushed him out then she ran to her window and threw it open wide a moment later a figure scrambled down the fire escape it was teresa unrecognizable in a painters cap and a maids uniform nancy pulled her in teresa what shh teresa slammed the window shut and pulled the drapes i sent se√±ora ramirez out for souvenirs and postcards so i could get away i remembered i saw these clothes in the service room yesterday and i borrowed them they are a good disguise yes no one will recognize me if i go out i went up to the next floor and came down the fire escape we must talk quickly she may be back already if shed come back and found you missing wed have heard the shouting nancy said frankly teresa why do you need to go out i found a note in my locker when i went to change after practice teresa said nancys heart sank if a note could be smuggled in there so could a bomb the note is from a a compadre of robertos in the underground he must see me i am marked to die and so are others she lapsed into frightened spanish many others not just the six nancy interrupted teresa listen to me this could be a trap teresa shook her head violently no he mentioned things no one not close to roberto could know the poetry book roberto gave me the message he wrote inside she grabbed nancys arm this amigo he wants to ask me questions questions that may give us a clue to some message roberto could have left me ill go with you nancy said at once no i must go alone but that is not the problem teresa drew herself up proudly with roberto dead i do not care about the risk i must find that list or his death will have no meaning tell me what you want me to do teresa leaned forward there is only one time this man can meet me at six oclock tonight but nancy at six oclock i must be at the tennis tournament nancy frowned i thought your match today was earlier she looked at her watch right now in fact teresa cut her off it was postponed until tomorrow one of my opponents took sick and must be replaced the stadium will open again at five today and at six i am to play a doubles match not part of the tournament it is a benefit for the poor people in my country an american man and i will play against the girl from canada and her coach roberto was supposed to be my partner but teresa forced tears back sternly it has been advertised how can i not show up there how can i be in two places at one time nancy help me in two places at one time nancy looked at the girl from san carlos almost unrecognizable in the baggy uniform and the cap that concealed her hair aside from the suntan she could have been nancy herself in disguise i know how nancy breathed you play the doubles match ill go to your meeting nancy i told you you cannot now it was nancys turn to interrupt wait a minute i play tennis not as well as you of course but im good you said yourself its a doubles match ill play in it for you as teresa montenegro and youll go to your meeting as nancy drew nancy tiptoed across the living room to the other bedroom bess she hissed opening the door come to my room we need you you too george i dont understand teresa whispered bewildered when the three girls returned you will just listen quickly nancy outlined her brainstorm it would require acting skill but nancy had that from many previous cases and she was sure she could persuade teresa to play her part it also required alterations not just of appearance but of mannerisms and of nancys tennis game george grasped the possibilities first i can coach you nancy ive learned lots of teresas techniques thanks to this mornings workout ill try to make your tennis look as much like teresas as i can but what about little things like skin and hair color bess objected thats where you come in nancy said promptly youre the fashion and beauty expert run out and buy whatevers needed at a drugstore be prepared to give me a cut and blowdry teresa go back to your room before your chaperon pushes the panic button ill arrange to have her receive a diplomatic invitation she wont dare turn down george get on the phone to the senator tell her we she emphasized the word need the use of a tennis court that can provide absolute privacy tell her im testing out a theory but dont tell her anything else as the other three sprang into action nancy sat down quietly she felt as if the room were whirling teresas meet was vitally important and this was the only way it could take place without alerting the terrorists of that nancy was absolutely sure she was absolutely sure of something else as well she had only a few short hours to complete the transformation not just of her appearance but of her tennis game she nancy drew expert detective but amateur athlete was about to play before a thousand or more people play against people good enough to be professional play well enough to carry through a triple deception of the united states government of the public and of the san carlos agents assigned to keep teresa montenegro in line could she do it chapter thirteen the next few hours were among the most frantic of nancys life within ten minutes senator kilpatrick sent the armored car as george called it to take nancy george and teresa to a private home somewhere nearby the girls never found out who lived there and no one was in sight but inside the high walls around the grounds was a magnificent tennis court for two hours teresa drilled nancy in the characteristics of her tennis style with george acting as coach to see if nancy followed teresas moves precisely itll do george said at last nancy could never pull off the substitution in a regular tournament match but people will probably think your playing looks different because this is mixed doubles lets hope so nancy said fervently my games suffering because im concentrating so hard on copying teresas style and id never have the stamina for a full match i would george said regretfully i wish i could try it perhaps when this is over you and i will have a chance to play together in another meet teresa told george gently there was a moments silence they were only too aware that some of them might not come out of the afternoons deadly games alive wed better get back so bess can have her crack at us nancy said briskly the limousine sped them back to the hotel again they were whisked carefully inside under heavy guard bess was in the suite surrounded by hair and makeup paraphernalia i shortened nancys skirt so itll be the right length for teresa she reported and i bought nancy some tennis shoes like the ones teresa wears you guys should be able to fit into the rest of each others clothes she hurried them both into the showers to wash their hair the next hour was a hectic flurry of activity with bess presiding and george acting as her assistant bess and george applied bronzer to nancys skin youd better have it everywhere george insisted since youll have to change clothes in the locker room fortunately nancy had some tan already so the deeper color was not too much of a change after that bess who was good at it trimmed nancys hair referring to teresa constantly as a model then she began to apply colored hair gel lavishly when she finished bess had matched the girls hair coloring quite well next she worked over them both with brush and blower last of all came makeup bess relied mostly on nancy and teresas own cosmetics but she was also able to do some skillful work with light and shadow be glad of what i learned when i was in those school plays bess muttered blending brown and lavender under nancys cheekbones okay take a look till then shed kept nancy and teresa away from mirrors now they stared at themselves amazed somehow nancys cheekbones had grown higher and broader the bone structure above her eyes seeming a bit more full on teresa the effect was the reverse once dressed each girls resemblance to the others normal appearance was uncanny now spritz your faces with this bottled water to set the makeup bess commanded no wait id better do it youre not afraid this bronzer will run off nancy asked apprehensively not till you scrub hard with soap bess said emphatically i tried it once believe me i know once i was a south sea islander for days its time you two were going george said glancing at her watch se√±ora ramirez should just be leaving for that cocktail party howd you arrange that i told dad that se√±ora ramirez could use an evening out after all thats happened he knew just the right people to nancy gasped weve been rushing so much i forgot to arrange transportation teresa cant drive into dc in our car not in rushhour traffic its taken care of bess said a troubled look crossed her eyes dan thinks hes driving nancy and me into georgetown to follow up one of nancys hunches after we drop teresa off were going to have dinner at a place he knows then well pick teresa up again good thinking george said approvingly i hate not being honest with dan bess said but it was the only thing that i could come up with nancy nodded sympathetically i know what you mean she said thinking of ned but if youd told the truth it would have been dans job to stop us ill be able to keep dan occupied so he wont ask teresa too many questions bess went on and the senators sending some other bodyguards who havent seen either of you two before to drive teresa well actually you to the doubles match the senator agreed with me that teresa might be safer without her san carlos guards than with them so shes arranged a way to spring her from custody you didnt tell senator kilpatrick what were doing did you nancy exclaimed instinct warned her the deception should be secret even from the senator especially after the way dad lit into her earlier about jeopardizing our lives she added mentally i didnt tell anybody bess emphasized but ill sure be glad when this is over i also teresa said somberly no matter how it ends there was a momentary silence the phone rang it was dan reporting that he was ready for the trip into dc teresa rose then resting her hands lightly on nancys shoulders she looked directly into her eyes vaya con dios she murmured she picked up nancys handbag and slipped out into the corridor bess followed ten minutes later george and nancy left too carrying teresas tennis rackets and gym bag george sat in the front seat of the government car beside the driver teresa wants to be alone she told the other bodyguard shes got to psych herself up for this match they rode out to the loudon campus in absolute silence nancy was grateful that this limousine like the one that had kidnapped her had tinted windows no one could look in at her and in the washington area limos were too common to attract much notice they reached the campus nancy noticed that the parking lot was well filled apparently many people had come to watch teresa play and help the refugees from her country the limousine pulled up by the gym to nancys relief security police had made the place offlimits for all but the four players in the womens locker room teresas canadian opponent greeted her pleasantly but otherwise let her alone nancy changed into teresas favorite tennis outfit and put on the new tennis shoes fortunately they fit well she propped teresas mascot a small doll a replica of a san carlos indian woman beside her on the bench and gazed at it somberly nancy was beginning to realize all too well just how easily the switch of identities could go wrong i cant think about it she told herself ive got to psych myself into the game into teresas game she closed her eyes and concentrated all at once she heard a commotion in the hall there were the sounds of a scuffle and then georges voice was raised wildly you dont understand ive got to see teresa montenegro nancy ran to the door george was struggling with two guards in the lobby of the gym building she caught nancys eye and signaled frantically it was a risk but nancy took it she stepped out of the locker room and strode forward to reach out for george her own eyes flashing imperiously as shed once seen teresas do let go of her she commanded to her great relief the guards let go of george and stepped back but only a few feet they would never let george follow nancy into the locker room out of their sight george turned her head so that only nancy could see her lips they formed the words almost soundlessly trouble bess phoned teresa phoned her at the restaurant the big guy down south has ordered the execution of traitors everywhere to begin at dawn she emphasized the word everywhere nancys eyes darkened teresa she asked soundlessly george nodded imperceptibly the same thought was in both girls minds if the san carlos dictator the big guy had ordered killings there was no guarantee that hit men like el morro would obey his decree that they should be carried out at sunrise el morro might not feel like waiting and by posing as teresa in the doubles match nancy was putting herself in terrible danger chapter fourteen el morro or another hit man could be in the grandstand crowd at that very moment for an instant that was all nancy could think of then a man wearing the uniform and badge of a tournament official opened the door two minutes to six to the courts please players george gave nancy a swift tight hug and hurried off the young canadian woman came out of the locker room and shook hands with nancy murmuring good luck the two male players left their locker room nancys partner was a cheerfullooking man in his early thirties with sandy hair sorry i didnt have the time to practice with you earlier he apologized i was tied up with some lastminute coaching nancy smiled and shrugged escorted by tournament officials and by security men disguised as officials the two couples marched across the road and out onto the court there was a burst of applause as they entered nancy smiled and nodded like the others but involuntarily her eyes searched the crowd i have to stop that she told herself the best way to protect teresa is to make people believe im teresa the other couple won the toss and chose to serve the canadian womans first serve was deep and hard nancys partner returned it well but the canadian coach hit a great shot down the line nancy missed it fifteenlove called the referee nancy knew within five minutes that the deception was going to be even more difficult than shed feared she was in a double bind to play well she would have to use her own style and the masquerade would be exposed but if she forced herself to play like teresa her reflexes were slowed and she missed shots teresa would have hit once after shed netted one of teresas characteristic backhand shots nancy caught her partner looking at her strangely but the game was too fast for him to focus on anything other than his own playing the canadian team took the first set easily george was at the rail when nancy wearily went to her seat for the few minutes between sets she was not allowed to enter the court but her eyes spoke plainly to nancy calm down dont force so much zen her lips framed the last word nancy frowned then her face cleared george was referring to the zen of a sport a phrase nancy had heard her use often it meant concentrate on the objective on the target not on the technique you hope will get you there nancy and her partner won the next game a faint murmur reached her from the bleachers and nancy resolutely put away the fear that her own tennis style might be creeping in concentrate on where the ball should go as george had said rely on the earlier practice for the style a gleam of light from somewhere in the stands danced into nancys eyes and she missed a high volley not even getting her racket on the ball there was a disappointed murmur from the crowd followed by a ripple of appreciation as nancys partner ran in to save the shot catching the ball on its first bounce he slammed it back and the momentum of the game picked up again the ball came toward nancy and she moved forward to meet it but as she swung the glint of light bounced into her eyes again the glare was just great enough to throw her offbalance she tripped and fell scarcely hearing the referees voice announcing the point for the other side above the groans of the crowd pretending dizziness nancy knelt for a moment on one knee but her eyes were busily sweeping the stadium the light had come from the far end from the east so it couldnt be rays from the dying sun none of the tournament floodlights had been lit yet where was it coming from and why couldnt she see it now nancys partner strode toward her concerned about her delay nancy nodded at him and began to rise then she saw the glint again as if he knew she needed his help nancys partner caught the next few balls with some dazzling maneuvers there was no repeat of the flash of light and nancy was able to return some shots successfully her mind was racing if the glint was not from electricity or the sunset what had caused it sunlight from behind her binoculars a camera lens a telescope then the truth crashed down on nancy it was a telescope of sorts the telescopic sight of a snipers rifle nancy froze a ball smashed past her and the glint came again instinctively nancy ducked she made it look like a stumble and murmurs rose from the crowd nancys partner strode toward her nancy shook her head and then with sharp clarity she knew there was only one thing to do it was the canadian womans turn to serve as the ball came toward her nancy completely abandoned her attempt to imitate teresas style she rushed forward to meet it with a wild forehand slam that sent the ball soaring over the crowd directly toward the sniper there were gasps from the crowd they must have assumed teresa was cracking beneath the pressure but one person knew better georges eyes had been on nancy they followed the ball then they swung back to meet nancys for a shocked instant and the next moment george was grabbing the nearest security guard and pointing from all over the stadium officials began to dash toward the sniper i did my best nancy thought all i can do now is hope she rushed back into the game and she did not see the telltale glint again nancy played hard after that with all her skill she knew the best thing she could do was to prolong the game and keep the canadian pair from winning easily she had to give teresa as much time on the loose as she could game set to san carlos the referee called the announcement was made over the loudspeaker the match is now a tie during the third set nancy and her partner played well when it ended they had lost the match by only two heartbreaking points in the last set the players shook hands exhausted nancy walked slowly from the court amid a flurry of whispers the canadian woman came over to put a companionable arm around her shoulders you made a great comeback she said too bad you lost when the game was so close that would have killed me nancy gave a tight grin you dont know how close it came she murmured in her best attempt at a san carlos accent chapter fifteen george met nancy with a quick hug as soon as she stepped off the court the sniper got away she whispered at once our drivers waiting right out front and the other guy got your things from the locker room during a wild ride on the parkway the driver abandoned the pretense of driving a private limo and used a siren he turned it off once they were within half a mile of the hotel all the same nancy and george were back in their suite just twenty minutes after the match ended teresa was already there with bess and both of them were distraught the news about the sniper had come over the cars twoway radio as dan and bess drove back from the restaurant bess had been forced to tell dan about the entire plot and masquerade he had been furious he said we were dumb and reckless that not only could he lose his job as a result but we might have caused either or both of you to lose your lives that is crazy teresa said sharply i knew the risk to me and i chose to take it she looked at nancy but it was not right of me to let you risk your life yes it was nancy said firmly how else could we have found out about the dawn executions then she looked more closely at teresa whats wrong she asked in a concerned voice i mean what else is wrong what happened at your meeting with robertos friend tears welled up in teresas eyes i am sure it is not true she whispered or no i am not sure but but nancy prompted gently but this friend he is telling me roberto roberto was not to be trusted that he was what did he say a double agent working for the dictator and for the revolutionaries he says he found in robertos papers back in san carlos some letters that show that he wanted to sell the list of names to the senator sell the list bess gasped yes said teresa if she would not pay enough roberto would not care what happened to the people on the list so he really wasnt working to overthrow the san carlos dictatorship nancy asked appalled there is no way to tell whose side roberto was on teresa bit her lip and maybe he would even betray me nancy was horrified but there was no time to think over what teresa had said it was almost nine oclock dawns at fivefiftyseven bess said starkly the senator checked dan took teresa straight to her as soon as he found out that meant senator kilpatrick knew about the masquerade and carson drew probably knew as well wheres the senator now nancy asked weakly at the department of justice pushing panic buttons and pulling strings she took your dad with her bess added i almost forgot she said that out of desperation the government agents even took teresas poetry book they used microscopes and infrared light and tried all kinds of code tests and its clean so teresa will get it and that postcard she was using as a bookmark back tomorrow nancy saw teresas face change what postcard nancy asked instantly teresa shook her head turning away slightly it is nothing i just realized that that card is the last thing roberto ever gave me she confessed wiping away tears roberto gave you a postcard nancy jumped up teresa think hard when did he give it to you and why teresa looked at her bewildered why when we were leaving the airport roberto said he wouldnt have time to write postcards that he was stupid to think he would he threw the cards into a trash can and i i said i would like to have the picture of the capitol to take home to my mother so roberto laughed and took it out of the can and gave it to me i was keeping it in the poetry book teresa think youd just gotten into the us you hadnt even left the airport when and where did roberto get american postcards teresa frowned he must have bought them the novelty shop nancy almost shouted i knew that must have something to do with this it was the only place roberto could have gone during those few minutes he must have written a message on one of the cards she faced the others urgently come on we have to get hold of the manager of that store the hit list may still be there hold on george said promptly one the stores been searched several times two he could have mailed the card three and most important the senators not about to let any of us loose till the hit men are arrested she gave strict orders to those musclemen outside our doors thats easy nancy said george phone the senators office tell her assistant that we need to follow up a lead for the senator hiding a grin george did so were in luck all the way she announced when she hung up weve got a bulletproof car and escorts your fathers occupied looking up legal measures the senator can invoke to protect the people who could be on the hit list and your chaperon she added turning to teresa has just been picked up by the fbi it seems she has an interesting past they want to find out more about chatty assistant bess said smiling at george george simply bowed could se√±ora ramirez be a terrorist if so on which side the rebels or the dictators nancy felt a sudden stab of pity for teresa she was so alone on her first trip to a foreign country the man she loved had been brutally murdered and suddenly she wasnt sure who that man had been even her chaperon might betray her teresa you stay here youll be safe with the guards at the door would you like bess to stay with you nancy asked gently teresas face was set i am coming with you perhaps i will remember something more when i am there no ones going anywhere till nancy washes her hair and scrubs that skin dye off bess said theres a contract out for teresa montenegro remember nancy and teresa stared at each other bess is right you change back me i will be all right as a blond american teresa fairly pushed nancy toward the shower nancy didnt think it was the time to point out that by then there was probably a contract on her too she used a few precious minutes to wash the gel out of her hair and to try to scrub away the skin dye if she looked more deeply tanned than usual it couldnt hurt much she pulled on jeans and a shirt then there was a knock on the door everybody froze takeoff time a detectives voice whispered through the door they piled into the car nancy was still toweling her wet hair during the second wild ride of the night out to the airport teresa sat wrapped in silence gazing unseeingly at the lights of washington across the river the limousine careened into the airport arrivals area with nancy in the lead george bess teresa and their escorts swept toward the novelty store the owner was in the shop and he wasnt in a good mood ive been over this twice already with other agents he snapped why cant you people get your act together yes i was in the shop at the time you mentioned but ive already said i cant remember every foreigner who walks into this place or every native either please nancy forced herself to smile at him i know this is annoying but its terribly important she glanced over at teresa who was gazing as if hypnotized at the poster for the tennis tournament its about her her fianc√© nancy told the storekeeper in a low voice hes been murdered and we need to know everything we can about his movements he bought postcards he probably bought them here you mean the poor guy i read about in the papers is that the girl montenero or something theyre talking about he snapped his fingers now i remember there was someone in here buying postcards i remember him on account of he stared at that poster just the way shes doing kind of creepy and it was weird the way he picked his postcards just up and down one of the rows as if the pictures on em didnt really matter he was interested in the poster did he say anything about the tournament nancy asked urgently nope just stared and he touched it the shop owner scratched his head that was weird too come to think of it seemed like it was the poster itself he was interested in not what it said i had to tell him to take his big hands off it we dont let people mess the airport up with graffiti or anything he added smugly take his hands off the poster nancy moved toward it as if hypnotized herself her eyes swept over it then delicately her hand reached out to touch one word semipro the dot over the i seemed ever so faintly larger than the dot over the i in the word international which was set in the same type nancys index finger touched the dot her nail scraped against it and the dot came off in her hand she knew what it was even before she heard one of the agents breathe the word behind her shoulder microdot chapter sixteen nancy knew she would never forget that frightful night the stretch limousine must have had a soupedup motor because the ride away from the airport was a blurred montage of headlights nightlit monuments and the capitol dome glowing like a beacon in the distance the federal agent at the wheel did not volunteer where they were headed nancy didnt ask she was well aware that if time hadnt been so urgent she and her friends wouldnt have been allowed to go along sometime during the evening a light rain had begun to fall the dark streets gleamed and raindrops streaked the windshield nancy stole a glance at her watch time was running out the limousine tore past the white house a group of demonstrators huddled forlornly with umbrellas and banners on the far side of the street under the watchful eye of police protesting the dictatorship in my country teresa said emotionlessly her hands were clasped tightly her face like stone at last the limo turned into the entrance to a garage an armed guard at the entry booth checked the drivers id they parked in a cavernous almost empty enclosure that was brightly lit their footsteps echoed as they walked across the concrete and nancy noticed that their escorts held guns in their hands the driver punched a coded sequence of numbers into an electronic device beside a heavy steel door for a moment a tiny beam of red light swept their faces then noiselessly the door slid open surrounded by their armed guard nancy and her friends stepped inside into a bright hospitalwhite corridor the steel door slid shut again and another door concealed in the opposite wall slid open then they were crowded together into a small futuristic elevator car which sped upward when they stepped out nancy fought back a giggle unconsciously shed been expecting a sciencefiction laboratory of some kind but the room they entered was a cross between a drab office and her high school chemistry lab the electronics technicians who were waiting for them though were all business as soon as the federal man produced the tiny i dot from the poster it was whisked beneath a highpowered microscope nancy teresa bess and george were ushered into a small office and told to stay there make yourselves some coffee if you want to there may be something around here to go with it the man in the lab jacket added he went out shutting the office door behind him none of us has had any dinner yet come to think of it george said in a flat voice not that it matters bess tasted the coffee that was left in the glass pot and made a face this is awful she emptied the pot washed it refilled it and turned on the machine nancy rummaged in the small cupboard for the something the scientist had referred to her stomach felt like lead but she had to keep her hands busy she found a box of crackers and a jar of cheese spread and began making snacks for everyone george paced between the window and the door teresa sat on a plaid daybed looking like a statue the coffeepot steamed sending out the strong comforting smell of brewing coffee the clock ticked away eleventhirty midnight one am two am why dont they tell us something nancy exclaimed at last remember the old saying no news is good news bess pressed a third mug of coffee into nancys hand nancy set it down so hard that the scalding liquid splashed her wrist i cant stand this i have to know she opened the office door at once a young woman in a lab coat appeared im sorry its really much better if you stay in there tell me something nancy pleaded you were right it was a microdot a piece of film the list is on it we still havent been able to crack the code but all the mechanics of protection have been set up agents in all the major cities of the us are standing ready to provide protection for the people on that list as soon as the names are decoded and now i must get back to my computer she vanished again a lot of good protection will do if it comes too late george muttered as nancy made her report teresas eyes were closed and her lips moved silently three am four bess had fallen asleep even george was drowsing nancy struggled against the heaviness in her eyelids she thought she was awake but all the same the faint creak as the office door opened made her jump dan stood silhouetted in the doorway his face one broad grin its okay theyve cracked the code the fbi has gone to everybodys rescue dan went over and kissed bess awake come on honey im taking you girls home as they headed for the elevator an older man came toward them he was dressed in an immaculate navyblue suit but his tie was askew which one of you is nancy drew he asked nancy stepped forward and he shook her hand firmly a fine job senator kilpatrick said you were good and she was right thanks to you a lot of people are going to sleep better from now on has el morro been caught nancy asked at once youll be hearing all about it in the morning i understand the senators planning a news conference the agent smiled warmly and went back to his office the limousine repeated its ride through the washington streets stop a minute dan ordered as it passed an allnight fastfood restaurant he went in and returned with bags of hamburgers french fries and sodas when they reached the hotel they carried them up to their suite dan intended to sleep on the sittingroom sofa again and teresa would have the other bed in nancys room her chaperon was still being detained for questioning by the time they finished eating the first streaks of light were in the eastern sky i cant go to sleep now can you find out have all the people on the list been warned in time nancy asked dan dan telephoned senator kilpatricks office and in a few minutes turned back to nancy jubilantly its okay we got to em in time so far el morros escaped capture but theres a dragnet out for him at eight oclock this morning the senators going to go on the air to announce that san carloss presidentforlife has fled his palace the revolution is underway but senator kilpatrick has been able to help those political leaders shes been meeting with work out a coalition government so theres no reason for el morro to hang around here especially if hes just a hired assassin george commented right there are a lot of people watching for him at the airports hell probably head for home wherever that is as soon as the senator announces that all five people on the hit list are now under us government protection then well nab him nancy jerked upright five people sure dan rattled them off but there were supposed to be six roberto told senator kilpatrick there were six you probably just heard wrong dan said kindly we didnt dan i beg you call the lab ask if a name could have been taken off the list dan shook his head but he picked up the phone anyway when he turned back to nancy his face had changed you were right there are indications that something was deleted probably some kind of accident when the dot was brought through a radar check theyre putting a crew to work again right now already the gray in the sky was growing paler nancy looked at her watch there wasnt enough time what could the sixth name on the list have been suppose it hadnt been taken off by accident or by mistake who was the most prominent person in the united states working for the peaceful overthrow of the san carlos dictator the realization struck nancy like a blow senator marilyn kilpatrick the person roberto had been trying to smuggle information to senator kilpatrick who in a few more hours would be announcing the dictators flight and the transition of power roberto must have been planning to let senator kilpatrick be murdered maybe he figured that with her out of the way thered be no one to finger him certainly his san carlos associates would have killed him if they discovered hed sold out it was the only thing nancy could come up with to explain the missing name but the main thing was to save the senator what roberto had brought to the us was a photo of the hit list the killer had the original list and the senators name was still on it weve got to warn the senator nancy shouted to dan shes the sixth person im sure of it call her quick dans jaw dropped i dont know where she is nobody seems to she doesnt think shes in any danger so she slipped her guards and went out for an early breakfast somewhere with your father chapter seventeen the world seemed to turn upside down in front of nancys eyes then it righted itself just as at that moment on the tennis court she saw the danger and knew the only thing to do george call the senators office tell them shes on the hit list dan come on nancy dashed for the door george was already on the phone where are we going dan demanded as he and nancy ran down the corridor to find my dad i know the places he likes to eat in dc not waiting for the elevator nancy lunged for the emergency stairs and went down them two at a time dan reached his car and unlocked the doors im driving nancy announced you get on the phone with the feds she ordered dan dan tossed over the keys and jumped into the passenger seat the phone beeped as nancy jerked the car out of its parking space and catapulted it up the runway she was barely conscious of dans voice speaking tersely into the phone receiver nancys eyes were on the road which was already gilded with sunlight her mind clicked along like a computer she knew that senator kilpatrick had scheduled an eight oclock video press conference in her office that meant carson drew must have taken her to eat somewhere nearby someplace he liked near the capitol and the senate office building someplace he knew would be very quiet and private tell the feds to check the monocle and the american caf√© nancy shouted she floored the gas pedal as she roared north on washington street horns honked somewhere behind them a siren sounded dan broke his phone connection and beeped his own police station he identified himself and his car license number crisply requesting blackandwhite on our tail repeat request escort immediately dan gave a code number that nancy guessed meant urgent security business almost at once the police car fell into place behind them its siren magically clearing the way in front heading into dc dan said into the telephone as nancy shot onto the road leading to the arlington memorial bridge and then where to i dont know all nancy knew was that something was driving her as if the car and her subconscious had one common will the watergate i guess just in case its closest golden sun sparkled on the potomac and on the white marble of the statues as they tore across the bridge the kennedy center for the performing arts shimmered peacefully in the sunlight the curved lines of the watergates many balconies glistened they careened to a stop at the hotel entrance and dan leaned out seen senator kilpatrick this morning he called to a uniformed doorman negative nobody important stirring around here yet i just checked the doorman indicated a tiny radio concealed in his hand dan waved to him and pulled his head in again government security undercover on account of the san carlos crowd in town he told nancy the phone beeped dan flipped the loudspeaker button so the voice echoed tinnily through the car negative on american caf√© and monocle ladys own guards cant find her she pulled a cute stunt and shook them dont know who shes with but they must have wanted to be real private privacy was one thing but nancy had a feeling el morro was not as easy to elude as the senators own security people suddenly nancy let out a cry her right hand found the emergency brake and jerked it free as her right foot slammed down again on the gas pedal the car leaped forward where dan yelled the hayadams hotel dad was there last trip the first time hed seen it since it was restored he said something about how beautiful it was and convenient and what a good place to have a conference because you couldnt be overheard by other tables got that dan shouted into the phone left at the next corner then right at the next light he ordered nancy nancy followed his instructions out of nowhere another police car appeared and fell in before them clearing their way nancys hands were frozen on the steering wheel she took the right turn on two tires they raced through central washington the historic hayadams hotel loomed ahead of them nancy screeched to a stop burning rubber against the curb as fast as dan and the other police were getting out of their cars nancy was faster she raced across the sidewalk almost knocking down two people who were in her way then she ran through the entrance doors through the lobby and past a sign directing patrons to a breakfast buffet nancys lungs burned as she exploded into the highceilinged serenity of the victorian restaurant her eyes swept the room suddenly she thought her heart would burst with gratitude there was senator kilpatrick in a pale gray suit reaching for her attach√© case as carson drew rose to pull out her chair something dazzled the way something had dazzled at the tennis court nancy did not risk the splitsecond to look for the location of the gun barrel dad get down she screamed chapter eighteen communication between the drews was as good as always instantly carson drew threw himself forward directly against senator kilpatrick he knocked her to the ground and rolled with her beneath the table just as the shots rang out the bullets hit the crystal goblets on the table they gave a high musical ping as they shattered somebody screamed within seconds police were everywhere but the room was shadowy as police raced in the direction from which the shots had come nancy saw a dark figure leap away dan nancy grabbed his arm as dan swung around the figure came running straight toward nancy the gun was still in his hand suddenly it swung down toward her on a table beside nancy was a vase of red roses almost of its own volition nancys hand snatched up the vase and flung it into the assassins face the gun fired upward exploding crystal drops of a chandelier at the same moment dan leaped forward in a flying tackle soon four burly policemen were cuffing the assassin and reading him his rights the crimson splotches on the carpet were rose petals not blood nancy ran into her fathers arms that night a jubilant party gathered in senator kilpatricks box to watch teresa montenegros triumphant victory in the international semipro womens tennis tournament they had kept their excitement under control during the earlier part of the day in deference to teresas feelings but now with teresa on the court playing her heart out it could break free at least i arrived in time for the celebrating ned nickerson said hugging nancy as teresa prepared for her last game i wish i could have helped you out earlier it helps having you here right now nancy said happily im so glad you came its not just anyone who would fly all the way to dc just for a tennis match ned had phoned as soon as senator kilpatricks delayed press conference had gone off the air the senator visibly shaken but resolute had told the world the full story of how nancy drew had saved her life at the hayadams hotel she had also announced that thanks to nancys quick thinking and the fine cooperation of various federal and local lawenforcement agencies the notorious hired killer el morro had been arrested several lesser terrorists had also been caught up in the federal agents sweep of various american cities the us government and the vast majority of people in san carlos were jubilant the san carlos dictator had fled to someplace unknown in south america bess snuggling in dans arms caught nancys eye and giggled everythings working out well for everybody she said contentedly did you hear that dans leaving the police and taking a permanent job on senator kilpatricks staff hell have to spend a lot of time back in our home state now weve heard about it three times in the past hour george said grinning even se√±ora ramirez has gotten what she deserved bess continued happily teresas chaperon was being extradited to san carlos where the new provisional government would investigate her strong ties to the former dictator but not everything has worked out nancy added her face growing sober involuntarily her eyes went toward the tennis court as far as the cheering crowd knew teresa montenegro about to win the tournament with one of her sizzling backhand returns was on top of the world but there were so many things the crowd didnt know i should have suspected something teresa said to nancy quietly when they were finally alone together in the locker room there was always a part of roberto that was unreachable a side of him i didnt understand i told myself it was because i was still so young now i see that he wanted to protect me by not letting me know too much she glanced at nancy then away he must have been committed to the revolution you know that was why he did what he did he must have thought that if an american senator was assassinated by orders of the dictator then the us government would have to come in on the rebels side nancy didnt answer she was afraid robertos reasons had not been so noble there had been large amounts of money found among his things at the hotel that was one of the things senator kilpatrick had not announced and teresa didnt know about apparently roberto really had been acting as a double agent it still wasnt clear whether he had been murdered on orders of the dictator or of the rebels but he did protect you nancy said gently yes and so did you teresa replied gravely i hope we shall be friends for a long time that was another thing senator kilpatrick had not yet announced thanks to fast action by her with help from carson drew teresa had been granted asylum in the united states george came into the locker room hey you guys havent you gotten your stories straight yet the press is waiting and sos the senator coming teresa gave her hair a quick shake into place and went out to meet her public her head high appropriately teresas press conference was held at a table in the hollins gymnasium right under an american flag almost immediately a reporter asked teresa what her plans were since civil war had broken out in her country teresa glanced at senator kilpatrick who stepped to the microphone im happy to announce that teresa montenegro has requested and been granted us asylum she will enter professional tennis in a few months as an american player america can be very proud to have her what about your san carlos coach who was murdered a reporter shouted he was more than just your coach wasnt he everyone around teresa stiffened but teresas head was high he was my good friend i am honored to have had him as my coach my friend and to have these new friends who are here with me her eyes traveled around the circle the senator carson drew dan and bess george last of all nancy whose hand was linked with neds their eyes met nancy knew that teresas mind like hers was whirling back over the terrorfilled events of the past few days i am very lucky just to be alive teresa said simply and that is due most of all to my friend the what do you call it superstar the superstar detective nancy drew
