chapter one this is exactly what we need bess marvin declared she combed the water out of her shiny blond hair and adjusted the straps of her red and black polkadot bikini fun in the sun on one of the most beautiful beaches in the world mykonos is gorgeous nancy drew agreed rubbing some sunscreen onto her stomach the hunter green twopiece suit she was wearing had seemed so daring when she had bought it back in river heights but it was tame in comparison to the tiny bikinis worn by most of the other women on the beach tall athletic george fayne besss cousin toweled off her dark curly hair then flopped down on the sand in her red racing suit didnt i tell you guys you were going to love greece she asked greece was the third and final main stop on the girls summer of traveling in europe george had gone ahead early from rome joining some italian teenagers on a trip to olympia nancy bess and mick devlin a cute australian guy they had met in geneva had joined her in athens the day before they had arrived on mykonos late that morning just minutes after checking into the hotel athena the girls had changed into their swimsuits rushed down the footpath to the beach at the bottom of the hill and dived into the crystalclear water already nancy could feel the soothing effect of the golden sun that the greek islands were so famous for with a contented sigh she took in the panoramic view sunlight glittered on the turquoise sea and sunbathers stretched out on the pastel sand off to her left a narrow paved road twisted over rocky terrain until it disappeared into clusters of asymmetrical white houses that made up chora the islands main town at the top of the hill behind the beach sat the hotel a square wedding cake of a building two stories high with seaside balconies long wooden shutters and arched doorways it was owned and operated by kostas kavalis and his daughter zoe it was great of zoe to invite us here bess commented lying back on her towel and closing her eyes she seems really nice zoe was a greek girl whom george had met at olympia the two had hit it off and zoe had encouraged george to bring her friends to mykonos for some greek hospitality at her fathers inn when george told nancy and bess about her new friend the girls had decided to spend the last month of their european vacation on mykonos i knew youd like her george said smiling she pointed to a speedboat that skittered over the water pulling a waterskier behind it i cant wait to get out there she said nancy had to admit that the turquoise waters of the aegean sea looked inviting im sure youll get a chance to waterski she said pushing her reddish gold hair back with a pair of black sunglasses weve got a whole month to spend here and im going to kick it off by relaxing with a capital r i hope that means no more cases bess teased after the two mysteries you solved in switzerland and italy i think youve done your share of detective work in europe nancy thought back to the two cases which she already called swiss secrets and rendezvous in rome dealing with blackmailers and jewelry thieves is enough action for one summer she said burying her toes in the warm sand but you know i cant resist when a mystery comes along she was interrupted by a familiar male voice with an australian accent i think ive died and gone to bikini heaven smiling nancy glanced over to see mick devlin coming down the footpath that led to the beach from the hotel just the sight of his blond hair and laughing green eyes sent a pleasant tingle racing through her nancy wasnt sure how it had happened but the gorgeous australian had found his way deeper and deeper into her heart since she first met him in switzerland she hadnt exactly forgotten about ned nickerson her boyfriend back in the states but she wasnt at all sure where things stood with him either have a seat nancy said putting the towel beside her thanks mick peeled off his polo shirt and sprawled in the sand ah this is the life hot sun cool sea beautiful girl he gave nancys hand a squeeze cant think of any way id rather spend a monday afternoon well dont get too cozy nancy teased pulling a book entitled lets see europe out of her tote bag from reading our guidebook i think the islands will keep us pretty busy mick propped himself up on one elbow to read over her shoulder i see what you mean theres snorkeling windsurfing dancing islandhopping sounds great george put in bess cracked open an eye to look at her friends dont forget there are shops and marketplaces to scope out too im dying to check out those quaint little places i saw near the harbor in chora when our ferry came in i thought youd given up shopping nancy teased referring to their experience in rome in a small shop bess had inadvertently exchanged her fake etruscan necklace for a real one which the girls later learned had been stolen as a result their relaxing vacation had turned into a suspenseful search for a jewel thief oh that was another time another country bess said airily nancy laughed maybe we can squeeze in some shopping this afternoon she said shielding her eyes from the sun i dont want to stay out here too long or ill be as crisp as a french fry just then a pretty darkhaired girl appeared on the footpath whos ready for lemonade zoe kavalis asked holding up a plastic thermos in her other hand she carried a straw bag with glasses in it just in the nick of time george said jumping up to help zoe pour that swim definitely made me thirsty zoe handed nancy a glass of lemonade then paused to push a spray of tiny curls out of her eyes a tall fineboned girl with smooth olive skin and brown eyes zoe wore her wavy dark hair coiled at the nape of her neck i thought i would never make it to the beach zoe said unbuttoning her sundress to reveal a royal blue onepiece swimsuit we saw that busload of british tourists at the hotel nancy said were they checking out or in out thank goodness zoe said rolling her eyes in relief papa was happy to have the business but i was not sorry to see a crowd that size go too much work in the distance nancy heard the buzz of an approaching motorboat she looked out over the water and saw a goodsize yellow boat cut in toward the shoreline although she couldnt read the greek letters of the boats name she did make out a fivepointed star painted on the bow zoe glanced over and nancy saw her frown that is theo pattakos hes a fisherman the boat swerved to within a few yards of the shore before the young man aboard cut the engine as he dropped the anchor over the side nancy saw that theo was a solid muscular guy with black hair that was slicked back off his brow his bare chest was tanned a golden brown that seemed even darker against his fluorescent orange swim trunks he called out a greeting and waved exuberantly to all the sunbathers on the beach then he jumped into the water and waded ashore zoe my friend he called his arms open wide to give her an affectionate hug stay away youre all wet zoe said dodging him she didnt seem very glad to see him nancy noticed with a tight smile zoe introduced nancy mick bess and george theos brown eyes twinkled as he smiled at nancy and her friends theologos pattakos water taxi tour boat and fishing boat at your service but everyone calls me theo nancy smiled sounds as if youve got quite a business going theo he nodded toward his boat the sea star is my first love he casually slipped an arm around zoes shoulders adding zoe is my second not anymore zoe said pushing him away nancy noticed the brittle tension in zoes voice as she went on to explain theo and i used to date but now were just friends there was a story here nancy thought but she didnt want to pry do you think you can find the time to take george waterskiing zoe asked theo ill bet shes an excellent waterskier georges eyes lit up with excitement id love to theo waved toward the boat and smiled lets go nancy thought he seemed relieved to get away from the tense situation with zoe a moment later george and theo were speeding out to sea aboard the sea star and now its time for me to take a dip before i go back to work zoe said starting for the water bess decided to join zoe but nancy and mick stretched out on the beach and continued to read nancys guidebook mick pointed to a small islet just east of mykonos on the map dragonisi is so close weve got to see it he said it says here that its uninhabited and riddled with caves might be fun to explore nancy agreed then theres naxos delos tinos she shook her head as she leafed through the pages its a good thing weve got a month to explore they were checking the boat schedule to delos the holy island of the ancient greeks when laughter distracted nancy she looked up to see bess and zoe posing for a roving photographer wait zoe laughed rubbing water out of her eyes after arranging her slick wet hair on one shoulder bess moved closer to zoe and flashed the darkhaired photographer a grin okay shoot bess told him as soon as the photographer handed the instant photo to bess she ran over to nancy and mick you guys have to get your picture taken too bess insisted waving the developing photo at them my treat she knelt down on her beach towel and reached into her tote bag for money such a beautiful couple the photographer said focusing his camera on nancy and mick mick slipped his arm around nancy and mugged for the camera say feta he teased using the greek word for goat cheese once the photographer had snapped their picture bess paid and thanked him carefully saying evcharistó parakaló youre welcome answered the photographer nancy guessed that he was in his early twenties the warm breeze ruffled his curly black hair and crisp white shirt there was an appreciative look on his angular face as he gazed at bess he definitely seemed interested in her looks like romance is in the air nancy whispered to mick thats no surprise he answered with a knowing grin bess has managed to charm half of europe its a pleasure to photograph such beautiful people even if it is my job the photographer told bess lingering by nancys towel im dimitri zorzis the best photographer on mykonos i have a studio in chora where i do much better work than this he gestured at the photos which were now becoming clear oh i dont know bess said studying the picture of zoe and her this is pretty good because of the subjects of course dimitri insisted flashing bess a winning smile you are models no bess answered blushing with pleasure nancy mick and i are just tourists and zoe lives here her father owns the hotel athena dimitri nodded at zoe then gave bess a friendly wink well i hope you will let me know if you want to capture more of your vacation on film he said after slinging his camera over his shoulder he continued on to the next group of sunbathers bess couldnt take her eyes off dimitri as he walked along the beach greek guys are so gorgeous she insisted i could stay on this island forever nancy raised an eyebrow at bess from the way dimitri smiled at you i dont think hed mind at all well youll have a chance to meet many greek people tomorrow night at dinner zoe said it will be a very special occasion a celebration of my cousins engagement you are all invited to join the festivities terrific bess exclaimed zoe pulled on her sundress then picked up the plastic thermos and put the glasses in the straw bag i have to get back to the inn if i can get enough done this afternoon ill be free to spend all of tomorrow with you nodding at the guidebook propped open between nancy and mick zoe asked have you decided what you want to see first how about delos nancy said turning to a page she had marked in the book it says here that theres a boat leaving for the island at tenfifteen each morning sounds good to me bess put in zoe smiled her approval youll like delos it is full of statues mosaics and marble ruins she waved at george who was zipping across the water not far from shore then picked up the tote bag and started up the hill see you at dinner around ninethirty she called then she disappeared up the footpath ninethirty bess groaned by that time i may faint from hunger george warned us that people eat pretty late here nancy said but im sure well find some way to pass the time the afternoon sun was just beginning to wane when george finally swam in from waterskiing mick wanted to linger on the beach but the girls decided to head back to the inn to shower and then explore the town of chora before dinner nancy bess and george were sharing a large airy suite on the second floor of the hotel when they checked in nancy had been charmed by the balcony view of the sea the floortoceiling windows with wooden shutters and the beds covered in crisp white coverlets first one in gets the shower bess called as she turned toward the staircase that led to their room youre on george agreed sprinting after her cousin all three girls raced up the stairs but george pushed ahead reaching the door to their room first to her surprise it was open she stopped short and nancy nearly plowed into her she looked over georges shoulder into the sunny lounge area of their room whoa nancy said under her breath a tumbled mess of clothes covered the sofa and wicker chairs besss nightcase was upside down on the floor nancy stepped forward and squatted just inches away from a tan puddle near the case whats this my makeup bess gasped joining nancy a bottle of beige foundation lotion lay splattered on the wooden floor beside it sat tangled strings of beads and rhinestones someones been in our room george observed frowning and theyve been going through my luggage bess said nancy froze as she heard the sound of running water coming from their bathroom wait a minute she whispered motioning for her friends to remain still her eyes flew to the bathroom door which was open a crack were not alone nancy whispered someones in the bathroom chapter two adrenaline made nancys heart pound as she peered toward the bathroom whoever was in there could be dangerous come on nan george whispered inching out the open door bess was already in the hallway as nancy backed away she got a glimpse of the intruder it was a girl a petite brunette with shortcropped straight hair she was wearing a crisp white uniform with a blue apron nancy felt a surge of relief the girl wasnt a thief she was a maid taking a step forward nancy opened the bathroom door wide at the same instant the girl shut off the water and turned around she blanched when she came facetoface with nancy oh she gasped clutching a wet cloth in her hands i didnt hear you come in nancy crossed her arms over her chest and stared at the girl we werent expecting maid service since we just checked in this afternoon just checked in yes well welcome to mykonos the girl nodded then walked past nancy and nervously knelt beside the puddle of spilled makeup im very sorry about this mess i bumped into the case and it fell open nancy watched the maid as she started dabbing at the puddle from the young womans red face nancy could tell that she was embarrassed and from the mess in the room it was obvious to nancy that the girl hadnt knocked over besss luggage she had been going through it but why george poked her head into the room surveyed the situation then joined nancy the maid seemed afraid to look up she rubbed the wooden floor until not a trace of makeup remained then said i just came to your room to bring you extra towels and some fresh fruit zoe wanted her american friends to feel welcome nancy glanced over at the low wooden table a stack of white towels and a wide bowl filled with oranges bananas and grapes sat on the tabletop that was nice of zoe she said then she looked pointedly at the mess on the floor the maid began to fumble with the snarled necklaces on the floor bess exchanged a look with nancy and george then bent down to help the maid return the jewelry to the overnight case well it looks like everything is here and okay dont worry about it she told the girl my name is bess marvin and this is nancy drew and george fayne niki christofouros the maid introduced herself scrambling to her feet and nodding at the girls nancy looked carefully at the girl she had large black eyes lined with dark makeup which gave her a mysterious look with her high cheekbones and stylish bob nancy thought that niki looked as if she had stepped off the cover of a fashion magazine thanks for the fruit nancy said deciding not to press the issue tell zoe that we feel very much at home here yes ill tell her niki promised edging away then she disappeared out the door george closed the door then glanced around the room whats her problem she was acting strange nancy agreed bess was sifting through her open suitcase there doesnt seem to be anything missing but why was she going through my stuff thats exactly what i was wondering nancy said as she sank down onto one of the rooms three beds and why just your stuff bess george wanted to know she didnt touch ours probably because she has excellent taste bess said with a mischievous look nancy groaned and tossed a pillow at bess who batted it away with her hands this is serious arent you the least bit suspicious nancy asked lighten up nan bess said this is our vacation she slipped into the bathroom calling out ive got the first shower an hour later dressed in shorts tshirts and sneakers nancy bess and george were ready to hike into chora armed with their guidebook and instructions from zoe the girls set off on the milelong walk to town did you guys notice the tension between zoe and that guy theo before nancy asked as they trudged uphill on a paved road that crossed the rocky hillside bess nodded i got the feeling that zoe resents him maybe they didnt break up on great terms when we were in olympia zoe did mention something about a guy who broke things off george said theo seems like a nice guy though bess wiggled her eyebrows suggestively at her cousin thats a rave from you she said do i detect the start of a new romance no way george raised her hands defensively kevins the only guy on my mind these days george really liked her boyfriend sports commentator kevin davis even if there had been a lot of strain between them because kevins job required him to travel frequently nancy knew that george was serious about their relationship well i think theos adorable bess said she giggled and added sos dimitri face it bess george said youre in love with love they had just rounded a crest in the road and nancy could see mykonoss distinctive white windmills in the distance the five round towers seemed to dominate the harbor from their perch on a hill below the windmills dazzling snow white buildings hugged the shoreline as the girls continued the countryside gave way to meandering alleyways lined with cubeshaped houses cars were restricted from the cobblestone streets but the area was busy with tourists local merchants and people leading donkeys with food and supplies strapped to their backs zoe told me that the buildings are whitewashed to protect them from the sun george said as they passed one house she also warned me about the zigzagging streets nancy added they were just passing a narrow twisting lane they were originally designed to foil pirate raiders so its easy to get lost if you dont watch where youre going dont worry bess said the maze of streets may have confused pirates but a determined shopper will always find her way following zoes directions the girls turned down matoyianni the main street of town shops cafés and bakeries stretched out in front of them the greek alphabet so different from english made it impossible for the girls to read the signs and letters painted on shop windows but nancy noticed that the vendors managed to get their messages across by displaying their merchandise oh wait a minute bess said stopping in front of a stationery store thats the most adorable statue ive ever seen nancy paused to see what had caught besss eye in the window of the small shop sat a tiny white replica of one of mykonoss windmills it was surrounded by miniature white houses fish boats and even a pelican it is an amazing piece of craftsmanship she agreed ill bet the sails even move bess said i wish id cashed some travelers checks but i left them in the safe at the hotel i dont have much greek currency just a few drachmas thank goodness george said with an exaggerated sigh otherwise wed have to hire a donkey to carry your purchases back to the inn nancy and george followed as bess went into the shop the small room was jammed with floortoceiling shelves stocked with international newspapers magazines postcards and writing paper an elderly man with white hair and a wooden pipe clenched between his teeth sat next to a counter against one wall when bess pointed out the windmill to the shopkeeper he handed it to her so she could have a closer look i make he said pointing to his chest you did bess said oh i love it this is the perfect birthday gift for my mother her blue eyes sparkled until she saw the price i guess ill have to come back after i change more money she told the elderly shopkeeper after thanking him for his help the girls left the shop i wish he hadnt put it back on display bess said pausing outside the shop as the shopkeeper reached down and replaced the statue in the window what if someone else buys it relax bess nancy assured her why dont you cash a travelers check at the hotel if theres time we can make a quick trip back here before dinner the gorgeous american girls a familiar voice interrupted nancy nancy turned and immediately recognized dimitri the photographer from the beach his dark curls glistened in the sunlight thats us bess said grinning at him would you like a photo here in chora dimitri asked raising his camera no thanks nancy replied we were just doing some shopping ah in the shop of my good friend spiros dimitri said nodding at the stationery store that is my studio just above he pointed to a narrow white stone staircase along the side of the building that led to a room just above the shop bess brightened you have your own studio of course dimitri boasted never taking his eyes off bess i need a darkroom for my business i have all the latest equipment id love to see the studio bess told him could you give us a little tour now dimitri hesitated ive been very busy today its a mess a group of japanese tourists caught dimitris eye and he excused himself to snap a few photographs i will see you later i hope he told bess nancy was surprised at dimitris abrupt switch one minute the guy was melting over bess the next minute he seemed to freeze bess had noticed his behavior too i cant decide if he was trying to get a date or give me the brushoff she said shrugging she added well im not going to let it ruin my day come on guys the main street ended at a busy waterfront strip the crescentshaped harbor was ringed by hotels cafés and tavernas small fishing boats skimmed along the water it all looked tempting nancy wasnt quite sure which way to turn first bess persuaded nancy and george to go into a pastry shop after all she reminded them as they walked inside and peered into a glass case full of cakes and honey pastries we wont be eating dinner for a few more hours after buying honeyed pastries called baklava the girls turned back up the main street retracing their steps through the maze of narrow lanes toward the hotel we might as well go straight to the office bess said when they reached the hotel half an hour later i can get my travelers checks and passport for id for security reasons the hotel requested that all valuables including passports be left in the office safe the three girls entered the arched double doors of the main building and went to the lobby desk which was a crescentshaped cutaway in one of the stucco walls zoe was behind the tiled counter bent over the registration book when bess told her about the miniature she had found in chora zoe smiled and closed the registration book you should probably take your passports with you when you leave the hotel grounds zoe told them but ill be happy to cash your travelers checks let me get your envelope from the safe she disappeared through a doorway behind the front desk zoe returned a few minutes later a grim frown on her face whats the matter nancy asked its the safe zoe told her someone has broken into it chapter three oh no bess cried she and george exchanged a look of alarm i dont know how it happened zoe said we always keep that safe locked but when i went to dial the combination the door just swung open george shot nancy and bess a worried look our passports were in there she pointed out and our travelers checks has anything been stolen nancy asked zoes brown eyes were filled with worry i dont know many things were left behind maybe nothing was stolen at all she said hopefully ill have to check the contents of the safe against our log book reaching under the counter she pulled out a fat notebook and turned to a page with dozens of entries penciled in looks as if that will take a while george said do you want us to help would you mind zoe asked looking grateful the inventory will go faster that way nancy bess and george joined zoe behind the checkin counter then followed her through the doorway and into the back office the rosy light of dusk streamed into the room through the slats of a shaded window on the wall just inside the door was a board with hooks for extra keys to the guest rooms a metal safe rested on the floor in the far corner behind a desk covered with stacks of invoices and registration forms first let me remove everything zoe said she knelt down beside the square gray safe and pulled out a plastic carton containing stacks of manila envelopes nancy bess and george gathered around zoe as she stood and placed the carton on the desk i cant stand the suspense bess said flipping through the envelopes to find the one marked with her name me either george said she found her envelope and nancys and pulled both out checking in her pouch nancy was relieved to find her passport and travelers checks just as shed left them she leafed through the passport noting the visas stamped on the bluegreen pages printed with a bald eagle everythings here she reported mine checks out too george said when bess said nothing nancy looked over at her besss mouth had fallen open and there was a look of shock on her face my passports missing she said in a horrified whisper are you sure nancy asked she leaned over besss shoulder as bess looked into the envelope once again the travelers checks were there nancy saw but besss passport was gone maybe it ended up in someone elses envelope zoe said hopefully george nodded toward the open ledger lets go over the inventory and see as zoe read off the names written in greek in the inventory ledger george and bess checked the contents of each envelope while they worked nancy paced the office looking for a clue as to who might have tampered with the hotel safe kneeling beside the safe she looked inside and ran her fingers over the walls of the empty interior since there was no damage to the safe nancy deduced that either someone knew the combination or was an expert at combination locks whoever it was must have been in a hurry she thought since they hadnt even closed the safe who has the combination to the safe nancy asked zoe just my father and me zoe answered do you remember who opened the safe last zoe frowned not really things were so hectic today with that british tour group checking out and a few families checking in i must have gone into the safe nearly a dozen times myself but its not like papa or me to forget and leave it unlocked she returned to the inventory with grim determination lets see if anything else is missing she said a diamond necklace bess remarked as a glittering necklace spilled out of one envelope weve come across a lot of cash too george added its hard to believe that a thief would leave all this behind good point nancy thought checking the area around the safe a shelf of ledgers seemed undisturbed as did the wooden file cabinet beside the safe it looked as if whoever had opened the safe and stolen besss passport knew exactly where to look for it and it wouldnt be hard for a staff member to watch zoe or her father open the safe and remember the combination who uses this room nancy asked zoe my father uses it as an office and sometimes the desk clerks and the cleaning staff come in here zoe explained they need extra keys from the board when there arent enough master keys to go around nancy immediately thought of niki christofouros since she was one of the hotels maids no one would question her appearance in the office and the girls had caught her going through besss luggage what if niki had been trying to steal besss passport once she saw that it wasnt in the room maybe she had looked in the hotel safe the question was why would she do such a thing nancy decided not to say anything about niki for the moment she didnt want to implicate the girl without solid evidence since niki could lose her job over this just to be safe though nancy suggested that zoe question the entire hotel staff in the meantime nancy would do some of her own checking on niki oh no not another one bess groaned a few minutes later she held up an envelope marked leo nelson his passport is missing too she told zoe george was frowning into another envelope make that three missing passports she said joseph seidels isnt in his envelope zoe circled the two names on her inventory sheet two american men and bess she said wearily luckily the remaining envelopes contained everything they were supposed to when the girls were finished zoe pushed away the list and leaned back in the desk chair so three passports were stolen in all i cant believe this is happening its not good for the hotel if word gets out well lose customers not to mention the fact that three passports are now in the hands of strangers george said bess drew her breath in sharply i dont like the idea of someone using my passport illegally she said in a shaky voice youll need to get a new one george advised her leaning over zoe squeezed besss hand im so sorry she said the police will know the best way to report it to your embassy just then a tall husky man with saltandpepper hair walked into the room he assessed the scene a bewildered expression on his face then addressed zoe in rapidfire greek she answered nodding at nancy bess and george as she talked this is my father kostas kavalis zoe said introducing the man to nancy bess and george mr kavalis gave each of the girls a hearty handshake im very sorry about your passport bess i will report it to the police immediately he glanced back at zoes list and frowned i must notify those two american men too shaking his head zoes father went into the front office to call the police nancy sat down on the edge of the desk and mulled over the situation three passports had been taken but dozens of others had been left behind the thief hadnt touched any of the cash or jewels either it didnt make sense what are you thinking nan george asked just that the thief seemed to know exactly what he or she was looking for and where to find it i hope the police can tell us why someone would take three passports and leave everything else i hope so too zoe said this is very upsetting nancy turned to zoe please dont be insulted zoe but under the circumstances id feel a lot better if george and i could keep our passports and travelers checks with us of course zoe said i understand perfectly she went through the envelopes and handed nancy and george theirs when an officer finally arrived nancys questions had to wait until a barrage of greek questions and answers had flown among zoe her father and the policeman zoe introduced the uniformed man as officer rossolatos at last officer rossolatos turned to bess he was a heavyset grayhaired man with a wide curled mustache in heavily accented english he instructed her to report her stolen passport to the us embassy in athens if you tell them your passport number there will be no problem to replace it he said my passport number bess repeated worriedly i was supposed to write it down i knew there was something i forgot to do before we left river heights why dont you call the embassy now mr kavalis offered i will help you he grabbed the carton of guests valuables and these i will put in the safe in our apartment he added gravely where no one else can get to them nancy knew this was her chance to question the officer excuse me but dont you think its odd that the thief left with only three passports she asked him officer rossolatos seemed surprised by nancys question until zoe explained that nancy was a detective in the united states a detective on our island we are honored he said bowing graciously he went on to explain in the criminal world american passports are prized because they allow access to the united states they also allow easier passage through europe so you think besss passport will be used by a stranger george asked coming over to stand next to nancy it is very likely officer rossolatos answered they will change the photo of course sometimes they take the booklet apart and replace the entire photo page inserting a new name and address too there are many ways to forge a passport forgery nancys mind reeled at the prospect of besss passport in the hands of criminals what if a crime was committed by someone using besss identity bess could be in serious trouble nancy didnt have much to go on but she decided to watch out for any clues that might lead her to the trail of the missing passports by the time bess made her call and the police report was complete it was too late to make another trip back into chora the girls decided to take it easy and have a late dinner in the hotels taverna nancy went to get mick in his room and soon the teenagers were sitting at a table on a terrace that overlooked the aegean sea we just got here and already you girls are involved in a mystery mick said after the girls told him about the passport theft it is a mystery zoe added i spoke to the hotel staff and no one has any clue as to who might have broken into the safe nancy finished buttering a roll then turned to zoe did anyone seem upset by your questions not really zoe replied but one of the maids niki christofouros seemed nervous when i mentioned besss name bess exchanged a curious look with nancy weve met niki nancy said without mentioning how she didnt want to get the maid into trouble unless she had more to go on im beginning to feel like one of those people in casablanca who cant escape until their papers come bess said stabbing a tomato in her greek salad i must have tried to reach the embassy a dozen times but i couldnt get through to them our phone system is unreliable zoe told her especially during the busy summer season youll get through eventually bess tried to smile thanks for cashing my travelers checks even though i dont have my passport she told zoe i hope that miniature windmill wont be sold before tomorrow this store it contains many tiny replicas boats and fish and things thats the one bess said nodding excitedly it is owned by a man named spiros he is a friend of my fathers zoe continued if you like i will call spiros and ask him to hold the windmill for you she offered would you bess asked tell him ill stop by as soon as we get back from delos tomorrow zoe nodded its the least i can do i hope this theft doesnt ruin your stay here in mykonos george looked over at bess who was smiling at a passing waiter i dont think theres any chance of that she said nancy was awakened early tuesday morning by the sounds of the island coming to life after throwing back the crisp white sheets she pushed open the wooden shutters and stepped onto the balcony all around her mykonos was bustling hotel workers wheeled carts of food along the path below her to her left three mopeds raced up the hill toward chora motorboats and sailboats zigzagged through the shimmering sea on the horizon and a group of college guys jogged along the beach she was watching the joggers when she spotted a young man and woman standing in the sand at the bottom of the path from the hotel from their gesturing arms they seemed to be arguing though nancy couldnt hear them from the balcony she blinked as she recognized the white uniform and blue apron worn by the maids at the hotel the girl was niki nancy realized and she was talking to dimitri the photographer curious nancy leaned against the balcony rail and watched niki was shaking her head adamantly she reached into a large tote bag took out a manila envelope and thrust it into dimitris hands then she waved dimitri off turned away and stalked up the path to the inn whats inside that envelope nancy wondered it was certainly large enough to contain three passports and considering nikis suspicious behavior nancy wouldnt be surprised if the maid was the one who had stolen the passports she still didnt know why niki would steal them but she was definitely going to try to find out wake up you guys nancy said going back into the room while bess and george sleepily got out of bed nancy told them what she had just seen that definitely seems suspicious bess said pushing her hair back with a headband and going into the bathroom to wash her face george glanced at the watch resting on her bedside table too bad we cant do anything about it now we still have to get dressed and eat breakfast and bess has to call the embassy in athens she said wed better hurry if were going to catch the boat to delos at tenfifteen two hours later nancy stood beside mick on the deck of a thirtyfoot fishing boat that was used as a ferry in the summer tourists milled along the deck taking in the sunshine and the views bess george and zoe stood by the rail tossing bread crumbs to the gulls that flew alongside the boat while nancy and mick watched as nancy turned toward mick he slipped an arm around her shoulders and pulled her close look at you with your white sundress and golden tan he said youre beginning to look like an aussie girl i hope thats good nancy said good you look fabulous nancy couldnt help thinking that he looked pretty good himself in his khaki shorts and white tshirt were almost there zoe said joining nancy and mick as the boat nosed toward a bare green island that was no more than a few miles long already nancy could see the ruins of a huge pillared building on a hill above the tiny harbor it doesnt look as busy as mykonos bess observed zoe nodded delos is mostly a museum once the tourists leave at the end of the day its deserted except for a small hotel government guards who protect the ruins and the lizards who live among the ruins ugh bess groaned lizards dont worry they dont bite zoe said with a laugh as the boat docked the teenagers moved toward the ramp where the other passengers were beginning to gather they waited at the back of the crowd for their chance to disembark nancy was just about to step onto the walkway when she noticed the uniformed guards stopping the passengers as they got off the boat whats going on over there she asked zoe the greek girl frowned in confusion those men are from the delos police she said but they dont usually question tourists i wish i could hear what theyre saying i can mick said wheeling back toward bess theyre asking for passports george craned her neck to see over the crowd it looks as if theyre turning one couple away the color drained from besss face passports but were still in greece i didnt think id need a passport for this i dont understand zoe said as the group hesitated at the edge of the gangway they usually dont check passports here what am i going to do bess asked worriedly that stolen passport is going to ruin the rest of my trip chapter four nancy took another look at the two guards they were wearing khaki uniforms and had stem expressions on their faces she hoped they were friendlier than they looked tell them the truth bess that your passport was stolen nancy advised taking bess by the arm and walking down the ramp with her relax we wont leave you at the end of the gangway the two girls paused before the officers passports one officer a young man asked curtly while nancy turned her passport over for inspection bess began talking rapidly trying to explain about her stolen passport the two guards seemed utterly confused until zoe stepped in and translated speaking to them in greek at last she turned back to bess they dont want to let you on the island she said apologetically they say they cannot allow a security risk today nancy blinked bess a security risk she was about to defend her friend when mick stepped up to the guards and handed over his passport i can vouch for this young lady officer he said clapping a hand on besss shoulder the young officer was ready to dismiss him but his partner an older man paused and pointed to the diplomats seal on micks passport nancy could see that the guards were impressed in geneva nancy had learned that micks father was an australian diplomat would the greek police dare to cross someone with diplomatic ties she held her breath as the young officer clapped micks passport shut and returned it to him you may go he told bess in heavily accented english but you must contact the american embassy today to get new papers i will i mean i already did bess said backing away a moment later the rest of the group had passed the guards inspection nancy gave a huge sigh that was a close call she said as they clambered along the dirt landing next to the ramp i wonder why they beefed up security today george asked glancing back at the police officers good question nancy said for a brief moment she wondered if there was some link between the security check and besss stolen passport then she shook herself not everything that happened in the world was a mystery the group paused at the ticket kiosk just a few yards away from the dock and zoe helped everyone count out the entrance fee then nancy turned toward the islands ruins delos was the religious center of ancient greece zoe explained most of the buildings here were built to honor the gods huge festivals were held with singers dancers processions horse races and athletic contests the island is small so we can tour it on foot in a few hours just lead the way bess said cheerfully following zoe as she took a right turn from the boat landing in the harbor nancy smiled glad that sightseeing seemed to be taking besss mind off the passport problem soon after nancy too was absorbed by the houses they visited with colorful mosaics and geometrically patterned tiles the group worked their way through the many houses that were scattered along the uphill path to mount kynthos the tallest point on the island nancy was nearly out of breath by the time she reached the summit but when she stood overlooking the entire island she knew it was worth the climb the mixture of green fields and smooth marble ruins made delos a land that time forgot youve been awfully quiet mick said coming up to her and placing his hands on her shoulders i guess ive been daydreaming nancy said can you imagine what it must have been like to live on this island two thousand years ago so youre drawn to faraway places eh id love to show you australia sometime mick stepped around to face nancy and took her hands in his promise me youll come visit nancy laughed oh sure ill just jet over when i have a free weekend im not kidding mick said his expression serious he actually meant it she realized mick id love to see australia but dont worry about details he said placing a finger over her lips well work it out nancy was thoughtful as she and mick followed the others down the hill toward lush palm groves soon they arrived at a walkway lined by six grand sculptures of lions stretching toward the east this is called the terrace of the lions zoe explained its hard to believe theyre two thousand years old bess said still thinking of micks invitation nancy didnt say much as the others commented on the statues mick was suddenly quiet too he wandered to one of the far lions while george zoe and bess strolled on heading back toward the harbor nancy was about to follow when she spotted a photographer with curly black hair poised behind the base of one of the lions she moved around the lion until she was face to face with dimitri yásou he said greeting her in greek as he adjusted a camera tripod you are one of the american girls staying in mykonos no thats right nancy said her eyes skimming over dimitris bags of equipment he was using a sophisticated camera with a long lens no more pictures of tourists nancy asked him not today today im taking beautiful photographs which i will make into postcards in my studio he said proudly this guy loves to exaggerate nancy thought dont you need special equipment to make postcards she asked of course he agreed but my studio is the best on the island of mykonos one of the best in all of greece it has everything i need including everything you need for forging passports nancy wondered remembering the envelope she had seen niki hand him on the beach that morning id love to see it she said watching dimitri carefully in the states im an amateur photographer she was bending the truth but she thought that dimitri might believe her instead he seemed to withdraw my equipment is far too technical to interest you im a fast learner nancy insisted it is not a good idea dimitri said forcing a smile nancy had the distinct impression that there was something in his studio that dimitri didnt want her to see just then mick came around the statue and took nancys hand wed better get going if we want to catch up with the others he said after saying goodbye to dimitri nancy and mick continued down the stonepaved path toward the boat landing during the ride back to mykonos she mulled over the encounter with dimitri if his studio contained equipment that could make postcards it had to be fairly sophisticated maybe sophisticated enough to create a good replica of a passport page that thought was still nagging at her when the teens sat down to a late lunch at the hotels taverna zoe had decided to join her father so nancy mick george and bess shared a table you look as if youre lost in space george told nancy as she passed around a platter of moussaká a casserole made of layers of eggplant and ground meat covered in a zesty sauce ive been thinking about besss passport and wondering who on this island could pull off a forgery nancy said lowering her voice she shared her thoughts about dimitris studio all that special equipment could come in handy for passport forgeries especially if he has three american passports to work with wow bess said stabbing a chunk of juicy eggplant do you think hes the forger its possible george said niki had access to the room with the safe and nancy saw her give something to dimitri this morning maybe she agreed to steal the passports and sell them to him nancy had been thinking the same thing i still dont have any proof though i really want to check out dimitris studio he was reluctant when i said i wanted to see it so maybe the stolen passports are there mick finished for her would the forger have to be on this island george asked i mean maybe the thief took the passports to athens to have them altered maybe nancy agreed but we saw the beefedup security on delos today if security is that tight all over theres a good chance that the thief and the passports are still on mykonos after lunch bess decided to go to chora to purchase the windmill from spiross shop zoe and george had already decided to stay behind and squeeze in a swim before the engagement party that night but mick and nancy opted to go along with bess when they got to the town the labyrinthine streets were empty except for a few dogs napping in shaded doorways thats right nancy said slapping her forehead zoe told us yesterday that its just like in italy the businesses close up for siesta from two to five maybe the shop with my windmill is open though bess said hopefully but when they reached spiross shop the door was locked and the lights were off mick peered through the glass door into the darkness whats next he asked nancy was beginning to think the trip would be a waste of time but as her gaze landed on the buildings second story she murmured id still like to check out dimitris studio looking up and down the deserted street mick said maybe he hasnt returned from delos yet he climbed the narrow white staircase that led to the studio door then knocked and if no ones home whats the harm in having a quick look when no one answered mick looked through the window next to the door i dont see anyone he said he reached through the open window stretched and turned the bolt on the door so much for security he said and grinned he pushed the door open and leaned inside the coast is clear but he could turn up while were snooping around nancy turned to bess why dont you stay out here and keep a lookout okay bess sat in a shady spot at the bottom of the stairs while nancy joined mick at the door but try to make it quick im roasting inside the studio the first thing nancy noticed was the wide array of equipment in the shadowed light she could see a large copy machine a paper cutter a light box an overhead projector and other equipment fake background drops were stacked in one corner although nancy wasnt an expert she could see that dimitri hadnt exaggerated about his studio pretty impressive she murmured from the way mick whistled through his teeth she could tell that he agreed this color copier is really something he said leaning over the huge machine this baby can do anything it can make copies bigger smaller darker lighter hardly the type of thing youd expect to find in a vacation resort ill bet mick was interrupted by besss loud voice dimitri oh good ive been waiting for you quick mick whispered hes coming nancys eyes darted to the back of the studio looking for a way out she saw only a solid windowless wall mick theres no back door she whispered just then she heard footsteps on the stairs nancys heart raced as she and mick dropped to the floor behind the huge copy machine they were trapped and there was no way out chapter five nancy hunched behind the machine holding her breath she could barely make out besss voice over the pounding in her own ears its really important bess said persuasively its such a beautiful day you know what we call in america a kodak moment i just have to capture it on film can you take my picture standing next to the fishing boats in the harbor im sure that would be a beautiful photo dimitri said gushing with flattery but can we do it later ive just returned from delos and i need to unload but this camera will be perfect bess persisted youll need a good camera to capture the bright sunlight the deep blue sea and me after a moments pause dimitri sighed for you i will do it he said at last way to go bess nancy thought she and mick stayed hidden until they heard the footsteps retreat its a good thing dimitri has a thing for bess mick whispered when the coast was clear otherwise wed be dead meat right now nancy stood up and brushed off her sundress i want to finish checking out this equipment she told mick wed better hurry she wasnt surprised to see a small darkroom with vats of processing solution in addition to the color copier she found a hotglue gun a giant stapler used to bind books and a machine with the word artograph embossed on it ive seen that before in art studios mick said tapping the artograph its used to project an image on paper or canvas so that the artist can trace over it with this machine dimitri could copy just about any design nancy let out a low whistle including anything that might be used for passport paper heres a laminating machine too and acetate she added lifting up a sheet of clear plastic from a shelf along the wall this is the stuff they use for that clear plastic coating over a passport photo this studio has a lot more equipment than a simple island photographer would need mick said dimitri could definitely be using it to forge passports nancy was searching the row of file cabinets along one wall she opened one drawer and pulled out a basket containing thick darning needles and twine a sewing basket she said shaking her head as she stuffed it back into the drawer i still havent found anything that directly relates to passports such as printed passport covers or that patterned paper they use for the pages even discarded passport photos nancy answered mick picked up an envelope from the top of a worktable and looked inside this might fit the bill he said excitedly pictures of a young woman a rather attractive one at that what nancy spun around to look at the two sheets of photographic paper he was holding those are contact sheets nancy said photographers use them all the time that way they can look at the negativesize prints and decide what they want to blow up she looked closer at the square shots of a girls face its niki that maid you were talking about mick asked the one who gave dimitri an envelope nancy nodded she must have handed him this envelope dont you see mick dimitri is probably going to slip one of these photos onto besss passport so niki can get into america nancy and mick searched the rest of the studio for the stolen passports but came up emptyhanded besides the photos of niki they found a few packets of portraits but nothing that might be used as a passport photo we still dont have nearly enough evidence to go to the police nancy said sighing with disappointment well just have to keep an eye on dimitri and see if we can catch him in the act were so lucky to be included in a family party bess said as the girls left their room that evening zoe said that therell be folk music and maybe even some platethrowing george added she led the way to the terraced lawn adjoining the inns taverna as they crossed the hotel grounds nancy had to admit that it was a perfect night for an engagement party the winedark sea the lemonscented air and the starry sky were a romantic backdrop perfect for two people who were going to be married the party area was festooned with hanging baskets of flowers and flickering candles a long buffet table was arranged along one side of the dance floor which had been set on the patio near the taverna although nancy couldnt see them she could smell the smoke of fire pits on the far side of vinecovered trellises i dont see zoe nancy said scanning the crowd of guests who were milling about the tables laughing and talking she was eager to fill zoe in on what she and mick had discovered in dimitris studio she must be helping out inside george guessed nancy didnt see niki either but she hoped the maid was there she wanted to talk to her as soon as possible about the photos and besss stolen passport nancy bess and george found mick at a small table clinking glasses with theo dressed in a coppercolored linen shirt and smart black jeans mick looked heartbreakingly handsome join us theo said standing up to pull some chairs over for the girls he was wearing formal black slacks and a white cotton shirt that showed off his tan you look smashing mick whispered in nancys ear as she sat next to him nancy smoothed the skirt of her royal blue minidress are you trying to get on my good side devlin she teased grinning at mick who me mick said innocently he waved at a passing waiter and ordered three soft drinks for nancy bess and george theo was just telling me about dragonisi the islet off the coast of mykonos mick told the girls hes been spending a lot of time fishing there nancy tried to remember what she had read about dragonisi in her guidebook isnt that the deserted islet thats riddled with caves not to mention a legendary dragon bess added theo laughed the dragon hasnt been seen for hundreds of years but the caves are worth exploring dragonisi is isolated very romantic mick placed his hand over nancys just the spot for us eh nancy sounds great she agreed turning to bess and george she said i know we decided that we wanted to visit naxos too what do you guys think want to give dragonisi a shot not me bess said tucking her blond hair behind her ears im taking the noon flight to athens tomorrow to get a new passport from the american embassy remember after what happened on delos im not taking any more chances im going with bess george added but theres no point in all of us springing for airfare back to athens we can plan on hitting naxos on thursday turning to nancy and mick she added but you guys might as well go ahead and visit dragonisi tomorrow tomorrow it is mick said with a wide smile can we hire you to take us there he asked theo tomorrow theo stared down at the table im sorry but i cant do it nancy saw that theo was suddenly uncomfortable with the conversation although she didnt know why well then well just have to find another boat since dragonisi is not to be missed mick said ill ask zoe if she has any suggestions did i hear my name zoe asked stopping by their table she was wearing a strapless dress in a deep shade of scarlet mick explained about their plans for the following day and theo cannot take you zoe asked narrowing her dark eyes when he said nothing zoe quickly assured mick that she would make the arrangements for the boat well pack a lunch for you and nancy to take along that would be great nancy said excusing herself she rose from the table and stepped aside with zoe she summarized what had happened that afternoon then asked do you remember seeing niki in the office yesterday when the passports were stolen niki zoe thought for a moment then shook her head i dont remember but its not something i would notice my father and i trust our staff she seemed offended that nancy suspected a staff member zoe time is important nancy said trying to make her understand we might be able to recover besss passport before it falls into the wrong hands if nikis involved its important that i talk to her as soon as possible zoe hesitated you cant talk to her now she told nancy today is nikis day off she took the ferry to tinos to visit her aunt stifling a sigh of disappointment nancy asked when will she be back tomorrow morning you can speak with her then zoe relented ill arrange it then she reached out and squeezed nancys hand for now please just try to enjoy the party all this talk of crime is not good on such a lovely night with that zoe turned back to the crowd at the table and announced please help yourself to the food the goat has been roasting for hours and its been cooked to perfection bess grinned i thought i smelled something delic she paused her blue eyes concerned did you say goat not your everyday river heights fare george said heading over to the buffet table but it does smell great as nancy and the others stood in line for food the smoke of the charbroiled meat made nancys mouth water in addition to the grilled goat meat there was chicken stewed in tomato sauce potatoes rice and the classic greek salad of tomatoes cucumbers black olives onions and feta cheese before long the teenagers were back at their table their plates heaped with food you know theo george said dipping a hunk of crusty bread into the olive oil from her salad were relying on you to teach us some authentic greek dances bess looked over at the dance floor where a few guests were already moving in time to the soft music the trio of musicians was made up of a violinist a clarinetist and a man who played an instrument that resembled bagpipes id love to learn but the steps look awfully complicated its not so difficult a good dancer listens to the heart theo said his eyes twinkling i am sure you can handle that bess ill give it my best shot bess said as soon as everyone finished eating zoe brought the group over to introduce them to her cousin helena and helenas fiancé petros while bess and george were talking with the bridetobe nancy stole away for a word with zoes father she asked if he had heard from the police about besss passport but he didnt have any news finally nancy joined her friends on the dance floor for the moment she was at a dead end she decided that she might as well take zoes advice and have a good time zoe was walking the group through the steps of the stae tria one of the most popular greek dances with their hands on one anothers shoulders all the dancers formed a wide circle the band was playing a slow song so it was easier to follow along at first youre doing well zoe said as george kicked at the air one two three kick kick bess counted aloud laughing when she missed a step nancy counted along trying to get the hang of the dance she couldnt help laughing too the lively beat of the music filled the air until almost all the guests joined the circle theo added some dramatic effects leaping through the air and slapping his feet on the floor gradually nancy fell into the rhythm of the dance the complicated steps seemed more and more natural as mick cheered her on to her amazement one man danced among the crowd with a bottle balanced on his head two other men danced around with dinner plates which they smashed against a wall with bravado the song ended and applause and cheers erupted from the crowd the platebreaking is a greek custom called spasimo zoe explained we try to keep it at a minimum or else well run out of dishes ill bet nancy said laughing the dancers were applauding the band when nancy noticed a sudden movement in the shadows beyond the trellis at the edge of the lawn she squinted into the darkness and suddenly she saw a figure is something wrong mick asked noticing the expression on her face but before nancy could answer the stranger stepped out of the shadows he was tall with wavy brown hair and a muscular physique moving onto the candlelit dance floor he tapped george on the shoulder george spun around and her mouth fell open kevin chapter six nancy could hardly believe it it was kevin davis georges boyfriend without a second thought george flung herself into kevins arms he held her close for a tender kiss then whirled her around im glad you remember me he teased what are you doing here george asked breathlessly i thought you were on assignment i am i have to meet up with my tv crew on sunday in madrid until then im all yours aside from a quick interview i need to do in athens terrific george stood aside as the others rushed over to say hello to kevin no sooner had he been introduced to mick theo and zoe than the band launched into a slow romantic ballad within seconds nancy found herself swept into micks strong arms this is called the ballo she heard theo say to bess its a couples dance played in honor of the engaged pair bess sighed how romantic turning her head nancy saw a starry look in georges eyes as she moved into kevins arms behind them helena and petros swirled in the center of the dance floor when mick led nancy over to the edge of the dance floor she could hear the sea in the distance lapping against the shore its such a beautiful night she said tilting her head back so that she could see the stars glittering in the ink black sky i hate for it to end who says it has to mick pulled her closer and nancy smiled forgetting about besss stolen passport all she could think about was mick and the delicious feeling of dancing in his arms i know it was my idea to come into town before the flight to athens bess told nancy the next morning but after all that dancing last night i should have stayed in bed nancys only response was a yawn it was almost nine oclock but the engagement party had ended very late and she was a little tired she and bess had already rushed through a breakfast of milk and cheese pies in a bakeshop called a zacharoplasteion now blearyeyed they were walking along the main street of chora dodging tourists and donkeys laden with baskets george had met kevin for a morning jog on the beach and mick was probably still asleep lucky guy nancy thought since bess and george were taking a noon flight to athens bess had persuaded nancy to join her for an early trip into town after all this i hope my mother likes the statue bess said oh theres the store she breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that the stationery store was open it didnt take her long to pay for the windmill which spiros the owner had set aside for her after zoe called him the silverhaired man chewed on his unlit pipe as he wrapped the windmill in tissue and placed it in a box he had just offered to gift wrap the box when the phone rang in the back room please he said excuse one moment while he was gone nancy browsed around the shop she looked up as the shop door opened and dimitri stepped in its your friend the paparazzo nancy said under her breath to bess dimitri lowered a camera case to the floor then walked behind the counter ah it is my favorite american girl he said winking at bess i will have those photos for you this afternoon where is my friend spiros hes in the back bess said he was just about to wrap that for me she leaned over the counter to point to a box when the phone rang ah then let me take care of it spiros and i help each other all the time we are very good friends after placing the box on the counter dimitri began to search the shelves wrapping paper he mumbled pulling out boxes of sealed stationery cardboard and notepads everything but wrapping paper nancy was beginning to think bess would miss her flight to athens when dimitri held up a sheet of pale blue paper ah here we go he said beautiful paper but then my friend spiros truly appreciates fine craftsmanship with a few quick folds dimitri wrapped the box thanks evcharistó bess said dropping the package into her tote bag youre welcome dimitri said just then spiros returned and the two men spoke briskly in greek nancy sensed that dimitri was a little nervous around the older man though she couldnt imagine why as spiros sat down on a stool dimitri quickly darted out from behind the counter and picked up his camera case how about a photo of nancy drew the american detective he suggested nancys mouth dropped open in surprise how did dimitri know she was a detective no thanks she told him besides im on vacation but you are famous dimitri insisted my friend officer rossolatos sings your praises so thats how he knows nancy thought did that also mean dimitri knew about the passport thefts i dont know about that she hedged looking him in the eye was he testing her she wasnt sure if his naive enthusiasm was real or just a coverup for a cunning master of forgery as she and bess said goodbye and left the store nancy resolved to find out the two girls were nearly a block away when bess said dimitri seems to be good friends with everyone on mykonos it is a small island nancy said still i wish he hadnt heard that im a detective its going to make it harder to pin him down if hes the passport forger when nancy and bess arrived at the hotel they found george kevin and mick lounging in the garden terrace overlooking the sea georges short brown curls were still damp from her shower and she was wearing a denim skirt and red shortsleeved top ready for our trip george asked bess bess nodded pulling the wrapped windmill from her tote bag yup i just want to put this up in our room have a seat nancy mick said he patted an empty chair well get you some lemonade no thanks nancy told him im going up to the room with bess to change and im going to need some sunscreen and a hat if were going to spend the afternoon on dragonisi well meet you back here in fifteen minutes okay when nancy reached the top of the white staircase leading to their room she found that the door was ajar again thats strange she said turning back to bess cautiously she pushed on the door and peered inside the sight before her made nancy do a doubletake from the back the young girl in their room resembled bess she had on besss red straw hat and a matching red bolero jacket but looking closely nancy recognized the skirt and apron of the hotels housekeeping staff it was niki christofouros dressed in besss clothes chapter seven niki nancy said stepping into the room what are you doing the darkhaired maid spun around and gasped i she stuttered fingering the hem of the red jacket um zoe told me you wanted to see me hey thats my outfit bess observed more confused than angry i was just putting it away niki said quickly peeling off the jacket this time bess didnt let niki off the hook wait a minute she said standing with her hands on her hips i know you went through my stuff before and that same day my passport was stolen looking squarely at the maid nancy added did you take those passports from the safe no niki insisted her brown eyes wide she shook her head vehemently i swear it i admit i have been looking at your things but i never stole anything i saw you on the beach yesterday morning with dimitri nancy said confusion darkened nikis eyes dimitri nancy nodded i saw you hand him an envelope did you give him the passports no niki insisted i gave him back the photographs that he took of me because they were awful i wanted some photographs of myself to send to she paused searching for the right words agencies in the united states for being a model my sister tells me i could be famous but dimitri made me look plain like an ordinary person you wanted pictures for a portfolio bess asked catching on niki nodded i need a port a portfolio to be a model in america that is why i was studying those she pointed to the dresser where some of besss fashion magazines were open but i did not take anything nancy looked down at the glossy photos of smiling models i dont understand she said fashion magazines are available here ive seen them in shops but they are european magazines niki explained i am interested in what is going on in america my sister lives there and i am going to join her as soon as i have saved enough money bess and nancy exchanged a look nancy could tell that bess believed nikis story she had to admit the young girl was convincing if itll help your career why dont you take these bess said gathering the magazines and handing them to niki im sure youll find some new styles that will look great on you evcharistó niki said hugging the magazines to her chest she started toward the door then turned back when she realized she was still wearing besss hat i almost forgot she murmured smiling you have such beautiful clothes quickly she put down the hat picked up her bucket of cleaning supplies then ducked out the door a fashion ally bess said clapping her hands together nancy didnt say anything right away after tossing her penlight sunscreen and an orange hat into a canvas bag she looked at bess and said i still want to check out the stuff about her sister oh come on nancy bess protested taking the wrapped package out of her tote bag and placing it on the dresser what do your instincts tell you nancy thought for a moment that nikis just a nice girl who wants to be a model and she had the bad luck to get caught snooping around in your things so you do understand bess said grinning shes just a slave to fashion like me bess and george were in high spirits as they jumped into a cab with kevin and headed off toward the airport kevin had been able to schedule his interview for that afternoon so that the three of them could travel together when nancy met mick on the terrace after seeing off her friends her heart did a little leap he was dressed in black swim trunks and a green tshirt that hugged his broad muscular shoulders ready to slay the dragon he asked spinning his baseball cap around on one finger they say the dragon dried up years ago nancy told him he tapped her nose gently well if anyone can find the beast its ace detective nancy drew im game nancy said laughing but first i have a few things to straighten out with zoe they found zoe in the hotels kitchen supervising the lunch preparations when nancy told her about her conversation with the maid zoe confirmed that nikis sister had recently moved to america she used to work right here in our kitchen zoe frowned thinking over the situation i didnt know about nikis desire to be a model but i know she has been planning a trip to america in fact she asked my father to keep her passport in the family vault so that she wouldnt misplace it niki already has a passport nancy asked if niki was free to travel to the us why would she steal besss passport for her own use yes zoe replied i should have thought of that last night when you asked about her at the party that just about clears niki nancy thought but she still wanted to pay close attention to dimitri what a feast nancy exclaimed as she caught sight of the picnic basket that zoe had prepared for mick and her grapes oranges cheese stuffed grape leaves and pastries mick said popping a grape into his mouth this is great zoe thanks a middleaged man appeared at the kitchen door with his pale blue cap in his hand he said something in greek to zoe who then turned to mick and nancy she introduced the balding heavyset man as nikos the guide she had hired to take them to dragonisi soon they were off nikos didnt speak much english nancy discovered but she was so wrapped up in the beautiful day that it really didnt matter she leaned contentedly against mick as they cruised along the boat cutting through the water with ease nancys first glimpse of dragonisi was of a wild isolated mass of rock and sand nikos circled the island so that she and mick could get their bearings one end of the oblong island seemed to be the hot spot for snorkeling haifa dozen boats were anchored offshore and nancy saw three different groups of swimmers who seemed to be taking instruction hey check that out mick said pointing to one of the boats bobbing in the water near the beach isnt that the sea star squinting over the sparkling reflection of sunlight on the water nancy was able to make out the distinctive star on the boats yellow hull thats it she said scanning the beach and theres theo no sooner had nancy spotted him than she saw theo bounding over to a petite girl with short red hair thats strange mick said as their boat coursed ahead when i asked him to bring us to dragonisi he turned me down and yet there he is nancy was wondering the same thing as she tied her reddish blond hair into a ponytail and tucked it under her orange baseball cap maybe another group hired him to bring them here she said after circling dragonisi nancy and mick asked nikos to drop them off in a secluded area they chose a rocky beach on the opposite side of the islet from the groups of divers and made arrangements with nikos to pick them up at the same spot at four oclock knowing that they would have to wade ashore nancy had worn a swimsuit under her clothes now she stuffed her shorts tshirt and sneakers into her tote bag holding the tote bag over her head she lowered herself into the water and waded to the beach mick followed balancing his clothes and the picnic basket standing on the uneven stretch of sand broken by craggy rock formations they waved to nikos as he sped off i dont know about you mick said after they found a cozy spot in the shade of a twisted olive tree but after that boat ride im starved nancy glanced at the dark cave openings in the rocky hills i guess the caves can wait until after lunch she said she opened the picnic basket and they split up the generous portions of fruit and spread the cheese on the crusty bread while they ate they discussed the fading trail of the missing passports i think youre right to keep an eye on dimitri mick said hes suspicious all right nancy sighed and hes our only lead unfortunately i wish i had more to go on this morning i contacted some friends of my fathers at the australian embassy in athens mick told her licking his fingers after eating a stuffed grape leaf theyll let me know if they hear of similar thefts or if they come across any information on besss passport half an hour later nancy was sure she couldnt eat another thing some more grapes mick offered no thanks she was already on her feet and slipping her clothes on over her swimsuit which had dried in the sun im dying to explore some of those caves that theo told us about this should help light the way she said pulling her penlight out of her tote bag that tiny thing mick teased he reached into the picnic basket and pulled out a highpowered flashlight zoe left this for us he said pushing his cap back on his head when it comes to caves you dont want to be left in the dark the first cave they explored had an arched opening with a vaulted rock ceiling high overhead its like a gothic cathedral nancy said a moment later she laughed as her voice bounced back in an eerie echo inside they climbed between two huge boulders and found themselves on a narrow path leading into the darkness wed better keep close to each other mick said turning back to take nancys hand before he continued nancy stepped carefully watching the beam of micks flashlight bounce along the walls ahead she nearly ran smack into mick when he stopped abruptly whoa he said grabbing nancy by the waist and taking a step back what is it she asked her eyes followed the beam of light as it moved over the ground in front of them then dropped off into blackness the path ends very suddenly mick said dropping to his knees and shining the light down into the pit that must be at least a twentyfoot drop and theres water at the bottom staring into the black hole nancy felt her stomach drop that was a close call she said they backed away and retraced their steps to the cave entrance nancy didnt realize how cool the cave was until she stepped out into the bright sunlight she rubbed her arms and asked brightly what next youre always ready for the next adventure mick said shaking his head thats what i like about you nancy never a dull moment come on devlin dont tell me youre ready to give up after one cave nancy teased oh not me but with your curiosity youd go wild in australia just think of it nan a whole continent to explore sounds great nancy had to admit that the idea of visiting the distant continent appealed to her especially with mick to show her around things were definitely getting serious between them she was beginning to think that everything back home her friends her work and even ned would never be the same for her again now that shed met mick who knows she added maybe well have a chance to see australia together youre softening thats a good sign mick said he leaned close to press a gentle kiss against her lips so which cave do you want to tackle next tugging on her fluorescent orange cap nancy surveyed the situation she could see the openings to three other caves one was so high that she knew it was out of their reach another opening was so narrow that she and mick would have to crawl through it she pointed to a square passage that started at the top of a flat rocky rise lets try that one stepping through the wide mouth of the cave nancy and mick found that the walls narrowed into a dark tunnel it twisted right then left and then they saw a faint haze of light nancy was surprised to find that the tunnel ended at an airy chamber lit by pale sunlight filtering in through an opening in the rock high above its like a great hall she said gazing around the huge space at the far end of the chamber a pond of dark water smooth as glass stretched to the rough stone wall were not the first people here mick commented switching off the flashlight nancy followed his gaze to a recessed area on their right where three knapsacks were propped against a boulder two sleeping bags were rolled out next to a few orange cushions marked with a star and some greek letters nancy walked over to the boulder knelt to pick up one cushion and studied the markings the first three letters were distinctively greek but the last four resembled the english letters aooa standing up she spotted a hearth and cooking utensils just beyond some boulders someones camping here she observed maybe we should head back i feel like im intruding on their home she backed away and accidentally knocked over a lantern leaning down to pick it up she noticed an envelope on the ground beside it the flap was partially open and nancy glimpsed the edge of a photograph she looked more closely and gasped passport photos she looked over the headshots of a darkhaired man he seemed to have a scar on his face but the photos were a little blurred so she couldnt be sure check this out she said turning to mick no time for that mick said urgently we have to get out of here and fast hearing alarm in his voice nancy dropped the envelope and joined mick he was standing next to a stack of wooden cartons she squinted in the dim light to read the word painted on each of the cartons explosives explosives nancys heart started pounding in here mick nodded stepping away from the four cartons enough to blow this place out of the aegean its definitely time to go nancy said she turned abruptly toward the caves opening then froze as a mans voice called loudly from the tunnel beyond the cave opening shara shara he was answered by a woman who spoke brusquely nancy felt the hair on the back of her neck stand up the campers were returning and she had a hunch they werent going to be happy that she and mick had discovered their collection of fireworks micks eyes darted about the chamber looks as if the way we came in is the only way out not good nancy whispered her nerves twanging mick if those are the people who own these explosives they might blow us away chapter eight nancy tensed as the mans voice called again shara his voice echoed against the cave walls so it was hard to tell how far away he was do you know what hes saying she whispered to mick its greek to me mick said in the tension of the moment nancy couldnt appreciate his joke she shivered as she looked frantically around the cold damp cave for somewhere to hide mick had moved away from the explosives and was running his hands along the rock wall near the passageway to the tunnel see that ledge up there over the opening to the tunnel he asked nancy nodded spotting the ledge that ran over the doorway about ten feet from the ground but it doesnt lead anywhere we can hide up there if we can find a way to climb up in a flash nancy was beside him searching the rock wall for cracks and crevices that they could use as handholds the voices of the people were getting louder but still nancy and mick hadnt found a break in the rock quick give me a boost nancy said breathlessly mick laced his fingers together so that she could step up from his hands desperately she scraped at the rock wall overhead until she felt a triangular wedge she could wrap her fingers around a moment later she pulled herself up onto the ledge moving fast she scrambled around locked her foot into a crevice and stretched out so that she could help mick up her muscles strained and her body flattened against the rock ledge as mick grasped her hand and hoisted himself up within reach of the ledge he had to make it up before they were discovered with his free hand mick grabbed on to the same triangular wedge nancy had used and he pulled himself up he huddled beside her his face grimy with sweat and dust and not a moment too soon suddenly the voices were loud and clear and nancy knew that the strangers had reached this end of the tunnel she sank back against the wall as two figures a man and a woman entered the rocky chamber below her in the pale light that filtered in from the opening above nancy could see a short brawny man with jet black hair and a nasty red scar that stretched from his chin to his ear on the right side of his face he was wearing shorts which were sopping wet seeing his muscled arms and chest nancy knew that he would be a formidable opponent the woman was wearing a black onepiece swimsuit smallboned and petite she had short red hair that was slicked back with water her features were plain though something about her seemed familiar to nancy since she was also wet nancy guessed that they had just been swimming the couple appeared to be arguing as they pulled clothes out of two of the knapsacks nancy wondered if the owner of the third knapsack was nearby although she couldnt understand anything the couple was saying nancy noticed that the man kept repeating shara she made a mental note to ask zoe if she knew the word her ear for languages told nancy that these people werent speaking greek the rhythm and tone of the language was different from the conversations she had heard at the hotel and in chora a glance at mick told nancy that he was studying the couple just as closely as she was what are we going to do she wondered if the couple moved toward the back of the cave she and mick might have a chance to slip out through the tunnel without being noticed but it wouldnt be that easy the redhaired woman pulled a towel from her knapsack and marched toward the tunnel unfortunately the man didnt seem inclined to follow her resigned to settling in nancy shifted her legs suddenly she felt herself sliding panic cut through her like a sharp knife pebbles and dirt scattered to the ground as nancy grappled to keep her balance but it was too late alerted by the falling pebbles the woman looked up right at nancy and mick gritting her teeth nancy dropped to the ground she landed just a few feet from the surprised woman any hope of a friendly reception was immediately dashed when the woman assumed a fighting stance with a fierce cry she squared off and aimed a karate chop right at nancys face thinking fast nancy dodged the blow wheeled and landed a kick to the womans chest knocking her to the ground the man was scrambling near the knapsack probably looking for a weapon nancy thought before he could act mick leapt to the ground beside nancy out we go he shouted pulling her toward the tunnel not daring to look back mick and nancy raced through the narrow passageway as quickly as they could when they reached the caves entrance nancy turned away from the flat sandy beach and darted behind a jagged boulder lodged in the sand are they following us she whispered breathlessly to mick they will he answered but i think weve got a good lead he nodded toward a rocky incline that formed a point on the south end of the beach well have to climb up that hill and hide behind boulders its our only chance of losing them without hesitating they tore off and scrambled up the hill glancing back nancy saw that mick was right the man and woman had chased them onto the beach she darted behind a boulder but not before she spotted the glint of a knife in the mans hand nancys stomach churned as the weight of the situation hit her these people were armed and dangerous fortunately she and mick had enough of a lead to give them an advantage after a few minutes they managed to lose their pursuers in the rambling twisted rocks as she and mick continued to put distance between them and the cave nancys mind raced they had left the picnic basket and her tote bag under the olive tree on the beach and she knew it wouldnt be safe to return there luckily nothing in the bag would help the man and woman track her down on the other hand now she and mick wouldnt be able to hook up with nikos either and he was their only way home unless they could flag down a boat of snorkelers she and mick would be stuck on dragonisi at least for the night nancy was mulling over the situation when she and mick reached a low cliff overlooking the water the sea was a short drop maybe fifteen feet below them nancy sat down to rest looking out over the water she noticed a boat on the horizon speeding along the islets shoreline that boats heading our way think we can hitch a ride she asked grabbing micks arm he shrugged its worth a try nancy took off her bright orange cap and tried to flag down the boat she was waving frantically when she recognized the boats yellow hull and distinctive star it was the sea star theo she shouted well fancy that mick said he stood up as the boat swerved toward them and slowed down theo seemed surprised to see nancy and mick stranded on the low cliff within minutes he had taxied ashore on an inflated dinghy and brought them aboard the sea star when nancy and mick warned theo that they were in danger he sped away immediately without asking questions nancy waited until the boat was a safe distance from dragonisi before she filled him in on their close brush in the cave that is amazing theo exclaimed the wind rippling his hair those caves you were exploring have dropoffs and hidden passages did you notice a pond in one of the caves nancy nodded yes in the cave that the people were camped in thats called kea lake it has a channel that leads out of the cave a tunnel of water it connects to a small pond on the other side of the point where you flagged me down do you mean we could have swum out of the cave mick asked somewhat surprised it is possible theo said but it is very tricky if you do not know the cave you seem to know dragonisi well nancy told theo he shrugged i have maps but the caves are dangerous im glad you werent hurt lucky for us you were in the area said mick we saw your boat on the other side of the island before lunch how was the fishing theo glanced away not so good no fish today nancy looked over at the empty fishing net and wondered what theo had been doing all day maybe you saw the people we had the runin with she said i think they were out swimming before they returned to the cave she went on to describe the man and woman theo frowned and suddenly became preoccupied with navigating his boat he definitely seemed uncomfortable with her questions in fact she was sure he was hiding something i didnt see them he said concentrating on the open sea changing the subject he said it will be almost an hour until we reach chora in the meantime i will try to radio nikos so he does not search for you why dont you relax he said nodding toward the seats on the aft deck with a sigh mick sank onto an orange cushion im glad thats over well have to report it to the police on mykonos nancy reminded him as she sat down next to him in the frenzy of their confrontation in the cave she hadnt had time to tell him about the passport photos she found there wow mick exclaimed once she told him his green eyes flickered with interest along with the explosives it all adds up to something illegal and deadly do you think those people in the cave are connected to the three passports mick shrugged how do you figure that i dont know nancy said hugging a cushion to her chest but i thought of it when i saw those photos in the cave as she spoke nancy looked down at the cushion in her arms something about it struck a familiar chord in her mind the square cushion was covered with smooth orange canvas cloth she turned it over and found that a star and a few greek letters had been marked on the cushion with a black felttip pen the greek word ended with the letters aooa nancys eyes widened in surprise the same cushions had been sitting near the sleeping bags in the cave with the explosives chapter nine whats wrong mick asked nancy glanced ahead to make sure that theo couldnt hear them then she showed mick the marking on the cushion i saw the same cushions in that cave are you sure mick questioned we dont know the greek alphabet maybe some of the letters just look the same im positive she said emphatically it was a star followed by these symbols a quick search of the other cushions on the aft deck revealed that they were all marked the same way micks eyes darkened and he said now that i think of it what was theo doing on that deserted part of dragonisi after he refused to take us there he could have been on his way to see the people in the cave nancy tensed and remember that woman we saw him talking to next to the snorkelers she had red hair just like the woman in the cave mick finished i think its time theo gave us some solid answers he added suddenly on his feet nancy grabbed his arm and pulled him back if he is involved with those people we cant afford to confront him while were out on the open sea good point mick took her hand and settled in for the ride nearly an hour later as they arrived in mykonoss harbor nancy held up one of the cushions and said to theo these are nice but what do those letters say those are the markings of the sea star theo replied he threw a line around a wooden stanchion in the marina then turned to nancy and traced the handwritten symbols on the cushion the name is also marked on the hull of my boat do any of the other boats have the same cushions nancy asked him oh sure but not with these markings at least they shouldnt theo said sternly i noticed that some of my cushions disappeared a few days ago he lowered his voice but i think some of the older fishermen here at the marina are playing a joke on me mick and nancy exchanged a look that said they both doubted the story mick started to say something but nancy shook her head stopping him it wouldnt be wise to press theo there were too many questions about the cushions about the redheaded woman about theos presence at dragonisi and about the deadly explosives she needed to investigate on her own before she let theo know how much she suspected the hot sun and excitement had taken its toll on nancys energy but she wanted to report the incident on dragonisi right away fortunately there was a police station located on mykonoss harbor between a café and a souvenir shop inside nancy and mick waited on a bench in a dusty gray room while the desk officer located someone who spoke english finally officer rossolatos appeared with a younger police officer who had short black hair nancy and mick reported the incident on dragonisi without too much trouble the only problem was every time they said something officer rossolatos translated it and a barrage of conversation all in greek followed nancy was dying to know what the men were saying she kept hearing one word crop up it sounded like diafevgo but when she asked what they were discussing officer rossolatos brushed her questions aside we will send a boat to dragonisi to look for these people but please stay away from that place he warned nancy and mick these people they may be very dangerous im a world traveler once again bess said waving her new passport in the air as she pulled out a chair and sat down at the table george and kevin sat down next to her now at least you dont have to worry if anyone asks for id when we go to naxos tomorrow great said nancy she mick and zoe were already sipping iced fruit drinks at kounela a waterside taverna in chora they had left a message at the hotel telling bess george and kevin where to meet them for dinner as soon as everyone settled in the group agreed to let zoe order up some traditional greek dishes that they could all share then nancy got a full report on her friends trip to athens the passport stuff took a couple of hours bess said taking a sliced orange from the rim of her glass then we got to watch kevin interview angelique seferis shes just as beautiful as she looks on tv and nice too im glad you girls could come along said kevin it made the interview a lot more like fun george smiled at him but nancy could see that she wasnt as ecstatic as bess watching you in front of the camera reminded me how hard you work george told kevin and youre off to spain on another assignment in a few days kevin placed his hand over georges and gave it a squeeze nancy felt a little sorry for george it had to be frustrating to be in love with someone who was always on the road everyone set for naxos tomorrow bess asked putting aside her menu the group gave a chorus of approval the hydrofoil is the fastest way to go zoe said it will give us more time to explore the island just then a procession of waiters appeared each bearing a platter of food that made nancys mouth water zoe explained all the dishes from cubes of roasted lamb called souvlákia to spicy meatballs called ghiuvarlakia there were also platters of dried octopus fish steeped in olive oil and grape leaves stuffed with spiced meat the platters were being passed around the table when bess inquired how was dragonisi poor nancy and mick had a terrible time zoe said stabbing a grape leaf with her fork what happened nan george asked a concerned look in her brown eyes nancy and mick took turns telling the others about their day first nancy recounted the story of their close call in the cave and of finding the explosives and passport photos hardly standard camping gear she remarked dryly its an odd coincidence kevin said but how could they be connected to the passports that were stolen from the hotel nancy let out her breath in a long sigh im not sure she admitted but these people are definitely trouble maybe they need passports to get out of greece they might have found out about dimitris studio and asked him to insert their photographs on the stolen passports but three passports were stolen zoe pointed out and there were only two people in the cave mick snapped his fingers but there were three knapsacks one guy couldve been out running an errand or swimming or something thats possible nancy agreed someone went through the hotel safe and carefully selected the id of two american men and one american female that could match the group hiding in the cave and officer rossolatos told us that american passports are highly valued in the underworld wait a minute bess said swallowing hard are you saying that the woman from the cave is going to escape the police by using my passport possibly nancy said but she and the others need to have the photo page altered first thats why i think there has to be a talented forger at work somewhere on these islands as nancy described their trip to the police station she remembered the word that the greek police had kept using diafevgo she said turning to zoe i hope im saying it right can you tell me what it means its the greek word for flee or escape zoe said thoughtfully maybe they were relieved that you and mick escaped from those people still not satisfied nancy said that might be it but it seemed like something was going on i wonder if the police have had dealings with those people with the explosives before too bad zoe wasnt at the police station to translate mick remarked or in the cave nancy added the man in the cave kept saying something shara what does that mean she asked zoe zoe shook her head its not a greek word the table was silent for a moment as everyone considered nancy and micks close call then george said nan dont tell me youre going back to dragonisi to look for that couple nancy shook her head no way not with those explosives lying around i thought it would be wiser to wait for the police to check out that cave unfortunately they didnt find anything nothing bess asked incredulously hardly a trace zoe put in i called the police just before we left the hotel they found the cave nancy and mick described but the only thing left behind was the remnants of their campfire they must have moved and fast not a good sign nancy said wincing theyre on the run i think weve stumbled into some serious trouble here what are you going to do nan bess asked keep an eye on dimitri if hes the forger he might lead us to the others involved theres one other person who concerns me too nancy told them her suspicions about theo kevin scooped up the last bit of souvlákia on his plate then looked at nancy let me get this straight you think zoes friend theo is helping those people with the explosives i dont know nancy said but so far a lot of evidence points to it besides the cushions i think i saw him talking with the redhaired woman who chased us from the cave i want to check out his boat as soon as i can zoe was dubious ive known theo for many years we tease him about how hell do anything for money but thats a joke he would never help criminals maybe he doesnt know theyre criminals mick pointed out it just doesnt sound like theo zoe insisted stubbornly i dont know what he was doing on dragonisi but hes never been interested in snorkeling before i think youre wrong she told nancy raising her chin not wanting to argue with zoe nancy let the subject drop but if theo wasnt a snorkeling fan what was he doing with that group of divers after dinner the group walked along the waterfront to one of choras discos which featured a circular dance floor and a live band the walls seemed to throb with the loud drumbeat of rock music as nancy took her seat at the table within minutes george and kevin were among the young people on the crowded dance floor two tables were taken up by a soccer team from germany and a few of the guys came over to talk to zoe and bess nancy and mick had danced through half a dozen rock songs when nancy decided she needed a breath of fresh air she and mick made their way out to a small garden terrace zoe was already there she saw drinking a soda trying to escape the party animals nancy teased trying to ease the tension that had cropped up between zoe and her over theo zoe nodded just for a moment its such a beautiful night as a light breeze ruffled her hair nancy had to agree the sweet scent of jasmine filled the air and the moon cast a milky glow over the mulberry trees along the patio looks like theres a full moon tonight mick observed staring up at the bright disk that lit up the island a good night for sleuthing nancy hesitated looking at zoe before adding ill bet id be able to find my way around theos boat without a flashlight micks flashing eyes told nancy that he seconded the idea zoe was a little hesitant but in the end she agreed as long as you let me come along she insisted if we run into trouble i might be able to talk our way out of it nancy followed zoe out through a back door that led to a narrow lane the marina is just a few blocks away and we wont be gone long zoe said i dont think the others will miss us although cafés along the waterfront were alive with customers the harborside marina was quiet nancy soon spotted the sea star bobbing gently in its slip the boat looked dark and deserted itll go faster if we split up nancy suggested as they approached the boat mick nodded ill check out the cabin below you two can cover the main deck as mick disappeared into the tiny cabin nancy and zoe searched the aft deck zoe found that the bench seats below the orange cushions opened up inside were life jackets extra rope and two flare guns for use in an emergency then they moved to the deck in front of the cabin where they checked the cabinet below the steering column and found a flashlight and a tackle box hey mick called softly from the doorway of the cabin check this out he held up a weathered book with entries scrawled on the pages zoe took the book and leafed through it its the ships log she explained does it say anything about theos trips to dragonisi nancy asked zoe nodded hes been traveling to dragonisi a lot nearly every day but it doesnt say what hes doing there bringing supplies to criminals thought nancy the people from the cave would need food fresh water and news from the outside was theo their tie to the rest of the world after zoe explained the log entries mick went belowdeck to replace the book he had just reappeared on the deck when nancy heard footsteps on the dock get down she whispered urgently mick hunched on the right side of the cabin while nancy and zoe squeezed behind the steering column peering around nancy saw theo walking along the dock toward his boat a ring of keys jingled in one hand its theo nancy reported zoe sank back against the boats control panel the one person i dont want to try to explain this to nancy dont let him find me here please but it was too late theo was already at the edge of the dock he whistled as he leapt onto the deck beside the cabin just around the corner from micks hiding place chapter ten nancy bit her lip as theo landed on the deck on the far side of the cabin his weight making the boat rock slightly there had to be a way to stall him even distract him pressed against the steering column she remembered the flashlight stowed below it and an idea came to mind get ready to jump onto the next boat she whispered to zoe pointing to the rickety fishing boat that was moored next to the sea star while theo collected cushions from the aft deck nancy reached into the cabinet and grabbed the flashlight staying low she moved silently along the deck to the front of the cabin then she switched the flashlight on and rolled it along the deck on the left side of the cabin opposite mick although she couldnt see theo she heard his whistling stop peeking around the cabin she saw him moving toward the rolling flashlight which made a clumping noise as the beam of light skittered across the boat her plan had worked quickly nancy scrambled to the opposite side of the cabin and followed mick who was already leaping onto the next boat they clambered for cover under a tarp and huddled beside zoe the three of them breathless as they listened to theo mutter aloud in confusion zoe covered her mouth to suppress a giggle poor theo she whispered hes wondering if his boat is haunted after theo went inside his boats cabin nancy mick and zoe quickly exited the neighboring boat and headed back toward the disco as they walked mick reported that he had found nothing unusual belowdeck there was just fishing gear a black wet suit and lots of snorkeling equipment zoe had mentioned that theo had never been interested in snorkeling before nancy remembered so why did he suddenly have all this equipment seeing the closed defensive expression on zoes face however nancy decided not to bring that up now nothing on the boat really explains what theo is doing on dragonisi every day mick said i wonder if any of the other fishermen know what hes been up to nancy said thoughtfully zoe hesitated as if making a decision i can ask them in a subtle way tomorrow morning when i go into chora to buy seafood for the inn she volunteered i hate to spy on theo but if hes involved with those dangerous people i want to know about it when they reached the disco zoe waved toward the hillside behind the building nancy saw the silhouette of a windmill at the top of the incline its such a beautiful night zoe told mick and nancy you two should climb kato myli hill and get a closer look at the windmills i did want to get a chance to see them nancy admitted then go zoe insisted its a very romantic walk she showed them the lane that led to the short stairway at the base of the hill ill tell the others see you back at the hotel she said then pushed past the crowd on the steps of the disco following zoes directions nancy and mick walked past a sprawling white church built in the cycladic style of the islands it looks like a giant cream puff mick observed nancy laughed and looped her arm through his she always felt so relaxed with mick it felt very natural to work out a mystery with him a short climb up the stairway brought them to the top of the hill they paused at the foot of the first white windmill and stared up at the canvas and wood sails which turned lazily in the breeze just think nancy said dreamily these windmills have greeted thousands of people rock stars famous actors ambassadors and topnotch detectives mick added cradling nancys face with his hands he placed a gentle kiss on her lips and nancy felt a tingle pass from head to toe right now i dont feel like an ace detective she admitted sitting on the pedestal of one of the windmills she added we really need a break in this case like tracking down that couple from the cave i wonder what they plan to do with those explosives that detectives mind is ticking away again mick said slipping an arm around nancys shoulders youre remarkable nancy i have to admit im falling in love with you his words took her breath away searching her heart nancy knew that she felt the same way about mick but how could they have fallen in love in such a short time oh mick weve only known each other for i know just two months he interrupted and i know ive been hinting around about a trip to australia but the truth is im not talking about a chartered tour id like to take you back to australia as my bride in that instant nancy felt the entire world screech to a halt all she could do was stare at mick in shock bride she finally managed to say bride as in wedding as in married to mick forever for better or worse nancys heart raced with the most magical terrifying feeling she had ever experienced dont look so shocked mick said running a finger along her chin two people who love each other should be together usually it makes them happy he teased nancy struggled to put her feelings into words it isnt that she said i love being with you mick its just that i wasnt thinking about getting married suddenly an image shot into her head she closed her eyes and tried to imagine leaving her hometown saying goodbye to her dad and to hannah gruen their housekeeper who had helped take care of her when she was growing up well will you think about it he asked of course nancy promised framed by moonlight micks face looked so handsome leaning toward her he covered her mouth in a kiss that nancy was sure would melt her heart forever married bess shrieked when nancy returned to the room and filled her friends in on micks proposal what did you say george asked nancy sank down onto her bed i didnt want to hurt his feelings so i told him id think about it she said i have to admit im crazy about the guy but youre thinking about ned right asked bess yes nancy admitted theres also river heights my detective work dad and you guys how can i leave all that behind bess went over to nancys bed and gave her a hug if you decide to marry mick and go to live in australia well come visit you thats all nothing should come between two people who are in love the wise one has spoken george said giving nancy a sympathetic smile she said its a question that only you can answer i mean i really care about kevin but im not sure that id be crazy about the idea of following him around the world she shrugged its a tough call that was for sure nancy thought she resolved not to make any decision right away but that night nancy fell asleep dreaming of the rambling sheep ranches and vast beaches of australia i looked for theo this morning at the harbor zoe told nancy the next morning as they took a hydrofoil to naxos the largest of the cyclades islands they had been late boarding the craft so mick bess and george had found scattered seats among the other thirty or so passengers nancy pulled her orange hat lower on her head to ward off the sun it was just before ten but even in her shorts and tank top she could feel the heat any luck she asked zoe the sea star was already gone some of the fishermen say theyve seen theo anchored near dragonisi they thought he was fishing but hes been coming in without a catch for the past week what does he do on dragonisi if hes not fishing nancy wondered she didnt have time to pursue the subject just then the engines slowed and the hydrofoil docked in the bustling capital of naxos from the terminal the island looked like a mixture of whitewashed villages and lush green valleys as soon as they were on land zoe suggested mopeds to make it easier to get around definitely said bess we rented them when we were in rome and they were great ten minutes later they had rented three large mopeds from a shop across from the ferry terminal zoe and bess teamed up on one bike nancy and mick shared another and kevin and george took the third clustered together outside the moped shop studying a map of the island the group decided to make the temple of apollo their first stop zoe and bess led the way to the north side of the port turning left from the ferry terminal in single file the mopeds buzzed along a causeway that connected the main island to a tiny islet as they rounded a curve a gigantic stone postandlintel came into view that must be the temple nancy said a moment later mick pulled into a parking lot teeming with vendors and tourists this is the temple of apollo zoe said as they all clambered off the bikes that doorway is called the portora which means great door staring up at the huge marble monument bess said that makes sense even the swarm of tourists couldnt diminish the enormous power of the ancient structure as the group strolled around nancy saw a familiarlooking man cross the marble floor of the temple i cant believe it she told mick in an undertone dimitri is here mick followed her gaze to the photographer who had stopped to take a candid shot of a tiny girl i wonder what hes doing here nancy asked thoughtfully after the previous days discoveries she had begun to think of dimitri as the forger and theo as the messenger could dimitris presence here have anything to do with the passports lets split up so were less conspicuous she suggested to the others good idea george said she pointed to a vendors cart near the temple steps well meet you back at that ice cream stand in an hour nancy was so busy watching dimitri that she barely looked at the tancolored marble ruins he worked his charms on tourist after tourist but she didnt see any kind of exchange or unusual encounter after the hour had elapsed nancy rejoined her friends by the temple steps bess and zoe wanted to move on but nancy hesitatedshe didnt want to leave dimitri george and i will keep an eye on him kevin volunteered you guys go ahead nancy started to object but bess interrupted great well see you later nancy looked at bess quizzically but said nothing no problem george said they arranged to meet for a late lunch in a popular taverna in the village then bess zoe nancy and mick headed back toward their mopeds didnt you get it bess said to nancy they want to be alone she went on dreamily to squeeze every bit of romance out of their last days together nancy laughed i should have guessed youd pick up on that too bad kevin has to fly off to madrid on sunday zoe said as nancy climbed on the moped and wrapped her arms around micks waist she wondered again what the future held for mick and her did they belong together forever the rest of the morning passed quickly as they rode along the twisting roads of naxos passing sparkling white churches and crumbled ruins at every turn they even saw a goat farmer who was moving his herd the metallic clang of the goats bells filling the air just outside town they pulled off the road at a scenic overlook bess and zoe sat down on a bench as nancy walked to the edge of the cliff pushing back the brim of her orange cap nancy took in the view of silvery green olive trees stretching in rows along the hills next to the clustered white buildings of the village isnt it beautiful mick asked coming up next to her it really is nancy said and leaned contentedly against him the moment was broken soon after by the buzz of a moped turning nancy saw a silver moped with two people on it round the curve of the road the sun glinted off the chrome of the bike blinding nancy for a moment she blinked then gasped as she saw the face of the driver an angry red scar ran from his chin to his ear its the man from dragonisi nancy thought recoiling there was no telling what he would do if he recognized them chapter eleven its them nancy exclaimed in the next instant she ducked behind the trunk of an olive tree pulling mick along with her she winced as bark scraped against her bare arm but she had to stay hidden whats going on mick asked looking at nancy as if she had lost her mind the man from the cave is driving that moped nancy said breathlessly but i think we ducked out of sight before he saw us hearing the sound of the motor fade nancy dared a look the moped was just disappearing down the hillside in the direction of town id love to know where hes off to in such a hurry she said rubbing the chafed skin on her arm are you okay bess asked rushing over with zoe whats going on nancy told them about the driver of the silver moped she felt so helpless how could she let those guys just ride on by what about the man on the back zoe asked i dont know who he is nancy said but i cant stand to stay here when they might lead us to some answers what if theyre on their way to pick up the passports from dimitri mick was already striding to their moped its a long shot he said but its worth checking out dont be crazy zoe protested grabbing nancy by the hand its too dangerous i dont think he recognized us nancy said but just to be safe wed better take off our hats theyre the same ones we had on at dragonisi she tossed her orange hat to bess while mick gave his to zoe then nancy hopped onto the moped and slid her arms around micks waist dont worry mick said well stay out of sight were just going to observe before zoe and bess could say another word he revved the mopeds engine and steered onto the road well meet you at the taverna bess called after them and be careful nancy held on tight as mick maneuvered the moped around a series of snaking curves with these treacherous roads she was afraid that they would never catch up with the two men then the mopeds engine whirred as they reached a straight stretch of road and mick shifted into high gear nancys heart raced as she spotted the silver moped ahead on the road there they are she shouted lets drop back mick said shifting into low gear to slow their bike to nancys relief the men never glanced back i dont think theyre even aware of us she told mick it was an easy drive over the open road but nancys nerves were tense with anticipation what if the two men met with dimitri or theo if she and mick interfered the results could be deadly once they reached the outskirts of town the chase became complicated by the narrow zigzagging streets scattered with people carts and animals were losing them nancy said wincing as a young girl with a basket darted in front of their bike forcing mick to veer away mick drove with caution but it cost them i cant keep up with them in these congested streets he rolled to a stop as a pair of burros hauled a wagon into the center of the street blocking the way disappointed nancy pushed her hair out of her eyes and frowned oh well better safe than sorry at last the donkeys moved on and mick steered the moped onto a wider street they were back at naxoss main square now nancy realized near the ferry terminal the square was filled with tourists and merchants rushing to do business before the afternoon siesta it was like a crazed obstacle course lets get away from this traffic mick said taking a sharp turn down a narrow alley neither he nor nancy saw the silver moped careening toward them until the last second look out nancy screamed bracing herself for the impact mick managed to steer away from the silver moped but the motion sent their bike skidding to the side it nearly slid out from under them as the silver moped zoomed off a cloud of dust rose around them as nancy and mick struggled to regain their balance and finally wobbled to a stop you okay mick asked turning back toward nancy fine she said but a moment later her nerves twanged as she looked up into the eyes of the man with the scar the silver moped had circled back nancy saw and it was just a few yards away the man with the scar was standing next to the bike staring at nancy and mick nancy caught a quick glimpse of the man on the bike he was thin with dark hair and a full beard oh no nancy thought the man with the scar had recognized them from dragonisi what now mick muttered through clenched teeth before nancy could answer the man hopped back on the moped and revved the engine the silver bike sped away into the square come on nancy said getting off the bike and following on foot she had gone only a few steps when the bike disappeared around a corner with all of the activity in the square there was no way she and mick could follow them now nancy let out a frustrated sigh not only had the crooks lost her and mick before they could find out where they were going but two very dangerous people knew who she and mick were this case is definitely heating up nancy said under her breath i just hope we dont get burned lunch was a loud affair the taverna zoe had suggested was filled with a spirited crowd of students and tourists nancy tried a dish of lamb and vegetables wrapped in crispy pastry leaves called filo while everyone ate she and mick filled them in on the commotion in the market square sounds like we missed a pretty dramatic scene kevin commented it really got out of hand mick shook his head looking miserable i cant believe we blew our cover and let those guys slip away its not your fault nancy said touching micks hand then she turned to george how did it go with dimitri she still needed evidence to connect him to the people with the explosives did you see him talk to a woman with red hair or two guys one bearded one scarfaced mick added hopefully unfortunately george and kevin had nothing to report from what theyd seen it looked as if dimitri had come to naxos to make some money photographing tourists nothing more later that afternoon when nancy spotted dimitri on the hydrofoil headed back to mykonos she decided to confront him she doubted that he would actually confess to forgery but with a little pressure he might let some useful information slip out she found him waiting in line at the hydrofoils snack bar i have a confession to make she told him remember how i wanted to see your studio dimitris dark eyes narrowed suspiciously yes well i just couldnt resist nancy hesitated as color rose in dimitris face one day when you were out i sneaked in and checked out the equipment the photographer slammed his hand on the snack bar counter that was a stupid thing to do you could have been hurt of course i didnt touch anything nancy lied surprised that dimitri was so upset thats not the point he said he motioned nancy to a corner by the snack bar so that no one could overhear their conversation you must stay away from the studio he said emphatically the truth is it doesnt really belong to me my friend lets me use it nancy shot him a dubious look and all the fancy equipment she persisted does that belong to your friend too dimitri nodded my friend spiros he owns the stationery shop right below the studio all at once nancy felt her investigation shifting spiros was dimitri lying to her she couldnt be sure he was obviously upset but that would be natural if he had just learned that she was closing in on his forging operation and what does spiros use the equipment for nancy asked dimitri shrugged please dont tell your friend the one with the blond hair and the pretty smile he asked bess nancy said does this have something to do with her passport passport dimitri raked his fingers through the dark curls over his brow and looked confused no no please dont tell her that the studio isnt mine i lied about it to impress her he said does she ever mention me he asked hopefully nancy didnt know if he was serious or if he was just trying to throw her off the track dimitri was attentive to bess whenever they met not knowing what to think nancy made an excuse to dimitri and went back to her seat when she told everyone what shed just learned mick had an inspiration spiros makes miniatures doesnt he i mean didnt you buy a tiny windmill from him when bess nodded he added he probably uses the equipment to help with his sculptures but you saw those machines mick nancy said they were pretty sophisticated not just arts and crafts stuff im not sure i trust dimitri but if spiros really owns the equipment he could be our forger not spiros zoe objected ive known him since i was a child he and my father are good friends he has been like an uncle to me she shook her head this has gone too far first you suspect our maid then my friend theo and now spiros she said her voice cracking with strain im sorry nancy said she didnt want to hurt zoes feelings but she had to follow the trail of clues if she wanted to get to the bottom of the passport theft this is the perfect way to end the day bess said later that evening she swayed to the strains of bouzouki music that was piped into the hotels taverna what do the words mean she asked zoe the lyrics to most greek songs are about love zoe explained bess sighed it figures thats probably why im crazy about greek music a ballad began and nancy and mick got up to dance he swept her across the dance floor and twirled her under a trellis covered with fragrant hibiscus nancy felt as if she were floating on a cloud then a sternlooking young man appeared at the terrace door he stopped a waiter who pointed toward nancy and mick looks like we have a visitor nancy whispered into micks ear mick turned his head and stared at the man in the doorway looks serious he said he took nancys hand and they went over to the edge of the terrace where the young man was standing as it turned out the man was a diplomatic courier i have a package for you from thomas mccurdy the courier said handing mick a thin manila envelope after mick thanked him the courier disappeared as suddenly as he had arrived what is it nancy was dying of curiosity as she followed mick back to the table mccurdy is my fathers friend the ambassador in athens that i mentioned before this must be some information on besss stolen passport mick said as he broke the wax seal on the envelope everyone leaned forward as mick pulled out a letter and began to read in silence a moment later he stopped and shook the envelope three glossy photographs spilled out headshots of two men and a woman the air was heavy as the group stared at the photos that looks like the two guys you chased on naxos today bess said pointing to two of the pictures and thats the redheaded woman who was in the cave on dragonisi nancy said what does the letter say kevin wanted to know mick looked soberly around the table that these people are terrorists he replied and we should avoid them at all costs chapter twelve an audible gasp rose from the table nancys heart plummeted as she realized just how deadly the situation she and mick had stumbled into was terrorists george echoed looking scared nancy youve been tangling with killers what else does the letter say about the terrorists kevin asked mick smoothed the sheet of crisp bond paper summarizing as he read on theyre three fugitives from the middle east explosives experts who were sent to prison for planting a bomb at a train station the men are named mashti and rashid and the woman is shara thats it shara nancy interrupted the guy in the cave kept saying it over and over i guess he was just calling her thats right mick said then he returned to reading the letter all three of them received life sentences but two weeks ago they escaped from prison killing two guards in the process with a shiver bess said escaped prisoners i cant believe zoe and i let you go after them escaped zoe said thinking aloud maybe thats why you heard the police saying diafevgo over and over its the greek word for escape they probably realized that you had come facetoface with these escaped prisoners but didnt want to scare you with the truth why would the police keep it a secret asked bess zoe frowned this kind of news could scare off visitors and harm the tourist trade the police are probably trying to keep it quiet but theyve probably tightened security nancy said ill bet thats why they were checking passports on delos mick tapped the manila envelope in front of him mccurdy thinks the terrorists have been moving around the islands in a stolen boat he added but they need papers to leave the country so our theory about the three stolen passports may be right nancy said it looks as if theyre going to fall into the hands of these three criminals wow bess said her eyes wide i feel like ive created an international incident according to this letter even interpol is in on the case said mick theyre compiling a special list of all lost or stolen passports in the hope that theyll be able to use it to snag the terrorists do you think we should go to the police with our suspicions of theo and dimitri george asked nancy took a sip of her fruit drink and thought for a moment we still dont have enough evidence shes right mick added all we can do is watch and wait and lay low kevin added zoe nodded her agreement now that the terrorists can identify nancy and mick we should all be extra careful im glad we werent planning a trip for tomorrow bess said well be better off sticking around here the next morning everyone else was already on the beach by the time nancy finished breakfast and changed into her suit as she walked down the path toward the water she saw bess and george posing on beached windsurfers for dimitri the photographer was kneeling in the sand taking their picture dressed in a black wet suit he looked more like a diver than a photographer i will have all your photos back to you tomorrow dimitri promised bess smiling as he strapped the bright yellow waterproof camera around his neck but now i must meet a group of british tourists who have hired me they want me to take photos of them snorkeling so they can brag to their friends back home as dimitri headed off down the beach bess walked over to the beach towel where nancy had just sat down im afraid to see those photos he took of me that afternoon in chora when you guys searched his studio it was such a hot day i probably look awful all in the line of duty nancy teased her eyes on dimitris retreating form was his friendly smile just a coverup for a master forger were he and theo working together she lay down on her stomach she was thinking about how to proceed with her investigation when she felt a splash of cold water on her back she rolled over and sat up just as mick tossed a snorkeling mask onto the beach towel beside her time for a dip nancy he teased there are some amazing fish out there today youre on devlin nancy said grabbing the mask she raced him to the clear turquoise water with the help of the snorkeling gear she spent the next half hour exploring the underwater world of the aegean sea a school of tiny silvery fish fluttered past her tickling her legs as they went lingering over a clump of seaweed she discovered fish in dazzling shades of blue orange and yellow she carefully avoided a group of pincushiony sea urchins whose spines could sting mick was just pointing out a tiny gray octopus when nancy caught sight of a diver out of the corner of her mask turning her head she saw that he was wearing a black wet suit mask and scubadiving equipment she couldnt make out his features at all nancy was about to look away when she noticed a strange contraption in the divers arm it looked like a cross between a rifle and an archery bow a second look made her gasp the man was holding an underwater spear gun grabbing micks arm nancy twisted around in the water to point out the armed diver just then the diver aimed the gun and fired with a burst of bubbles a sharp spear torpedoed straight toward nancy and mick chapter thirteen nancy felt her whole body go tight pressing her hands against micks side she pushed as hard as one could push underwater sending him in one direction while she moved in the other a split second later she felt a rush of water as the spear zoomed past her micks arms flailed for a moment then nancy saw him start swimming off in the opposite direction from the diver following his lead she kicked frantically through the water behind him quickly she turned back to see if another spear was coming her way the masked diver was loading another one without a moment to waste she and mick pushed above the surface and swam trying to put distance between them and the diver nancy knew that they could move more quickly if they werent under the surface but with every stroke she took she thought about the sharp end of that spear her muscles were screaming from exertion when she ducked her head under the water to check on the man with the spear gun she was just in time to see the second spear veer off to her left then the diver turned and swam away from them breaking through the surface nancy took a deep breath that was close mick said coughing as he propped his mask on his head did you get a look at that guy nancy pulled off her own snorkeling gear no but there he is again the diver had surfaced near a small motorboat that was floating some twenty yards away nancy watched as he tossed the spear gun into the boat then heaved himself aboard his head was covered with the black hood of a divers suit but nancy was able to see that he was a man of medium build a moment later the boats engine roared to life and the masked man sped away guess hes not going to stick around for a chat mick said smiling weakly no but i think his message was clear someone wants us out of the picture nancy frowned i just wish i knew who that someone was when nancy and mick finally waded to shore they found their friends playing cards oblivious to what had transpired out in the sea i cant believe all that action was going on while we were sitting here bess said brushing sand from her legs its a good thing both you and mick are good swimmers george said scanning the nearby water thank goodness you werent hurt zoe added nancy combed her wet hair and pulled it back into a ponytail i just wish i had seen the face of that man with the spear gun well lets think about it kevin said who could get their hands on a black wet suit mick dried off then pulled a blue tshirt over his head theo has one i saw it stashed in the cabin of his boat but no one has seen theo all morning zoe said defensively besides you would have recognized the sea star he could have borrowed a boat from one of his friends at the marina nancy pointed out then added but we also saw dimitri wearing a wet suit just this morning george snapped her fingers thats right a black wet suit he could have jumped in a boat after he disappeared down the beach but he said hed been hired to spend the hour photographing some tourists underwater bess added thats why he was wearing the wet suit we should check out his story just to be sure nancy said mick looked out over the sea a serious expression darkening his handsome face do you think that those criminals decided to come after us he asked after a moment nancy winced i sure hope not first of all im not sure theyd be able to find us that easily and if the police are looking for them my guess is that theyd want to lay low but it is a possibility bess said her brow furrowed in concern i think we all need to be careful i dont intend to mess with those terrorists again nancy assured her friends just then she caught sight of a young man in a black wet suit coming down the path from the hotel at first she was alarmed but that feeling faded when she realized it was theo he waved and headed right for them theos finally turned up nancy whispered to her friends and hes dressed for the part yásou theo called out cheerfully ive just come back from dragonisi i caught a few fish this morning too why are you wearing that zoe snapped at him she looked as if she didnt know whether she should attack or defend her friend theo glanced down at the wet suit i was snorkeling he said confused you hate snorkeling zoe retorted i changed my mind theo said he looked from zoe to the others on the beach whats going on here why are you all so serious jumping to her feet zoe went nosetonose with theo nancy and mick were just attacked by a man with a spear gun a man in a black wet suit you must be joking he said then realizing that they were serious he said wait a minute you dont think that i zoe jabbed a finger at his chest and youve been spending a lot of time on dragonisi where three international terrorists were hiding out what theo looked completely baffled what is she talking about although nancy wasnt happy that zoe had told theo about the terrorists she couldnt let the subject drop now she told theo about the letter from micks diplomat friend and about the cushions from the sea star that she and mick had found in the terrorists cave i never met those people i swear it he insisted a lot of things have disappeared from my boat over the past few weeks first there were the missing cushions then fishing equipment and cans of food i thought the other fishermen were playing tricks on me then i realized everything disappeared while i was anchored near dragonisi that explains about the orange cushions mick said to nancy and the terrorists probably stole the canned food and fishing stuff too nancy still wasnt convinced but what about the redhaired girl she asked theo blanched at the question but she didnt back off we saw you with a young woman a petite girl with red hair who looked just like the female terrorist shes not a terrorist frustrated theo rubbed his hands over his eyes then peeked out through his fingers at zoe i have been taking snorkeling lessons from a diving instructor on dragonisi a pretty girl a redhead but her name is eleni and she would never hurt anyone then why is eleni such a big secret george asked nancy thought she knew the answer but she waited for theos reply staring at zoe he said i didnt want to hurt you i know youve been mad at me for breaking up but i want to stay friends ive been mad at you for acting so strange zoe protested what kind of friend refuses to talk about what he does all day every day theo shrugged im sorry will you forgive me zoe rolled her eyes and sighed only if you promise to be honest with me from now on she said and wipe that sheepish look off your face i promise theo said smiling nancy was glad that zoe was on better terms with her friend but she knew that theo couldnt be ruled out as a suspect yet his explanations were reasonable but how could she be sure that he was telling the truth i dont understand how dimitri can still be a suspect bess said as she toweled off her hair after a walk down the beach to check up on dimitris whereabouts the girls had returned to their room to shower before lunch shes right george added those british tourists said that dimitri spent the entire morning with them so he couldnt have been the guy with the spear gun that proves he didnt attack us nancy said but dimitri could still be the forger nancy slipped on a royal blue tank top and tucked it into her white denim miniskirt what about theo george asked didnt you believe his explanation nancy let out a sigh i want to believe him she said pushing back her hair with a blue cloth headband but we cant be sure until we have proof not just his word she opened the wooden shutters to the balcony and sunlight streamed into the room i wish we knew who we were up against bess said its a dangerous situation for all of nancys voice trailed off she was standing with her back to the balcony doorway the sunlight that streamed in hit the top of the dresser illuminating besss giftwrapped package wait a minute nancy said stepping over to the dresser because of the sunlight directly hitting the package she could see tiny squiggly blue lines on the wrapping paper whats wrong george asked standing up the intricately patterned bluegreen wrapping paper looked familiar to nancy she picked up the package and looked more closely she could make out an eagle in the center of the page thats it she whirled toward bess and george who had paused in the middle of dressing to gaze at her the answer has been sitting right in this room for days what are you talking about bess asked nancy waved the package in the air see the wrapping paper on this gift when dimitri wrapped it in spiross shop he must have used the wrong paper this is engraved with an eagle just like the pages of a us passport george hurried over to nancy and grabbed the package bess moved in close to study it that means spiros could be the one whos forging the passports george exclaimed looking up at nancy in awe nancy nodded exactly chapter fourteen i cant believe that clue was in our room all along right under our noses bess said after she nancy and george had shared their revelation with their friends the group decided to talk over the case at lunch now they were at a small waterfront sandwich shop on the harbor in chora i am disappointed that my fathers friend would steal from our hotel zoe said as a waitress brought a tray of iced lemonade to their table but if spiros is the forger the police should know about it nancy took a long drink of lemonade she was glad that zoe understood the need to follow through on their suspecting spiros i dont get it kevin said how could spiros be so stupid as to wrap a gift in a fake passport page spiros didnt do it george explained dimitri wrapped the gift while spiros was out of the room which proves that dimitri isnt involved in the passport forgery nancy added he would never have used that paper if he knew what it was intended for ill bet spiros will be steaming mad when he figures out dimitris mistake mick said nancy nodded i just wish i could figure out how spiros got his hands on those stolen passports i think he stole them himself right from our safe zoe said grimly seeing nancys surprised expression zoe explained that spiros had been visiting her father at the inn the morning the thefts occurred i forgot that he was there since i never considered him a suspect if you were opening and closing the safe as often as you said it would have been easy enough for spiros to see what the combination was then he probably opened it when you or your father were at the front desk nancy said picking up on nancys thoughts mick said and since your father is so close to spiros he never suspected him either now that she had a target nancy felt a new sense of urgency ive got to find a way to catch spiros redhanded before he gives those passports to the terrorists we need to watch him closely i have a girlfriend who lives across the lane from spiross shop zoe explained she is away in athens this week but her balcony has an outside entrance and we can use it to watch spiros without being seen sounds perfect nancy said picking up a piece of tost a roll stuffed with spiced pork and pressed into a crispy toasted square kevin passed the sandwich platter to george and asked does this mean were staging a stakeout i guess you could say that mick replied but stakeouts can be boring nancy warned everyone especially when they drag on for hours maybe we should work in shifts to make it easier on everyone the others agreed that nancys idea was a good one it was decided that nancy and mick would take the first watch after lunch george and kevin would relieve them an hour later and zoe and bess would take the third shift this balcony gives us a perfect view mick said he was kneeling and peering over the waisthigh ledge of the stucco balcony the house that zoe had brought him and nancy to was just across the narrow lane from spiross shop from the balcony they could look right into the windows of the studio and of the shop below it all they had seen of spiros so far was the top of his head in the store as he sat behind the counter reading a magazine i just hope were not too late nancy said she was kneeling too she also hoped that george and kevin would show up soon her knees were getting sore i dont think anythings happened yet mick said giving nancys ankle a squeeze its just a matter of time before this whole case is wrapped up and then what whats in store for us nancy glanced at his angular rugged face she leaned back into a semisitting position ive been thinking about your proposal she said slowly and id really love for you to show me australia great before mick could get carried away she added but australia is really faraway im just not sure about we can visit river heights mick interrupted after you meet my parents itll be terrific nancy youll see i havent made a decision yet nancy said holding up her hands and im not rushing you mick told her he dropped a kiss on her cheek are we interrupting something bess asked from behind them turning nancy saw bess and zoe climbing the closed stairway to the balcony we brought these binoculars from the inn zoe said handing nancy the glasses were going to get ice cream bess added want us to bring you some nancy checked her watch george and kevin will take over in ten minutes or so she said i think we can hold out till then hey look hes leaving the shop mick whispered nudging nancy while bess and zoe ducked behind the balcony wall nancy peered over the top spiros was just locking up the shop then he climbed the stairs and entered the secondfloor studio i should have guessed nancy whispered excitedly he has time to work on the passports when the shop is closed for siesta she and mick watched as the old man moved about the room for a few minutes then sat down at a worktable bathed in sunlight whats he doing mick asked after a few more minutes it looks as if hes sewing looking through the binoculars nancy was able to make out the item on the table he is sewing hes doing the seam of a passport the sight of the large darning needle sent her mind reeling back remember the sewing basket i found in his file cabinet thats what its for she handed the binoculars to mick who held them up then whistled pretty crafty so it looks as if hes almost finished bess asked nancy nodded he must have taken the passport apart to remove the identification page the one with the photo then all he has to do is duplicate a single page with a new photo and new information and sew it all back together they watched as spiros finished his task and then tucked the passports into the sewing basket still holding the basket he headed for the door what do you think mick asked nancy we know hes got the passports she whispered lets split up we need to contact the police and keep an eye on spiros ill go for the police zoe volunteered peering over the ledge they watched spiros tuck the basket in the crook of his arm he went down the stairs and headed down the street lets go nancy said the cobblestone lane was fairly deserted so the teens followed spiros at a distance most locals and tourists had retired indoors for a siesta a few blocks down zoe turned off down a side street which led to the police station as nancy mick and bess followed spiros through the twisting maze of streets they passed a handful of japanese tourists and a young boy with a goat after a few minutes they found themselves at the foot of the staircase leading up to the windmills this is it nancy said as she started up the stairs if hes got those passports we have to get them now before he sells them she knew spiros would never hand over the forged passports she would have to catch him off guard thinking of a plan she reached into the back pocket of her denim skirt and pulled out her own passport which she had carried with her ever since the day the safe was broken into she had had no idea then just how handy her own passport would be at the top of the stairs nancy saw that spiros was the only person on the hot dry summit of the hill his eyes narrowed suspiciously as he spotted them forcing a smile nancy held out her passport as she approached him we found this on the steps i think it fell out of your basket spiross gaze fell on the passport in her hand with its blue cover and gold seal it could have been one of the forged passports spiros pulled his pipe out of his mouth then slowly reached forward until his hand closed around nancys passport before spiros knew what had hit him nancy tugged the basket out of his grasp and mick grabbed his arms to restrain him well be needing this too bess said snatching nancys passport from spiross hand nancy rummaged through the basket and pulled out the three passports their covers bearing the us seal nancy opened the first one and saw the face of the bearded terrorist staring at her inside the second one she saw the photo of the woman shara this must be besss passport she said flipping through the pages she saw the stamps they had gotten earlier that summer in switzerland and italy leave me alone spiros shouted struggling to get away from mick you are crazy to be involved in this this is all the evidence we need nancy announced waving the passports as mick wrestled spiros down and pinned him to the ground do you want me to run down to the police station bess offered zoe has no way of knowing that we wound up here good idea and take these nancy handed bess the three forged passports ill be back in a flash with the police bess promised then she ran down the steps of kato myli hill spiros had given up struggling with mick but he let forth with a flood of angry greek phrases nancy slipped off her blue headband and gave it to mick use this on his arms a moment later spiross wrists were bound and he was sitting on the stone pedestal of one of the windmills with nancy and mick standing on either side of him for several minutes no one spoke then spiros said urgently please we must leave here right away we are all in danger the police will be here any minute nancy said she caught a flicker of movement out of the corner of her eye this must be them now turning her head to peer around the side of the windmill she heard a sudden cold click then felt a small solid object against her temple nancy drew in a sharp breath she had heard that sound before it was the sound of a cocked pistol and it was pressed against the side of her head her heart began to hammer in her chest and she thought one move and im dead chapter fifteen dont move said a man with a deep accented voice as if he were reading her mind nancy didnt dare turn to look at him in the next instant she heard the metallic sound of another gun being cocked and her heart sank mick was in danger too loud male voices growled in a language nancy didnt understand when she dared to glance slightly toward her right she saw that spiros was arguing with one of the terrorists the scarfaced man from studying the photos nancy remembered that his name was mashti the other two shara and rashid stood nearby the pistol at nancys head was held by rashid while shara had her gun trained on mick spiros waved off mashti defiantly then pointed at nancy ask her he spat switching to english she can tell you where your passports went nancy felt her mouth go dry as the muscular mashti lunged toward her and yanked her arm hand over the passports now he demanded i dont have them nancy said she wasnt about to let them know that bess was on her way to the police station with them at that very moment ah but she can get them spiros objected infuriated mashti kicked up a puff of dust then pressed his face close to nancys the hair on her neck stood on end as his hot breath brushed her skin you are going to get those passports for me if you want to live nancy saw a sudden movement behind him and she realized that someone was coming the police at last she thought a moment later she gasped in horror as she recognized george there you are george cried bess told us you were up here guarding she stopped short taking in the situation whoa kevin said stopping next to her mashti pulled out a revolver whirled dropped to a crouch and trained the gun on kevin and george stop he shouted george and kevin froze their faces reflecting total shock quickly mashti corralled them against the wall of the windmill so that they stood beside nancy and mick one by one the terrorists patted down nancy and her friends nancy suspected they were searching for weapons or the forged passports they found nothing after a heated argument with spiros mashti pulled nancy away from the wall of the windmill you will get the passports back he ordered shaking his fist in her face bring the passports to the cave on dragonisi you know the one you have three hours be there by six oclock or your friends will die then he backed away for a moment nancy couldnt believe her eyes the terrorists were letting her and mick go free then her heart sank as she saw them nudge george and kevin with their guns pushing them toward the stairs they were going to use george and kevin as hostages this cant be happening nancy thought tears filled her eyes as george flashed her a look of desperation then turned away nancy watched horrified as the three terrorists descended the stairs hurrying george and kevin along at gunpoint he says that he has forged passports many times in the past but never before for anyone he thought was dangerous zoe murmured with him forging is an art like the miniature statues he makes in a small hot room of the police station zoe was translating spiross statement the terrorists had heard of his reputation and they threatened to kill him if he did not do as they asked zoe went on she seemed disappointed in her familys friend and nancy didnt blame her she guessed that it was an art to recreate something as intricate as a passport but that didnt justify breaking the law zoe and officer rossolatos had helped move things along quickly spiros was under arrest two men had been sent out to search mykonos for the terrorists and their hostages just in case they hadnt left the island yet and the police chief had put in a call to interpol the international police network the police would take action once interpol arrived officer rossolatos allowed nancy and the others to listen in while spiros confessed to opening the hotel safe stealing the passports and altering them this is all your fault spiros scowled at nancy if you had not stuck your nose in this business your friends would be safe i knew you were going to be a threat when dimitri told me you had been in my studio that is why i tried to frighten you while you were swimming you were the man with the spear gun nancy said as the pieces of the puzzle fell into place why didnt you back off when you still had the chance spiros asked her i warned you nancy isnt scared off by threats bess said coming to nancys defense her eyes were red from crying but maybe this time i should have been nancy thought she sank back in her chair a sick feeling in her stomach spiros was right if she had backed off her friends lives wouldnt be in jeopardy at this moment what if the terrorists made good on their threat solving one case just wasnt worth two precious lives once spiross statement was complete nancy bess zoe and mick were dismissed thank you for your cooperation the police chief said in a matteroffact way nancy had the feeling that he didnt understand how serious the situation was whats going to happen to my friends she asked him anxiously it was almost four oclock minutes were ticking by and george and kevin were still in the hands of the terrorists officer rossolatos intervened speaking to his supervisor in greek then rossolatos turned to nancy and said we will send an interpol agent who matches your description to the cave she will trade the forged passports for your friends of course after the trade a team of officers will surround the terrorists the criminals will surrender if they want to live and what if they refuse to release george and kevin nancy asked blinking as her eyes filled with tears please said the officer you must trust us to handle it thats no answer nancy wanted to shriek a wave of guilt washed over her as she thought about the terrible situation she had gotten her friends into she wished the police would use her instead of a decoy but she knew they would never agree to it turning to bess she asked do you still have my hat nancy had given her orange cap to bess before she and mick rode off after the terrorists on naxos sure bess said she was still carrying the tote bag shed had on naxos she reached into it and pulled out nancys fluorescent orange cap nancy handed the hat to officer rossolatos i had this on when i first ran into the terrorists the decoy might want to wear it thank you he said we will contact you as soon as your friends are in our custody and theres a six oclock deadline nancy stressed rossolatos smiled reassuringly we will be there long before the deadline do not worry how could she help but worry nancy was surprised to find theo coming out of an office when she zoe and mick walked into the hall immediately there was an exchange in greek between theo and zoe theo came in to make a report zoe explained his boat was stolen from mykonoss harbor a few of the fishermen saw two men boarding the sea star from their description it sounds as if the two male terrorists stole the sea star one of the fishermen remembers seeing a redhaired woman board a smaller boat was george with them bess asked but theo didnt know why did they take your boat mick wondered when they had the other one maybe they need a faster larger boat than the one theyve been using nancy suggested she followed her friends outside into the late afternoon sunshine the bright sky seemed to contrast sharply with the darkness of her mood maybe we should go back to the hotel and wait zoe suggested bleakly shes right bess said wiping tears from her eyes she couldnt stop crying theres really nothing else we can do i cant just sit around and wait nancy said ill go crazy dont tell me mick said raising an eyebrow at her you want to go to dragonisi i have to nancy told him its too dangerous bess insisted if the terrorists see us they might kill george and kevin on the spot nancy frowned thinking we can wait in a boat offshore out of the way of the police and where the terrorists cant see us zoe shook her head its too risky please nancy pleaded i just need to be sure that george and kevin get away safely i can take you there theo offered a friend of mine at the marina told me that i could use his boat until i get mine back thanks nancy said gratefully we should leave right away the six oclock deadline isnt that far away its already fourthirty this is crazy mick said hesitantly but i know theres no changing your mind count me in bess and zoe exchanged a look then zoe shrugged i guess im going to see dragonisi after all bess said feeling miserable as she followed her friends down the street to the marina as theo had promised a small blue boat similar in size to the sea star awaited them at mykonoss harbor as theo steered the boat out of the harbor bess sat beside nancy on the aft deck i guess theos not a suspect anymore bess said nancy nodded it looks as if the operation was directly between the terrorists and spiros the fact that the terrorists stole theos boat proves that he was just an innocent victim and so are george and kevin she added silently staring out at the churning sea by the time they neared dragonisi it was already fivethirty just thirty minutes until the deadline yet there wasnt a police vessel in sight something must be wrong nancy said as theo cut the boats engine offshore they were behind a huge rock formation that jutted out of the water by leaning over the forward deck however nancy could see the cave entrance and the shore squinting she could also see a yellow boat moored near the beach and a smaller boat theo nancy asked pointing isnt that your boat theo leaned forward thats the sea star all right nancy choked back a sick feeling whats keeping the police maybe theyre already inside bess said but she looked just as worried as nancy felt nancy shook her head no wed see another boat maybe more lets just sit tight and see what happens mick suggested nancy didnt see any alternative so she and the others settled in by the forward railing their eyes were glued to the rocky beach those binoculars we used to watch spiros might help bess said pulling them out of her tote bag here she handed them to theo tense moments passed without a sign of another boat the waiting is killing me nancy thought as she checked her watch yet again twenty minutes to the deadline someones coming out of the cave theo announced handing nancy the binoculars nancy recognized mashti the muscular man as she watched he transferred the four cartons of explosives from the smaller boat to the sea star theyre moving everything to theos boat she said a moment later rashid came out and helped mashti move knapsacks onto the sea star theyre getting ready to leave nancy told the others lowering the field glasses a tense silence settled over the group where are the police mick finally said no one has brought the passports nancy said anxiously the terrorists must be getting ready to kill george and kevin ive got to go in there before its too late chapter sixteen nancys friends looked at her as if she had lost her mind you cant go in that cave zoe warned her it would be suicide shes right mick said firmly its bad enough that those people have two hostages dont make it three nancy im not going to march in there were going to swim in through kea lake said nancy theos mouth dropped open thats right we can use the underwater passage he cried nancy stood up and began to search through the boats compartments at last she found what she wanted this will help she said pulling out a flare gun i have a plan that might give george and kevin a chance to get away but ill need everyones help her friends were openly skeptical at first but once nancy explained her plan they agreed to try it bess and zoe had discovered a box of snorkeling gear belowdeck and theo found a chart of dragonisi which they could use to map out their plan within minutes the group was ready for action theo and mick would dive into the pond on the other side of the point and snorkel into the terrorists cave ending up in kea lake inside the large chamber while nancy used the flare gun to distract the terrorists mick and theo would emerge from kea lake free george and kevin and guide them out through the underwater passage well bring along extra snorkeling gear for george and kevin to use on the way out said mick this pond will lead us to the tunnel of water theo said pointing to a spot on the chart its on the next beach just beyond that stone ridge nancy looked up at the rocky point to the right of the terrorists cave then nodded nancy turned to bess and zoe you should wait on the other side of the point for theo and mick to return with george and kevin nancy explained and while youre waiting watch for the police then come back for me but what if the terrorists come after you mick asked his jaw tense i can hide in that rocky section of the point just like we did last time nancy assured him wait a minute bess objected as theo guided the boat toward the rocks just out of sight of the terrorists cave this sounds too risky to me weve got to do it nancy said squeezing besss arm george and kevins lives depend on it nancy had put the flare gun and extra flares in a tote bag she found belowdeck now she slung the bag over her shoulder and descended the boats ladder as she carefully stepped into the waistdeep water she held the bag over her head fortunately the beach was deserted as nancy waded ashore and ran behind a clump of rocks turning she saw the boat with her friends disappear beyond the jagged coastline momentarily she felt deserted but then she concentrated on the task at hand nancy looked at her watch ten minutes until the deadline she thought as she watched the minutes tick away on her watch she mapped out her next move five minutes later she decided that mick and theo were probably ready gritting her teeth nancy raced across the sandy dunes to the mouth of the tunnel her progress was slowed as she plunged into darkness but she inched forward trying to remember the caves layout from the day she and mick had explored it her thundering heartbeat filled her ears as she moved on finally she turned a corner and saw the sunlit entrance of the inner chamber holding her breath she flattened herself against the stone wall and peered inside george and kevin were sitting against a huge boulder bound together with rope the three terrorists were sitting in a circle nearby talking nancy backed away and took out the flare gun its now or never she thought bracing herself she aimed the gun into the air and fired a redtailed rocket whooshed through the darkness and shot into the rocky chamber confused shouts came from the cave as nancy quickly reloaded the flare gun and fired again then she spun around and hurried through the dark tunnel toward the beach she could hear the voices of the terrorists behind her they were chasing her she only hoped that she could lure all three of them out leaving george and kevin alone and unguarded for the rescue she stumbled her arm scraping against the rough wall of the tunnel keep going she urged herself on just as she heard a loud pop and saw sparks fly off the cave wall ahead of her thats a ricocheting bullet nancys feet pounded on the path when she reached the mouth of the cave she raced across the beach and dived behind a nearby pile of boulders her heart was pounding but there was no time to catch her breath she crouched on her knees in the sand reloaded and shot another flare toward the cave the shot was answered by a loud scream nancy peered over the top of the rock to see mashti and shara lingering at the mouth of the cave but where was the third terrorist rashid she had to lure him out of the cave otherwise mick and theo would receive a violent reception when they emerged from lake kea just then mashti aimed his gun in her direction and fired nancy ducked her head hitting the sand as the bullet zinged overhead she was still taking cover when she felt the sand shift beside her she had company a hand closed over her shoulder chilling her to the bone chapter seventeen strong fingers gripped nancys shoulder pulling her up to a sitting position rashid her mind screamed nancy glared at the man then let out a sigh of relief it wasnt rashid after all she was staring into the surprised face of officer rossolatos he didnt look at all pleased to see her nancy drew he said crouching beside her what are you doing here trying to lure the terrorists out of the cave she said desperately they both pressed against a boulder as two more bullets flew overhead quickly she explained the plan she and her friends had put into action when it seemed that the police wouldnt arrive in time we were held up waiting for the female agent the officer explained peering over the top of the huge rock nancy frowned ive got to get the other man out of the cave or my friends will be in big trouble say no more rossolatos said kneeling beside her he drew a gun from the holster at his waist and fired nancy cringed at the noise but the barrage of shots sent mashti and shara scrambling behind the sea star but what about rashid nancy thought frantically it was a long shot but she decided to shoot off one more flare quickly she reloaded the gun stepped beside the boulder and shot a flare toward the mouth of the cave the flare made it inside the entrance and an echoing blast followed a moment later nancy saw rashid crawl out of the cave entrance he was firing a machine gun nancy dived for cover silently praying that the plan had worked behind her half a dozen boats closed in on the shoreline rossolatos was speaking into a walkietalkie updating the other police and interpol officers a shower of gunfire tore along the beach chasing rashid and ripping holes into the hull of the boat where shara and mashti were hiding the terrorists were clearly outnumbered within minutes the threesome surrendered marching onto the open beach with their hands over their heads nancy watched as they were handcuffed and loaded onto a police boat weak with relief nancy dropped the flare gun in the sand i need to find out if my friends made it out she told officer rossolatos anxiously pointing toward the rocky ridge can one of the police boats give me a lift nancy was escorted onto a launch which sped over the water circling the point immediately she spotted the borrowed fishing boat anchored in the cove zoe and bess were pacing along the beach still no sign of them zoe reported as nancy waded ashore what was all that gunfire when nancy told them what had happened bess widened her eyes in terror oh nancy what if they dont make it they will nancy said hugging bess she only hoped she was right the three girls waited in silence staring into the clear pond that disappeared into the tunnel minutes dragged on and nancy thought the waiting would never end then at last she saw the silhouettes of swimmers coming through the dark mouth of the rock tunnel its george bess squealed and kevin theyre back she raced into the pond a moment later george and kevin emerged from the water pushing back their snorkel masks their clothes were clinging to them but to nancy it was the best sight she had seen in her life you had me scared sick bess said throwing her arms around her cousin nancy was right behind bess thank goodness youre safe she said hugging george and kevin then she turned to mick and theo who were just emerging from the water and taking off their masks you guys are true heroes nancy said she squeezed theos arm and gave mick a big kiss we cant take all the glory mick said gazing down into nancys eyes we wouldnt have been able to get them out if you hadnt had the guts to go into the cave with that flare gun that was amazing george agreed one minute we were sitting there doomed the next minute there were rockets zipping through the cave thanks for saving us guys kevin told the group after this ill be happy to get back to the tame world of a tv sports announcer after this week well all be ready for something tame bess said well theo said folding his arms is anyone interested in some snorkeling lessons officer rossolatos had asked the teens to remain on the scene until the police report was complete relieved that the terrorists had been captured the group didnt mind hanging around at one point nancy noticed george and kevin stealing off for a private moment a few minutes later they hugged then separated kevin joined mick and theo who were talking with officer rossolatos george came over and sat next to nancy on a boulder in the shade looks like you two were having a hearttoheart nancy told her friend about our relationship george admitted sitting down beside nancy and nancy prodded there was a thoughtful expression in georges brown eyes as she cupped her chin in her hands you know that kevin has to report to madrid on sunday right nancy nodded well george continued his job keeps him on the road a lot its been bugging me for a while i think we both need to be free to see other people she let out a sigh im nuts about kevin you know that but hes going to be on assignment in europe for quite a while i just think that we both need our freedom right now hows kevin taking it nancy asked gently george shrugged hes not crazy about the idea but he understands nancy nodded sympathetically the news of georges decision reminded nancy that she faced a huge choice of her own and suddenly her decision was crystal clear mail call zoe shouted as she ran down the path to the hotel beach it was saturday morning and nancy and her friends had decided to spend the day lazing around at the inn theo george and kevin were windsurfing just offshore and nancy mick and bess were stretched out on beach towels two letters from the states zoe said handing envelopes to nancy and bess news from the homefront bess said tearing open a letter from her mother when nancy saw the return address on her letter she decided to read it later she tucked it into her tote bag it was from ned no matter what the letter said nancy knew that ned was only part of the reason for her decision not to marry mick her adventures in europe had taught her one important thing about herself she thrived on independence marriage involved a commitment a giant step that she wasnt ready to take right now she needed to be free to explore everything life had to offer the only bad part was that she had really fallen for mick nancy looked up as zoe and bess jumped up and ran into the water now that she and mick were alone she knew it was time to tell him what was on her mind we need to talk she told him sitting up fire away mick said he propped himself up on his elbows and faced her about getting married nancy began then paused when a rush of emotion nearly overwhelmed her tears stung her eyes as she looked over at mick i im just not ready mick im crazy about you but im not ready to make that kind of commitment and leave my friends and father and shhh mick whispered gently placing a finger over nancys lips you dont have to explain i understand he stared into nancys eyes for a moment stroking her cheek i have to admit i wish it werent so the door is always open nancy remember that ill never forget you he reached into his knapsack and pulled out his wallet opening it he showed nancy a picture see it was the photo dimitri had taken of them the day they had arrived on mykonos its a picture of us and not a very good one nancy teased what do you mean mick said taking a closer look at the photo i look spectacular just then everyone charged onto the beach and dragged nancy and mick into the water a water battle ensued finally nancy bess and george managed to untangle themselves and head for the beach leaving the others in the water we noticed some heavy conversation going on bess said as she toweled off did you decide about getting married nancy took a deep breath then told her best friends about her decision wow george said i mean im glad youre not moving to the other side of the planet but are you sure youre all right dont feel bad you two bess said throwing her arms around nancy and george nancy smiled weakly even though i know its the right choice it will still be hard to say goodbye she said i know what you mean george agreed but soon well be back in the states bess pointed out and theres just something irresistible about allamerican guys
