chapter one when the first man woke up that morning he wasnt thinking about killing anyone he woke up with a head full of blues a brain that was too big for his skull and a bladder about to burst he lay with his eyes closed breathing across a tongue that tasted like burnt chicken feathers the blues rolled in through the bedroom door coming down hard he had been flying on cocaine for three days getting everything done everything then last night coming down hed stopped at a liquor store for a bottle of stolichnaya his bleeding brain retained a picture of himself lifting the bottle off the shelf and another picture of an argument with the counterman who didnt want to break a hundreddollar bill by that time the coke high had become un sustainable and the stoli had been a bad idea there was no smooth landing after a threeday toot but the vodka turned a wheelsup bellylanding into a full crashandburn now hed pay if you peeled open his skull and dumped it he thought his brain would look like a coagulated lump of campbells bean soup he cracked his eyes lifted his head and looked at the clock a few minutes past seven hed gotten four hours of sleep par for the course with coke and the stoli hadnt helped if hed stayed down for ten hours or twelve he needed about sixteen to catch up he might have been past the worst of it now he was just gonna have to suck it up he turned to his left where a woman a dishwater blonde lay facedown in her pillow he could only see about half of her head the rest was buried by a red fleece blanket she lay without moving like a dead woman but no such luck he closed his eyes again and there was nothing left in the world but the blues music bumping in from the next room from the allblues channel ninehundredandsomething on the tv dial mustve left it on last night gotta move he thought gotta pee gotta take twenty aspirins and go down to country kitchen and get some pancakes and link sausages the man didnt wake up thinking about murder he woke up thinking about his head and his bladder and a stack of pancakes funny how things work out that night when he killed two people he was a little shocked greeneyed aliee maison stood in the hulk of a rustcolored mississippi river barge she was wrapped in a designer dress that looked like froth over a reef in the caribbean sea an anklelength dress the exact fadedjade color of her eyes lowcut and sheer hugging her hips flaring at her ankles she was largeeyed barefoot elfin fleeing down a pale yellow twobytwelveinch pine plank which stretched like a line of fire out of the purple gloom of the barges interior behind her a huge man in a sleeveless white tshirt filthy searsroebuck work pants and teninch work boots blew sparks off a piece of wrought iron with an acetylene torch he was wearing a black domeshaped welding helmet and acrid grey smoke curled around his heavy tense legs the blank robotic faceplate in combination with his hairy arms the dirty shirt and the smoke the squat legs gave him the grotesque crouching power of a gargoyle a fantasy at three thousand dollars an hour and not quite right thats no fucking good no fucking good amnon plain moved through the bank of strobes his thick black hair falling over his forehead his narrow glasses glittering in the set lights his voice cutting like a piece of broken glass aliee youre freezing up at the line i want you blowing out of the place i want you moving faster when you come up to the line not slower youre slowing down and i want you to look pissed you look annoyed you look petulant i am annoyed im freezingaliee snapped ive got goosebumps the size of oranges plain turned to an assistant larry move the heater into the back you gotta get some heat on her well get the fumes larry said arms akimbo a deliberately effeminate pose larry wasnt gay just ironic well deal with the fucking fumes huh okay well deal with the fucking fumes you gotta do something im really coldaliee said she clasped her arms around herself and shivered for effect a man dressed in black walked out from behind the lights peeling off his cashmere sport coat he was tall thin his overtheshoulder brunette hair worn loose and back he had a thick hammeredsilver loop earring in his left ear and a dark soulpatch under his lower lip take this until theyre ready again he said to aliee she huddled in the coat turning away from them plain rolled his eyes larry move the fuckin heater larry shrugged and began wheeling the propane heater further into the barge if they all died of carbon monoxide poisoning it wouldnt be his fault plain turned back to aliee jax take a hike and take your coat with you hey the man in black said but nobody was looking at him or paying attention plain continued aliee i want you pissed dont do that thing with your lips youre sticking your lips out like this plain pursed his lips thats a pout i dont want a pout do it like this he grimaced and aliee tried to imitate him this was one of her talents the ability to imitate expression the way a dancer could imitate motion thats better plain said to aliee but make your mouth longer turn it down and get it set that way while youre moving do it again she did it again making the changes thats good but now you need some mouth he turned back to the line of lights and the small crowd gathered behind them an account executive a creative director a makeup artist a hairdresser a couture rep a second photo assistant and alies parents lynn and lil plain did not provide chairs and the inside of the barge was not a place youd want to sit down not if your handtailored jeans cost four hundred and fifty dollars to the makeup artist plain said fix her mouth and to the second assistant jimmy wheres the fucking polaroid you got the polaroid jimmy was fanning a x cm polaroid color print which was used to check exposure he glanced at the print and said its coming up behind him the creative director whispered to the account executive says fuck a lot and the account executive muttered they all do plain peered at the polaroid looked up at an overhead soft box move that box about two feet to the right that way jimmy moved it and plain looked around everybody ready aliee remember the line clark are you ready the welder said yeah im ready was that enough sparks sparks were fine sparks were good plain said youre the only fucking professional working here this morning he looked back at aliee now dont fucking pout blow right through the line aliee waited patiently until her mouth was fixed staring blankly past the makeup artists ear as a bit of color was patched into the left corner of her lower lip jax said into her ear love you youre doing great you look great aliee barely heard him she was seeing herself walking the plank the vision of herself that came from plains mind when her mouth was done she stepped back to her starting mark jax got out of the way and when plain said go aliee got her expression right started down the plank with a lanky hipswinging stride and blew past the exposure line the green dress swirling about her hips the orangeyellow welders sparks flashing in the background the stink and smoke of the burning metal curled around her as plain standing behind the camera fired the bank of strobes better plain said stepping toward her a little fuckin better theyd been working for two hours in the belly of the grain barge the barge was a gift a pilot on the greekowned mississippi towboat treponema had driven it into a protective abutment around a bridge piling the damaged barge had been floated to the anshiser repair yard in st paul where welders cut away the buckled hull plates and prepared to burn on new ones plain spotted the disemboweled hulk while scouting for photo locations he made a deal with archerdanielsmidland the barge owner delay repairs for a week and adm would make vogue the people who ran adm couldnt think of a good reason why the company would worry about vogue but their publicity ladies were wetting their pants so they said okay and the deal was made they were still working with the green dress when a team from tvs showed up and they all took a break aliee goofed around for the camera with jax showing a little skin doing a long slow rolling tonguekiss which the camera crew asked them to redo twice once as a silhouette the interviewer for tvs a squarejawed exjock with bleached teeth and a smile hed perfected in his bathroom mirror said after the cameras shut down its a slow day i think well lead the news with this nobody asked why it was news they all lived with cameras and assumed that it was two hours for four different shots with and without fans two rolls of highsaturation fujichrome film for each of the shots the fuji would make the colors pop plain pronounced himself satisfied with the green dress and they moved on the next pose involved a torn tshirt and a pair of malelook womens briefs complete with the vented front aliee and jax moved against the far hull and a little shadow and aliee turned her back to the photo crowd and peeled off the green dress shed been nude beneath the dress anything else would ruin the line she was aware of her nudity but not selfconscious about it as she had been at first her first jobs had been as one model in a group and they usually changed all at once she was simply one naked woman among several by the time she started up the ladder to stardom to individual attention shed become as conditioned to public nudity as a striptease dancer even more than that shed worked in europe with the germans and total nudity wasnt uncommon in fashion work she remembered the first time shed had her pubic hair brushed out fluffed up the brusher had been a thirtysomething guy whod squatted in front of her smoking a cigarette while he brushed her and then did a quick trim with a pair of barber scissors all with the emotional neutrality of a postman sorting letters then the photographer came over to take a look suggested a couple of extra snips her body might as well have been an apple you want privacy you turn your back aliee maison ahleeay maysone had been born sharon olson in burnt river minnesota until she was seventeen shed lived with her parents and her brother tom in a robinseggblue rambler just off highway fourteen miles south of the canadian line she was a beautiful baby she won a beautiful baby prize when she was a year old shed been born just before halloween and her costume was a pumpkin that her mother made on her singer a year later sharon toddled away with a statewide beautifultoddler trophy in that one shed been dressed as a lightning bug in a suit of black and gold dance and comportment lessons began when she was three singing lessons when she was four at five she won the north central tapfairies contest for children five and younger that was the pattern miss junior north country international miss snow international falls and fort francis canada miss border lakes she sang and danced through her school days miss minnesota and even her parents lynn and lil barely dared to dream it miss america was possible until she was fourteen anyway when the breast genes were passed out in heaven aliee had been in line for an extra helping of eyes instead that became obvious in junior high when her friends began to complain about bra straps cutting into their necks not aliee as the olsons best friends ellen and bud benton said bud said it anyway aint no miss minnesota without the big bumpers yknow as it happened the breasts didnt matter in the summer of her sixteenth year lynn and lil took her to a model agency in minneapolis and the agent liked what she saw aliee had knifeedge cheekbones and those jadegreen eyes they came straight from god in a perfect package with whiteblonde hair a flawless complexion delicate fuckme shoulder blades and hips so narrow shed have trouble giving birth to a baling wire between minneapolis and new york sharon olson vanished and aliee maison stepped into her sizesix dress she was so famous that the secondmost famous person in burnt river was a lawncare service operator named louis friar friar one night in tenth grade nailed aliee in the short grass beside the firstbase line of the american legion baseball diamond on bergholm road on an air mattress that hed brought along for that express purpose louis never talked about it he never even confirmed that it happened he held the memory of the event in a beery reverence aliee on the other hand talked to everyone so everyone in burnt river knew about it and how at the critical moment louis had cried out oh god oh god oh god oh god which was why everybody in town called him reverend friar himself thought the nickname was based on his last name as if the residents of burnt river were universally fond of puns nobody ever told him different you dont think theyre getting too close to porno lil now asked under her breath to lynn as they watched amnon plain push their daughter around the set i dont want any goddamned porno lil had a thing about porno you know theyre not going to do any porno lynn said placatingly he was wearing blackonblack with wraparound blades they better not thatll kill you in a minute she refocused look at jax i think hes so good for her jax he had no last name was peering around the set through the viewfinder of a nikon f he thought of himself as a photographer although he hadnt yet taken many photographs but how hard could it be you look through the hole you push the button when aliee said you got anything jax let the camera drop to his side tipped his head and they moved together against the hull of the barge jax took a plastic nosedrop bottle from his pocket and passed it to her aliee unscrewed the top slipped the end into a nostril and squeezed the bottle once twice whoa whoa jax muttered not too much itll kill the eyes if you had eyes as green and large as aliees you didnt want them dilated amnon plain was moving lights around as his assistants refilled the camera backs with kodachrome aliee would be wearing a torn paleblue tshirt that was meant to show just a hint of rouged nipple within the tear and the film had to hold the subtlety of the pinkagainstblue with the kodachrome the flare of the torch behind her wouldnt pop like it would on the fuji but that wasnt so important in this shot plain was juggling the color equities in his mind when aliee said past his head hello jael plain turned his sister was standing in the gash in the barges hull just inside the line of lights what do you want he snapped jael corbeau shed changed her name with her mother after their parents split up was light where plain was dark blonde against plains deep brunette despite their coloring differences they had faces that were astonishingly alike wedgeshaped edgy bigeyed jael had once been a model herself didnt need the money found the life boring and moved on although the two of them looked alike there was a singular difference in their faces three long pale lines slashed across jaels face scars she was a lovely woman to begin with but the scars made her something else striking beautiful erotic exotic something i came to see aliee she said sullenly see her someplace else plain said were trying to work here dont give me a hard time plain get the fuck off my shoot plain said walking toward her all other talk stopped and clark the welder stood up uncertainly and pushed his mask back plains voice vibrated with violence from behind him aliee said theres a party at sillys tonight nine oclock jael had taken a step back away from her brother there was no fear in her but she didnt doubt that plain would physically throw her off the barge he was bigger sillys at nine she said and left plain watched her go watched until she was out of sight turned back to aliee took a breath saw clark hovering in the background like a sumo wrestler he turned to the couture rep and said ive got your key shot the couture rep was a thinfaced german named dieter kopp he had a stubblecut skull twoday beard and gaunt pale face his cheeks were lightly pitted as though he might once have suffered from smallpox he was the only one not wearing jeans instead he wore a pale gray italian suit with an opennecked black dress shirt and a gold tennis bracelet kopp didnt want to be in st paul didnt want to be in america he wanted to be in vienna or berlin but he was condemned to this to sell seventydollar malelook underpants complete with front vent to american women like a good german he would do what was necessary to carry out his orders but at the moment he was still vibrating with the possibility of violence against the striking blonde whod just walked off the barge he knew her face shed been a model he knew that but shed been out of it for a few years she looked better now she was stunning he thought what he asked hed missed what plain said to him ive got your key shot we move clark around back and we put aliee deadcenter aliee come over here aliee walked toward them along the plank as plain continued we light them separately and then jam them together with the long lens clark will look like the fuckin moon coming over the horizon and aliee will be there in the foreground we still need the nipple for the punch said the german we could lose it with a long lens gotta lose it anyway for the americans said the creative director a man with a red beard and bald freckled head we can do it both ways plain said for the europeans well hold it well stick a snoot over on the left and light it aliee aliee stepped closer and plain slipped his fingers into the torn slit in the tshirt and pulled it wider to expose her nipple well have to tape this back well have to bring it out a little more maybe touch it with a little more makeup not too much shes really pale and too much would look artificial the art director said nervously artificial would be all right plain said what could be sexier than rouged nipples in germany yes i think kopp said in america sexy in america too but itd be too much for the mainline magazines plain said for the american shot well ice her nipple to bring it up so you can see it through the tshirt put a little shading on the side to emphasize it but we relayer the rip so theres more coverage and drop the snoot but youll still be able to feel it there therell be like a mental tit behind the tshirt youre gonna ice me aliee asked youre gonna fucking ice me its twelve degrees in here the german had closed his eyes after a moment he nodded plain had worked for eight years in miami where hed developed a reputation for a decadent sexually charged fashion art juxtaposing outlandishly disparate characters in variations of the beauty and the beast theme anyone could do that and many tried but plain had something different something that nobody else could quite get something straight out of grimms fairy tales like this shot the german could see it in his minds eye now that all the characters were assembled in this ridiculous hulk with the lights the smell of the welder the roaring propane heater but never could have thought of it this was why he traveled to minneapolis and paid plain as much as he did plain had vision they worked the rest of the morning hard work done over and over plain had a color card in his brain and a drama chip he knew what he was getting and he pushed it shredded the tshirt exposed one breast completely clark watched from the background a burning torch in his hand his cementblock sausagelovers face fixed by the vision of the womans body lynn and lil watched from behind the lights you dont think thats getting toward the porno when they were done and while jax was collecting aliees dressing bags one of plains assistants walked her back to a rented lincoln towncar she recovered her purse and the stash of cocaine caught a little dust under a fingernail and inhaled what do you think of that clark guy the assistant asked aliee whose eyes had been closed the better to experience the rush now opened one eye cocked her head and thought about it hes not bad for a pickup what i meant was he looked like he had a zucchini stuffed in his pants during that last sequence aliee smiled her wan cokedup smile and said then it must have been a good sequence dieter kopp had seen it so had plain i was afraid id lose it plain laughed brushing the hair back from his eyes i was over there waggling that snoot around trying to get some light on him hoping it wouldnt go away hoping he wouldnt figure out what i was doing not for the american magazines i dont think kopp said but it was a question oh i think so plain said you couldnt say anything about it you couldnt make it too obvious but a little work on the computer taking it up or down well get it in and people will notice kopp bobbed his head flashed his thin hard grin at another time he mightve been driving a tank into russia instead of selling underwear but that was then and this was now he was in underwear they all went to the party that night at silly hansons home aliee jax plain kopp corbeau the photo assistants aliees parents even clark the welder aliee looked spectacular she wore the green dress from the photo shoot and hung with jael corbeau and catherine kinsley the heiress the three women like the three fates in the renaissance paintings all tangled together technopop rolled from small black speakers spotted around silly hansons public rooms and aliee images flashed across movieaspect flatscreen monitors the crowd danced and sweated and drank martinis and rob roys and came and went silly herself got drunk and physical with dieter kopp who left thumb bruises on her breasts and ass a gambler drifted through the crowd and met a cop who was astonished to see him and the killer was there in the corner watching chapter two lucas davenport got up that morning at five oclock long before the sun had come over the treetops he ate a bowl of oatmeal drank a cup of coffee filled a thermos with the rest of the coffee and drove into hayward his friend had the boat loaded lucas left his tahoe on the street and they drove together out to round lake on the years last muskiefishing trip cold weather no wind but cold they had to break through a fifteenfoot line of quarterinch ice at the landing in another day the ice would be an inch thick and out fifty or eighty feet all along the country roads guys were pulling icefishing houses out of their back yards getting ready for winter on this day though most of the water was still soft they found a spot off a sunken bar and dropped their baited sucker hooks off the side and waited lucass friend didnt talk much just stood like a moron and bounced a lure called a fuzzy duzzit off the bottom and kept one eye on the sucker rods lucas dozed a quiet peaceful unstressed sleep that always left him oddly refreshed they didnt catch anything they rarely did although lucass friend was an authority on muskie fishing and by noon stiff with the cold they headed back to town lucas pulled the battery out of the boat for winter storage in his friends basement while his friend carried nets oars a cooler a pissjug and other gear into the garage when it was all done lucas said see you in the spring fat boy and headed back to his cabin he couldve taken a nap hed only had four hours of sleep the night before but he been drinking coffee to keep warm and the caffeine had him jangled and the nap in the boat had helped instead of sleeping he got tools out of the truck and started working on his new steel boat shed the previous shed had been wired for electricity and the contractor who built the new shed had left the underground cable coiled next to the foundation the day before lucas had bought four fluorescent shop lights four outlets and a wallmounted junction box and now started putting them up and wiring them in the job went slowly he had to run into town for more wire and hed stopped for a late lunch and more coffee by the time he was finished the sun was dropping over the lake he flipped on the lights spent a few seconds admiring their pink glow hed gotten the natural fluorescents and started filling the place up he backed in two small aluminum boats on their trailers put a utility trailer in the far corner a john deere gator sideways in front of the trailer and finally a kubota tractor the kubota belonged to a neighbor who found he couldnt fit it in his garage it wouldnt start right away so lucas had to bleed the fuel line before it would kick over a little after six oclock he walked in the dark back to the cabin just beyond down at the lake a merganser squawked the edge of ice around the lake had disappeared during the day but the temperature dropped quickly after sundown unless a wind came up to roil the water the lake should ice over during the night he spent two hours picking up the cabin vacuuming collecting garage and old summer magazines washing and drying sheets cleaning out the refrigerator wiping down the kitchen then a shower with a beer sitting on the toilet stool dressed again he turned off the water heater and water pump and pushed the thermostat down to fifty after a last check he dragged the trash out to the tahoe and threw it in the back at eight oclock he locked the cabin and walked out to the truck a redandsilver lund fishing boat was parked just beyond the new shed dropped by another guy the week before hed be dragging it back to the cities he hooked it up doublechecked the safety chains checkedthe trailer lights good they worked even the turn signals all right ready for winter he thought a merganser squawked again and then another some kind of duckfistfight down at the lake or somebody rolling over in bed and a million stars looking down at him on a moonless night he looked up through the tree tops at the milky way a billion stars like bubbles davenport was a tall man he drove a porsche daytoday but fit better in the big tahoe he had black hair shot through with vagrant strands of grey he was as dark as a sicilian with a permanent outdoor tan the tan made his eyes seem bluer and brighter and his smile whiter women had told him that his eyes seemed kindly even priestly but his smile made them nervous he had the smile one of them told him of a predator about to eat something tasty his face was touched with scars a long thin line crossed his eyebrow into his cheek like a knife cut but it wasnt another that looked like an exclamation mark a thin line from a knife a round o from a bullet wound marked the front of his neck along his windpipe hed been shot and had almost died but a surgeon had opened his throat with a jackknife and kept him breathing long enough to get him to an operating table a plastic surgeon had offered to revise the scars but he kept them absently traced them with his fingers when he was thinking personal history not to be forgotten the road out was narrow and dark and he was in no hurry he took highway into hayward dropped down to in spooner headed west across the border into minnesota out to by ten oclock he was on the far northern rim of the cities pulling the boat the owner of the lund was a guy named herb clay who owned the remnants of a farm south of forest lake not far off the interstate lucas pulled into clays driveway bounced past the house to the barnyard and turned a tight circle he left the engine running and climbed out of the truck as a porch light came on a moment later clay stepped out on the porch supporting himself on crutches that you its me lucas said he started unhitching the trailer howre the legs itch like hell clay said got a coat hanger to scratch with yeah but theres always a spot that you cant reach clays wife came out on the porch pulling on a quilted jacket she hurried across the yard let me get the door she said she pulled open a lowerlevel door on the barn which led into what would have been a turnofthecentury milking chamber but was now a garage she turned on lights and lucas got in the truck and backed the boat into the barn stop she yelled when the boat was far enough back he stopped and they unhitched the trailer and dropped it the interior of the barn years past the last bovine occupant still smelled slightly of hay and what might have been manure a thoroughly pleasant smell clays wife closed the door and came out to stand by lucas and they both looked up at the sky pretty night she said she was a small slender woman with dark hair and a square face she and lucas had always liked each other and if things had been different if the clays hadnt been quite so happy with each other she smelled good like some kind of faintly perfumed soap pretty night he repeated thanks for helping out with the boat she said quietly thanks for bringing it clay called from the porch yup lucas got back in the truck talk to ya at ten minutes after eleven oclock he rolled up his driveway punched the garagedoor opener and eased the tahoe in next to the porsche a new car the porsche about time clean mellow starting to fade the memory of verna clays scent still on his mind he dropped into bed he was asleep in five minutes a small easy smile on his face he got three hours and fortyfive minutes of sleep the phone rang the unlisted line groggy he pushed himself up in bed picked it up yeah swanson one of the oldtime guys goddamnit youre home you know who aliee maison is the famous model yeah somebody strangled her in a rich ladys house we need some political shit over here this is gonna be a screamer chapter three saturday the first day of the aliee maison case the morning was cold even for midnovember the lake a hundred miles north would have frozen over for sure lucas thought he stood at a gas pump trickling fifteen gallons of premium into the tank of the porsche two blocks out of his driveway running for the aliee maison scene he remembered about the gas he didnt have any now at the least convenient moment hed had to stop he yawned and peered around the gas station attendant sat in an armoredglass booth punching with his thumbs at a game boy like a figure in an edward hopper tableau lucas didnt register hopper instead he wondered idly why gas pumps no longer dinged they used to ding with every gallon or so he thought and now they just rattled off yellow electronic digits gallons and dollars silent as the night another car a small lincoln the one that shared its frame with a jaguar lucas knew about the jaguar but could never remember the lincolns name pulled into the second set of gas pumps lucas yawned again and watched as a woman got out and stopped yawning something familiar about her from a long time ago he couldnt see her face and it wasnt her face that sparked the memory it was the way she moved something about the movement and the stature and the hair her face was turned away from him as she opened the gas flap on the car unscrewed the cap and maneuvered the nozzle into the mouth of the tank she was wearing a suit and dark low heels and a dark blouse she turned toward him to drag her credit card through the pumps cardreader but he caught only a flash of her face a square chin tennisblonde hair he thought of weather the woman hed almost married should have married a woman he still thought about but this wasnt weather weather was smaller and hed know her a mile away whether her back was turned or not the pumphandle jumped under his hand and clanked filled up he turned off the pump and walked over to the station got a bottle of diet coke out of a cooler and pushed a twenty and a ten through the cash window the attendant barely able to tear himself away from the game sullenly made onehanded change a college algebra book sat on the counter next to him vbu go to st thomas lucas asked yeah bad hours life sucks and then you die the kid said he didnt smile he seemed to mean it his eyes flicked past lucass shoulder and a light soprano voice asked lucas is that you he turned but he didnt have to to know who it was everything came back with the voice catrin he said and turned she was smiling and the smile nearly knocked him off his feet she was fortyfour ten pounds heavier than in college a little rounder in the face but with that fine welsh skin and wild reddishblonde hair the last time hed seen her must be twentyfive years she said she reached out and took his hand and then looked at the attendant and said i paid outside they stepped toward the door and then outside and catrin said ive seen you on television lucas was trying to recover but recovery was difficult the last time hed seen her what uh whatre you doing now i live down in lake city she said you know on lake pepin married with kids she grinned at him of course to a doctor a family practitioner two kids one of each james is a sophomore at st olaf marias a senior in high school ive got one a daughter lucas said still in elementary school her mother and i arent together anymore never married no need to make a point of it a thought occurred to him and he looked at his watch its not four oclock yet what are you doing out here a friend died this morning she said her smile had gone wistful he thought for a moment that she might break down i knew she was going tonight i sort of dressed up for it jesus it was not good lung cancer she said she never quit smoking im just so just so he patted her on the back yeah and where are you going i dont remember you as an early riser got a murder he said he felt that he was staring at her and that she knew it and was amused back when shed know exactly what she did to him the effect he thought must have been wiredin because it hadnt changed in twentyfive years ah you know the model aliee maison her hand went to her mouth in astonishment she was murdered strangled oh my god here minneapolis catrin looked around the empty gas station pad youre not exactly rushing to the scene of the crime five minutes aint gonna make any difference lucas said shes dead she seemed to step back though she hadnt moved she looked up and said you always had a harsh line in you the cold breath of reality and shed just seen a friend die lucas thought im sorry i didnt mean no thats okay thats just lucas she smiled again and took one of his hands in hers and patted it you better go take care of her yeah he stepped away stopped youre absolutely gorgeous he said youre one of those women wholl be gorgeous when shes ninety nice to think so when you feel the age coming she said she crossed her arms hugged herself when your friends are dying and you feel the age coming on he left reluctantly turning his head to watch her walk to her car the lincoln conservative uppercrust welltended jesus the last time hed seen her his body ran the porsche through the gears out to the interstate ramp down onto toward the lights of minneapolis his eyes intent on the road and the traffic his mind stuck with catrin the last time hed seen her shed been both angry and buck naked just out of a hot shower rubbing her hair with a ratty brown bath towel that hed stolen from his mothers linen closet the trouble had started two weeks earlier at a pickup hockey game on an outdoor rink lucas had caught a deliberate elbow in the face and with blood pouring out of his nose had gone after the other guy and hadnt stopped quite soon enough the other guys friends had taken him to a local hospital for some emergency dental work then hed caught a stick in a regular game against duluth nothing serious just a cut and a few stitches after the match at an offcampus party a hassle erupted between a couple of the players and a defensive end from the football team the hassle had cooled quickly enough no fight but lucas had been ready to jump in catrin clutching at him pulling him off she started getting on him he liked to fight he enjoyed fighting he had to look at himself at what he was doing did he think fighting was right whyd he hang around with all those silly fuckin jocks whod be working down at the car wash as soon as their eligibility ran out he was smarter than they were why couldnt he theyd gone around a few times and she started again as she got out of the shower hed finally had enough and shouted at her shut the fuck up shed flinched away shed thought he might hit her that was a shock he never would have hit her he said so then she got on him again he walked out of the apartment stayed out went down and got some ice time when he came back a sheet of notebook paper lay on his kitchen counter shed scribbled on it fuck you when hed tried to call her roommate said she didnt want to hear from him he didnt push it he was practicing all the time playing trying to keep his head above water in school never went after her but always remembered her theyd dated from october through february of his sophomore year hed slept with a halfdozen women in his life but shed been the first one who seemed to match his interest in sex they studied it together still remembered he smiled at the thought and noticed that the concrete walls of it the interstate were a little too blurred he looked down at the speedometer oneohfour he backed off a bit catrin silly hanson lived in a whitestuccoed house with an orangetiled roof across the street from lake of the isles a rich neighborhood of professionally tended landscapes and architectdesigned houses from the first half of the twentieth century a halfdozen police vehicles were piled up at the curb outside hansons house an earlymorning blader who looked too old and bald and fat and way too rich for his skater gear went by on the lakeside skate way his face turned toward the cluster of cops the word about the murder would be getting out very soon now lucas found a spot by a fire hydrant parked nodded at a cop standing by the stoop beautiful morning he said fuckin a said the cop if i get a ticket you wont get a ticket lucas went up the steps a sloppy overweight homicide cop wearing an insulated nylon baseball jacket over a white shirt and necktie was waiting on the porch his face was tired but he smiled in relief when he saw lucas man im glad youre here so what happened lucas asked two more uniformed cops were standing just inside the door looking out at them you aint gonna believe it the fat cops name was swanson aliee maison got killed lucas said i believe it wheres the body its worse than that swanson said we tried to call you again but you were out of touch lucas stopped what happened whenre you gonna start turning on your cell phone swanson was reluctant if i turn on my cell phone people call on it lucas said so what happened we were just doing the routine checking the house opening doors you know they both knew lucas had been on more murder scenes than he could remember and swanson had been to more than lucas had hed been a homicide cop when lucas was still in uniform yeah we found another body swanson said stuffed in a closet another woman lucas looked at him for a long moment then shook his head thats a lot worse yeah i thought so bad as it was it was something new theyd both been to multiple murders but never to one where the cops had already gotten the coffee hot sent somebody out for donuts started the routine then opened a closet door and had another body drop out like a dislodged sock monkey whyd it take so long to find her lucas asked she was in a closet the door was locked nobody unlocked it right away jesus i hope the papers dont get that lucas said or maybe we ought to give it to them you know our way this woman who lives here hanson she was there when we found the second one and shes gonna talk about it she lives for the media you know what she told me when i was talking to her about it lucas shook his head she said her only good black dresses were too short for this for the murders she sees this as a photoop and shes already figuring out her wardrobe for the cameras all right that happens theres one other thing swanson glanced down at the uniformed cops lucas got the idea and they both turned sideways and swanson dropped his breath hanson says there was a strange guy wandering through the place about the time maison disappeared out of the crowd hanson thinks he did it she didnt know him but he was talking to everybody she said he was like a street guy too thin yellow teeth and he was wearing this tshirt that said im with stupid and had this arrow that pointed down at his dick and he had this weird dogshit brown sport coat lucas stared at swarfson for a moment then said huh thats what i thought swanson said you want to call him yeah ill call him let me look at the scene first hansons home was elegant but sterile lucas recalled another case a couple of months before when hed entered an apartment and found the same highstyle sterility like a picture on the cover of architectural digest pretty but not livedin eggshell walls with contemporary graphics wrenches and hammers and gestures and angst and then around the corner the interjected english countryscene in oilcolors with cows spotted perfectly to connect with the graphics somebody elses sense of humor a humor spoiled by the underlying scent of alcohol and smoke the smell of a wellkept motel the house seemed divided into two parts an openplan public area and a conventional series of bedroom suites at the back swanson led the way into the back two plainclothes cops were standing in a long central hallway looking down at the thick grey hair of an assistant medical examiner who was crouched over a body on the floor the dead woman was facedown she wore a reddishbrown party dress theame was dabbing at her mouth with an absorbent tissue name is sandy lansing swanson said as they walked back shes a hostess of some kind at browns hotel browns was expensive a hotel where poised young blonde women in pearlgray suits took the guests to their suites while bellhops in redandblack monkey suits toted the luggage and kept their mouths shut lucas squatted beside the body one knee cracked know what did it lucas asked theame theame was older like swanson with the same tired hounddog eyes he had a pack of marlboros in his shirt pocket and a black medical bag which was open on the rug behind him i think her skull is cracked he said thats the only trauma i can find but that was probably enough theres a cleft looks like a vshaped cleft she could have been hit by something with a narrow edge on it a board maybe the end of a cane a walking stick not a pipe nothing round a cane did somebody have a cane lucas asked looking up at swanson swanson shrugged but could have been a doorjamb or something like that theame continued here he picked up the womans head gently as though he might have had a daughter of his own and turned it a small indentation marked the back of the womans head near the top there was a smear of blood enough to show the line of the injury we think she might have walked in on the murder by accident and the killer went after her hit her with anything he had swanson said maybe banged her head against the wall why would he stuff her in the closet lucas objected but theame interrupted look at this what he was peering closely at the womans scalp then reached back felt in his bag and took out a hand lens i think uh it looks like a little flake of paint in her hair he looked up at swanson dont let anybody touch the door jambs or any of the wooden trim anywhere she could whack her head you might find an impact mark and maybe a hair or two that could make the difference between murder and manslaughter or even an accident all right swanson said he looked up and down the hall at all the doorjambs there seemed to be dozens lucas went back to his first thought why couldnt this one have been killed first and then cause maison was strangled and she wasnt wearing any underpants and the condition of her vulva and her pubic hair would suggest that shed very recently been engaged in sex swanson said if somebody had killed lansing first we thought it was pretty unlikely that hed stop off to bang maison and then strangle her okay made sense shes got something written on her wrist in ballpoint but its kinda smeared so it probably didnt happen right at the time she was killed theame said he turned a wrist and lucas looked at the smear of blue ink looks like ella fella delia probably not fella swanson said why would anybody write fella on their wrist could be a name theame suggested strange name swanson said see what you can do to bring it up lucas said get some photos over to homicide okay lucas stood lets see the other one the door to the guest bedroom was another six feet down the hall and lucas stepped over lansings body swanson following along behind two crime scene guys stepped out of the room just as lucas came up video one of them said crying goddamned shame said the other inside a photographer lit up and began taping the crime scene while a second guy maneuvered a light all lucas could see of aliee maison was one bare foot sticking out from behind the bed the body was lodged in the space between the bed and the wall he waited until the video guy was finished then looked over the edge of the bed maison was lying face up one hand over her head one trapped beneath her back her filmy green dress had been pulled up under her arms exposing her body from the navel down her hips were canted toward the wall and her ankles were crossed but the wrong way the one that should have been on the bottom was on the top looks like she was thrown in there lucas said one of the cops nodded thats what we think tried to hide her but not too hard you can see her feet but if you just poked your head in from the door you probably wouldnt who found her lucas asked one of the people at the party he looked at a notebook a woman named rowena cooper cooper knew maison was back here supposedly sleeping and hadnt come out she went back to see if she was awake she says she opened the door but couldnt see anything so she turned on the lights she was just turning around to go back out when she saw the underpants she went over to pick them up and she saw the feet started screaming wheres cooper now the cop tipped his dead toward the other end of the house the library we called sloan hes coming in to talk to her good sloan was the best interrogator in the department lucas took a last look around the room the bedspreads coordinated with the window treatments and the carpet he asked the windows were locked in this room yeah but we got an open window down the hall one of the cops said let me see check this first the cop said he leaned forward hovering an index finger over the inside of aliees left elbow lucas would have known what that meant even if he couldnt see the bbsized bruise a needle user he sighed and nodded at the cop said swanson and stepped back into the hallway swanson was a step behind look you know whats gonna happen so weve got to nail everything down lucas said everything i want everything sampled swept vacuumed i want every test there is on both women i want interviews with everyone at the party ask everybody for a list of names and make sure you get every goddamn last one sure who takes over when you get off i think thompson brief him do everything well pay for every bit of science anybody can think of he looked back at the room did you look at her fingernails yeah theyre clean well get her vagina swabbed and get a rush on the semen and blood we need blood right away i want to know what kind of shit she was shooting heroin yeah i know but i wanna know you gonna call del in a minute theres a phone in the office i was keeping it clear for in comings swanson said show me the unlocked window this place doesnt look like the windows should be unlocked hanson says they never are swanson said but she got them washed a couple of weeks ago and they were all opened then theyre some kind of tilt thing sotyou can wash both sides from the inside i dunno yeah well the window could have been unlocked then hanson says she never went around and checked them she assumed they were all locked the unlocked window was in another guest room one door down the hall this room with a different set of coordinated bedspreads window treatments and carpet lucas looked out through the window glass nothing but lawn and shrubs any muddy footprints outside the window with a unique brandlogo impressed in the mud no fuckin mud it aint rained in two weeks i was joking lucas said i wasnt i went out and looked swanson said the grass aint even crinkled all right wheres that phone hansons home office was a small purposebuilt cubicle with cherrywood shelves at one end for phone books references and a compact stereo the cherry desk had four drawers filing drawers to the left envelope drawers to the right a wooden rolodex sat on the right side of the desk a telephone on the left a dell laptop computer sat on a pullout typing shelf the wiring dropping out of sight to appear behind a laser printer that sat on a twodrawer wooden filing cabinet beside the desk hanson still in the living room lucas asked swanson yeah go talk to her keep her entertained ask her questions start the witness list you got it swanson glanced at the laptop nodded and headed toward the living room when he was gone lucas shut the office door and turned on the computer windows came up and he clicked programsaccessoriesaddress book the address book was empty he jumped back to the opening page and clicked on microsoft outlook when it came up he checked the inbox and sent folders and found that hanson had a small email correspondence he picked up the phone and dialed dels number from memory and as the phone began ringing clicked on the inbox folder again clicked again on find and typed in alie e he was still typing when dels wife answered the phone the answer was more like a groan than a word hello cheryl this is lucas is del there hes asleep lucas he was trying to get you all night but he couldnt find you she was crabby what time is it anyway sorry wake him up we gotta talk just a minute after a few seconds of background mumbling del came on the line you heard yeah just now what were you doing here after a moments silence del said what he sounded only semiconscious then wheres her et sallance hansons you were at the party last night right lucas asked yeah but whatre you doing there the maison thing lucas said what lucas looked at the phone and then said you dont know yeah i called in del said i called all over looking for you i even had your neighbor up north go look in your cabin but youd gone you called in that somebody strangled aliee maison longer silence then what the fuck are you talking about somebody strangled aliee maison and threw her body behind a bed in a guest bedroom lucas said another woman was killed and stuffed in a closet hanson thinks a street guy did it said he was wearing an im with stupid shirt after a moment of silence del said youre not joking im not joking jesus christ del was awake now and again jesus christ behind him cheryl asked what happened that was me all right del said i was there until one oclock i didnt see maison there after midnight or so what were you doing runnin drugs man that goddamn place was an ocean of shit maisons got fresh tracks on her arm yeah they were all doing a little something del said i was trying to figure out where it was coming from figure it out no you better get over here im gonna have to talk to hanson pretty quick on my way when del had hung up lucas clicked on the find now button the computer thought about it for a moment then kicked out fifteen or twenty messages he went through them as quickly as he could most of them were did you see or did you hear about aliee in a magazine spread two of them seemed relevant three months earlier according to the date stamp hansons correspondent a woman named martha carter had seen aliee at a party and shed been flying on ccocaine lucas switched to the sent folder scanned it until he found carters name and the right date hanson had replied to the cocaine comment with the observation that friends told her that aliee had started using heroin lucas sent both letters to the printer then went back to the inbox and the find function and typed in maison he got two letters hed already seen he tried alice without the apostrophe between the es and found only one new letter about a dress he quickly typed in sandy lansing and found only one letter in which lansing was mentioned only in passing he tried sandy alone and lansing alone and found only the one letter he switched back the sent folder and repeated himself he found nine references to aliee and none to lansing one letter from hanson confided to a woman named ardis there was no last name that aliee was definitely having an affair with somebody named jael and that somebody else an amnon was wildly jealous i think amnon would kill jael if she said just the right thing to him lucas sent the letter to the printer and noted the email address on it sallance hanson was sitting on her couch wrapped in a black dress a black hat beside her when lucas wandered into the room swanson whod been sitting in an easy chair facing her stood up and said miz hanson this is deputy chief davenport hanson turned on the couch and extended her hand without getting up she was a pretty blonde woman in her forties with a tight willful mouth and tough blue eyes shed used black eye liner under her eyes and just touched her eyelids with a gray tone the combination gave her a playedout dyingpuppy look when do we go downtown i beg your pardon lucas asked to make my statement oh yeah detective swanson will make the arrangements actually we can probably take it right here but i want to talk to you about another matter have you found that street person i identified him hanson said thats what i want to talk to you about her eyebrows rose you found him nobody notified me why didnt anybody tell me swanson said um youre more of a witness or bystander than anything else miz hanson youre not really part of the investigation thats not the way i see it she snapped thats the way it is lucas said i could talk to the mayor and he might inform you differently she said the mayors a friend of mine hes a friend of mine too lucas said he appointed me to my job hed tell you the same thing were telling you youre not part of the investigation youre being investigated what two murders were committed in your house miz hanson you were on the scene when the killings took place we know nothing about you or your relationship with the dead women he smiled at her softening it up no politician the mayor included would go on the record defending somebody who might later be charged with murdering aliee maison im sure you can see that she said oh tipped her head from side to side thinking about it bounced once on the couch brightened and said thats not bad being a suspect but i didnt do it either one that street person is he in jail or are you bringing him here or what lucas felt awkward looking down at her he took a step away and settled into a leather easy chair steepling his fingers in front of his face the street persons name is del capslock he said hes an undercover police officer one of our best undercover people uhoh she said looking from lucas to swanson this could cause you problems then she frowned what was he doing at my party anyway thats the other thing lucas said del was researching drugs miz maison showed signs of heroin use she had needle marks on her arm no hanson registered shock something she was good at lucas thought one hand went artfully to her face she was using drugs a cop stepped into the room said tvs here they all got here in a bunch lucas nodded said okay keep them back then to hanson miz hanson everybody at your party was using drugs i wasnt she said her face darkened i think thats an outrageous thing to say miz hanson the officer in question is a drug specialist lucas said he said an ocean of drugs was flowing through your apartment he knows what hes talking about the thing is theres no way that there could be that much junk around without your knowing about it thats bullshit she said now she was getting angry and a little fearful anything about it maybe my attorney should hear this lucas didnt want to mention the email until theyd taken the computer with a warrant he put his hands up palms out so you call your attorney and talk it over the point is it wont help our investigation if any of this is alluded to if you allow yourself to be interviewed by the press or television and you talk about our man being at your party were going to have to explain why he was there youre blackmailing me she said she was quick enough lucas thought no no you can say anything you want to anybody your attorney will tell you that the first amendment gives you that right and all minneapolis police officers support that right he flicked his eyes sideways at swanson dont we absolutely swanson said piously thats why i served in the marine corps lucas continued im suggesting that you understand the consequences before you take a selfdestructive position if you understand what i mean you want me to shut up she said about our man hes an undercover officer if his face were made public he would lose his effectiveness and might even be endangered what if he did it hanson asked cops do that sort of thing from time to time ive read about it rogue cops this guy doesnt lucas said besides were detailing a special squad out of internal affairs to pull him apart everything he did last night when were done well know every step he took well i think i could leave him out of my statement she said to the press excellent lucas said one more question this will be covered when you make your formal statement but im just curious aliee maison is pretty famous probably the most famous person at your party hanson rolled her eyes up and waggled her head from side to side as if balancing all the equities of fame or celebrity and finally decided probably in that world we also had some very wellknown financial people here but thats another world if she was so famous how could she disappear into a bedroom and nobody was curious about her what had happened to her lucas asked well i mentioned this to officer swanson she seemed very sleepy and just wanted to take a nap so we accommodated her and shooed people away if they asked about her she was on a very rigorous schedule earlymorning photo shoots and all she was exhausted so nobody went back and looked at her oh i dont know maybe some of her friends did hansons eyes slid away from lucas she might not be lying he thought but she was skating probably some of her friends did we were just keeping the sightseers away let me tell you something lucas said i cant read you well enough to know if youre lying to us but if you are youre committing a crime you dont have to talk to us at all he turned to swanson and asked have you read her her rights not yet do it he said he turned back to hanson you dont have to talk to us at all or you can have an attorney but if you do talk to us it better be the truth we can get pretty goddamn cranky about obstruction of justice in a doublemurder case from the front hall a man called hello lucas recognized the voice sloan in here a moment later sloan appeared cleaned up and ready for the day in a fresh brown suit white shirt and blueandgoldstriped necktie lucas this is miz hanson owner of the house lucas said we need an interview with her and with the lady who found miz maisons body i can take miz hansons statement now sloan said he held up a tape recorder and looked down at hanson if we can find some place quiet and comfortable she flipped a hand to say whatever and turned back to lucas before you go let me get something straight youre not telling me that i cant speak to the media youre just saying that you should edit what you say carefully im perfectly happy to see you on tv i expect to see you on tv theres almost no way you could avoid it but there are aspects of the investigation that we really dont want made public like this undercover man who sloan asked looking at lucas del was here last night lucas said ah chasing dope hanson looked from sloan to lucas and back to sloan and shook her head there was no dope swanson and lucas quickly briefed sloan on what they knew while they were talking hanson stood up and said ill be back in a sec i gotta pee meet you in the kitchen sloan said whos got the list of the people at the party lucas asked swanson swanson took a notebook out of his pocket ive got most of it you got anyone on there named amnon or jael swanson said yeah somewhere i remember the names theyre brother and sister he flipped through his notebook found the names amnon plain and a jael corbeau why theres a rumor that aliee jilted amnon and went off with jael and this amnon guy was pretty pissed about it so lets get them downtown he looked at sloan why dont you fix it call me when you get them i want to sit in okay those are both bible names swanson said amnon and jael yeah whatd they do in the bible fuck if i know swanson said i just remember them from sunday school lets get them downtown we can ask them about it lucas said lucas looked in on rowena cooper the woman whod found aliees body cooper was a thin morose woman with dark hair and redrimmed eyes she was sitting with a chubby babysitter cop named dorothy shaw i just wanted to say hello cooper said the last time aliee came to town we went to a movie together i just wanted to see how she was doing you didnt have a chance to talk to her earlier lucas asked no no i didnt get here until midnight shed already gone back to take her nap by then she really knew nothing else shed hung around the party for better than two hours mostly because she wanted to talk to aliee if only for a moment we shared some concerns about current fashion and where its going she seemed genuinely upset about the murder without hansons undertone of excitement lucas tried to reassure her without much luck and left her with shaw dels on the porch swanson said when lucas wandered back into the living room del had taken the time to dress up he was wearing clean jeans sneakers without holes and a grey sweatshirt with the sleeves pulled up over the elbows he smelled vaguely of muskscented deodorant and his long hair was still damp were gonna have to talk to internal affairs youre gonna have to meet with them lucas said just to keep the record straight del nodded no problem i picked up on this party yesterday afternoon and told lane where i was going so im covered good lane was the other man in lucass twoman strategic studies and planning group del said but i never told you why i was calling you why i was looking for you did anybody tell you about trick anybody call you from downtown what trick trick bentoin he was at the party last night he just got back from panama del said lucas took a long look at him and finally showed a small smile you gotta be bullshitting me im not man del said his eyes round i talked to him he thought it was funnier than hell he hardly ever laughs he goddamn near fell down in the hallway ah fuck then lucas started to laugh and a minute later del joined in a uniformed cop with a solemn murderscene face poked his head around the corner saw who it was and pulled back thats gonna be a little hard to explain lucas said finally narcotics and homicide had worked together with the county attorneys investigators for more than four months to build a murder case against rashid albalah albalah had killed trick bentoin and had thrown his body in a bog at the carlos avery wildlife area the traditional murderedbodydisposal area for the twin cities the state claimed the case had been a jigsaw puzzle of evidence weed seeds in the back seat of the cadillac identified by a university of minnesota botanist and unique to the bog traces of blood in the trunk of the car confirmed as the same blood type as bentoins a history of death threats by albalah against bentoin a lack of any alibi albalah had been in prison for a little more than a month looking at a life sentence for firstdegree murder what about the blood in the car lucas asked trick didnt know about any blood del said he said he had a deal going in panama this rich guy who thought he could play gin rummy so he took off he never heard anything about the trial wasnt that big a deal in panama lucas scratched his head well shit ill call the county attorney he aint gonna be happy he got a lot of good ink out of that trial you know whats worse that asshole albalah is gonna be back on the street whatd trick think about that he said leave him in there you know hes killed somebody got that right lucas said down the street tv lights came up and lucas peeked silly hanson was being interviewed posed in her black dress against her expansive lawn after a second the lights went down again and a couple of different cameramen began scrambling around with portable lights theyd have a roadside studio set up in a moment goddamnit lucas said gonna be a circus del said i know it hanson told me she didnt know about any drugs whatd you expect del said but the only guy who wasnt putting something up his nose or into his arm was too drunk to do it you know any of the people at the party only by sight none of them knew me of course swanson stuck his head out on the porch looking for lucas rose marie called he said you got a meeting at sixthirty her office okay lucas turned back to del you gotta talk to internal affairs right away he said when you get clear talk to the dope guys and nail down every goddamn dealer who might have been selling to maison or her friends find out where she got the shit she put in her arm last night did she buy it here or did she bring it with her del nodded okay the real problem for us is if the media finds out you were at the party theyre gonna want to break you out he said you get your face on the nightly news youll have to find a new job giving out tickets for illegal lane changes no no no i aint going on tv del said i gotta stay out of this ill do what i can but if the word leaks we might need a major fuckin plane crash and you know how the goddamn department leaks plane crash wouldnt do it del said gloomily looking at the lights down the street not with aliee maison dead beautiful rich famous and strangled its a cnn wet dream theyre gonna run down everybody who had anything to do with her once my cat gets outa the bag shit we got to find this guy he nodded toward the house meaning the killer we got to find him quick chapter four rose marie roux had lost thirty pounds on a new allprotein diet and now was thinking about a face lift just a couple of snips to pull me up around the sides she told lucas rose marie was the chief of police she put her fingertips on her face just below her cheekbones and pushed the skin back until it began pulling on her lips the mayor stepped into her office looked at her and said what she let go of the skin and her face slid back to its usual shape face lift lucas said he yawned he liked late nights but not early mornings i been thinking about getting some hair the mayor said he was balding but still had the remnants of a hairline think anyone would notice they look like little bushes planted into the side of a grassy hill the hair plugs do rose marie said you dont ever want anybody on a staircase above you looking down ah thats the oldstyle plugs the mayor said im thinking about microimplants theyre supposed to be really natural they chatted about plastic surgery and microimplants for a few minutes aging politicians doing what they did best schmoozing until lucas yawned again and the mayor stopped the chitchat in the middle of a sentence and asked how dead is she pretty dead lucas said sitting up strangled maybe raped did rose marie tell you about the second woman the mayors head went back and he gave lucas a startleddeer look as much as a short barrelchested balding former personalinjury attorney can have a startleddeer look a second woman he turned to rose marie who shrugged not my fault a second body turned up stuffed in a closet i just found out another model swiveling to lucas no lucas said he gave the mayor a short rundown on the double murder your friend sallance hanson says if we give her any trouble shes gonna call you fuck her the mayor said chainwhip her if you want really rose maries eyebrows went up she gave me two hundred bucks the mayor said for that much she gets a signed photograph i sure as shit dont run interference on a murder he looked back at lucas do we have any leads probably but not that i know of lucas said were still processing the scene maison had been putting some dope in her arm heroin probably the other woman was red around the nose like shed seen a lot of coke chamber of commerce is gonna love that coke and heroin the mayor said what do we tell the movie people the movie people were television reporters we tell them its probably a doperelated murder lucas said the mayor frowned doperelated sounds bad everything sounds bad lucas said but saying that its dope makes it simple to understand and thats what we need simple boring understandable nothing exotic no orgies no weird sex no big money or jealous lovers no scandal just a bad guy somewhere and the movie peoplell believe heroin theres so much heroin in the fashion business that it was a look not very long ago all the models had this faggedout doper look it wont surprise anybody we dont want it to drag out we dont want it to become some culture thing for the movie intellectuals to get onto thats what im saying lucas said we dont want anything mysterious or exotic a doperelated killing fits tell him about the window rose marie said window a bedroom down from the murder room the room where maisons body was if that was the murder room and it probably was had an unlocked window somebody could have gone out that way or more to the point might have come in a cat burglar with all the people in there there mustve been lights lights seem to pull cat burglars in lucas said they get a buzz from going into a house where people are cause theyre nuts generally you get a cat burglar you get a guy whos gonna start raping the victims or killing them theyre thrill freaks ah man the mayor shook his head its better to stay with the dope story lucas said if a dealer killed her or she was killed because of dope everybody understands its a onetime thing and shes partially at fault if she hadnt been using dope shed still be alive but if its a cat burglar then weve got a serial killer on the loose and the worse kind of serial killer the kind wholl come creeping into your bedroom and strangle you even with other people in the house like one of those horror movies halloween or the one with the guy with the fingers that are knives rose marie said no no no we dont want that the mayor said waving off the idea thats what we thought rose marie said wryly so its dope the mayor said whos running the show frank lester said rose marie lucas and his group will fit in sideways like we did before everybodys comfortable with that good its strategic planning strategic studies and planning lucas said and i need a woman in the group marcy sherrill wants to come over from homicide rose marie shook her head then i got to give homicide somebody else everything is too tight were paying for ourselves about twenty times over lucas said patiently and i need a woman if im going to operate theres politics murder is down fourteen percent and a lot of its because of my guys three guys including me spotting the assholes lucas said thats politics the mayor held up his hands to stop the argument to rose marie he said half the people in homicide are going to be working on this anyway so why dont you give him marcy for the duration of the maison case when thats done well figure something out rose marie sighed and said all right but i want some more money the mayor rolled his eyes then said yeah who doesnt then youll do the media rose marie nodded but youll have to be there too the first time this is gonna be large mediawise who do you thinkll come in everybody she said four locals and a freelancer for cnn are already outside the house all the other networks are on the way and most of the pictureandgossip magazines people the star then were gonna need something more than just saying its a doperelated killing he looked at lucas do we have somebody we can throw to them some doper asshole they can chase for a couple of days i can ask lucas said do that the more theyve got to occupy them the less time theyre gonna spend asking why nothings been done yet the mayor touched his forehead wish id gotten the new hair though you know like last year rose marie stretched the skin back from her nose never too late she said the meeting lasted fifteen minutes as lucas was leaving rose marie said hey turn on your cell phone okay for the duration lucas shrugged noncommittally on the way back to his office he poked dels number on his phone speeddial del was in the middle of the internal affairs interview and when lucas passed on the mayors request he said ill see what we got as soon as i get out of here hows it going fine theyre a lovely bunch of people lucas punched off dropped the phone back in his coat pocket del could take care of himself at his office he yawned peeled off his jacket and locked himself in leaving the lights off he pulled open a desk drawer dropped into his chair and put his feet on the drawer not quite seven oclock hed gone to bed a little after two and normally wouldnt have gotten up until ten years before before hed inadvertently gotten rich hed invented board games as a way of supplementing his police salary the games were created in allnight sessions that now in memory seemed to merge with his time of running the streets the games eventually became computerbased with lucas writing the story and a hired programmer from the university of minnesota writing the computer code that work led to davenport simulations a small software company that specialized in computerbased simulations of lawenforcement crises intended to train police communications personnel in fastmoving crisis management by the time the companys management bought him out davenport simulations were running on most of the nations equipment the simulations hadnt much interested him theyd simply been an obvious and logical way to make money more of it than hed ever expected to make and while games still interested him hed lost his place in the gaming world the new threedimensional computerbased action strategy games were far beyond anything hed been able to do as recently as five years before when hed got rich when hed got political hed stepped off the streets but in the past six months his life had begun to shift again he was wandering the cities at night looking into places he hadnt seen for years taverns a couple of bowling alleys barbershops a candy store that fronted for a sports book strip joints now masquerading as gentlemen clubs putting together rusty connections and he was talking to old gaming friends he began to consider a new kind of game a game set in the real w rid with real victories to win and a real treasure at the end maybe using palm computers and cell phones hed been staying up late again working on it he was still in the penciltwiddling stage but now had a block of scratchy flow charts pinned to his drafting table one idea a night thats all he wanted something he could use but an idea a night was a lot of ideas he leaned back in the chair yawned closed his eyes in his minds eye he saw maison on the floor her foot sticking out from behind the bed and the woman crumpled on the floor below the closet maison and her friends were dopers and dopers got killed it happened forty or fifty times a year in minneapolis thousands of times a year across the country as far as he was concerned dopers were crap and if they died well thats what dopers did that aliee was famous cut no ice with lucas her fame was entirely ephemeral not the result of hard work or intellectual or moral superiority but simply a byproduct of her appearance he felt no impulse to revenge he did feel the first tingles of the hunt that was something else altogether that had nothing to do with aliee but was purely between his guys and the other guys then he saw in his minds eye the image of catrin as a young woman man the last time he saw her eyes closed the corners of lucass mouth turned up a small smile and not a particularly attractive one feeling a little wasted feeling some pressure from the politicals feeling a killer out there somewhere maybe running maybe not and a woman on the mind somebody to wonder about this was how life was supposed to be propped up in a chair wishing you still smoked worried about twentyfour things at the same time not that laidback going nowhere slowly feeling that prosperous richguy handshaking shit like this he was sleeping like a baby when the phone rang chapter five dark bad taste lucas pushed himself up in the chair the phone still ringing confused for a moment he realized he was in his office that hed dozed off he sighed and fumbled for the phone yeah sloan i got this amnon kid coming down here and his sister uh jail however you pronounce it yael whatever yeah jael lucas rubbed his eyes held onto the phone and stumbled to the light switch and then looked at his watch sevenfifteen when are they due in amnons in st paul he said he was in the middle of something but he could leave there in ten minutes or so he ought to be here in a half an hour the sister said shed be here about nine she sounded pretty freaked out i could hear somebody crying in the background anyway you said you might want to sit in yeah i would are they bringing lawyers i dont know i do know that they moved maison to the mes and he was coming in to take a look im going over wait for me ill walk along the me was a middlesized man with long graying hair tied in a neat pony tail goldrimmed glasses and a distracted air they talked in his office a routine government cubicle with no bodies in sight ive taken a preliminary look is all ive done well get right on the full autopsy ill do it myself well start getting some chemistry back by late afternoon but i can tell you three things he said your guys told me that she was strangled and i can confirm that thats almost certainly the case this wasnt accidental sexual asphyxiation or anything like that her hyoid bones broken and that takes direct pressure probably with the thumbs from a pair of strong hands a man then sloan said lucas frowned why wouldnt it be there are some rumors that she swung the other way sloan said really that she swung both ways but recently mostly with women the me shook his head i cant tell you that it was a man for sure just that it was somebody with strong hands the second thing is this the crime scene people say that her condition suggested sexual activity before her death and i can tell you that she did engage in sexual activity not long before her death but at least some time before an hour maybe as many as two hours there are two or three small scratches and some light bruising next to her vulva fingernails i think just enough to draw a little blood but the bruises had time to develop before she was killed and it appears ill tell you for sure after the autopsy that while there is light bruising suggestive of rough sexual play she was not fully penetrated not by a penis anyway it appears that the sexual play was primarily manual and oral theres no semen lucas looked at sloan who asked is that two things or three things two things the me said whats the third thing lucas said there are no defensive wounds no other bruises no indications of a struggle no sign that the killer had to fight to hold his grip she didnt scratch him her fingernails are clean i couldnt even find any signs that she thrashed around she just let herself go for whoever did it she was an easy kill dope sloan said she might not even have known she was dying oh yeah thats a fourth thing the me said that is a needle stick on her arm and there are more between her toes she was taking a lot of sticks an addict tell you later none of this is final ill have some definitive stuff this afternoon lucas stopped at the chiefs office gave her a quick capsule of what the me had said she made a few notes so it really could be drugrelated yeah maybe even probably we got half an hour before the press conference she said ive promised everybody that youll drag the killer in and hurl him to the floor in front of the microphones or her lucas said yeah maybe the chief turned to her window squinted out at the empty sidewalk then shook her head nope its a man a woman didnt kill aliee maison youre sure yup and seriously lucas mmmm wed look really good if we caught this guy quick the chiefs secretary stuck her head in lucas sloan says a mr plain is here gotta go lucas said good luck with the movie people sloan was waiting in the back of the homicide office talking with a tall darkhaired man with black eyes who might have been called slender except that he had a squareshouldered heft that made him too tough for the word he could have played a dissolute biker in a rocknroll movie he was wearing a black leather jacket black slacks and a plain black tshirt another man fleshy brownhaired freckled wearing a star wars crew baseball hat and a single silver earring sat sideways in a hardback chair a few feet away sloan saw lucas coming and said chief davenport this is amnon plain he was at the party last night and agreed to come to talk with us the darkhaired man nodded at lucas and the brownhaired man said get a lawyer dude plain asked lucas do i need one a lawyer lucas shrugged i dont know did you kill aliee no nothing more no explanation of why he wouldnt have or couldnt have or a protest at the question lucas said if youve got a simple and convincing story then there shouldnt be a problem if there are ambiguities to your statement then maybe you ought to get a lawyer plain looked at the brownhaired man who said do what the dude says get a lawyer plain looked back at lucas then at sloan then back to lucas and said fuck a lawyer but i want to make my own tape of the statement i brought a recorder no problem lucas said plain asked if the brownhaired man could come along and lucas looked at sloan who shrugged id rather not get a lawyer said the brownhaired man but if he doesnt get involved sloan continued come on along lucas said they took the statement in an interview room with three taperecorders on the table two police recorders backing each other up and plains handsized sony sloan had gone into goodcop mode and said pleasantly if youll just tell us where you were and what you did and who you saw last night plain dipped into a jacket pocket and took out an orangecovered notebook and flipped it open i got to the party a little after ten oclock as close as i can put it about ten minutes after ten before that starting at about eight oclock id been at the new french cafe with friends the friends were he listed the friends in the next five minutes he gave a nearly minutebyminute account of his evening with each friend he encountered along the way what about sandy lansing plain shook his head i dont know if i saw a picture of her maybe id recognize her but i dont recognize the name the party was open to a particular crowd what crowd the artmoney hip crowd plain said any dope around all over the goddamn place you use drugs sloan asked it mildly enough but there was a snake in the question which everyone could see plain did not hesitate no i dont use any chqjnicals i did for two years when i was a teenager i used cocaine heroin methamphetamine ecstasy lsd peyote marijuana alcohol nicotine and a couple of other things hypnotics quaaludes i found out that each and every one of them made me stupider than i already was and i decided i couldnt afford that so eleven years ago i stopped aspirin lucas asked a little sarcasm i still use aspirin and ibuprofen im not a moron his tone of voice showed no reaction to the sarcasm and somehow left lucas feeling that the sarcasm had been juvenile plain was ahead on points so what happened next sloan asked at about midnight plain said he left the party at sallance hansons and went back to his studio in st pauls lowertown with a friend sandy smith where they met an employee james graf to look at scanned negatives from that mornings photo shoot after half an hour of looking at the negs smith left for his home while plain and graf continued to work with the negatives what were the pictures of lucas asked plain tilted his head you dont know no some investigation he said to the brownhaired man then i spent all yesterday morning and the early part of the afternoon doing a fashion shoot with aliee did you have a personal relationship with aliee sloan asked what do you mean personal you mean was i fucking her or anything else lucas said no i wasnt fucking her i wasnt interested in her she was a dummy she was like a toy that you plugged your dick into or if you were a woman that you stuck your tongue into she was interested in feeling good and that was about it he said your sister was involved with her lucas asked yfeah they were gobbling each other or whatever women do sticking heroin in their arms putting coke up their noses sloan said hmph and lucas asked i was talking to some woman who was at the party and she said you were so jealous of the relationship between aliee and your sister that you might kill jael if you had the chance which suggests that aliee was more to you than just another model plain tipped his head regarding lucas with some curiosity and said youre lying nobody told you that but thats interesting you apparently got hold of something somewhere and you dont know quite what it is get a lawyer his friend said from the corner lucas grinned involuntarily hed been caught and that made him curious tell me why you think im lying because you got it just backwards plain said what i wasnt jealous because my sister took aliee away from me im a little jealous i admit it because aliee took jael away from me in the immediate silence the brownhaired friend said oh shit and lucas and sloan looked at each other trying to figure out what plain had just said plain picking on sloan because he was the straighterlooking of the two cops leaned toward him and said yup i was fucking my sister now that was an interview and a half sloan said when theyd finished and plain and his friend had gone they had an hour of tape lucas rubbed his forehead i was feeling almost sympathetic there toward the end two arty parents rich dip shits get divorced each one takes a kid the kids dont see or speak to each other for fifteen years then they run into each other virtual strangers goodlooking one is a model and the other one is working in photography both running with the same crowd if they hadnt been brother and sister youd expect them to fall in bed yeah but lucas nodded then theres the other thing whats that he says his sister quit modelling and now is a professional potter big in the art world ive met a couple of potters i wouldnt doubt it sloan said he had an exaggerated idea of lucass love life ill tell you one thing about potters lucas continued they pick up this clay and they throw it around and they beat it and twist it and turn it a few years of that and theyve got arms and hands like wrestlers aliee was strangled sloan said be interesting to talk to the sister aliees boyfriend a guy who insisted his only name was jax came through homicides front door a few steps before jael corbeau came in with her lawyer lucas had to decide which interview to watch and he went with corbeau sloan took the statement with lucas and swanson sitting in lucas trying not to stare but jael corbeau was somebody to stare at not immediately not a flash thing but after a minute or so he found it hard to stop looking at her she had the same angular face as her brother but was blonde and she had tracks on her face scars they did something unnatural made it hard to breathe after the preliminaries sloan read her the miranda warning and the lawyer said that he might ask his client not to reply to certain questions and that was not to be taken as an indication of guilt sloan said tell us about your relationship with aliee maison jael looked at her lawyer who nodded and she said well i didnt kill her or the other woman im happy to hear that sloan said smiling at her do you have any idea who might have no really ive been going over and over it in my head and i cant figure out who would her eyes drifted away from sloan and stopped at lucas nobody disliked her enough i mean i dont know about the other woman but aliee some people probably disliked her but not enough to hurt her how about in new york anybody there sloan asked no she was talking to lucas now of the top ten or fifteen models that you hear about you know the supermodels shes like number seven or eight she was very close to the top maybe she would have become number one she had the look for it but there are other people who really are bigger who would be more likely to attract a crazy person if thats what youre thinking we dont know quite what to think yet sloan said so you dont jael leaned forward interrupting but you know she had a big following on the internet a lot of the you know engineertype people were interested in her they put up internet pages or whatever you call them web sites with her pictures some of them grafted porno pictures on her so youd see a woman fucking somebody and the face would be aliees there are quite a few of those hmm interesting sloan said he looked at lucas then back at jael and asked did she ever do any porn no of course not aside from everything else she couldnt afford to if shed done any porn the big couturiers would have dropped her like a hot rock okay how about lansing was she a friend of yours sloan asked no i knew her she came to parties but she really wasnt part of the i dont know what youd call it the art scene that sounds pretentious and stupid at the same time so she wasnt a friend but you sort of knew her lucas said yes she was some kind of hotel executive sloan nodded okay let me ask you about your personal relationship with ms maison you were what he let the question hang there unfinished corbeau hesitated for a moment then said we had both a friendship and a sexual relationship i originally met her in new york we were both working as models this was before she became as famous as she is was we were both from minnesota and that brought us together and we became friends the relationship continued even after you moved back here i understand you live here now yes although i go to new york every few weeks to talk with dealers i represent both myself and several other potters to the new york galleries id usually stay at aliees apartment not always not always we both continued to have other relationships with men as well as women she was looking at lucas again neither one of us thought of ourselves as primarily lesbian we were just very good friends and our friendship had a physical component to it if she had a man over then i would stay someplace else usually up on central park south so i could walk to the galleries on th street and over on madison avenue did you have a sexual encounter with ms maison last night at the party sloan asked another quick glance at the lawyer yes you were alone with her no there were three of us the other woman is catherine kinsley who i believe is up north at her cabin with her husband i havent been able to reach her she flushed for the first time this is not heavyduty masculinestyle sexuality this is more like cuddling kissing talking with each other but there was a physical component yes what happened afterwards how was she when you left sleepy we were all sleepy but shed gotten up very early for her photo shoot and had to get up the next day and silly silly hanson said she could sleep there and so we left her she was okay and neither you nor miz kinsley saw her again no well i dont know if catherine saw her because like i said i havent been able to reach her this morning i couldnt find her number and i dont know exactly where the cabin is anyway i dont think she saw her we walked out to our cars together said goodbye and i went home your police people woke me up ms maison injected heroin around the time of your encounter were you present for that no quick and definite lucas thought shed known the question was coming sloan continued you didnt know that she was using heroin a slight hesitation another glance at the attorney and i thought she might be tripping when we met in the bedroom she was languid she was the way you get when youre using but i wasnt there when she injected and i dont think she had much because she didnt fall asleep or anything not while we were there it was more like a a party favor a party favor lucas said yeah thats what people call them some people call them short pops you know if you want the effect but dont want to get addicted you get addicted anyway sloan said corbeau flipped her head you know thats not true thats just a political position sloan looked at lucas who raised his eyebrows and sloan said im not here to argue with you but just for the record ms corbeau short pops will addict you as fast as anything believe me or dont believe me but thats the way it is she shook her head and sloan said i dont want to embarrass you but ive got to ask this question the medical examiner tells us that ms maison has small light scratches around her vulva and light bruising as if shed been involved in a fairly active sexual encounter involving manual stimulation and perhaps oral stimulation would that have characterized your encounter she flushed again looked at them quickly one at a time taking them in lucas still feeling the effect she had on his breathing squirmed he felt like a pervert she didnt help she asked do you guys get off on this sort of thing sloan his face a monks stolid mask shook his head sitting in a room like this full of metal tables and tile floors this is not very sexual ms corbeau we need to know because we need to know if she had another sexual contact after yours or if yours was most likely the cause of the scratching and bruising ms maison was strangled which frequently is associated with sexual activity okay she said yes its possible that she was scratched especially by catherine catherine can be a little rough and she had long nails i keep mine very short because of my job youre a potter yes and you had nothing to do with the death of aliee maison no i did not she bit her lip as the words came out and her chin trembled to lucas she seemed shaken do you think your brother might have lucas interjected she looked at him a frown flickering across her face and then said no if amnon was going to go after somebody itd be me why you we have a personal problem he told us about your relationship lucas said you think that could turn to violence the breakup she turned away looking at the floor twisting her fingers together amnon has violence in him he wouldnt have killed aliee because he had no regard for her he didnt care about her youd have to have some feeling for a person before you killed her wouldnt you no lucas said not if youre psychologically disturbed people who are disturbed may kill to change the way they feel about something the person killed may be a complete stranger if the killing somehow medicates the disturbed person god thats awful yes your brother no hes not disturbed that way i know him well enough to say that how did you get your names swanson asked our parents were hippies they went from one thing to another and they eventually tried out judaism amnon and i were born during that period theyre bible names im a catholic lucas said we werent big on bibles when i was a kid do the names mean something jael was maybe a sorceress deborah fought sisera the canaanite and defeated him and sisera fled the battlefield and hid in jaels tent when he was asleep she killed him by driving a tent peg through his head ouch lucas said a tiny flicker of a smile on her sad face how about amnon amnon was one of solomons sons corbeau said what he was wise no no she said he slept with his sister she scanned the four men lucas sloan swanson and her own attorney showed a flicker of a sad smile again and said were my parents prophets or what when they were done they milled in the hallway outside the interview room and lucas asked jael whyd you quit modeling you think i shouldnt have i think you could have continued he said she made him feel like a provincial clown and he kind of liked it its boring she said its like making movies except they dont pay you enough movies are boring movies are fuckin nightmares she said she laughed and grasped his arm just for a second she was the kind of women who liked to touch people lucas thought shooting a movie is like watching grass grow when jael and her lawyer left lucas and sloan walked back to homicide frank lester was talking to rose marie and waved lucas over howd you guys do he asked lucas shrugged theres a lot of motive floating around but none that points at aliee or lansing who then rose marie asked everybody lucas said weve got incest jealousy drugs love triangles you name it we got it but nothing that points at anyone thats what i was telling rose marie lester said weve got so many suspects that its turning into a technical problem weve got fiftyfour people for the party now and therell be more how in the hell do you really interview more than fifty people and do a good job of it who do you push and how hard the thing is if the killer was at the party and hes our fortyfifth interview theres no feel to it anymore youre asking everybody to point at somebody else lucas asked yeah but theyre all lying through their teeth nobody knew that everybody was using drugs anyway weve only been able to probably eliminate a halfdozen people who left the party when aliee was still circulating with that open window we cant eliminate anyone who left after aliee went back to the bedroom somebody might have unlocked the window for the purpose of leaving and coming back later if the window was used at all sloan said yeah if how about the husband of the woman who was with aliee and corbeau on the bed this catherine kinsley did he know about the relationship lucas asked theyre not in yet rose marie said lester said i did just sit in on an interview with aliees boyfriend i saw him lucas said noxious little penis lester said his real name used to be jim shue he didnt think he looked like a shoe so he tried to change it to jx j for james x for nothing the court told him he had to have a vowel so he winds up with jax anyway he knew all about the relationship with corbeau he says it didnt bother him he called it aliees alternate modality he said that they were both multisexual he said pretty sbon everybody will be too late for me rose marie said yeah im barely unisexual lester said anyway hes a dipshit he said he had nothing to do with her death but were putting him on the short list what about the media thing rose marie asked lucas the human sacrifice ill ask del lucas said hes setting it up chapter six del was waiting outside lucass office leaning patiently against the wall when he saw lucas coming he walked down the hall to meet him and said im clear with ia what about finding somebody we can throw to the media i cant find a connection these arent street people but the dope guys are set up to raid george shaws operation shaw is street hes not aliees dealer lucas said i know but its what we got del said we got confirmation last night that hes got a lot of cocaine on hand and maybe some heroin so theyre gonna hit him and i thought we could ride along we dont say anything but we get your picture taken where a place down on thirtyfifth shaw has been sleeping there usually until three oclock or so hes there now were gonna hit him a little after noon if we work it right the tv people are gonna jump to a conclusion we can deny our ass off and they wont believe us for a minute thats not exactly what we wanted no but thats as good as were gonna get it del said lucas thought about it for a second the movie people werent stupid if they thought they were being manipulated thered be trouble but if they werent thrown some kind of meat theyd be running around like a pack of wolves and pretty soon the politicians would start to panic and then the attorney general you never wanted to stand between the attorney general and a tv camera would get into it on some theme like police negligence in a fairly short time a worldclass pissing match would be going on and all right if thats what we got ive already tipped tvs to be ready to roll between noon and one oclock del said rose marie and the mayor already said at the press conference that youd be monitoring the investigation so if youre monitoring the raid and if they want to put twoand two together thats their problem but the raid isnt a putup job is it i mean its legit its fine shaw got a ton of shit a week ago but hes been moving wholesaling it to all the little assholes couldnt find him now hes holed up at his sisterinlaws and hes still got some left lucas nodded because if it was a putup job and somebody gets hurt the word would get out and wed all be in shit city del nodded were okay the drug guys were talking about it last night before aliee as soon as they spotted shaw walking home the twelveman emergency response team met at a southside precinct house and was briefed by a guy named lapstrake from intelligence lapstrake was a bland twentysomething guy with a home haircut who wore blue sears work pants and a blue shirt that said cairns glass on the back he used a flip pad to illustrate the approaches to george shaws house lucas and del sat on folding chairs in the back of the room listening in were gonna have to move fast lapstrake said pointing with a laser georges got relatives all over the neighborhood and every one of thems got him on speeddial four guys go in the back coming in from thirtyfourth youll split up and go around this house he put a red laserdot on the house behind shaws and go right over the fence and cover the back door and side windows its a hurricane fence no problem a dog somebody asked used to be but it died the intelligence cop said aw shit somebody said they got pit bulls down there hes gone really lapstrake said grinning i promise he put another red dot on the front of the house we got group two coming in from the front blocking watching down the sides group three hits the front door we think george sleeps in what used to be the dining room when you go in youll be in the living room therell be a hall straight ahead and an arch over to the right the dining room is behind the arch and thats where george should be but theres also a connection between the dining room and the kitchen lapstrake sketched it quickly and made sure the entry group had it from the time we hit the sidewalk we need to be on top of him in one minute no more theres a possibility that hell be upstairs theres no bathroom upstairs and no way out and we dont think its likely hell be up there the stairs come down into the front room youll see them on your left when you go through the door who else is in the house somebody asked and whatre we looking for specifically we think hes probably got anything from a quarter kilo to a kilo of cocaine on him and some amount of heroin but we dont know how much he usually carries it in plastic squeeze bottles like the kind you get at camping stores rei like that we heard last week that hed gotten a delivery the week before and was putting it on the street but we couldnt find him so who knows what hes got left maybe hes got a ton maybe hes sold it all the coke is definite one of our guys saw it last night lapstrake said as for whoelse in the house the house is owned by his sisterinlaw mary lou carter the thing is you gotta watch mary lou get her on the floor she tends to go off she got a gun somebody else asked not her style but theres probably a few in the house she basically has a really explosive temper and shes big and strong if she comes after you dont mess around take her down dick hardesty ran into her a couple of years ago and she almost beat his brains out what about shaw is he gonna fight hes a tough guy yeah but hes a pro and hes getting older and slower i dont think hell fight lapstrake said he looked around and asked any more questions no then chief davenport wants to say a word he and del are gonna ride along lucas stood up and said number one nobody get hurt number two theres gonna be some media around the homicide guys think shaws heroin may have been getting to aliee maison and youve all heard about that situation homicide thinks maybe her killing was drugrelated so take it easy but we want to look sharp lucas looked around got a few nods lapstrake picked up a jacket and said so lets go out the door del wandered down the sidewalk pulled out a cell phone punched in a number said a few words and punched off were set he said on the way to the target house lagging a bit behind the entry team del asked do you remember george shaw veah i didnt know him real well its just that lapstrake said he was getting older and slower and probably wouldnt fight yeah shaws about our age fuck lapstrake lucas said they turned the corner onto thirtyfifth just in time to see the armored ert take down the front door the entry team flowed inside as lucas eased the car to the curb at the same time doors started opening down the street and a few kids wandered toward them two minutes later lapstrake appeared at the front door looked up and down the street spotted them and waved them in as lucas and del walked toward the house a tv van turned the corner must of been close del muttered lemme get outa sight he hurried on ahead up the steps and into the house as lucas idled along the sidewalk lapstrake met him at the lot line got him any coke yup quite a bit lapstrake said and some heroin good we another cop appeared at the door you guys gotta come look at this what come on whatever it was was good lucas thought the cop was too cheerful for it to be anything else got some stuff upstairs chief one of the armored team members said as lucas ducked inside the house the house was old with ceilings that felt an inch too low floors that creaked underfoot and rooms that seemed a foot short in both lateral dimensions the wallpaper on the walls was loose with warps and water damage near the floor a couple of rag rugs in oncebright now dirtmuted colors made ovals in front of a bigscreen television the place smelled of tacos hamburger and onions most of the cops were crowded into the dining room lucas stepped that way and saw a large black man in olivegreen underwear a dazed expression on his face handcuffed on an open studio bed del was squatting next to him talking wheres mary lou lucas asked she went out a few minutes ago about the time we were starting over here lapstrake said she got on a downtown bus and we let her go upstairs said the armored cop a little impatient upstairs in the single bedroom what looked like a full cord of marijuana bricks were stacked on a plastic sheet in the middle of the room all right said lapstrake now were talking lucas picked up one of the bricks sniffed it dropped it a small upstairs window was open two thin curtains fluttering in a breath of breeze outside through the screen he could see a little boy playing in a tractortire sandbox ten yards away a little girl a few years older than the boy stood looking diagonally across the yard at what must have been the cops in the street her arms and legs were rigid with attention and possibly fear or anger he was struck by the similarity of the view toward the window and a camera shot in a world war ii movie hed seen on television the week before but then the men in black combat gear with the helmets and guns rousting people from their houses had been nazis just a movie he turned back to lapstrake im gonna tell the tv people to hang around when you get this documented let them in let them get some shots of you guys carrying the stuff out lucas said and flash the cocaine too not me lapstrake said so get a front guy get jones down here from dope hes good at this shit lucas said downstairs again del eased over and said im outa here ill get a ride with one of the squads we got maybe a kilo and a half of powder cocaine and a bottle of heroin plus that weed no crack what do you think about shaw george is history del said is there any possibility that any of this shit really could have gotten to aliee hes not really in that highend of the trade del said but who knows ill talk to him again downtown del and lapstrake stayed out of sight while the entry team took george shaw out to a car and put him inside when the cameras started following the headdown figure of shaw now dressed in dark slacks and tennis shoes del went out the back lucas followed the shaw parade as soon as the police car was moving one of the tv reporters shouted his name and he walked toward them the reporters were accompanied by three cameramen who refocused from the car to lucas chief davenport we understand this raid was a direct reaction to the murder of aliee maison this morning is that right lucas shook his head i cant comment on an ongoing investigation i can tell you that weve found a substantial quantity of illegal drugs what drugs both cocaine and heroin and a very large amount of marijuana lucas said looking into the cameras the marijuana looks like a stack of firewood we understand that cocaine and heroin may have been involved in maisons death i have heard that but my source probably wasnt any better than yours lucas said mildly werent you at the death scene early this morning yes i was reluctantly and now youre here investigating the exact same drugs that were found look lucas said interrupting i dont want to talk about the maison investigation chief roux is taking direct charge of that investigation and all comment has to come through her but we understand that you are coordinating i really cant comment sorry excuse me lucas pushed through the group walking down toward the cars the interviewonthescene was over and the cameras went down but the reporters tagged along behind theres gotta be more than that lucas one of the reporters said she was an intense young woman with short dark hair and small pretty features i wish i could tell you more but i cant lucas said i just cant but ill tell you what if you hang around here ill talk to jim jones lt jones from narcotics and ill get you inside the house marijuana might not be that big a deal but it is when youve got a mountain of it and theres a mountain of it in there and ill get them to show you the cocaine and heroin aliee was using heroin at least in new york she was another reporter asserted this one was a honeyblonde with a nose so tidy that it could only be explained by surgery listen lucas said dropping his voice this has honesttogod gotta be off the record okay im serious the three reporters glanced at each other and nodded aliee had whats called a short pop of heroin about the time she was murdered i dont know what theyre planning to say downtown but thats the truth if you push them on it theyll confirm it he looked back at shaws house significantly he hoped thats all i can tell you wait a minute wait a minute the blonde said you said short pop is that the phrase yeah short pop thats good that sounds really you know ghetto she said and one more question this cant hurt anyone when you saw aliee this morning was she wearing a green dress a green dress ves a green dress with a narrow dropped neck and this has gotta be off the record he couldnt see how it could hurt sure of course we just want to know she said it was green kind of semitranslucent excellent the cameramen had been drifting over to listen in their cameras pointed away this was offtherecord and they knew the rules the blonde picked out her cameraman and lifted a hand palmup and said the dress was green they highfived and lucas asked what the other reporters looked as puzzled as he was death dress the reporter said we got it on tape yesterday its by gurleon a twentyfivethousandfuckingdollar shroud and we got it on tape with aliee in it are we fuckin good or what chapter seven and became a beautiful filmygreen twentyfivethousanddollar shroud for the mysterious women with the jadegreen eyes back to you henry the first man hadnt gotten any sleep he paced his office watching the tv the blonde reporter was smiling at him filmy green shroud she was proud of that filmy green at the tips of his fingers the man could still feel the soft skin of aliees throat he hadnt had any choice with her shed come along at the precisely wrong time in everybodys life sandy lansing was panicking she was going to run hed had to talk with her to discipline her you did not run when there was business to be done hed reached out intending to push her against the wall somehow the pit of his palm had landed under her chin and when he pushed her head snapped back into a molding around a door hed actually felt her skull crack the vibration through the heel of his hand like feeling a raw egg crack on the edge of a china cup her eyes had gone up and shed slipped down the wall and hed glanced back up the hallway toward the party if the door opened get up he said come on get the fuck up hed taken her arm and pulled but her arm was deathly slack and after a minute hed believed hed looked for a pulse tried to find a heartbeat but could find neither hed been seized by fear christ she was dead he crouched over the body like a jackal over a baked ham looking from her face to the stillclosed door he hadnt meant to kill her but nobody knew the body was next to a door he pulled the door open a closet with a rack of coldweather jackets and coats he lifted her her heels dragging and shoved her into the closet she wouldnt fit she kept slumping and she had to be upright to fit he was holding her by the throat with one hand trying to get the door shut when a voice said from a few inches behind his ear what are you doingt hed almost had a heart attack he turned and saw the green eyes and the closet door finally clicked shut aliee asked again why did you put her in the closet the second man heard about aliees death from his dashboard radio at first he thought hed misheard and then it occurred to him that he was crazy that he wasnt hearing this at all but the radio kept talking talking talking and when he changed stations they were talking talking aliee this aliee that aliee with lesbians aliee nude in a photo shoot aliee dead the second man swerved to the side of the road pulled on the park brake put his head on the steering wheel and wept couldnt stop his shoulders shaking his mouth open breathing in stuttering gasps after a long five minutes he wiped his eyes on his shirt sleeve turned found a clipboard in the back clipped in a piece of notepaper he wrote who did this and drew a line under it and under that he wrote the first name there would he thought be quite a few names before he finished the list chapter eight on the way back to police headquarters lucas took out his cell phone thumbed it on and called rose marie roux on her command line she picked up and lucas said we got the media fixed the raid turned up a ton of grass and a bunch of coke and heroin i think they all bought it good now we need a second act its like managing the media has gotten more important than finding the killer roux said you know the truth about that lucas well either get the killer or we wont no matter what the media does but the media can kill us and i dont have anything else id rather be doing right now for the rest of the day lucas hung around the interrogation rooms listening in one item came up earlyaliee didnt have any dope in her possession or any cooking equipment for the heroin or a syringe or needles somebody else put the dope on her but nobody at the party was admitting to the use of dope and nobody knew anybody else who was using a question they asked everyone involved the scribble on sandy lansings wrist they got the answer to that in the early afternoon a woman named pella swanson told lucas shes going to england in december for three weeks and lansing was going to get her a rate at a hotel she said lansing wrote her name on her wrist to remember to set it up this holds water swanson shrugged does with me i guess pella said a decent hotel in london is gonna cost her two hundred a night but with lansings connection she can get the same room for oneandaquarter thats something like fifteen hundred bucks in savings and this pella doesnt know anything about the dope she said she met aliee for the first time last night and said three words to her but she looks kinda wired i wouldnt be surprised if she carried a little toot in her purse all we have to do is crack one of them lucas said get somebody to rat out her friend lester stopped by we grabbed hansons computer but most of what were getting is bullshit they talked about dope lucas said she said it was just rumors shes bullshitting us of course she is two uniformed cops from st paul brought in a huge man named clark buchanan who improbably told them that he was a model and incidentally a welder model what one of the interrogating cops asked skeptically lunch buckets you know clothes and shit clark said i was the other guy in the aliee shoot she was doing the clothes up front i was making some sparks in the back clark didnt know anything about drugs at the party i had some drinks thats all i saw lotta drinks he shrugged maybe a halfdozen maybe ten vodka martinis goddamn ill tell you something guys rich people make good fuckin vodka martinis he stayed at the party until one oclock then caught a cab and went home he remembered the name of the cab company and that the drivers name was art they asked a few more questions and cut him loose early in the afternoon aliees parents arrived with a group of friends and talked first to the mayor and then the mayor walked them over to rouxs office roux called lucas who went down to her office and stood in the back with lester as the chief explained what was happening with the case both lynn and lil olson were dressed from headtotoe in black lynn in a blackontfcack suit that may have come from manhattan and lil in a black lace dress that dropped over a black silken sheath she also wore a black hat with a net that fell off the front rim over her eyes her eyebrows matched the hat severe dark lines but her hair was a careful layered honeyoverwhite blonde like her daughters her eyes when lucas could see them were rimmed with red aliee got her looks from her father lucas thought the cheekbones the complexion the green eyes lynn olson was a natural blond but his hair was going white in the black suit he looked like a famous artist the friends were dressed in flannel and jeans and corduroy they were purely minnesota she was going to be in the movies aliees mother said her voice cracking we had a project just about set we were interviewing costars that was the big step and now rose marie was good at dealing with parents patient sympathetic she introduced lucas and lester and outlined how the case would be handled lucas felt a strange disjunctive here aliees parents who were probably in their late forties looked new york in their blackonblack elegant against their blond hair and fair complexions the words they used were new york and even their attitude toward aliee was new york all business not only was their daughter dead so was the aliee enterprise but the sound of the language was smalltown minnesota round scandinavian vowels oo instead of oh boot instead of boat and every few sentences a minnesota construction would creep out rose marie was straightforward she mentioned the relationship with jael lil said but that was just a lark girls and the possibility of drugs the olsons eyes drifted away from rose maries and as rose marie was finishing the door opened and a heavyset man stepped in looked around he wore jeans black boots and a heavy tan carhartt jacket with oil stains on one sleeve his hair was cut like a farmers shaggy on top but down to the skin over the ears lynn olson stood up and said tom and lil stopped sniffling her head jerking up the big man scowled at them nodded at the people from burnt river looked at lucas lester and then at rose marie im tom olson he said aliees brother we were just telling your parents what were doing rose marie said do you know what youre doing he asked rose marie we handle this kind of vbure dealing with a nest of rattlesnakes olson said the best thing you could do is beat all of them with a stick they are sinners each and every one they are involved in drugs illicit sex theft and now murder theyre all criminals tom lil said tom please were questioning everyone who was with aliee in the past day rose marie said were very confident tom olson shook his head once and looked away from her at his parents so after twentyfive years of abuse she comes to this dead in minneapolis full of drugs the radio says heroin a short pop the radio says whatever that is some kind of evil they have a special name for huh we didnt hear about that in burnt river lesters eyes flicked at lucas as lynn olson stood up and said tom take it easy huh olson squared off to his father and said im not going to take it easy i can still remember when we called her sharon we need to talk to you lester said to tom olson to question me thats fine but i know almost nothing about what she was doing i had one letter a month still wed like to talk olson ignored him turned to his parents shook a finger at them how many times did i tell you this how many times did i tell you that you were buying death you even dress like the devil in satans clothes look at you you spend more money on one shirt than good people spend on a wardrobe its a sickness and it has eaten into you he was starting to foam shaking not just his finger but his entire body lucas pushed away from the wall and lynn olson got back on his feet and said tom tommy tommy people living in this nightmare people encouraging this nightmare willingly doing the business of the devil hed turned to rose marie who was watching him openmouthed and for a moment he looked like he was going over the desk at her lucas moved quickly from behind the desk saying whoa whoa whoa slow down man slow down olson stopped talking but continued to vibrate then turned away and stepped to the back of the office and leaned on the door after a moment in the silence he turned with tears running down his cheeks can i see her he asked del was working down a line of junkies and dealers trying to find the source of the drugs going through silly hansons apartment the night before lucass other guy a kid named lane was working on aliees genealogy i want all of her family and i want a chart that shows how theyre related he told lane i want all of her exhusbands arent any all of her exfiancees exboyfriends anyone else who might want to do her same with this other chick lansing yeah i want the whole chart listen i think if we sorted through the people who were at the party last night ran them lucas shook his head homicides halfway through the list ill get it tonight or tomorrow if they dont have a case by then or working on the catburglar angle i got some sources down there from when i was on patrol lane go with the genealogies homicide and property are working the catburglar thing we want stuff that homicide wont get around to right away cause if aliee getting killed isnt a random thing if its not a cat burglar then its somebody who knows her well enough to have a motive and its gotta be somebody reasonably close but lucas pointed a finger at him the fuckin genealogies he spent an hour in homicide listening to returning cops talk about what theyd found what looked good not much looked good lester came back from his talk with tom olson he says his parents trained her like a dog thats his word like a show dog used to drag her all over the country for beauty competitions and youth talent contests and modeling gigs but abuse he didnt mean sexual abuse that wasnt part of the deal lester said and he doesnt think his parents could have had anything to do with her death he said they were living through her that they took her life as a kid away from her and that they were still taking did aliee fight it lucas asked lester shook his head he says no he said she never knew anything else huh he seemed a little nuts hes a preacher of some kind lester said he says he actually loves his parents but he just doesnt like them very much then del was on the phone and said hold onto your shorts what happened boo mcdonald called me im over at his place mcdonald was a paraplegic who monitored police scanners for a halfdozen tv and radio stations and sometimes backfed information to the cops hes been cruising the internet searching under aliee theres a story out from here in the cities called muffdivers ball goes homicidal guess what its about muffdivers ball lucas repeated lesters eyebrows went up that doesnt sound good del was still talking yeah this is an online rock n roll rag called spittle and they got some detail its gotta come out of the department how bad well see the rag says its semidocumentary which means they make up a lot of stuff you know to enhance the reality of the moment enhance let me read a part move over boo lucas could hear them clunking around for a moment then del read aliee stretched back toward the brass bars at the head of the bed and grasped them in her hands holding on tight as the waves of pleasure rippled through her lean taut body jaels head bobbed between her thighs her long pink tongue parting aliees glistening labia finding at last that little man in the canoe the center of aliees heat and being ah fuck me iwcas said then he laughed youd sound like a porno flick if you had somebody playing a saxophone behind you probably will be sooner or later a movie not a saxophone i called the kid at spittle and asked where he got this shit he told me he wouldnt talk because of first amendment considerations but he said that he had interviews lined up with channels three and four and eleven an asshole lucas suggested actually i kinda liked him reminded me of myself when i was his age i tried a little threat but he told me he was a minor and i could go fuck myself so whatd you say what could i say i said the bed wasnt brass you little prick how old is he sixteen del said so we go fuck ourselves anyway the lesbian thing is out its out another ring in the circus lucas called rose marie to warn her and when he got off the phone walked down to his office and a silent space kicked back in his chair and stared at the ceiling his ceiling was dirtier than it should be thats all he got the case had a bad feel to it too many suspects and not enough serious possibilities clean murders were the hardest to solve somebodys killed everybody denies everything there were a halfdozen killers walking around the twin cities whod never been touched the cops knew everything about the murders without any proof husbands killing wives mostly whack the old lady on the head throw the pipe in the river go back home and find the body what can you do he was mulling it over when the phone rang again more bad news no catrin lucas ive been thinking about you all morning she said god it was good to see you ive been thinking about the u do you remember lanny morton do you know what happened to him yeah as a matter of fact lucas said getting comfortable he moved to la to get involved in film and got into real estate instead he was pretty rich the last time i saw him he was on his fourth wife fourth what happened to virginia lucas hunched forward in his chair virginia died didnt you know that jeez it was only maybe five years after we graduated she had a heart attack one day on the venice beach she was like twentyeight oh my god do you remember that football game with all the mums everybody had to buy his girlfriend a mum the iowa game yeah virginia was like she was going to live forever they talked for twenty minutes catching up on old times catrin remembered all the names from their few months together and the faces came swimming up from lucass memory along with the sights and the sounds and even the smells of all those old glory days the field houses all over the big ten smelling of popcorn and dirt the ice arenas and the odors of cold and blood wet wool and sweat diesel fumes from the buses cheerleaders god i wish wed had time to talk lucas said what do you do now do you still paint no no i do some photography but the painting i dont know i just stopped my husbands a familypractice guy i helped out at the office when we were first getting started i heard about you marrying a doctor i remembered on the way over here after you told me this morning i think bill washington said something about you going out with an older guy washington god i havent thought about him in years the last time i saw him we were all sitting around on a floor in dinkytown getting high youre a photographer say you dont know a guy named amnon plain do you hes hooked up with the aliee case really did he do it he says not and he probably didnt but he says hes some kind of fashion photographer and i thought jeez hes more than that he does fashion photography got started that way bat he does these most amazing pictures of the prairie hes like avedon he does fashion but hes got this whole other thing avedon you were never an intellectual were you she laughed i was majoring in hockey for christs sakes criminal justice yeah well plains a photographer big time pretty big time im nothing like that i mostly take care of the kids or try to theyre getting to the point where they dont want to hear from me oh my god what i just had a terrible thought she said what one of thems about to go off to the u she could run into a lucas davenport hey how bad could it get but she was laughing i read about you in the newspaper sometimes i cant believe that you know i knew you once youre kinda famous yeah like they say worldfamous in minneapolis pause so let me buy you lunch lucas said a pause on the other end will you tell me all the insidecop stuff about aliee if you wont tell anybody else she laughed again and said when catrin as soon as she was off the phone he wanted to call her again and what was he gonna wear tomorrow something really cool and expensive or something tough coplike hed been a hockey jock when they first got together but shed confessed then that she wasnt much interested in sports or jocks either hed talk about taking somebody out on the ice or hed come back after the match with a little ding on a cheekbone a little rub and shed be perplexed and disturbed and sometimes even a little amused by his pleasure in the violence the adrenalin of catrins call got to him he pushed himself out of the chair took another turn around the office and finally launched himself out into the hallway frank lester was sitting in his office leaning back in his leather chair the door open cops coming and going anything new lucas asked nope rose maries doing another press conference about the lesbo thing jesus dont call them lesbos if you go on tv hey am i an idiot lucas looked at the ceiling as if thinking about it and lester grinned and said were indexing everything were getting from the interviews running down every single person at the party but ill tell you what the guys are starting to think its a cat burglar thatd be tough lucas said if we havent got anything yet itd be damn near impossible unless somebody turns him in whats the evidence gonna be he didnt even get any blood on him because there wasnt any were thinking about putting up a reward you know about george shaw lucas asked lester nodded nothing there probably not but the media seems to have gotten the idea that there is if you decide to organize a reward why dont you wait until after the george shaw angle burns out a reward would be something new keep the goddamn tv off our backs as long as we can all right besides ill tell you what lucas said the answer is in the party there wasnt any cat burglar sez who sez me rose marie told me this morning that a man killed aliee that it wasnt a lesbo thing and by god she was right it wasnt a cat burglar either god just wouldnt like it if it was all just a coincidence a onetime thing and the victim just happened to be aliee maison lester puffed up his cheeks and then exhaled then nodded a cat burglar does not crawl though a window and accidently find a passedout aliee maison lying there without her underpants lucas said not in a million fuckin years lester grinned again thinking about it have to be a profoundly lucky cat burglar lucas asked wheres sloan still down doing interviews lucas headed for the stairs maybe sloan was pulling a thread he wondered what catrin would be like what if shed turned into this smalltown mommie housewife she hadnt looked like that at the gas station shed looked interesting he tried to gather back the memory of the morning she was older obviously but then so was he she had some lines but still with the good hair the good moves the laugh he flashed back to his college apartment hed lived over a dingy autoparts shop down university avenue he had one room with a foldout couch and fake oriental carpet from goodwill a bathroom permanently frosted over with either mildew or fungus he was never interested enough to find out which and a kitchen with a cheap gas stove and a refrigerator that was missing a leg and so listed to the left and made sloped icecubes he also had a tiny bedroom and in the bedroom was the best piece of furniture in the apartment a bed hed brought from home and a good thing it was that he had the bed because if he hadnt catrin would have broken his back she liked sex a lot she was not promiscuous just enthusiastic the two of them had learned a lot together trying out their chops there was one cold winter day but sunny theyd been in bed late in the morning the sun coming through the dirty window splashing across the bed and catrin flashing back on it he felt himself stirred at the bottom of the stairs he stopped and looked around what was he doing ah sloan sloan was just coming out of the interview room he carried a piece of paper and walked a halfstep behind a middleaged man who seemed broken the man had a hump at the back of his neck his head pressed forward his thinning grey hair combedover the top of his balding head his face was dry but teartracks showed down his cheeks lucas this is mr arthur lansing sandy lansing was his daughter im sorry mr lansing lucas said i cant believe shes gone he said she was so happy her career he trailed off then said it again her career he looked at lucas when she was a little girl her mama and i used to drive over to como park and push her through the zoo in a walker she loved the bears and the monkeys she loved the monkeys im sure lucas was about to unreel a cliche but lansing broke in do you think youll catch them he asked yes ill betcha it was niggers he said there werent any black people at the party last night lansing shook a trembling finger at lucas maybe but you watch i betcha it was niggers you go upstairs in the courthouse i go up there all the time to watch all you see in them courtrooms is niggers i mean some white trash goes through there but ninetynine percent of them is niggers and most of the white trash got nigger blood sloan standing behind lansing rolled his eyes lucas said whoever did it well catch him mr lansing im really sorry about your daughter lansing turned away and spoke to no one my daughter she was an executive and he wandered away talking to the air he loved his daughter sloan said after him yeah thats what all that segregation shit used to be about all the white people loved their daughters hate to lose a daughter though sloan said he had a daughter in college worst thing i could think of its not right dying out of order lucas sighed you get anything from anybody no but were working the right people whoever killed them was at the party there was too much going on that sparks off trouble drugs former boyfriends and girlfriends the celebrity thing and the macho shit that goes with it and just the general craziness of the crowd i just said the same thing to lester lucas said so how many people were at the party weve got sixtyodd so far outa maybe a hundred sloan held up the piece of paper this is the list most people dont remember seeing aliee aftar about midnight i talked to one guy and his girlfriend who can pin down their arrival at about who say they never saw her and they heard she was there so they were looking jael and catherine kinsley left her in the bedroom sometime before one oclock she was alive and drowsy when they left you talked to kinsley on the phone shes on her way back with her husband their cabin is all the way up in ely five hours she didnt hear about it until noon on public radio and you believe them that aliee was alive yes theres just too much other people saw lansing still alive after jael and kinsley had left at least thats what were getting now so how many people are eligible to do the killing hanson says the party peaked between one and two which means maybe most of the people were around when aliee got it weve got a few whod left earlier that weve been able to confirm and quite a few more that said they left earlier but we havent been able to confirm or are lying sloan said what if the killer unlocked that window left the house so people could see him leaving made a deal out of it kissed a few people shook a couple of hands giving himself an alibi then came back through the window killed her and went back out the window sounds like too much coming and going sloan said but it explains the open window lucas said and it might even explain why sandy lansing was killed suppose he came back in the window does aliee and boom lansing is right there in the hall hes gotta kill her she knows that he left and made a big deal out of it and then came back sloan looked at the paper in his hand so we put everybody back on the list chapter nine lane got back i got a chart on aliee her folks her brother i saw her brother lucas said yeah the preacher he goes around and ministers to farm people out in the red river valley he fixes farm equipment sometimes he works part time at a grain elevator wont take any contributions gives away everything he earns except what he needs to eat and buy clothes tell you this he doesnt spend any money on clothes lucas said so the people out there think hes either crazy or a saint or both thats what they said in the fargo newspaper there was an article on the brother not aliee lane nodded mostly on the brother the angle was you know crazy saint related to alie e maison where was he last night lane had asked that question in fargo he runs a free kitchen there he was around the kitchen until eight oclock or so he was back in the morning he could have made a round trip in between and hes got a temper lucas said what else you got i got all the shit on aliee that was just a matter of going out on the net i got a file of printouts two inches thick and you know what theres a cult of aliee worshippers out there and aliee haters they fight on the net i heard anyway i wouldnt be surprised if one of those guys did her yeah vfeah you know some computernerd rapistkiller nut so builds a fantasy around her crashes a party where shes supposed to be she laughs him off says shed rather be fuckin her girlfriends than a pimply little freak lucas grinned at the runaway description nerd rapistkiller nut so it coulda happened that way lane said seriously what else you got i got something else lane said and its interesting but nothing like my previous conjecture about the nerd rapistkiller nut so and its this other chick sandy lansing i talked to the manager at browns hotel and it turns out lansing wasnt exactly a big deal she was more like a female bellhop shed take rich people up to their rooms and show them around not an executive lucas said no she was making maybe twentyfive thousand a year enough to starve on but man i talked to the guys from homicide who were down at her apartment shes got the cool clothes shes got a decent car porsche boxter and she hung out with all these rich people and held her end up financially shes gotta have money coming in from somewhere but i cant find it it aint coming from her old man lucas said i just saw him he looked like he doesnt have two dimes to rub together thats the impression i got lane said so i was thinking she works at this hotel greeting people maybe shes on the corner any busts not a thing but at that level its more by introduction lane said some big sports guy comes through town or big tv guy and you go hang out then you go back to his hotel room and later you get a gift maybe the hotel knows maybe not so lets get her friends and push a little find out where the money came from i thought maybe you could do the hotel end lane said me im a deputy chief of police yeah but the hotels assistant manager in charge of keeping things right is an old pal of yours whos that lucas asked derrick deal you gotta be shitting me i shit you nofc deputy chief of police on the way out of the building lucas passed rose marie roux puffing down the hall muffdivers ball she asked hooking his arm thats what the headline said he answered mildly flustered how many euphemisms do men have for the female sexual organ she asked thats not a place you wanna go lucas said how long before we catch the guy another place she nodded that i dont want to go derrick deal had once been an assistant county assessor more or less his actual position was bagman for a city council cabal that was selling cutrate property assessments the cabal ran into trouble when deal tried to hit up a machineshop owner who happened to be the uncle of a vice cop the cop did some cop shit and got a tape of deal soliciting a payoff then the cop made a mistake he believed that if he simply nailed deal that deals brother assessors would in turn punish his uncle by running up his assessments even as deal went off to six weeks in jail so instead of arresting him the cop let deal listen to the tape and told him to lay off deal misinterpreted the threat and ran to his city council protectors they went to the chief this was three chiefs ago who squashed the vice cop like a bug the vice cop found himself working traffic management on construction sites then he rang in his brother cops notably lucas lucas set up a sting operation and deal went to jail for nine months his city council employers managed to slide and deals brotherassessors did the expected number on the machineshop owner whose taxes went up fifty percent when deal got out of jail he tried selling cars and then houses but wasnt good at it his skills lay in bureaucracy and blackmail not sales lucas heard that hed gone to california and until lane mentioned his name assumed he was still there derrick deal he asked himself as he walked across town browns hotel was a brick building a block from the ids tower from the outside it barely looked like a hotel you had to know it was there lucas nodded at the whitegloved doorman who held the door for him and turned right across the plush red carpet around a circular seat with a spray of outofseason gladiolas in the center to the reception desk a neat young woman stood behind the desk she was black with delicate bones in her face she wore a conservative suit and a silverandturquoise necklace with small oval stones yes sir i need to see mr deal derrick deal lucas said can i tell him whos calling no lucas smiled to soften the answer slipped his id from his pocket and showed it to her this is sort of a surprise if you could just show me where he is she reached for a phone ill call the manager on duty lucas stretched across the desk and put his hand on the phone please dont do that just show me where mr deal works ill get in trouble her lip trembled no you wont lucas said believe me she looked both ways saw no help touched her lip with her tongue and said hes in his office down the hall she looked to her right a long narrow hallway off the lobby show me the door she looked both ways again as if the manager might spring out of the red carpet and finally said this way she came out from behind the desk and started down the hall walking swiftly when they were out of sight of the lobby she slowed is he in trouble i have a question for him if hes not in trouble he should be she said really lucas asked hes a jerk wait a minute lucas said quietly they stopped in the hallway whats a jerk he hassles people she said for money sex dope not dope she said youve had to fight him off lucas asked not exactly im a little too dark for him and i told him that if he hassled me my brother would cut off his testicles he believed you yes my brother came over and showed him the knife she said ah but we have all these little maids a lot of them are mexican and maybe they dont have papers its this tight economy is the reason they hire them he puts the bite on them yes sometimes sex there are often a few empty rooms around usually its money the guests leave tips for the maids ten dollars or twenty dollars he might take out fifty dollars a day all told the maids are afraid to turn him down all he has to do is make an anonymous phone call he lets them know it maybe they should bring their brothers up from mexico lucas said she shook her head easy to say i know lucas said all right ill go ask him my question and then maybe later well figure out something to slow him down a little the hotel wont fire him i dont think she said hes very good at what he does which is he fixes things he gets tickets for shows and basketball games if somebody gets sick he gets a doctor anybody could do that lucas said i mean if a rock star gets sick because he put something up his nose or whatever or if theres a little lovers quarrel and somebody gets beat up or cut up okay lucas said we could still have a talk with him about the maids lucas waited until the receptionist was well back toward her desk before he quietly opened deals office door the office was a collection of six shoulderhigh fabric cubicles the clacking sound of a computer keyboard came from the far corner deal was a balding man with a long nose and heavy petulant lips which he thrust in and out as he peered at his computer screen he was wearing a dark sport coat and sprinkles of dandruff decorated the shoulders and lapels he was intent he never saw lucas coming lucas picked up a visitors chair from a neighboring cubicle and sat it in the aisle just outside deals he sat down heavily and now deal for the first time realized he wasnt alone he jerked around pulled back startled lo derrick lucas said smiling thought you were in california deal pulled himself together goddamnit davenport you scared the shit outa me what do you want vbu heard about the murder sandy lansing nothing to do with us deal muttered he picked a piece of paper up from the desktop squinted at it and slipped it into a desk drawer out of sight lucas shrugged you know how it is derrick we gotta nail everything down and this lansing chick she sorta puzzles us shes got no money shes pulling down twentyfive from this place but shes driving a porsche shes dressing outa those edina boutiques we give her five grand a year for clothes deal said party dresses no not party dresses deal said he turned casually to his computer screen which showed a spreadsheet casually pushed a couple of keys and the screen blanked out the kind of dresses you see on the other women here uppermiddleclass conservative matron clothes we thought maybe she was getting the extra money from taking the clothes off you know the matron dresses deal shook his head no come on man lucas said he waved his hand meaning look at this place you got all kinds of jocks and movie stars and singers and theater people and rich guys i mean what does a fixer guy like you do when one of them wants a blow job i tell him to go blow himself deal said derrick deal put up his hands listen man she was not fucking anybody for money not here anyway i knew about the car i even asked her about it she said something like i got my own money i figured it came from daddy and she was working until she got married she was not ajich kid lucas said deal shook his head so maybe you should do some real investigation so you can stop hassling innocent people derrick goddammit im trying to like you but you make it so hard lucas said he put his hands on the arms of the visitors chair ready to stand up we know shes getting some extra cash and sex is the only thing we can think of id hate to think that browns is some kind of highclass bordello but were gonna have to send some people around to look at the records can we use your name as a recommendation wait a minute wait a minute deal said he picked up a telephone punched in four numbers listened to it ring once then again and then said jean could you come down here for a second he hung up and said you oughta look into dope why because half the time when sandy came in which was usually late in the afternoon she was hung over from partying she was a party girl and she had a real bad coke habit you think she was selling lucas asked deal opened his mouth as if with a reflexive response but his eyes flickered and he changed direction i dont know about selling but she was using and she wasnt getting any extra cash here above the board or below it he was lying about something lucas thought hed seen it in deals eyes the momentary flicker the office door opened and they both turned toward it a moment later a young woman looked down the aisle to deals cubicle and saw lucas mr deal deal stood up and stepped past lucas yeah jean down here the woman walked toward them and lucas suddenly realized that she was extraordinarily goodlooking she was a little heavy round and had soft brown hair spiked with blond strands a lush face with placid pale blue eyes and a slightly rolled underlip she wore just a dab of lipstick her business suit was as conservative as the receptionists but with a difference hers was cut deeply enough in front to show a soft slice of cleavage she was lucas thought maternal and sexy at the same time yes she asked would you take this pencil out to india at the front desk he handed her a yellow pencil she was puzzled but compliant yes sir when she was gone deal sat down again and said with just a touch of sarcasm thats why sandy lansing wasnt dating our customers looking after the woman lucas thought about it for a moment and then nodded she wasnt enough not nearly enough for this place deal said comfortably and there are a couple more like jean even better than jean not that id know anything about private arrangements between staff members and our guests he folded his hands across his stomach and leaned back in his office chair anything else officer davenport lucas leaned into him smiled reached out and tapped him on the kneecap yeah lansing and drugs where was she getting them i dont know he squealed it he sounded like a startled pig i dont know anything about any drugs i dont do drugs you know that yeah right deal was lying about something you do assessments well i would be if you hadnt fucked me he said now i do hotels like it better no deal said i dont i used to be somebody now he looked up between the rows of cubicles im in a goddamn rat cage chapter ten not much more to do there were cops out everywhere working on everybody writing biographies on the party people matching their stories one against the next outside tv trucks were beginning to pile up at the curb he called rose marie checked out and went home had a sandwich got a beer out of the refrigerator the last one hed have to run down to the store he clicked on the tv the movie people were going crazy as expected the local tv news shows crushed sports and weather into a fiveminute segment everything else into two minutes and spent the rest of the halfhour on aliee then the networks jumped in with their talking heads theyd had all day to explore the topic of fashion and dope and long lines of solemn middleaged men deplored the relationship fox and nec had a stunning amnon plain photograph of aliee maison in what looked like mens underwear the photo was as sexual as could be broadcast on tv without a fuzzy spot over the good parts lucas thought and while plain was credited as the photographer all of the commentators gave credit to the star for the use of the photo abcs news reader said the issue of the star would hit the news stands by two oclock the next day only thirtysix hours after aliee was murdered he seemed to think it was a technological miracle lucas got a few seconds of airtime the interview cut in over movies of a stunned george shaw now in jeans and a sweatshirt being dragged out to a cop car theyd bitten on george but not too hard while drugs are acknowledged to be a central point of investigation rumors have surfaced about a number of sexual escapades involving a former model named jael corbeau and the broadcast cut to a shot of corbeau in a chinesecollared black dress that emphasized the planes of her face the jagged jigsaw quality of the scarring after a while lucas got tired of it punched off the tv and wandered back to the drawing board one idea a night that was all his idea tonight was that he might need a fulltime game master or better he thought a game mistress somebody cute and blonde with goldrimmed glasses but game sales wouldnt support a game mistress for long so thered have to be a time limit on the game say one year he pulled out a fresh sheet of paper sat on his high stool doodled a bit couldnt get going catrin he didnt know what he thought about her but she was on his mind restless he walked down the hall picked up the phone hesitated then dialed calling the nunnery a nun answered this is chief davenport with the minneapolis police department lucas said i need to speak to sister mary joseph ill find her the nun said a young voice with a depressive note sister mary joseph was his oldest friend going back to elementary school born elle kruger she was a professor of psychology at st annes college a few blocks from lucass home lucas waited two minutes then heard a phone being fumbled on the other end lucas he smiled when he heard her voice he almost always did hey elle hows everything so much for the small talk lucas whats going on with this aliee maison murder funny you should ask is there a lesbian involvement ah man and whats a muff lucas was absolutely befuddled for a moment though he knew from the first instant that hed never be able to find an answer to the question but then elle laughed merrily and said you can restart your heart now listen dont do that he said the aliee thing its a mess there was a lesbian scene an act involving three women some time before she vas killed i dont know what it has to do with the killing maybe nothing thats sorta what i wanted to ask you about what when gay guys kill each other it can be pretty rough a lot of mutilation a lot of anger a lot of knives for some reason you see guys stabbed twenty or thirty times passion turns to anger when things go wrong passion and anger are linked what were these women like was it all very sexual or was it less sexual and more something else thats what i was worrying about one of the women suggested that while it was sexual it wasnt aggressively sexual she said it was more like cuddling but there was a sexual act stroking oral sex but it didnt seem crazy it might not have been the cultural prohibition against lesbian sex is not nearly as strong as it is against male homosexuality if a man becomes involved in gay sex theres a tremendous amount of stress at least initially elle said women sometimes can go from friendship with another woman to occasional touching to sex and back to friendship in a seamless way without much guilt or stress thats why you dont see so many violent lesbian murders the stress isnt so high all of the women involved were also involved with men the relationships sometimes were simultaneous thats not unusual there are some women who are howll i put this reflexively lesbian thats what they are they are as interested in women as well as you are but many women especially young women they may just drift along having relationships with women as well as with men theres even a kind of fashionable element to it all right have you looked at aliees family somebody has i met her folks i dont think theyd get the good housekeeping seal for parenting they dragged her all over the country since she was a baby pushing her into showbiz living through her mmm and shes got a goofy brother thats interesting it suggests there mustve been some serious stresses in the family yeah hes a peasant preacher out around fargo somewhere gives away his clothes elle said not tom olson lucas looked at the phone then put it back to his ear vfeah you know him hes a saint oh boy oh boy was rough language from elle what he really is a saint hes an evangelistic christian he believes the rapture is coming next month or next year or whatever because he can see it coming rolling in like a wave he might be schizophrenic he is definitely an ecstatic we had a novice here from out that way the red river she went home to visit her folks he was preaching at a bowling alley she went to see him with some of her girlfriends sort of a lark she came back and quit the convent and quit the church and began wandering around the red river preaching christs gospel i try to stay in touch with her she told me that olson sometimes gets the stigmata her voiced hushed with the word stigmata you gotta be sh kidding me no im not as a catholic lucas was severely lapsed but he nevertheless felt a chill crawl down his spine at the idea of the stigmata bleeding from christs wounds in the hands the feet the side even from the crown of thorns so he thinks hes god oh no absolutely not elle said he sees himself as a messenger preparing the way john the baptist then lucas said i dont think hed put it that way youre being copsarcastic and hes a very serious man he was in the office today he was intense where was he when the murder was committed elle asked in fargo out there somewhere thats his story but you think he could have done it i dont know sainthood is generally a mystery but it involves very deep emotional streams and often something very dark he may have very deep feelings about his sister and because of his emotional condition he might be very demonstrative he was with the chief they talked for a few more minutes lucas filling in the details of the crime elle would think about them and call if anything occurred to her they said goodbye and lucas started back to the study halfway there he turned went back to the phone and called the nunnery again the same young depressive nun answered and he waited the same two minutes for elle to pick up something else you know what you said to me when you first came to the phone i dont know i was teasing you you asked something like whats going on with the aliee maison murder yes she was puzzled nobody ever asks about the other woman lansing shes like a piece of kleenex that got used mmm to be honest i havent thought of her elle confessed you know when you were hurt you were hurt because somebody was trying to distract me and it worked for a while with everybody saying aliee aliee i hope were not looking in the wrong direction as long as we keep that in mind elle said after a second of silence she added ill think about her pray for her late that night as he sat on the bed taking off his socks lucas remembered trick bentoin trick the gambler the man who wasnt dead who hadnt been killed by a brandnew lifer out at stillwater lucas had forgotten to call the county attorney and so apparently had del theyd talked to each other a dozen times during the day and neither had mentioned it again lucas muttered a short obscenity to himself folks were gonna be pissed about the delay even though it was kinda funny but he wasnt thinking about trick when he drifted off to sleep he was thinking about what he should wear to lunch tomorrow lunch with catrin even later that night not far from lucas but across the mississippi in minneapolis jael corbeau heard a scratching round her door her eyes popped open and she sat up she was exhausted but she hadnt been able to sleep shed taken a pill but her body fought it aliee amnon said she was infatuated that aliee was nothing more than a willing reflection of jaels own need for a special kind of pleasure for a languid wicked fashionable lover a beautiful lover and jael feared it was true that she was shallow dissolute trendy the scratching on the door popped her out of the depressive cycle she recognized the sound as soon as she heard it somebody was trying to get in jael lived in a small house on the south side of the loop not far from the metrodome her bedroom was on the second floor the first was occupied by her workshop a throwing room a glazing room a kiln room with two big electric skutts and a wedging room where she stored clay and did the preliminary workups the workups thatd built her arms and shoulders the cops had asked her about that one had taken her hand told her to squeeze she had and hed pretended to wince fucking with her trying to intimidate her it hadnt worked she wasnt intimidated by the cops and she wasnt intimidated by the scratching at the door during the worst of the crack years the scratching would come every week or two but crack was fading burning out she hadnt had an attempt in a year or more still she rolled out knelt as if in prayer and felt under the edge of the bed her fingers picked it up immediately the cold steel of the barrel she pulled it out an old pump winchester gauge moving swiftly through the dark she went into the bathroom to the barred frostedglass window over the tub the window was doublehung and the slides were waxed she unlocked it slipped it up down below a heavyset man in black crouched on the stoop prying amateurishly at the lock bushes flanked the stoop so he would be invisible from the street unless somebody looked straight up the walk she spoke softly but clearly hey you down there the figure froze then half turned she could see a crescent of his face in the ambient light from the street like a sliver of the moon seen through a thin cloud pale obscure i have a shotgun she pumped it the old steel action cycling with the precise chickchick soundeffect heard in a thousand movies its a twelvegauge im pointing it at your head the crescent of face disappeared the man turned quick as a thought and bolted from the porch down through the bushes around the corner and down the street hands and heavy legs pumping frantically watching him go jael allowed herself the first smile shed enjoyed in twentyfour hours but as she slid the window back down and locked it a vagrant thought crossed her mind he hadnt looked like a crack head not at all he looked like some kind of redneck ql chapter eleven sunday the second day of the maison case lucas retrieved the pioneer press from his front porch looked at the large dark headline alie e maison murdered and beneath that the subhead strangled in minneapolis the headline he thought was smaller than the moonwalk and possibly even smaller than reproductions hed seen of the pearl harbor news flash but not much and he thought trick county attorney randall towson was not exactly a friend but he was a decent guy he took the phone call at his breakfast table and said tell me we got everything we need what on the aliee maison killer who youre calling to tell me you caught i have something much better honest to god lucas tried to inject sincerity into his voice ive found a chance to serve justice the attorney betrayed a cautious curiosity youre bullshitting me sorry darling no no ive found an innocent guy in the prison system you can get him out and then you can take the credit and the grateful taxpayers will undoubtedly return you to office for the what fifth time sixthtowson said what the fuck sorry darling im eating breakfast with my granddaughter what are you talking about del capslock was at the aliee party the other night he wasnt there at the time of the murder but he did meet an old friend of ours who suspicious now trick bentoin silence silence for so long that lucas added trick had gone to panama to play gin rummy qq then his voice soft and unshaken towson said this is a problem yeah lucas nodded though there was nobody to see it ive clearly identified it as a problem tomorrow when i get to work ill get my best people working on a solution that would be good lucas said another long silence then great jesus fuckin christ davenport towson screamed and meekly added sorry darling catrin what to wear to a sunday lunch she was married to a doctor so she probably had some bucks shed be more comfortable with something neat rather than something out on the edge boots and blackleather jackets were out lucas dug through his closet through a stack of dry cleaning and finally came up with what he hoped would be right twill pants in a deep khaki a crisp blue shirt and brown suede sport coat he added dark brown loafers and his dress gun a p in mm checked himself in the mirror smiled a couple of times nah better to can the little smile he thought go for sincerity and pleasure at seeing her on sundays city hall was dead quiet not today lucas went straight for rouxs office the secretarys desk was empty but rose marie dressed in slacks and a sweater with fuzzy white sheep on it was in her office with two visitors dick milton the departments media specialist was a former newspaper reporter whod once written an eightpart investigative series sunday through sunday on oak wilt angela harris a departmental contract shrink was perched on the window sill what do you think lucas asked as he stuck his head in the door mediawise roux looked up just about what we expected been a little rough on george shaw milton said thats not rough lucas said hed never liked milton even when he was reporting rough is sitting in the county jail waiting to go to stillwater for ten years which is what george is gonna do inn its not gonna hold the connection between shaw and aliee milton said he looked at roux this whole lesbian business they stayed pretty delicate about it last night on the news shows but i was on the net and i saw a scan of the first copies of the star and they got big a sexy picture of this jael corbeau shes hotter than aliee so it aint gonna stay delicate very long whens the star gonna get here lucas asked this afternoon i guess they got stories on the net about how the star editors tore the ass off a whole issue as it was going out the door and turned it around to do an aliee issue the journal says all them other rags are suckin wind so its gonna pump everything up lucas said he looked at roux youre still working the press pretty hard were doing another press conference at ten oclock and then the olson family and friends are supposed to be back around noon they want the body as soon as they can get it the funerals gonna be later in the week up in burnt river then well probably have another press briefing around three oclock and if we need another around seven nothing came up overnight nothing except this morning randall towson called about trick bentoin i forgot to tell you about it lucas said the murder washed it away del says tricks in a days inn down on so well pick him up tomorrow and get a statement towson is gonna call rashid albalahs attorney i guess as soon as we get a statement from trick maybe nobody will notice we should announce it the day of the funeral milton said if we can hold off until then i dunno lucas said we really ought to get albalah out of stillwater as soon as we can albalah roux said fuck him but why dont you get bentoin today just in case okay lucas looked at the shrink what do you think about aliee we got a crazy harris shook her head too soon to tell it looks more efficient than crazy though of course the man is disturbed in some sense hed be more disturbed if i could get my goddamned hands on him rose marie said twelve of the people at the party have arrest records and im looking at them for any sign of psychiatric involvement but i dont see any so far the shrink continued twelve lucas asked looking at rose marie talk to lester but its all small stuff shoplifting petty theft two misdemeanor domestic assaults one street fight a couple of ticket scofflaw cases like that nothing a postit note was stuck to lucass door come get me it was signed marcy he walked down to homicide and found the place full of cops more homicide cops than hed ever seen in one spot at one time on a sunday lester was perched on a desk at the end of the room talking to a cop with a notebook he spotted lucas and shook his head nothing happening lucas stepped back to marcy sherrills desk she saw him coming said something into the phone she was holding and hung up im really coming over she was a pretty woman in her early thirties she liked to fight she and lucas had had a brief intense affair which everyone in the office had considered inevitable and overdue after a couple of months theyd called the thing off by mutual consent to their mutual relief yeah at least for a while lucas said good im trying to track down more people from the party i bet were missing forty people but im not getting anywhere im ready to bag it so youre up right now i could be if you whispered in franks shelllike ear marcy said you remember trick bentoin sherrill didnt want to go after bentoin but if she could bring him into the state attorneys office he could keep del free all day so if i do this i can work aliee for you were all working aliee after this lucas said maybe forever sherrill leaned back in her chair locked her hands behind her head and studied him what he asked youve got something going on the way you look you look sort of snazzy meeting an old friend for lunch lucas said no point in denying it during the affair sherrill had learned to read his mind nicelooking id guess she smiled i dont know i really havent talked to her in twenty years whoa so what happened she just came back to town no shes been living down south on the mississippi somewhere down there and she could read his mind she rocked forward her face serious lucas is she married he shrugged shes not entirely unmarried as i understand it look were just having lunch oh god dont fuck her up lucas he was offended stiffened up i wont and you go get bentoin okay call me when youve got him lucas even more serious now lucas man shes your age shes married shes in the danger zone you could seriously mess her up i can tell by the way youre acting find bentoin he turned and left in the hall under his breath he said fuck you and looked at his watch plenty of time for an errand carl knox had taken a fine sunday morning to look at a stolen kubota tractor with a front loader and rearmounted backhoe an accessory mower was piled on the front of the trailer that held the tractor while carl looked a frecklefaced strawhaired outraged thief was talking about the turf tires practically unused the goddamn machine only had hours on it came straight off the best golf course in southern minnesota what was this twothousanddollar shit carl couldnt hear him because he was thinking about a cree indian guy named louis arnot up in canada whod been calling around looking for just such a machine arnot would pay twelve thousand american if carl could deliver the tractor to kenora ontario which he could but his guys would have to change the numbers and hed have to come up with some kubota papers and he hadnt done kubota in a couple of years his daughter had come out to the shop with him shed been inside fooling with the books but now suddenly broke through the service department door and said the cops are here uhoh he said he waved her back inside and then looked at the tractor how hot is this thing nobody even knows its stolen yet roy said nervously davenport came around the corner of the building fifty yards away knox said quietly here he comes dont look i know this guy and hes not here about the tractor ill take the two thousand roy said his adams apple bobbing knox stepped away from the trailer to greet davenport nicelooking machine lucas said as he strolled up i use a b up north no offense but thats practically a fucking lawnmower knox said enough small talk whats going on lucas was offended but tried not to show it instead he looked at the frecklefaced thief why dont you go get a coke sounds good roy said he hopped off the trailer and hotfooted it across the parking lot toward a door marked service department through the glass panel of the door lucas could see the pale face of knoxs daughter peering out at them whys everybody so nervous he asked whats everybody doing at work on a sunday you work everyday if you have a small business and youre not sucking out of the state trough knox said that cant be it lucas said he looked at the kubota what that hick steal this tractor jesus davenport hes a goddamn basement excavator whos going broke and has to sell his job what do you want a list lucas said we chase all over town going after the big dope wholesalers the gangs the people pushing shit on the street and we pretty much know every one of them the ones we dont know the ones we cant get at are the realty smart ones who only move a kilo or so a week to rich people nobody ever complains nobody ever gets caught nobodys standing on a street corner we need some of these names you know i dont mess with dope too dangerous but you do loansharking carl and you got that layoff business ifu with the sportsbook guys you know a lot of rich people who get their money in strange ways and put a lot of it up their nose and who dont buy their shit down in the ghetto youre gonna get my nuts cut off knox said lucas shrugged so whos ever gonna know that youre talking to me and it gives us just that much less incentive to figure out what you really do for a living you know the ugly details is this part of the aliee maison thing yeah part of it nobody ought to be killing young girls knox said i saw the story in the startribune this morning the interview with her parents he looked toward the service door where his daughters face still floated in the rectangle of black glass in the service door i can ask around he said but like the last time i might come up empty that helped when you came up empty lucas said it eliminated some possibilities so i can ask knox said now you wanna take a hike before my kid breaks out in hives lucas left halfway back to the corner of the building he turned and said ill anxiously await your call knox shook his head and watched until lucas had turned the corner the frecklefaced thief eased out of the building and asked whatd he want just bullshit knox said he turned to the thief you said nobody knows the tractor is gone yet wont nobody know until tomorrow when the owner gets back from vegas can you get it back there get it back i just stole it roy said yeah but this guy is gonna look it up just sure as shit if its on a list hes gonna be back here and hes gonna want to know where it went id have to tell him i turned you down and then hed come looking for you you wouldnt tell him knox shrugged youre not a real big part of my business well goddamn carl so you take it back knox said when does your guy go to vegas again he goes every couple of months so steal it again then ill give you three thousand knox said three take it or leave it the thief looked up at the big orange tractor and said im gonna be out fifty bucks for gas hey roy yeah tell somebody who gives a shit lucas stopped back at headquarters left a note for a guy in property crimes asking him to check on stolen kubota tractors then he looked at his watch every thirty seconds for ten minutes and then headed for a restaurant called the bell jar no sign of catrin he was a few minutes early but he started to worry maybe shed bailed the maitre d put him in a corner where he could see the room a waitress came by and dropped off the drinks menu a couple of minutes later she came back and he ordered a martini will you be dining by yourself today she asked no i and catrin came in the door im meeting that lady right there catrin he thought had dressed as carefully as he had in a light graywool skirt a black cashmere sweater and low heels she was wearing small diamond earrings she looked he thought absolutely wonderful she read his face and might have colored just a bit as he stood up to meet her lucas how are you he was fumbling already i mean with your friend funerals on tuesday she said its over with what shed been through it was time i dont feel the least bit bad about it okay she smiled and said did you order a martini a martini what happened to the grain belt only on special occasions he said he looked around the restaurant if you ordered bratwurst in this place the chefd probably faint so ill have a martini she said an oldtime drink with an oldtime friend and she was fumbling he thought last time i saw you not yesterday but back when you were really upset i remember she said you were such a punk you were unbelievable you were also pretty sure you were gods gift to women if i remember correctly cmon i wasnt gods gift to anyone easy to say now you werent exactly a ride in the park yourself are we gonna fight but she said it smiling almost delighted like something was still the same the last time i saw you he said dropping his voice you were absolutely buck naked the last thing i saw was you standing there with your fists on your hips looking for your underpants that was something you werent supposed to bring up she said and now she was pink though i do remember that we spent quite a bit of time running around naked yeah jesus are we old now no but we were definitely young then a waiter came gave them menus left water and promised to come back catrin opened the menu and looked over it to say you really made me angry back then i almost couldnt stand it i never told jack about you and he was a hockey fan and he used to take me to hockey games the next year before he graduated he was one of your fans i remember how pissed off id get when youd be skating around cruising around backward or something all arrogant macho tough asshole smiling at the girls jesus he was impressed still pisses me off thinking about it her eyes dropped to the menu that was the end of the sex talk after they ordered the conversation drifted to their current lives when you said your husband took you to hockey games before he graduated when did he graduate the next year we got married june of my sophomore year and he did his internship with a military hospital in korea he was a captain then when we came back he joined his fathers practice in lake city and thats where weve been what about you you didnt finish school no you know i got pregnant while we were in the army i mean i took classes over the years but i never got back to school fulltime i thought about going this fall to macalester but i just i dont know i didnt go now im supposed to go this winter and i still dont know im kind of fucked up she heard herself say it and stopped the last time i said that used those words fucked up was when we were dating yeah well the good stuff always comes back lucas said wryly when they were eating she said things have really been good i loved jack right away i wouldnt give up any of that for anything but this is like feminist hell i keep coming back to how about me when do they make my movie i always thought i was gonna be the movie star and the rest of you were gonna be the extras instead i wind up as the one in the background whos changing diapers and doing the books and working for free for united way i thought you and i were alike because you always did what you were going to do you were always the star in your movie i thought i was like that i was always going to do what i wanted to do and then the kids came and i had to take care of them i didnt have any choice because they were mine and nobody else was going to do it and it just made sense now theyre moving out lucas said so do what you want to do but what am i going to do i have a feeling that if you want to be a movie star in any movie youve got to start young and work hard and the best way to do that is be hungry all the time but jack started investing while we were still in the army and he always made good money and you know how much were worth now something like ten million dollars thats a ridiculous amount jack wants to buy a house in florida and hes talking about an apartment in london we both like london and you can get there in seven hours on northwest so whats the point in trying to be a movie star now to do what not to make money maybe you were a painter and you want to do photography so do photography or paint ahhh she said that all seems to sterile now everything is too comfortable so go back to college in criminal justice lucas said you can be a cop i can fix it so minneapolisll hire you and you can go around and do murders really what do you want to do catrin lucas asked not be a cop she said so what i dont know im just so comfortable everything is so perfect that i want to scream he walked her back to the car she stood on her tiptoes and kissed him on the cheek and swivelled into the front seat of the lincoln by the way the chances of us running into each other up here are just about nil but if we do we do get up here every couple of weeks i didnt tell jack about meeting you for lunch there just would have been too many questions so if we see you yeah dont worry he was whistling on the way back to the office caught himself and caught himself again man she was married and it didnt sound like a bad marriage either but there was something between the two of them between himself and a woman he hardly knew anymore and it had a lot to do with sex the thought might have brought him down but it didnt when he got back to his office he found another postit note on the door find me marcy sherrill was at her desk in homicide she didnt ask about the lunch she said no trick what the motel manager said he checked out this morning hes driving a tenyearold limegreen caddy with a trunk full of golf clubs and one suit case we got a license number a real license number yeah illinois tag i ran it and it comes up under a different name a guy named robert petty but its a tenyearold limegreen caddy i called petty and he said he sold it two weeks ago and the guy was supposed to change plates i guess trick never got around to it goddamnit lucas said you put the tag out yeah pretty much all over the fivestate and i called del and hes looking around the hotel manager said trick didnt seem to be in a hurry he checked out about ten minutes before the checkout deadline and they talked about the vikings for a while so he may still be around sloan came in asked have you seen it he held up a copy of the star with aliee on the front she was standing in a dark cavernous space with fire or sparks flying behind her she was wearing what looked like mens underpants and a short torn tshirt that left her midriff bare in yellow inchhigh block letters a headline read aliee the last shoot holy shit sherrill breathed she took it from sloan and flipped it open to the portfolio in the middle of the issue aliee in a dress the color of froth on the caribbean sea walking down what looked like a line of fire another shot of her in the shortsandtshirt ensemble but this time with one exposed and apparently rouged nipple and behind her a giant man in a welders helmet and on the page opposite a closeup facial shot of a woman lucas wouldnt have recognized except for the film hed seen on television the night before and the scars is that sloan asked jael corbeau lucas said looks different sloan said lots better lucas said shed been caught fullface at night although the photo had the flashambience of a news shot it was obviously done in a studio everything was perfect poised balanced designed corbeau was looking back over a bare shoulder a single strand of dark pearls looped around her neck and dropped out of the bottom of the photo her hair was cropped and she was not quite snarling at the camera her lipstick looked dark maybe purple hot shernll said if i was inclined to do a little muff diving id take either one of them what kind of talk is that sloan asked the kind that turns me on lucas said bumping sherrill in the arm with his elbow youre not the only one sherrill said she tapped the lap of the giant welder in the photo of aliee the photo with the rouged nipple lucas looked closer is that unless its a biggerthanusual jackknife sherrill said like way biggerthanusual nothing was happening cops came back shaking their heads looking for something else to do every person that they could find whod been at the party had been interviewed nobody used any dope nobody knew where it was coming from nobody had seen aliee after midnight only a few people could remember lansing at all after an endoftheday meeting in rose marie rouxs office lucas headed home he changed into a sweatshirt and shorts ran for fortyfive minutes through the quiet highland park area of st paul feeling virtuous and back home picked up the phone to find a message from dispatch call carl knox carl he said lucas davenport i got two names for you and ive squeezed as hard as im going to im already nervous enough whatre the names curtis logan spelled just like it sounds he says hes an artist and he used to work in one of the art museums he started by selling coke and ecstasy and speed to a few of the patrons and his name got around in certain groups okay curtis logan lucas noted it on a legal pad and james bee thats bee like in bumble whats he do certified financial advisor hooks up with rich people through a company called rio accounting same thing as logan mostly handles fashion drugs ecstasy speed what are we talking about in sales every once in a while or bigtime i dont know exactly i wasnt doing an investigation i was looking for a connection but i got the feeling theyre semibigtime and very careful i owe you lucas said yeah you do and for christs sakes dont do anything thatll make them think of me when you ask about them neither of the two names was on the party list that would have been too much to expect anyway but if they could get the two of them they might be able to develop a daisy chain of peddlerstotherich and a name might still be found del was still working lucas dialed his cellular number and pulled him out of a bar got two names for you but youve gotta go gentle like walking on cotton lucas gave him the names del hadnt heard of either of them and said call me if you get anything probably wont nothing happen until tomorrow del said ill get on some banks start doing some financials we cant really afford a longterm look lucas said ill do it fast as i can but i cant just go knock on their doors hear any more about trick no but people are talking about a big game maybe tomorrow night or the next night i havent tracked it down yet but thatd be a possibility call me when you get it that night he worked on his game but there were no calls a call came in the morning though you awake sleepyhead rose marie roux and the words on other days might have brought up a smile they didnt this morning because of her tone of voice what happened lucas asked amnon plains dead dead he said stupidly in st paul somebody shot him chapter twelve monday the third day of the hunt there had been no premonition lucas was given to premonitions mostly wrong and usually involving a variety of planecrash scenarios beginning as soon as he made a reservation for an airline flight he also had premonitions involving criminal cases some were right hed been told by a shrink that his unconscious was probably pushing him to a logical connection that his conscious mind hadnt yet made he didnt necessarily buy the mumbojumbo but he didnt yet deny it either so he paid attention to premonitions but in this instance he hadnt had one and even after he heard about plain he felt no foreboding about the rest of the day plain had been murdered in his apartment studio at the matrix building in st pauls lowertown an outoftheloop business district of old converted warehouses occupied by artists and startup businesses the matrix was one of the oldest and least updated all the elevators were designed for freight and stank of decades of crushed fruit and rotten onions paint beer and cardboard boxes the hallways were littered with trash cans most of them stuffed to overflowing the matrix had sold everything at one time or another produce hardware dope even wholesale leisure suits sewn in st pauls only doubleknit sweatshop lately the big product was art mostly painting with some light sculpture and plains photography studio a half dozen st paul cop cars were gathered in the street when lucas rolled up he dumped the porsche in a furniturestore parking lot flashed his badge at a clerk who stood in the window the clerk nodded and he headed across the street a st paul cop at the door recognized him and said nice to see you chief when lucas said good morning another cop pointed him at the elevator up to seven take a right a st paul police lieutenant named allport was standing over amnon plains body making notes on a steno pad with a yellow pencil plain shiftless and shoeless was facedown in a puddle of drying blood that had spread across a pale hardwood floor a brown paper grocery bag lay a few feet from his head its contents spilled out across the floor bakery a cereal box a sixpack of mineral water just beyond the grocery bag a stainlesssteel spiral staircase led down to the floor below lucas took it in for a minute then the st paul cop looked up ah thank god the minneapolis cops we were just about to call for help we heard you had a murder and thought you probably needed some advice on how to handle it lucas said we certainly would what would you advise get your pr guy out of bed and get his ass over here lucas said in about one hour youre gonna be up to your knees in cnn abc cbs nec and every goddamn channel thats got initials yeah allport scratched behind his ear with the pencil point then he turned and looked at a cop get the chief on the line so what happened lucas asked allport spread his hands over the body they just had this big aliee spread in the star have you seen it yeah sexy you see the boner on that guy yeah so what happened here ill tell you what if i had a dick like that i sure as shit wouldnt be a welder anyway everybody was screaming for pictures thats what plains assistant says they were sending them out by phone i dont know how exactly so so the assistant was here until fourthirty and then they decided to break he said plain wanted to take a shower and they needed some food it was too early for any regular store to be open and they didnt like any of the allnight restaurants so the assistant drove over to white bear avenue theres an allnight supermarket where all the cops hang out used to when they had the allnight restaurant anyway he bought some rolls and fruit and shredded wheat and a carton of milk and some bottled water his pencil dipped toward the bag on the floor when he came back he let himself in downstairs because he thought plain might still be in the shower and then he came up the stairs and he found this he dropped the bag yup got a cashregister receipt lucas asked yup and the time of the receipt says already worked it out and it fits you believe him yup why because he was freaked out in a way thats hard to fake because we had an offduty cop working at the supermarket who saw the assistant checking the food through and she said he was mellow enough to bullshit both the cashier and the cop shit i sorta thought the same thing until it occurred to me that ill probably get a lot of air time outa this the cop that allport had sent to make the phone call came back with a cell phone and handed it to him chief he said allport took the phone and said i got lucas davenport here he says were gonna need some heavy pr bullshit here and right away yeah yeah here he is he handed the phone to lucas you working up a new hand load lucas asked when he took the phone well uh not at the moment why all the stray dogs have been disappearing from the neighborhood lucas said vfeah bullshit davenport listen how bads this gonna be cant tell all depends on how you handle it the movie people are like flies over in minneapolis right now and you can bet your ass theyll be over here as soon as the word leaks id be surprised if you got more than an hour if i were you id get the mayor in and get him briefed so he doesnt say anything stupid and id talk to rose marie get her to ship our pr guy here to brief you on our case s if you sound half bright and on top of all the questions youll be okay for now until we catch the killer you guys getting anything over there no then spend some time with allport if you arent doing any good over there maybe somethingll catch your eye over here when he got off the phone lucas went back to the body squatting as close as he could get without disturbing the puddle of blood all he could see was the red stain in the middle of plains back an exit wound he thought but the cloth was too soaked to show a hole lucas looked around the room you find a bullet hole anywhere yeah the problem is the whole place is poured concrete theres a big goddamn dent in the wall over there he pointed and lucas saw the gray pit the slug went somewhere else i wouldnt be surprised if it more or less evaporated hit the wall straighton when are you gonna roll him over he asked we re ready allport nodded to an assistant medical examiner who was sitting on a chair in the kitchen reading a comic book but our photo guy is checking what he got on film we dont want any mistakes on this so how long hes been out of here for half an hour so it should be any time wheres plains assistant lucas asked down in the studio mind if i chat with him go ahead ill call you when we roll him the studio consisted of five rooms one big open space with pulldown paper rolls mounted on the walls a smaller room full of strangelooking tables with curved milkywhite plastic tops a small room with a group of hooded lights and a halfdozen chairs of different kinds apparently a portrait studio an office and storage space and an entry lucas found james graf in the office he was dressed in a black turtleneck and black slacks and had a thin black beard he looked lucas thought like a picture of one of the oldtime beatniks graf was lying on a couch an arm thrown over his eyes lucas dragged a directors chair across the floor and sat down next to the couch graf lifted his head and looked wordlessly at lucas hed been crying lucas thought did you see or hear anybody outside the studio or the apartment when you left for the grocery store i already talked im from minneapolis im working on the aliee murder lucas said i just have a couple of questions did you see or hear anybody i didnt see anyone but we heard people from time to time when we were working theres always somebody around graf said people here work all night sometimes theyre always out wandering around in the hallways but you didnt see anybody no but i did recognize one voice joyce i dont know her last name shes an artist down the hall i heard her yelling and running in the hall laughing this was a few minutes before i went out i told the st paul police how about cars in the parking lot graf dropped his head back refocused on the ceiling thinking then shook his head im sorry i didnt notice anything unusual we did have a wrongnumber phonecall about two oclock which was pretty unusual but i told st paul and theyre checking the artist joyce was wandering around for what i dont know graf pushed himself up on the couch but you know she was down here he was killed upstairs and to get upstairs you have to go all the way to the middle of the building and take the elevator or the public stairs unless you take a fire escape so if he was waiting up there she probably wouldnt have seen him you dont think he came in through here lucas nodded at the studio door no ammy was on his way upstairs when i left and the bolts on all the doors lock automatically and those doors theyre steel weve got maybe a hundred thousand dollars worth of photo equipment and computer stuff in here and the place is full of thieves stuff gets stolen all the time so our doors are good the locks are good so i think whoever it was went up and knocked on the door upstairs and killed ammy when he answered it would plain just open the door if somebody knocked well maybe i mean everybody in the building knows everybody else so if somebody knocks he gestured at the door the doors upstairs are just like these solid no windows if somebody knocks you have to open it to see who it is and maybe what maybe he thought it was me coming back for something graf said how often did he send you out most nights when were working id go get some food somewhere and wed eat it upstairs in the kitchen we dont like to have food in here cause you get grease around and crumbs and then you get bugs and mice theres just too much stuff in here so he might have thought it was you coming back yes did he have his shirt on when you last saw him yes and his shoes he was going to take a shower so whoever attacked him probably had to happen within a few minutes of your leaving probably i dont think hed taken his shower yet his hair didnt look wet he always washed his hair because if we were working a long time itd get greasy thats what he always said do you think allport shouted down from the apartment level were gonna roll him lucas went back upstairs the medical examiner was pulling on yellow rubber gloves a cop and an mes assistant were already wearing them a photographer squatted in the corner sorting equipment out of a camera bag an eightfootlong sheet of plastic had been spread across the floor just outside the blood puddle gonna turn him allport said gotta pick him up straight up keep him in the air dont let him dip back into the puddle then were gonna roll onto the plastic the me told the other two guys with gloves did you talk to somebody named joyce lucas asked allport joyce woo allport said nodding the me interrupted youre gonna have to move were gonna swing him right past you he said lucas and allport stepped back the me said bill you gotta hang onto the shoulder at the same time you pick up the hand or well lose him with the blood on there he could be slippery shes an oriental chick allport said to lucas she was out in the hallway she might ve seen somebody she might even have heard the shot but she was so drunk at the time that shes not sure i mean shes sure but were not sure go talk to her the phone call the wrong number still looking for it ready the medical examiner asked lift when they moved the body lucas turned away but he heard it as it broke free of the partially coagulated blood it sounded like a boot coming out of a mudhole they picked plain straight up carried him facedown to the plastic sheet and then flipped him in midair and dropped him to the plastic his eyes were open lucas winced and turned away for a moment nothing here allport said boom he falls down lucas squatted looked plain in the face so strange he said what the killings at the party were improvised lucas said whod be crazy enough to go to a big party planning to kill somebody in a hallway and then strangle a famous model in a bedroom with a hundred people around had to be improvised it seemed almost accidental this aint allport said maybe this plain guy knew something and the killer had to shut him up lucas stood up thats pretty complicated when joyce woo answered her door she was holding a beer mug halffull of white wine and her apartment reeked of the stuff she was short stocky moonfaced and wore thicklensed glasses she invited lucas in and slumped on a couch with paisley cushions he pulled up a kitchen chair i told the other cops i saw somebody she said sipping the wine looking at lucas over the rim of the glass down the hall but i didnt see him very well cause i was playing catchme fuckme with a friend you were uh a guy i know from across the street a computerart guy not what youd call real goodlooking but what the hell im not exactly the queen of the may and hes big where it counts if you know what i mean yeah well bigwhereitcounts was getting a workout between the computer guy and clark the welder but she wasnt finished with the idea its like that with all the computer guys you know she rolled her head back staring at the ceiling as if she were trying to unlock a conundrum i dont know why youd think the jocks would be the guys with big wieners but its never like that its always these thin skinny computer guys who got the package you were playing lucas said trying to wrench her back on track she rolled her head forward focused on him and said yeah he gives me a twominute head start and then if he can catch me in the building in five minutes he gets to fuck me well that sounds like sometimes i cheat and let him catch me she said she burped anyway we run all over the building i was running down the hall and i saw this guy in the stairwell i yelled at him just hello and kept going was he going up or down dont know he was just there in the stairwell she said he didnt answer no what time was it lucas asked i dont know but early or late whatever i talked to jimmy for a minute this morning after they found the body this is jimmy plains assistant vfeah anyway he heard me yelling in the hallway and the only time i was yelling that they would have heard was about the time i saw the guy so when i saw him plain was still alive you didnt think it was weird that somebody was wandering around the bujlding in the middle of the night lucas asked this building id think it was weird if people werent wandering around in the middle of the night the st paul police said you might have heard a shot maybe i heard a loud noise but it might have been a door banging shut weve got all these metal doors in here and they echo off the concrete when you let them bang shut she said i didnt think about it at the time except that i heard it this guy in the hallway looked like what porky thats all i can say porky he was sort of turned around from me a puzzled look crossed her face you know something that crossed my mind this is stupid i thought the guy might be the vendingmachine guy we got a vendingmachine guy who looks like this guy did you tell the other cops that lucas asked no i just thought of it she said the vendingmachine guy wouldnt be here at that time in the morning no but you play catchme fuckme at that time sure the way it works is i drink myself into a stupor in the morning which im doing now then i sleep until about three oclock or maybe four oclock then i get up and i feel like shit and i eat something and then i work i work until midnight and then you know whatever i eat again and sometimes neil comes over and we play and then when i start getting sleepy i start drinking did this neil guy your friend did he see the man in the stairwell the other cops went and got him up and he said he didnt see anybody she said all right lucas looked around the apartment which seemed spartan if not absolutely bare the only thing hung on the walls was a kliban cat calendar what kind of art do you do he asked conceptual she said lucas had just turned the corner at the top of the stairs when he heard the woman scream the scream came from plains apartment and the cop at the door turned to look inside a second later a woman ran out directly into the green concreteblock wall on the opposite side of the hall she ran into it fullface staggered from the blow ran another step and then lucas caught her as she sagged toward the floor the woman held on and turned her face sideways and lucas first registered the scars jael corbeau she wrapped her arms around him blindly using him for support lucas half turned and allport came through the door spotted them ah jesus he said im sorry you shouldnt have he looked at lucas we told her shed have to wait until we got him to the medical examiners to see him we had the sheet over him and she just stooped down and ripped it off before we could stop her jesus miz corbeau im sorry i gotta go home she said i gotta go home wheres your car lucas asked he let her go but she held onto his jacket with one hand she hadnt looked at his face yet he was a handy post i dont have a car a friend brought me is he still here no the police wouldnt let him come up so i told him id catch a cab i thought i thought i thought i thought id be here for a long time but i gotta go home if i cant have him she looked back at plains door where do you live lucas asked now she looked up at him south minneapolis ill give you a lift lucas said he looked at allport do you need to talk to her allport shrugged sooner or later but it doesnt have to be this minute we can talk to her this afternoon or tomorrow unless you think you might have some information we need miz corbeau i dont know i dont know i dont know you better go on home well have somebody call you this afternoon get some rest lucas said the woo woman she said that the guy she saw in the hall looked like the vendingmachine guy allports forehead wrinkled she didnt say anything about that to us shes a little drunk lucas said the vendingmachine guy lucas said this way and took jael toward the door halfway down she stopped suddenly and said i have to make the arrangements not now lucas said theres nothing you can do here a funeral call somebody from your house if you dont have a funeral director i can get you the name of a guy wholl take care of you lucas said oh god they started down the hall again did you call your folks lucas asked my mothers dead my father ill have to find him hes in australia or someplace right now at the first floor there was a short wide flight of steps down to the door and they could see a cop standing with his back to the glass lucas pushed through and the cop half turned and lucas heard somebody say thats her and thats davenport jael stopped and a knot of people in dark coats hurried toward them down the street two tv trucks a still photographer started ratcheting shots with an f and a tv cameraman was already shooting while another ran down the street towing a reporter on the end of a microphone cord lucas recognized the towed reporter as an old friend whod done a turn as a studio talkinghead and now was back on the street jael squared off against the cameras looked up at davenport waited for the second camera to come up smiled and said i just want to say go fuck yourselves to lucas wheres your car across the street he took her arm and they went left and the latearriving reporter followed lucas is he dead lucas turned his head and said this is st paul ask st paul yeah but they hurried across the street into the furniturestore parking lot the reporter trailing behind the camera on the end of her tether lucas stuffed jael in the drivers side and the reporter his friend followed him around the back of the car and said in a low tone answer one question he leaned toward her and said stick your microphone under your coat she did and he whispered plains dead he was shot to death a very bad scene you didnt get it from me in the car jael sat silently hunched staring straight ahead as they crossed the interstate hit a couple of red lights and then dropped down a ramp onto the roadway heading west toward minneapolis after a while she said honest to god whatd you say im sorry nothing honest to god i cant believe hes dead she looked at him you were one of the men who interviewed me i remember you yeah you look mean i kept thinking you were going to say something mean she said thanks i appreciate that ill write it in my book of memories she said im sorry if i offended you no its the scars she said she reached out and touched his neck a white scar that had resolved itself into a question mark howd that happen oh you know no youll have to tell me a little girl shot me lucas said a surgeon had to do a tracheotomy so i could breathe not a very good surgeon from the looks of the scar she did it with a jackknife lucas said shes a pretty good surgeon why did a little girl shoot you like really a little girl jael asked yeah really because she was in love with the guy who was abusing her and i was a chasing him she was trying to buy him time to get away did he get away no what about the girl another cop shot her she was killed really she looked at him for another minute and then asked what about the one on your face the scar a fishing leader snapped it out of a log and it buried itself in my face bet that hurt no not really it stung a little the real problem was i didnt do anything about it washed it with a can of coke pressed it with a shirt sleeve and kept fishing it didnt look that bad when i went to bed but when i woke up the next morning it was infected i made a lot of money with my scars jael said her voice had a distant quality as though she might be sliding into shock lucas glanced at her took in the scars again three distinct white lines that slashed across her face from the hairline on the left temple two of them crossed her nose and ended on her right cheek the other ran at a steeper angle missed the left wing of her nose crossed her lips and ended on the right side of her chin they gave her face an odd look of discontinuity as though she were a piece of paper that had been torn and then scotchtaped together a little less than perfectly thats because uh i look terrific lots of little boys go home and jerk off when they think about them yeah you got them in a car accident lucas asked looking at him again howd you know i spent a few years in uniform ive done my share of car accidents looks like you hit the glass yeah was that when your mother no no she took pills she thought she had alzheimers and sleeping pills were a way out she didnt lucas asked no she just saw a program about it on tv and did a selfdiagnosis when she told people what she was going to do nobody believed her then she did it the joke was on them lucas said jesus a little later how can a cop afford a car like this are you on the take no no im rich really so am i i guess thats what they tell me the bank ill be even richer when i inherit from ammy youll inherit yup unless he changed his will when he got pissed at me about aliee i dont think he did a lot a few million jeez if you dont mind me asking whered you get it from my mom and dad when my dad was in college a long time ago he invented a new kind of ball for rollon deodorant lucas thought she was joking but she was solemn as ever no really the ball has to have some kind of surface thing that i dont know about to pick up an even coat of deodorant i mean they had rollons but they werent very good everybody was looking for a better ball the problem defeated the best minds of a generation until dad came along then he got rich and gave everybody trust funds and started smoking a lot of dope when mom died ammy and i got her part of the divorce settlement on top of our trusts and later howdyou get rich computers lucas said ah she said like everybody she was not in a condition to talk much about her brother halfway back she put her head down the heels of her hands in her eye sockets and began to sob lucas let her go and drove she stopped after a while and wiped her eyes god i cant believe it lucas dropped her at her house a man was sitting on the steps fiddling with the wheel on a bicycle don she said a friend he keeps hoping im going to sleep with him but im not going to its a country song lucas said she looked at him quickly and almost smiled youll call me if anything happens if they catch anybody yeah do you think this person i mean if its about aliee do you think her voice trailed away then her hand went to her mouth and she said oh she looked up and down the street what there used to be a lot of crack around here she said thats why all the houses have bars on the windows and big doors its going away now lucas said burned itself out i know but when there was a lot of crack the crack kids would try to break in all the time id hear them and id go yell at them from a window and theyd run away but somebody tried to break in the night before last i thought it might be crack but i thought it was weird too the guy didnt look like a crack kid he was too big he was she made a gesture porky lucas asked well i dont know if he was porky i was gonna say he looked sort of rednecky sort of why white i think so but i couldnt really see him but his clothes looked white lucas peered through the windshield at don the friend who was now standing up looking at them as they idled by the curb can you trust this guy don he wouldnt hurt a fly do you have anybody you can trust who would hurt a fly lucas asked why tell me a woman in your brothers building saw a man last night she said he was porky she saw him probably within a few minutes of the time your brother was killed you think i think we shouldnt take any chances the guy who killed your brother is a nut stick with don im gonna have a cop drop by and hang out with you howll know its really him the cop not a him its a her ask for her id her names marcy sherrill he looked at her i think youll probably like each other chapter thirteen lucas went to rose maries office the secretary waved him through and he found her talking to a slender man with a red beard and expensive black suit this is howard bennett hes a curator over at the walker art center rose marie said ive been there a few times lucas said inside rose marie asked suspiciously one eyebrow going up not actually inside lucas said when i was in uniform the guards would get us over there to chase people who were trying to you know fuck in the spoon bennett said the exact words i was looking for lucas said the walker center had a claes oldenberg sculpture of a spoon with a cherry fucking in the spoon was the twin cities equivalent of flying a cessna through the arch in st louis yeah well howard is an expert in photography he says amnon plains murder is gonna be a bigger deal than aliees i didnt quite say that bennett said but itll be bigger with a different crowd he smiled a thin marmotlike smile youll get press synergy a whole new even more weasellike element of the press will get on your case demanding action thats good rose marie said we werent getting enough attention she looked at lucas how bad was it bad i dont know what youre getting from st paul but i think its a different killer maybe somebody just taking the opportunity hoping well think that whoever did aliee and lansing also did plain but i dont think it was the same guy so it might not be directly related maybe not on the other hand it could be its possible that a couple of people have seen the killer they said he was porky and big and rednecky rose marie looked at lucas for a second then at bennett howard i really appreciate your telling me about plain can i call you bennett knew when he was being shuffled out he smiled his marmot smile again and said say hello to your friends in the legislature you can count on it rose marie said she followed him into the outer office shook hands then stepped back inside and closed the door you think it was tom olson she asked lucas the thought crossed my mind lucas said hes heavyset we know hes got a temper we know hes distraught we know that he might be a little bit of a nut or maybe a lot of a nut she said maybe the photo spread set him off ive never seen anything quite like it before not outside a mens magazine not ever in mens magazines it was a lot artier than that shit and decadent it had this weird endoftime feel to it that might have fed straight into his paranoia so whatre we going to do were doing some research on him and im going to put sherrill with jael corbeau somebody tried to break into her house the night before last and the guy was sorta porky okay sherrill for as long as she can stand it but when she needs a break i want somebody else with corbeau she doesnt get killed in minneapolis and we better get somebody with catherine kinsley too the problem is nobodys looking for trick lucas said dont worry about trick weve got to get albalah out theres gonna be a lawsuit and weve got to at least keep our heads up on that lucas said sure if you happen to stumble over trick thats fine but the priority has got to be aliee and keeping people alive this thing in st paul is almost like a good break we get some time to work without everybody breathing down our necks theyll all be back here tomorrow morning thats twentyfour hours back in his own office lucas called sherrill on her cell phone shed heard about plain and lucas told her to get with jael corbeau a bodyguard job she complained why cant you pull somebody in look its a highdanger point right now we dont have anybody to chase yet but somebody killed plain and somebody may be stalking jael i want you with her i dont want you looking like a cop i want you to girlaround with corbeau a little her brothers dead but if you could get her out in the open making arrangements for the funeral you mean like baitt sherrill asked not a word id choose lucas said hmm she was thinking about it that doesnt sound so bad when you put it that way maybe pull this guy right in yeah so get over there shes expecting you when he got off he walked down to homicide found frank lester and told him that the chief wanted somebody with kinsley might as well lester said since nobodys getting dogshit nothing at all nothing lucas called del i called your office a couple of times del said i think im gonna need a couple of search warrants what happened the other guy curtis logan is on vacation somewhere maybe vegas so i hung around james bee last night staying out of sight and at one point he hooked up with larry outer you remember outer vaguely wasnt he involved with that chicago bunch yeah i thought hed gone away but i followed bee down to this pie place on grand avenue and who does he hook up with but outer after a while they go out to outers car and they talk for a couple of minutes and then bee goes back to his own car outers car has illinois tags which i got and i tracked those and they gave me an apartment in evanston im willing to bet that outer is dealing with bee and if we stop him on some bullshit were gonna find some coke in his car and if we find some coke in his car even a little bit then we can probably get a search warrant for his apartment and if they find anything there thatd be three felonies in illinois and illinois is a threestrike state youre such a clever fuck not only that when i pulled outers sheet outa the ncic theres a misdemeanor warrant on him for skipping out on child support in cleveland he ditched some chick and her kid a vicious criminal a mad dog no doubt so we can take down outer without having to go through any perjury bullshit on a search warrant when we get him weve got him in an arm lock unless hes willing to have somebody kick his door in illinois so he gives us bee and we use that to get a warrant and we hit bees apartment and maybe his office and get a list and maybe that gets us back to aliee he rubbed his eyes convoluted as hell but its what we got and for logan we have to wait until he gets back from vegas unless outer can give us him along with bee so it all hangs on outer lucas said yup you have any idea where he is now in a motel in plymouth im standing outside a mcdonalds looking at his car freezing my ass off you been there all night weve been everywhere all night we got here about ten minutes ago which brings me to the question what are you doing up at this time of day amnon plain lucas said uhoh whatd he do you havent heard the radio he was shot to death last night wo shit over in st paul hes seriously dead after a moment of silence del said goddamnit yeah though it does add a certain fris son to the case a what frisson its a french word so get me some guys over here theres nobody to get lucas said everybody over here is already jumping through their ass so what are you doing del asked del was sitting in the front window of a mcdonalds eating a big mac out of a bag and watching the motel across the street hes got the blue olds he said when lucas slid into the booth across from him you get an okay on the warrant lucas nodded no problem its a little old the cleveland cops didnt know what i was talking about it took about fifteen minutes to find it if its still good its still good del said he was redeyed tired you look a little ragged lucas said im buzzed on caffeine im so buzzed i talked to the counter girl for ten minutes at a hundred miles an hour scared the shit out of her hmm the counter girl was keeping an eye on both of them lucas looked at the olds parked across the street nosein to a motel door everything looked so quiet but fifty times a year somewhere in the country a cop would kick a door off a nice quiet parking lot and the guy inside the room would shoot him so you want to do it yeah del wadded up the bag with half the burger still in it lets go they left one at a time and walked around behind the white castle so that if outer happened to be looking out his window he wouldnt see them crossing the street at the hotel office they showed the day manager the warrant and their badges he wanted to call the chain headquarters in rococco florida for instructions but they got the key to outers room and lucas told the manager to stay out of sight no matter what they said in rococco ill kick it if you do the key del told lucas on the way down i got so much caffeine i might miss the keyhole all right they stopped at the door listened a television was on that was good itd cover the noise of the key lucas held the key up and del stepped into kicking range when they were ready lucas hovered the key a quarterinch outside the lock the idea was to slip the key quickly into the lock and turn it and push the door when the door hit the chain if it did del would kick it they wouldnt try to sneak the key into the lock for the simple reason that it was almost impossible the slightest vibration would wake the dead if the dead was a nervous dopedealer with the quick openandkick you were usually inside before the target had time to react whether he heard it or not del nodded lucas got right then jammed the key and turned the knob and del kicked the door and exploded into the room lucas two feet behind him del screaming police police freeze outer was sitting on the toilet a wad of toilet paper in his hands his slacks down around his ankles the bathroom door was open hed been watching espn when del landed on the carpet opposite the bed his pistol pointing lucas backing him outer sat up raised his hands and then in a deafening silence said ah man can i wipe before they had him cuffed outer said i aint sayin shit i want an attorney sit on the bed del said outer sat and lucas started pulling apart outers duffle bag halfway into it he ran into a tshirt built like an ibeam he shook it out and found a smith wesson gun he said to del jeez thats too bad del said him being a convicted felon and all attorney outer said no dope lucas looked around the room he checked the bathroom but the toilet was the pressure kind with no tank he came back into the main room and del said he wouldnt leave it in the car outer relaxed and leaned back on the bed all i have is the gun which was for selfprotection and isnt even mine get off the bed lucas said what outer put on a perplexed look get off the fuckin bed del took him by the arm and outer said fuckin cops and lucas walked around to the door side of the bed crouched grabbed the mattress and flipped it off the box spring in the center of the box spring four ziploc bags of cocaine nestled in a line that aint mine you put it there outer said probably has our fingerprints all over the plastic then lucas said and when we get a blood test well probably test for cocaine attorney outer said sit in the chair lucas said del pushed outer down on an overstaffed chair and lucas sat on the box spring im gonna make you an offer i cant make it after you talk to an attorney i can only make it before we can fix it so you take a minimum plea on the dope and the gun three years thats what we can do attorney or we can call the illinois cops tell them where your apartment is tell them weve busted you as a bigtime dealer he looked at the ziploc bags and said to del i think we can call that bigtime when we talk to evanston i think so del said definitely bigtime he looked back at outer we can ask them to search your apartment if theres dope there if theres a gun there lucas spread his arms and shrugged well thats another felony and how many felonies you got in illinois larry two aw thats terrible illinois is a threestrike state right what a shame he leaned forward the mean smile crossing his face you know how long forever is its a long fucking time larry jesus we cant offer you this deal after you talk to an attorney because your attorney might call a friend of yours in illinois and the apartment might get cleaned del said if we dont make a deal right now were gonna have to make the call and get you an attorney of course outer put his head down youre fucks well you know larry that comes with our job sometimes del said thats why we sometimes offer deals to our favorite citizens to make ourselves feel better what do i gotta do weve got two names we know you know the guys because weve seen you with them we want a statement who james bee del said and curtis logan is that it outer said i flip on those guys and i walk well you walk out to stillwater for a couple lucas said but you can do a couple standing on your head and we wont call evanston until later outer seemed to brighten well shit if thats all i can do that outer said lucas and del looked at each other and then del looked at outer and said i knew we could be friends friends but i want something on paper before i talk outer said they called a squad and had outer transported to the jail with instructions that he didnt get a phone call without lucas being told you call i call evanston lucas said i bet we can get the evanston cops there before you can get it cleaned out del went over to the county attorneys office to find somebody who could help draw up the deal and somebody else who could get search warrants for james bee and curtis logan lucas walked up the stairs heading for his office but got hooked by a secretary theyre gonna show film from st paul theyre bringing somebody in what its on tv she said homicide had a tv and lucas stopped there a half dozen cops were gathered around the tube the st paul chief was saying no no no we just wanted to talk to him we dont have any indication that he had anything to do with the murder of mr plain who is it lucas asked brought in some vendingmachine guy one of the cops said and as he said it with the chief rambling on in the background a news clip came up two st paul cops escorting a man in blue coveralls into the front of the police station he was brownhaired slatfaced rawboned not porky lucas said he was supposed to be porky at his office he had a callme message from sherrill and a note from lane saying that the olson familyandfriends genealogy was complete and hed put it on a computer disk with lucass name on it in the chiefs secretarys outbasket he dialed sherrill i just kicked open a motel door and arrested a dealer he said what are you doing we just bought a casket sherrill said im creeped out you know the last time i was in here yeah dont think about it the last time shed been at the funeral home shed been buying a casket for her husband hows corbeau shes in the can by herself i checked i think you made an impression on her this morning and it wasnt fatherly sherrill said my personal feeling is that shes too young for you she cant be any younger than you are i was too young for you sherrill said i was much younger when we started going together lucas said than when we called it off bullshit you were rejuvenated sherrill said anyway were shopping and im on the lookout for maniacs st paul brought in a guy lucas said he told her about it and said i dont think its anything so what do i do stick with corbeau yeah if anything heats up ill call he was walking down the hall to the chiefs office to get the computer disk when lane returned he was walking fast an intent look on his face what lucas asked that genealogy excuse me i meant that fuckin genealogy i was getting everything i could on sandy lansings friends so i went by the hotel to see who she hung out with there everybody in the place was looking for derrick deal deal hes gone they havent seen him since he talked to you or about then they been calling his house nobody home huh so im not doing anything ill go knock on his door chapter fourteen derrick deal lived in a townhouse in roseville eight miles northeast of the minneapolis loop and off highway the townhouse a splitentry endunit with a tuckunder garage was one of twenty arranged around a pond full of canada geese lucas knocked on the door waited and got the hollow response that an empty house gives the garage door was locked so he walked around back there were windows on the side of the garage and the back door and he peered inside but couldnt see much a corner of the kitchen table from the back door and on the table what looked like a stack of bills and a checkbook the garage was empty he walked back around to the front noticed that the mail slot was open just a crack he pushed it the rest of the way and could see mail on the floor more than one days worth he thought no newspapers though he knocked again then went next door and knocked no answer from there either if you lived in a townhouse you worked maybe check back in the evening as he was leaving lucas cranked up his cell phone called dispatch and asked that they find deals license tag and put it out lucas the chief has been trying to get in touch with you the dispatcher said theres a meeting going on well its gonna start in ten minutes in her office she wants you to come ten minutes he said i might be a couple minutes late tell her as he ran the porsche out onto the interstate he glanced back toward the townhouses maybe he thought deal had gone to the same place as trick bentoin wherever that was but he didnt think so deals disappearance was a shadow across the day a huge detective named franklin was climbing the stairs toward the city halls main level when lucas caught up with him whats going on just getting a coke and an apple franklin said something going on meeting lucas said i was afraid another body had fallen out of a closet somewhere probably has but not here as far as i know franklin said lucas went on ahead the chiefs secretary nodded at the closed office door and said weve got a crowd aliees family and some friends youre supposed to go right in rose marie was barricaded behind her desk to her left dick milton the department pr guy perched on the edge of a folding chair his jaws tight eight people were arrayed in visitors chairs in front of the desk aliees parents tom olson unshaven apparently in the same clothes hed worn at the last visit and three other men and two women lucas didnt recognize lucas come in were just getting started rose marie glanced at one of the men lucas didnt know and added i guess were trying to get some ground rules going here everybody this is lucas davenport a deputy chief who often works as a kind of mmm key man in these kinds of investigations lucas you know mr and mrs olson and this is mr and mrs benton and mr and mrs packard the olsons best friends from burnt river who re down to help out and lester moore the editor of the burnt river newspaper moore was a gangly man with reddish hair and green watery eyes he wore wash pants that were an inch too short and showed a rind of pale skin between the top of his white socks and the cuff of the green pants im the ground rules problem he said affably the problem is rose marie said is that mr moore is also one of the olsons good friends the olsons both nodded at once as did the bentons and the packards they want him here but if we give him the confidential family briefing that is not available to all the press so will you use what we tell you in confidence lucas asked moore shook his head of course not im here as a friend not as a reporter we have our reporter down here right now and shell do our coverage milton piped up suppose you think your reporter is reading something wrong because of privileged information you happen to have well go with her story moore said the people of burnt river have the right to the information but not necessarily at this exact minute rose marie looked at lucas who shrugged so you trust him or not id say go ahead and trust him now and stop if something comes out after thinking about it for a second rose marie nodded all right mr moore stays with the understanding that what is said in this room stays in this room as rose marie briefed the group on what had been done in the past twentyfour hours and filled them in on the murder of amnon plain lucas watched tom olson olson sat squarely and solidly in his chair his chin down almost to his chest staring fixedly at rose marie as she spoke he really wasnt porky lucas thought although an observer at a distance might think so especially since pork was almost the default bodyshape for men in the upper midwest but olson looked hard he was barrelshaped and squarefaced but you could see the bones in his cheeks and at his wrists he looked like a farm mechanic somebody used to pushing around machines and maybe throwing bales the bentons and packards on the other hand had the pale round blandness of prosperous minnesotan smalltown people they were not quite blond but not quite brunette either they all spoke softly in rounded scandinavian vowels with perfect grammar and finished each others sentences they were lucas thought like two pairs of sugar cookies out of the same nonsexist malefemale cookiecutter tom olson was the one to speak when rose marie finished so what you just said is you didnt find out anything theres no new information thats not at all what i said rose marie snapped there was a lot of negative information we eliminated a lot of possibilities i will tell you mr olson and chief davenport will tell you the same thing that if you dont find the killer standing over the victim and arrest him on the spot then the elimination of possibilities is one of the most important things we do we will find the killer we know its going to take time oh horse shit olson said his mother looked at him and said thomas the older olson cleared his throat and said the funeral is the day after tomorrow if you can release aliee to us the me said he thought that was likely its done or will be in the next few minutes rose marie said olson continued when the funerals over lil and i are coming back with tom and the bentons and the packards when charlie doesnt have to work and wed like to stay for a week or two and hope you catch this guy but wed like to stay and see what you do thats no problem at all we can meet every day to keep you uptodate is amnon plains murder related directly to aliee lester moore asked we dont know rose marie said we have to treat it as though it is lucas jumped in i was at plains apartment whoever killed him planned it there was nothing impulsive about it the other murder had an ad hoc quality they feel different two separate killers tom olson said possibly they may be related they may even have been done by the same person but i personally think plain was killed by another person when you say person are you being politically correct or are you not sure whether the killer was a male or female lester moore asked im being politically correct lucas said we had a series of very cold executionstyle murders done by a woman just this past summer but thats very rare i think the killers male he may even have been seen well i hope you find him the elder olson said he looked at his wife and son and said lets go get aliee when the door closed lucas rose marie and milton sat in silence for a few seconds then rose marie asked did you see them on television no its like people get media training somewhere rose marie said in here mrs olson sits in her chair like a turtle on a rock but when you see her on tv shes the perfect mom shes as good as most of the professionals you see on the news shows every hair in place except the ones that shouldnt be shes perfectly distraught she personifies exactly what a distraught mother should be like and the kid i wouldnt want to meet him in a dark alley if he was pissed at me milton said hes supposed to be some kind of holy guy but he said horse shit horses shit even around holy people lucas said besides added rose marie he was clinically correct that was a load of horse shit lester moore picked up on it too there were no secrets because we dont have any she brooded about that for a moment then said i think ive heard his name lester moore maybe when i was up on the hill milton shook his head its a famous name really rose marie was curious a guy named lester moore was killed in some place like tombstone or dodge city and was buried on boot hill his epitaph said something like here lies lester moore two shots from a no les no more really really rose marie said to lucas weve had some time now now theyre gonna start cooking us the press is when the funerals over with theyre all gonna come back here and we better have something besides horse shit lucas had three messages one from catrin that said please call before three one from del and a last one from sherrill he called sherrill first she answered the cell phone then said ill call you back in fifteen seconds in fifteen seconds his phone rang and sherrill said i think you better come down here and talk with jael why some kind of fatherfigure thing i think and all the scars you guys got she said and she sounded serious she wants to talk actually i think she wants to confess something to you she no no she didnt kill anyone sherrill said then why doesnt she confess it to you you got scars because shes not interested in me with you shes thinking it over women would much rather confess to a guy theyre thinking about sleeping with because they think that way they might have some control over him ah so when can you come down pretty goddamn quick but ive got a couple of calls to make see you in twenty minutes lane stuck his head in as lucas was hanging up im heading out to fargo why lucas punched in dels number because i was looking at tom olsons alibi for the night aliee was killed its loose and i need to talk to a guy out there and ive got all the genealogical shit you could ever ask for dels phone started ringing and lucas asked when will you be back tonight late or midmorning tomorrow del said hello and lucas lifted a hand to lane take off del asked what and lucas said i was talking to lane so whats happening with the deal and the warrants the warrants on bee and logan are in the works manny lanscolm is taking outers statement right now we could move in an hour call me lucas said make sure that the warrants specify computer files and disks he dialed catrins number the phone rang twice and catrin picked it up id like to talk again she said her voice was low tight anxious i know youre busy with the aliee thing but could we meet in st paul somewhere tomorrow sure i guess he gave her the name of a restaurant near st annes told her how to find it its got those oldfashioned high plastic booths he said we can talk jael he was looking forward to seeing her again sherrill met him at the door and said shes back in her studio as long as youre here im gonna run out and get a cheeseburger all right jael corbeau was sitting on a wooden stool wearing a clayspattered apron over jeans and a loose flannel shirt the sleeves rolled over her elbows she was turning a creamcolored jug let in her hands she looked up when lucas came in her eyes were rimmed in red her nose red and a little swollen she was still striking this thing is three thousand years old she said look how nice it is she handed him the jug let it was the size of a hand grenade with a soft porous surface whered you get it my mother gave it to me because of my name amnon got one too they come from israel the north part of the country the galilee i dont know israel he handed the jug let back you wanted to talk wheres marcy since i was here she went to get a bite lucas said okay so why dont we walk jael said i wouldnt mind getting out for a while did you bring your gun the last question came with a small hint of humor in her eyes and lucas nodded not only that but its got a hair trigger now i feel completely safe she said but as they stepped outside she said do you really think somebody might be trying to hurt me i dont know but theres no point in taking a chance im not sure id be missed that much maybe not but if you were killed the media would trash us thats what were trying to avoid she smiled now now i feel safe youve got a selfish motive for keeping me alive damn right they walked along for a while in the cold air and then jael asked whats the thinking on sandy lansing well shes kind of a mystery lucas said she wasnt a hotel executive and she had no family money but she had great clothes a nice apartment drove a porsche and apparently snorted a massive amount of cocaine which is not free of charge were trying to figure out where the money came from we thought maybe it was sex that she was taking care of rich people at browns but that seems unlikely now jael stopped and looked up at him her face sober its weird you know all the people at that party what oh just the way they all made the same excuses there was no dope they didnt see any they didnt know about any all so worried about their reputations just like me and really in my world a little dope is no big deal maybe in the back of their minds theyre worried about something a little more stark like jail lucas said rich people dont like jail they dont function well in that environment but they didnt tell you about sandy and i didnt tell you about sandy we were all busy thinking about aliee what a tragedy it was and just keeping your mouth shut about a little dope what about sandy but now he knew she was the dealer jael said half the people at the party bought dope from her anything you wanted she could get she was discreet she had to know you before she would sell to you you had to have a recommendation but she could get it did you ever buy from her a little heroin once or twice just little touches of it she said jesus christ jael that stuff is poison but it feels so nice it smooths you out lucas shook his head angrily and stalked off down the sidewalk she watched him go then hurried after him what thats so fuckin stupid what you just said it makes my goddamned head hurt then he stopped and faced her will you come in and amend your statement and say that sandy lansing was a dealer would i go to jail no theres nothing illegal about knowing that somebody deals bring your lawyer so you get all the words right but its important that we get it on paper so we can use the paper to pry information out of other people i knew something was going on with lansing but it was so hard to look in her direction when everybody was screaming about aliee did aliee get that shit from her yeah actually i wasnt there but i think sandy had a kit in her purse and i think shes the one who popped aliee you didnt find a syringe no nothing like that nothing but the tracks you didnt find sandys purse no well she had one pretty big a lot bigger than fashionable she had some stuff in it okay lucas said ill come make another statement but i wont turn in any of my friends or anybody else for that matter goddamnit i wont then you just might be covering for a killer lucas said impatiently its more important to me to protect my friends than to catch the killer catching the guy wont bring aliee or sandy back if i turn in my friends well i wont do that listen how about if i put a name on you and you tell me look heres what i want to know were ninetynine percent sure that sallance hanson knew that there were drugs all over the place i wont were not on the record here its just you and me but i dont want to go off on hanson if shes really naive but she cant be that naive can she jael kept her mouth shut lucas said so tell me can she be that naive you dont have to accuse her of anything but tell me that is sallance hanson naive youre getting me twisted around is she naive jael turned and started back toward her house her arms wrapped around her body as if the cold air had suddenly gotten to her over her shoulder she threw one word no lucas followed after her said tell me one more thing something that wont hurt anyone anymore did your brother buy from sandy lansing did he know her she slowed and let him catch up i dont know if he knew who she was or what she did maybe somebody might have told him but he didnt like dope hed get pissed when i used it he said he used it when he was young yeah he was precocious he used everything when he was a kid jael said then he went to new york and he met mapplethorpe just before he died and knowing mapplethorpe did something to plains brain mapplethorpe you mean the photographer yes completely decadent plain used to go on rants about how mapplethorpe had this good talent that never came to anything because he killed himself suicide no he died of aids but he was notorious for putting anything and everything into his body and into anybody elses body anyway plain got to see the end of that whole thing and he stopped using she snapped her fingers just like that he was going to live forever so lansing he didnt know her lucas said maybe knew her didnt buy from her okay thats what plain had told them does any of this help jael asked yeah we couldnt get any traction we couldnt figure out why anybody would kill either of these women or your brother for that matter dope was always a possibility but if sandy lansing was dealing then it becomes a serious possibility as they got back to her house lucas asked casually are you still using oh you know sometimes just a little pop itll kill you jael he liked her name it rolled smoothly off the tongue you gotta stop i need to get smoothed out sometimes jael said smoke a little grass stay away from the heroin not the same she said but she was amused again i should have been recording this a cop telling me to smoke a little grass grassll kill you too lucas said but not until youre eighty at the house they sat on the stoop and talked lucas trying to tug the conversation back to the party looking for another name another hint look im not going to tell you any more names she said if i thought it would really help i would but it wont a city car pulled to the curb and sherrill got out sherrill likes you a lot jael said he could feel her watching his face i like her a lot lucas said he half turned sherrill and i have a little history thats all over we werent good for each other she talks tough jael said she is tough tough as you sherrill was coming up to them lucas said maybe sherrill said hows it going her eyes slid from lucas to jael and jael stood up and said fine i better go call my lawyer though what did he whack you around or something were not that friendly yet jael said she went inside and when she was out of earshot sherrill asked what happened she says sandy lansing was the dealer she says lansing could get anything you want not like she was a housewife with a neighborhood connection you think somebody killed lansing for dope mmm i dont know about that but ill bet its tied in somehow lucas said somebody owed her too much and was afraid of what was gonna happen or blackmail maybe she was trying to squeeze one of her clients and he didnt like it who knows maybe she had a competitor in the crowd this is good sherrill said but you cant stop thinking about aliee if lansing was killed because she saw something with aliee then there could be a whole not her thing going on that we dont see yet i know that bothers me but i cant see any connection between lansing and amnon plain or lansing and jael plain has to be hooked into aliee or were completely off the track if its olson what were talking some kind of revenge trip for what happened to his sister taking out the sinners who led her into the pathways of evil sounds like a tv show everything in this case sounds like a tv show sherrill said you think we ought to start tracking him olson we oughta think about it sherrill said we got fifteen guys working on this case and most of them are standing around bullshitting with each other ill talk to lester lucas said he looked back at the house take jael down for the statement yeah im gonna take off at five though tom black is gonna pick up at five good keep her covered pretty interesting isnt she lucas leaned forward dropped his voice you know what id like to do get about three of them you know on a kingsized bed some really funky blonde lesbians stacked up around me this big davenportlesbo sandwich she put her hand on his chest and pushed so sad these erotic fantasies in ageing men three blondes in bed with lucas all that relish and one little weenie they were laughing together when jael came out he cant do it until three were supposed to meet him at his office and we can walk over to city hall she looked at lucas he didnt want me to do it i told him i wanted to lucas said goodbye and headed back downtown del was waiting ready to go kick doors we got a statement from outer but his lawyer about had a hernia he said the deal was a violation of everything sacred in the law whatd outer say not much but we got him cold on the dope so were good and ive got warrants for logans home and bees home and offices wheres the first one north oaks bees home del read out the address see you there in twenty minutes lucas said he still needed whatever information bee and logan had lansing may have been aliees dealer but she had also been the other victim whoeverd been supplying her that guy needed to be looked at james bee lived in a stonefronted ranchstyle house much like lucass own with frontage on a small dark lake lucas arrived as dels city car a minneapolis squad and a ramsey county sheriffs squad were turning up the long blacktopped driveway lucas followed them in through a scattering of big oaks their dead leaves gone a hard stiff brown color a narcotics cop named larry cohen got out of the passenger side of dels car the warrants in hand the minneapolis cops got with the to sheriffs deputies and headed for the door while del dropped back waiting for lucas this is a long goddamn way around yeah but if we can nail him down ill bet he knows his competitors the door was answered by a thin blonde woman in black spandex tights and a tshirt advertising the twin cities marathon lucas could hear her screeching at the cops and then one of the sheriffs deputies broke away and started running around the side of the house one of the minneapolis cops six feet behind him the other minneapolis cop was pushing inside his gun drawn now while the sheriffs deputy drew his gun and moved up next to a picture window and peeked through over his shoulder he yelled we got a runner lucas and del trotted toward the house drawing their weapons inside the minneapolis cop had the blonde lying on the floor face down she was screaming theres nobody else for gods sakes theres nobody else they took the house slowly five minutes to work through it when lucas came back up the basement stairs his pistol reholstered he found the woman sitting on the couch her hands cuffed behind her the second sheriffs deputy was standing over her we got him the deputy said there was no way he was gonna run away from rick he runs in marathons the blonde said so does rick the deputy said del came out of the back of the house and said were all clear office in the back lucas followed him to the office a paper rolodex sat on the back of the desk and del started going through it while lucas cranked up the computer the phone rang and lucas picked it up and said hello hey is this jim hes out back lucas said can i have him call you yeah tell him to call lonnie is this steve naw this is lucas okay whatever i need to talk to him pretty quick you got a number hes got it just in case yeah okay lucas copied down the phone number and said well get back to you thanks very nice del said he was looking at the rolodex hes gotta have two hundred names in here but nobody from the party list not so far but you know what ill bet you a buck that we find at least one if hes dealing highend there were a lot of highend dopers there the phone rang again and a womans voice said lucas the name startled him he didnt pick up on it right away yeah this is rose marie the woman said jesus i thought i was talking to a fuckin psychic or something she broke in listen i hate this but sherrills been shot lucas didnt understand for a minute what what del looked at him straightened sherrills been shot shes on her way to hennepin aw jesus christ is she bad shes bad shes bad im going he threw the phone back at the receiver and started running and del shouted what and lucas shouted back sherrills been shot you stay here take this fuck that larry can take it he was right behind lucas and together they ran through the front room and lucas shouted at cohen who was talking to the blonde larry you gotta take it sherrills been shot were going you know what to do on the sidewalk the sheriffs deputy wet up to his hips was pulling a handcuffed man up the lawn a short slender man with a dudes haircut and a small tight mouth the dude was soaked from head to foot the deputy said fell in the fuckin lake but lucas and del ran past him and piled into lucass porsche and they were gone streaking through the slow streets of north oaks past a soccer field and south toward minneapolis chapter fifteen lucas focused on driving blowing past cars on highway as del gave a running commentary on gaps in the traffic go left behind this red one move over left go go down the ramp and around the corner onto iw squeezing between an old bronco and a generic chevy pickup halfway back lucas said weve done this before that fuckin sherrill shes always got her face in it del said last time she goddamned near bled to death rose marie said its bad lucas groaned she said its bad a palefaced bloodspattered jael corbeau was standing in the hallway just inside the emergencyroom door with two uniformed cops when lucas and del burst in where is she lucas asked theyre operating jael said stepping toward him they rushed her right in lucas headed for the hall to the operating rooms rose marie was standing there with lester lester grabbed lucass arm and said slow down and rose marie said you cant see anything down there lucas lester added shes already under man theyve already got her asleep lucas slowed down realized del was right behind him how bad del asked and lucas asked is she gonna make it she was hit twice lester said once in the left arm once in the left side of her chest busted a lung she mightve died except that she rolled up on her left side they said she mightve drowned if she hadnt been on her side is she gonna make it lucas asked shes bad lester said but shes still alive if they get you here alive aw jesus lucas said he slumped against the wall closed his eyes jael he pushed away from the wall and headed back toward the entrance jael was still there what happened the words came out in a spate we were coming out of my house going downtown and this car came down the street and the window was open and marcy yelled at me and got her gun out and this man started shooting at us marcy shoved me down and then she fell down and the car kept going and when i looked at marcy she had blood all over her and i ran and called and then i came out and tried to stop the blood and when the ambulance got there i rode down here with her she got off a couple of rounds one of the uniform cops said jael nodded stepped toward lucas took his shirt in both hands she said to tell you this is all she said she said to tell you that she shot the car she said tell lucas i hit the car what kind of car you didnt get a license number no no i barely saw it cause she pushed me i went down you didnt see anything she closed her eyes still holding onto his shirt and then said it was dark long and dark lucas pressed long and dark what do you mean long and dark like a mercedesbenz or a cadillac no i dont think so she said it just looked long and dark american i dont know like those big cars from twenty years ago but i dont know what kind i dont know god lucas put an arm around her and gave her a squeeze you did good he said im amazed that you saw anything more cops came rolling in everybody was doing right they were looking at all long dark cars checking for bullet holes looping the neighborhood down there but jael lived within whistling distance of a halfdozen interstate onramps everybody was looking but without much hope another doctor arrived headed straight back vascular surgeon a nurse told them what does that mean lucas asked heart no telling she said one of the onsterile circulating nurses came out of the operating room on an errand and they trapped her i dont know she said shes alive theyre breathing her after an hour del said we cant do anything here all we can do is find out that she died if she dies so what do you suggest lucas was angry and scared his voice a croak i suggest we go find that fuckin olson and look at his car del said sherrill had been shot once before and nearly bled to death del had ridden with her from the shooting scene to the hospital in a helicopter squeezing the artery so hard that for weeks afterward sherrill had complained about the bruise the bullet hole is nothin shed said but that goddamn bruise where del squeezed me thats killing my ass we know what kind of car lucas asked dark blue volvo sedan and the olsons said theyre staying at the four winds thatd be a place to start ill drive lucas said the four winds was three blocks from the mall of america just south of the link of the beltway they spotted the volvo in the parking lot stopped behind it and got out to look the car was old and dark with patches of grey primer paint on the left front fender no bullet holes goddamnit that would have been easy del said then tom olson turned the corner of the motel carrying a sack of vendingmachine potato chips and a can of coke he saw them stopped and then stalked over what are you doing looking at your car lucas said why he set himself squarely and a halfstep too close lucas moved an inch closer yet and del moved a foot to the right because somebody in a long dark car just shot the police officer who was guarding jael corbeau olson was amazed and some of the grimness went out of his face he shuffled a step back you thought it was me id never is she dead no shes in the operating room lucas said since whoever is doing the shooting may be taking revenge for the death of your sister and since you drive an older dark car we thought we should take a look i didnt do it olson said if i were you id take a close look at those hell hounds that aliee hung out with theyre the crazy ones not me theyre the crazies you seem a little loosely wrapped yourself del said hed edged a few inches closer to olson to a spot that would allow him to hook the other man in the solar plexus only to a sinner olson said del tightened up easy dude lucas said where were you at fourtwenty this afternoon del asked olson looked at his watch well let me see i mustve still been at the mall mall of america ves they all turned and looked at it the mall looked like uncle scrooges money bin without the charm i spent a couple of hours walking around the place whatd you buy do you have any receipts del was pressing no i didnt buy anything olson said well a cinnamon roll i just walked around talk to anybody no not really in other words you couldnt find anybody to back up your story if you had to olson shrugged i dont think so i was just walking id never been in the place before its astonishing you know dont you our whole culture is dying something new is being born in places like that snake things yeah well now del shrugged whatre you going to do pray olson said there was nothing more to say and the need to know what was going on at the hospital was pressing on them lucas said lets get back and del nodded sorry about this del said to olson lucas had parked behind olsons car olson watched them get back in and then pushed through a set of glass doors to a stair lobby lucas rolled the porsche out of the parking lot i got a bad feeling about marcy he said with a dark hand on his heart del said they got her alive dude i got a bad feeling man at the end of the motel drive he slowed to let a car go took a right idled a hundred feet up the street to a traffic light and stopped this is the second time shes been hit hard you been hit just as hard i never took a shot in del interrupted his voice harsh what the fuck is this what the fuck is this he was looking out the passengerside window and lucas leaned forward to look past him tom olson was running toward them across the motel parking lot waving his arms they could see that he was shouting or screaming but were too far away to hear him there was a craziness in the way he ran a violent highkick fullback run as though he were fighting his way through invisible tacklers lucas stopped the car and both he and del stepped out as olson got closer the traffic light changed to green the driver of the lexus that had come up behind them touched his horn lucas shook his head at the driver and stepped between the lexus and the porsche heading toward olson olson was fifty yards away when he suddenly stopped leaned forward and put his hands on his knees as though hed run out of breath the lexus guy pushed open his car door and stepped out on the street the lexus was trapped behind the porsche with more cars behind the lexus the driver shouted move the car asshole and honked his horn again lucas shouted back police go around it the man leaned on the horn shouting unintelligibly then another car behind the lexus started as suddenly as hed stopped olson heaved himself upright and began running toward them again crossed out of the blacktopped parking lot onto a grassy verge as lucas and del stepped onto the grass from the other side then with the horns honking behind them olson ran to within a few feet of them stopped his eyes wide and anguished grabbed hair on both sides of his head above his ears opened his mouth said nothing his jaw working and then pitched facedown on the ground jesus christ del said a few of the horns stopped but one or two continued they could hear the lexus drivers voice again hey asshole asshole they crouched next to olson and lucas turned the unconscious mans face lifted an eyelid with a thumb olsons eyes had rolled up and lucas could see nothing but a pearly sliver of white hes breathing but hes out lucas said call del got his cell phone out and they both stood up over olsons crumpled form a halfdozen horns were going again and then the sudden brrrrp of a cop touching a siren a squad car rolled around in front of the porsche and the honking stopped lucas took his id out of his pocket and started toward the cop car as a bloomington cop got out of the near side another out of the far side of the car they kept lucass porsche between them lucas held his badge case above his head and shouted minneapolis police we need an ambulance and some help the cop behind the porsche turned to say something to the other cop and when lucas closed up he held out the badge case but the cop on the far side of the squad the taller of the two a sergeant said chief davenport whats going on we dont know we just talked to that guy at the motel and were leaving and all of a sudden he came running across the lot screaming at us and now hes had some sort of fit we need a paramedic right now and we need you guys to hang around could you hold on a minute sure he walked around to the lexus the driver had slid back inside but lucas grabbed the handle and jerked the door open the man was in his fifties redfaced watt led lucas said im a police officer we had a serious problem my inclination is to jerk your ugly stupid ass out of this car cuff you and send you downtown on a charge of interfering with a police officer a body cavity search would teach you the real meaning of the word asshole i just want to get going the man was furious unapologetic vbu had me blocked in im busy im in a goddamned hurry and youre screwing around with some asshole lucas said put your car in park it is in park lucas reached past him turned the key killed the engine sit here until i tell you you can go if you move you go to jail im in a fuckin hurry the man screamed lucas went back to the bloomington cops and explained what had happened with olson an ambulance siren started in the distance the traffic jam intensified as people leaving the mall stopped to gawk at the porsche and the police car and the man lying on the grass the thing is he was fine in the parking lot when we were talking to him lucas said then he headed back to his hotel room and a minute later here he came running after us now hes had whatever this is a fit a car was passing in the outside lane and a kid yelled did you shoot him maybe a stroke said the sergeant hes just out del said hes like somebody knocked him out i think we better go look at the motel lucas said could you guys stay here and handle the paramedics and traffic but send another car over to the motel yeah have somebody here in a minute he looked at the lexus whats the story on this guy lucas told him quickly and the sergeant nodded fuckhead well keep him around for a while thatd be good lucas said at least until hes cooled out he and del walked toward the hotel off the grass across the parking lot the desk clerk had come to the front window to watch the commotion at the curb lucas showed him the badge case and said we need the room number and a key for a guest named olson the clerk stepped behind the desk punched up a computer weve got two olsons a mr tom and a mr lynn olson give us both keys lucas said the clerk never hesitated he looked in a slotted drawer took out two keys and pushed them across the desk is there anything else i can do a bloomington police car is gonna be here in a minute lucas said send the cops up the olsons two rooms were adjacent up an interior stairway and down a long carpeted hall that smelled faintly of disinfectant and something else like wine or beer would something in his own room freak him out del asked as they counted the room numbers down the hall i was wondering that lucas said lets try his folks the elder olsons door came up first lucas knocked no answer knocked louder they listened then del shook his head and lucas put the key in the lock turned it and pushed no chain the door swung open and lucas stepped inside smelled the blood and urine lynn olson lay diagonally across the double bed closest to the door facedown fully clothed his head twisted strangely to the right away from them one arm was outstretched a chromed revolver lay on the floor under his hand his wife lay on the next bed rigidly straight down the middle shoeless but otherwise clothed she was faceup her head on a pillow a red gunshot wound showing at her temple oh fuck del said from behind him they moved slowly into the room both of them unconsciously pulling their weapons the room was actually a small suite with a sitting area off the main room the bathroom was in the back lucas checked quickly found it empty and went back to the main room del whod stayed back said gun by the bed lucas stepped toward lynn olson touched his cheek cold he was dead and had been dead for a while there was no question about lil olson they could see the spray from the gunshot wound on the far side of her head where the slug had exited lucas knelt next to the gun got his nose an inch away from it a ninemillimeter i dont think thats the gun that was used on plain he said that was a pretty big crater in the concrete i dont think a nine would do that and i cant see the thread aliee goes down so somebody kills plain i can see that revenge especially after that photo spread hes making a buck off aliees death and maybe some nut takes it the wrong way same thing with corbeau shes one of the sinners around aliee one of the muffdivers but the parents i dont see the parents lucas shook his head and from the hallway they heard a voice hello del went to the door poked his head out down here two new bloomington cops arrived a moment later one in his twenties the other graying heavier two dead lucas said were gonna need the crime lab big time and like right now the grayhaired one said i saw you on tv on the aliee thing is this more of that lucas nodded these are aliees parents the cop exhaled hooked his thumbs over his belt took another long look as though memorizing the scene gotta hand it to you he said as though it were lucass doing this is some weird shit he looked at his younger partner call it in lucas said i just thought of something im gonna have to i need lynn olsons billfold aw man i dont know the bloomington cop said crime scenes were not to be messed with yeah i know but i need it lucas stepped back inside the room looked around saw a plastic bag stuifed into an ice bucket got it and walked over to olsons body he could see the lump of the wallet in olsons back pocket carefully lifted the pocket flap gripped the wallet through the plastic bag and slipped it out with the wallet inside the bag he opened it found the drivers license in a creditcard slot and maneuvered it out could you call this in he asked the older cop ask them to run lynn olson dob he lives in burnt river minnesota we need cars registered to him bloomington came back in thirty seconds olson had three cars a new darkblue volvo a twoyearold ford explorer and a green pontiac gto you guys got it lucas told the bloomington cops we need to look for this car in the parking lot and to del come on on the way down the stairs del said marcys gonna make it lucas looked at him you didnt talk to anyone no man you bummed me out with that bad vibe but this was the vibe not marcy you were getting a vibe from this del you cant be smokin that shit while youre working yeah well watch shes good he seemed marginally more cheerful they found the olsons car in a minute the blue volvo much like tom olsons car but a decade newer lucas walked around to the passenger side squeezing between the volvo and a red chevy camaro he saw the bullet hole before he got to the door reached down and touched it hard to mistake either by sight or feel thats olympicquality shooting del said he knelt in the narrow space to look at the hole while lucas turned to look back up the parking lot three bloomington squad cars rounded the corner of the hotel one after another lights flashing like a shriners parade i better call rose marie he said i left my phone in the car del handed him the cell phone and he punched in rose maries number this is lucas he said how is she lucas listened del peering at him lucas took the phone away from his ear and told him shes still on the table shes okay del said but now he sounded uncertain lucas said to rose marie okay weve had a development down here chapter sixteen while del waited at the car lucas led the arriving bloomington cops up the stairs to the olsons room and then violated the crime scene again this time over the bloomington cops protests he took the olsons car keys off a dresser the keys are completely out of the scene he told them you wont get anything off the car keys but we need to look in their trunk yeah but the sergeant said uneasily it was all against his training look its okay ill take the responsibility lucas said but id appreciate it if you could come down and watch while we open the car the sergeant agreed to walk along lucas opened the car trunk found odd bits of traveling luggage a camera bag a halffull laundry bag two golf clubs and a couple of loose balls an open box of plastic garbage bags an empty cooler and under a purple minnesota vikings jacket a graymetal tool box looking for a big gun del asked if this is what it looks like if this is murdersuicide man itd make life easier lucas said he dipped into the box of garbage bags pulled one out ripped a couple of chunks out of it made mittens out of the chunks and opened the tool box the top of the box was a liftout tray with a socketwrench and sockets he lifted the tray out tools nothing he said del had taken the keys out of the truck to open the passengerside door i dont see anything del stood up but the hole in the door this could clean up marcy and probably plain revenge shootings either that or what what if lynn olson was trying to fuck his daughter and something happened he was drunk at the party and maybe lansing i dont know whered plain come into it lucas asked thinking it over maybe he saw something why wouldnt he tell us he said he didnt like them much the whole crowd around aliee i dont know del said they stayed at the motel for an hour watched the preliminary crimescene work and made arrangements for a statement for the bloomington cops you gotta do the gun right now lucas said as a crimescene tech crawled over the room it may be the gun used to shoot marcy sherrill well have it in a couple of hours no more the tech said have they taken a bullet out of her i dont know lucas called to ask and was told that both bullets that hit sherrill had done clean passth roughs another crime scene team was at jael corbeaus studio trying to recover a slug from what looked like a bullet hole in a wooden railing jael was still at the hospital a cluster of television camera trucks had appeared at a diner across the street bloomington was keeping them away from the motel and a bloomington cop had moved lucass porsche back into the lot as they left the motel lucas could see sudden movement among the cameramen the cameras going up on their shoulders were about to go on tv he said del dipped his head and stepped behind lucas at the car he kept his head down one hand over his face as they pulled out of the parking lot a tv truck pulled out behind them in pursuit lucas lost it on the interstate cutting through evening traffic like a shark theyd made the phone checks sherrill was still on the table shed taken a lot of blood but the prognosis had improved tom olson was asleep hed been disoriented at the hospital his body overcome with shock hed been sedated north of town at james bees house the cops had cleaned out the computers and the rolodex thered been one crossmatch between the rolodex and the names on the party list from silly hansons and a competent minneapolis cop named loring was running down the cross the cops at bees house also found three ounces of cocaine in a bedroom bee claimed it belonged to his wife the blonde who denied it they were both being transported to the county jail they still had the outstanding warrant for the second house but del shook his head everythings too heavy right how he said if we need it lets do it tomorrow lets go talk to bee maybe hell give us what we need lets stop at the hospital first yeah well i assumed that del said they werent allowed to look into the operating room and sherrill was still on the table jesus how longs it been lucas asked rose marie rose marie had taken an empty hospital room and was working two separate patient telephones she looked at her watch four hours how much more can they have to do i dont know what theyve done lucas look go away go do something like what he asked i dont care but this isnt good for you she looked at del you either del said so lets go talk to bee bee was with his lawyer lucas knocked on the door poked his head in wanted you to know were looking for some information and we might be able to talk i dont think so the lawyer said your search warrant is a piece of toilet paper au contraire del said that thing is a piece of gold your client here is going straight to jail and he wont be passing go bee looked troubled he said i dont think ive exactly got a problem for one thing it wasnt my cocaine it was connies but say i wanted to help connie what would you need to know were trying to find out who was running sandy lansing the woman killed with aliee maison she was dealing but she was retail were looking for the guy behind her bee shrugged let me talk to ralph here i dont know if i could help you even if i wanted to but let me talk to ralph talk to ralph lucas said and to ralph i understand youve been shootin beaver again ralph grinned and said shhh and bee said what ralph said i got a little beaver problem up at my cabin larry connell said about once an hour hed hear a highpowered rifle lucas said deer seasons coming up the lawyer said i need the practice and those fuckin beaver if they block up that creek its gonna flood my whole property goddamn rodents i hate them almost as much as i hate the dnr what beaver bee asked talk to you later lucas said you know what you dumb shits did bee said you took the one guy whod know about this for sure you took and put him in prison he hates your ass and he aint never gonna talk to you del said what and he and lucas looked at each other and then simultaneously said rashid albalah outside lucas said we gotta nail down that poker game if tricks gonna be anywhere thatd be it gimme two hours del said you going back to the hospital yeah turn on your cell phone okay no i wanna see you do it del said lucas took out the cell phone and turned it on del took out his punched a speeddial code and lucass phone buzzed satisfied keep it on del said i dont want to be kicking down the door of a highstakes game by myself lucas walked through the tunnel to the government center and took an elevator up to the county attorneys office randall towson was in conference lucas got him out into a hallway whats going on towson asked he was holding a printout of what looked like a financial spreadsheet have you talked to albalahs attorney about del bumping into trick bentoin not yet but i cant put it off much longer towson said could you call him now lucas asked and tell him that weve lost trick and cant do anything yet but were looking and that we might want to talk to albalah tomorrow makes us look retardedtowson said hell be calling the papers two minutes after he hangs up we really need to talk to albalah lucas said its the maison case he gave towson a quick explanation and towson said finally all right i gotta call him anyway ill do it right now you sure youll find bentoin no but dels heard that its a big game and that normally would be a magnet for the guy even if hes not there somebody else at the game might know where he is hows marcy im going over there now she was still on the table the last i heard listen shes gonna make it towson said he knew that lucas and marcy had had a relationship shes in good shape and once they get her on the table yeah well i hope shes gonna make it man at the hospital lucas nodded at a couple of loitering cops and headed straight for the desk a nurse saw him coming shook her head and said shes still not out but dr gunderson came out for a coke and said theyve got almost everything hooked up again it shouldnt be much longer shes doing okay the nurse equivocated shes doing as good as she could i understand she looked both ways as though worried she might be caught giving out unauthorized information yeah yeah i understand that the bullet hit her just below her breast and a couple of inches off the centerline so theres a lung problem and theyve got a problem with bone splinters from her ribs but theres no spinal involvement i think if theyve got the bleeding under control and if shes strong enough she should make it thats what i think but im not in there bless you lucas said shes pretty strong he headed down to the room that rose marie had commandeered and found her talking with frank lester anything new lester asked maybe the edge of something lucas said how about you and wheres jael you talk first lucas gave them a quick account of the raid on bees house bees suggestion that albalah might come up with the name and dels search for trick bentoin rose marie took it all in and said finally youre still about three levels away from the killer or maybe four or five lucas said wheres jael we had franklin take her back to her place to get some clothes were gonna ditch her someplace safe maybe over in hudson keep her covered she wants to talk to you again i think she blames herself for what happened to marcy good keep her out of the way lucas said whatd you get the police shrink angela harris had come in to talk with lester an hour earlier after shed heard about the death of aliees parents she doesnt think its a murdersuicide lester said she knows about the bullethole in the car door yeah but shes predicting that well find the killings werent murdersuicide she thinks that they were killed in revenge for the murder of aliee along with plain and along with the attempt on corbeau if thats what it was she thinks we need to take another very close look at tom olson shes talked to some guys who know him and hes apparently had some odd psychological episodes in the past that suggest he may have multiple personalities harris thinks one of the personalities is a psycho aw man thats too weird lucas said yeah but she says it explains what happened with the parents olson gets in psycho mode and starts eliminating people who he blames for killing aliee people who led her into her lifestyle with dope and lesbians and all that the tabloid pictures set him off the rouged nipples and all of that some kind of psychosexual trip with his sister so he goes after plain then he goes for corbeau because of this lesbian stuff thats been coming out he hits marcy instead but he was going for corbeau then he kills his parents the people who are really responsible for putting her in this life and we know he blames them for that then having killed them he wanders off in psychological exhaustion to the mall changes personalities this personality has no idea what the other personality did and then in that same personality comes back to the motel runs into you then goes up to his parents room and finds the bodies he conics running after you but in the shock he begins to disassociate disassociate fuck me i dont know lester said thats what she said he falls apart rose marie said somewhere his main personality knows what he did but cant handle it so his whole juryrigged persona starts falling to pieces he has what you saw some kind of fit lucas thought about it and then said hed have access to his fathers car if its not murdersuicide we thought about that what were doing right now is waiting for the crimescene guys and the me to finish down there if they say its a murdersuicide then we slow down a little if they say its not then we look at olson hes not going anyplace hes asleep in the hospital the paramedics said the shock really got on top of him all right lucas said and things are looking a little better for marcy rose marie nodded shes gonna make it lucas they all thought about that for a minute and lucas felt a finger of darkness the first premonition of the day but he didnt say anything he said theres a science thing that i picked up from the computer jocks i used to work with yeah lester asked vfeah if you have enough information to make a good prediction then youre probably getting a grip on the situation if harris is predicting that the olsons arent a murdersuicide despite appearances then maybe shes onto something you oughta talk to your girlfriend the nun rose marie said ill call her lucas said he hung around a while watching rose marie work the telephones lester went out and got a diet coke and brought one back for lucas they were talking about nothing waiting when lucass cell phone rang its del lucas said fumbling the phone out of his pocket but it wasnt del a surprised dispatcher said is this lucas its me i mean its my phone anyway how come youre answering the phone im running around whats going on im relaying a message from the maplewood cops they found that car you were looking for car yeah that uh i wrote the name derrick deal oh yeah from about ten years ago he looked at his watch six hours two more dead bodies one shot cop where was it in some executives reserved spot out in a m parking lot at m and he thought ohoh yes thats what they say they want to know what you want to do with it can you patch me through to the cop uh just a minute a few seconds later she came back i talked to them and the executive whose space it is has a cell phone in his pocket so you can call them directly hes standing right there with them the executives name was marx he sounded interested the cars been here since yesterday i finally called the cops the police to get it towed because i was getting angry about it and they say its on some kind of hit list yeah lemme talk to the cop the cop came up and when lucas identified himself said hey chief whats happening with the car lucas gave him a quick story and asked is there anything unusual about it yeah one thing you can see the keys on the floor of the drivers side a key ring they mightve fallen out when he got out and he locked it behind him nothing else nope the cars clean nothing else inside that we can see except some maps and a wall street journal on the floor of the back seat listen this has to do with the maison case and that car could be pretty important i wonder if i could get you to open the door and use the keys to pop the trunk jeez i dont know we dont carry the door openers anymore the cop said how about it you break the window its pretty important aw man id have to call in can i get back to you can i hold sure just take a second while the cop was calling in lucas said to lester im gonna start using this phone and then people are gonna start calling me on it and pretty soon ill be as crazy as the rest of you fuckers it feels kind of good after a while lester said people call you up you feel important pretty soon you start thinking about a beeper yeah in a pigs eye lucas said you just havent experienced it yet lester said the connectivity rush franklin leaned into the doorway and lucas and lester both looked up at him and lucas said i thought you were with jael corbeau shes right there franklin said pointing to his left talking to a nurse i can shoot the nurse if you want thats okay rose marie said franklin asked about marcy and rose marie began filling him in then the maplewood cop called back and said listen chief my chief wants to talk with you you got a number he can call hang on lucas said he handed the phone to lester and said give him your cellphone number lester read his number off then handed the phone back to lucas lucas could hear the maplewood cop repeating the number to somebody else and a second later lesters phone rang he handed it to lucas who said hello the maplewood chief asked if we bust this car are we gonna get sued theres a suspicion of foul play so we really dont want to move it just in case lucas said rolling his eyes at lester well take responsibility if the city wont ill pay for the window myself on your head the maplewood chief said and lucas could hear him talking in the background he put his own phone to his ear and the maplewood cop at m said okay were gonna bust it lucas said if you gotta pick up the keys use gloves just in case in his other ear the maplewood chief said take it easy and lucas said yeah thanks and handed the phone back to lester while the cop was saying we can leave the keys i can see a trunk latch from m lucas heard a crunch then a door and the maplewood cop said were popping the trunk and a moment later ah shit lester whod been looking at lucass face asked what and franklin and rose marie hearing the tone stopped talking and looked at lucas then the maplewood cop came back and said i hope this guy aint a friend of yours aw man lucas stood up what does it look like looks like somebody busted him in the head with a shovel hes way dead little guy maybe sixty long haircut for his age yeah you got him whats the deal lucas looked at rose marie and said we got another one i dont think its about aliee i think its about sandy lansing is this about maison the cop asked in his ear so where does aliees family fit in rose marie asked maybe tom olson is on a revenge trip but the first killings that started it off thats about lansing whore you talking to the maplewood cop asked to rose marie lucas said just a minute and into the phone ill be out there in a few minutes exactly wherere you at he made a mental note of the address and hung up can we avoid talking about deal lester asked to the media i dont think so the maplewood cops know were talking about aliee and you know words gonna get out weve had a cop shot and four killings in one day rose marie looked at lester and then franklin and back to lucas whatre we gonna do lucas left them found jael huddled next to the nurses station franklin standing by the outer door jael saw him and stood up and lucas said how are jael reached around his neck with both arms and put her head against his chest and hung on im coming apart she said after a while i cant do this chapter seventeen derrick deal was distinctly deceased the maplewood cop hadnt been lying when he said he looked like hed been hit with a shovel the cop played a flashlight over deals face the left side of his forehead and left eye socket had been crushed and another indentation followed the line of his eyebrows across the right side of his face deals right eyebrow looked like a steppedon millipede while his left one was gone entirely wasnt a shovel though lucas said looking at the body looks like he was hit with a chair you think so yeah i once went to a killing where this guy hit his old lady with a kitchen chair he said he thought it was gonna break like they do in the movies he might as well of hit her with a pipe her face looked just like this he pointed at the dent leading out the right side of deals face ill bet you it was an old wooden chair the other guy swung it by the back just like in the movies and hit him in the face with the edge of the seat one of the legs busted his brow ridge you might find a mark from the other leg on his neck or his chest ill tell the me the cop said i never seen a chairjob lucas stood around the melancholy scene until the me got there and convinced a crimescene guy to check deals pockets they found a wallet with ten dollars and eleven cents in change a withdrawal slip for twentyfive dollars from an atm and a small blackleather card case the case had a dozen cards from browns hotel no address book lucas asked i dont find one the crimescene cop said lucas took a last pensive look at the dead mans crushed face got in his car and started toward deals townhouse deal had known something lucas had seen it in his face when he went to talk with him but hadnt known what deal was lying about after lucas left him in the hotel deal probably had gone out looking for a little schmear a few bucks to meet the rent or whatever needed meeting but it wasnt nice to blackmail a killer who had nothing to lose now they had a connection deal had known the killer or had known how to make a connection to get to him they werent three steps away any more one step and theyd have him the maplewood cops had already opened deals townhouse the place was a melancholy collection of small cubicles an efficient space for sleeping eating and watching television he had no computer nor could they find an address book or rolodex there had to be one unless the killer had taken it lucas lingered at the house until he was sure there was no more to find then headed for browns hotel on the way he called the hospital theyd finished with marcy rose marie told him but she wasnt out of the operating room yet they were rigging her up for intensive care the doc thinks shes gonna make it rose marie said theyre gonna keep her under for a while though they dont want her popping anything loose a knot in lucass neck relaxed a notch good as long as theres no heart involvement it was lower than that lower than what we heard the slug went in below her breast at an outward angle so it came out almost on her side she mustve been turning sideways when it hit her what about the slug in the railing have they idd it yet they got it but its wrecked we wont be able to id the gun they can say its a magnum jacketed hollowpoint then its a different gun than the bloomington gun lucas said and if it was a murdersuicide whyd they bother to hide the big one at browns the goodlooking black woman was working behind the reception desk when she saw lucas come in she said a word to the woman working with her and slipped out lucas glanced at her name tag and remembered india she said we heard about derrick is it because you talked with him i dont know lucas said but i need to look at his desk i can get a search warrant or we can just go look can i ask the manager this time if you have to but i want to go down and stand by his cubicle while you ask lucas said ill go ask she said and im sorry but my job sure lucas went down to deals office space another man was sitting in a cubicle three down from deals working with an old mechanical adding machine he glanced at lucas and said can i help you waiting for the manager you the police yup the man leaned back from his chair he was deals age and like deal a little heavy balding with wiry black hair on his arms he locked his hands behind his head and said i dont know exactly what he was up to but he seemed a little shady he always had getrichquick deals you know anybody who bit lucas asked no not around here he did not exactly inspire confidence he was not that bad a guy though hey some of the best guys i know sell used cars theyve all got big deals cooking somewhere i like them but id never put my money with them the outer door opened and a tall man in a dark blue suit came through trailed by india the man had a beaked nose closeset waterygreen eyes and a black too black widows peak he resembled prince philip just a little and mustve known it because he had a red silk handkerchief peeking from his breast pocket he looked lucas up and down and before the manager had a chance to open his mouth lucas didnt like him youre the police as if he doubted it do you have identification he had a perfect round baritone english voice veah but you usually dont want to flash the old buzzer in a highclass joint like this lucas said looking around the room as if the ceiling tiles might turn hostile indias eyes cut sideways at him and the corners of her mouth twitched lucas flipped open his id held it in front of the managers eyes and said we can lay some paper on you if you want otherwise ill just take a quick gander at derricks desk well i dont think you need a search warrant were all anxious to help find out what happened with derrick the manager said he tilted his head back the better to peer down his nose hed reformed you know he was doing so well lucas shrugged so maybe it was an accident the manager lifted an eyebrow just one we heard he was found locked in a car trunk with his face smashed in lucas nodded judiciously maybe youre right probably wasnt an accident i never thought so myself he was getting tired of it so i can look around id like to leave a staff member with you prince philip tipped his head at india sure no problem when he was gone india giggled and asked whered you get that accent whered he get his lucas asked as they walked down to deals desk same place as gary grant really gary grant they were both born in bristol england yeah hed spotted an oldfashioned plastic rolodex on deals desk and this he touched the rolodex is what ive been looking for he found a name twothirds of the way through the rolodex he checked it twice terrance bloom he checked the printed partylist to confirm it then called lester at homicide im looking at derrick deals rolodex and i find the name terrance bloom and bloom is on the party list give me the address and phone number lester said lucas read them off the rolodex and lester rattling on some computer keys said hang on a sec im just bringing the screen up then yup thats him we gotta get on him lucas said this could be something hang on hang on lucas hung on for another moment listening to the computer keys at the other end of the line then lester again hes not on lansings phone list shit well that could be deliberate if hes her guy she probably wouldnt need it and he wouldnt want her carrying it yeah but listen put somebody good on it this is the first hint weve had absolutely did you hear about marcy i mean going into intensive care yeah thats the last i heard same with me shes gonna make it if theres any goddamn justice in the world talk to you later lucas spent fifteen minutes with india going through deals computer but deal apparently didnt use email and lucas couldnt find any data files there had to be some but they could be on a removable disk he closed the computer down stuck a handwritten note that said dont use minneapolis police on the monitor screen and said im sending a computer guy over here to take a look at this thing dont let anybody touch it okay ill tell philip she said whos he the manager honesttogod philip del called when lucas was on the way back to the hospital i got the game started last night continues until five am tomorrow twentyfive grand to get in that was good they had blooms name now but there was no guarantee that bloom was their guy they still needed trick and albalah where at pat kelly remember him yeah wheres he at now bought a place down on the south end right on minnehaha creek hes got a brandnew twostorey fully heated triple garage in his back yard the word is its upstairs in the garage going on now lucas asked yup want to meet me absolutely lets get uh whats franklin doing hes still with corbeau del said how about loring i saw him early today so hes probably off but hes always up for overtime give him a ring ill meet you at pasties in an hour rose marie had gone home but a night nurse at the hospital let lucas look in on marcy she was halfpropped up in a bed a breathing tube in her nose more tubes in her arms wires scrambled around the top of the bed running to monitors she smelled of disinfectant and something else corruption or cut flesh lucas knew the odor but had never been able to put a name to it he sat down on a chair next to the bed watched her breathe for five minutes then said we got a couple of things going couple of leads youre gonna make it we talked to the docs but you gotta keep sleeping for now maybe she could understand it somewhere down in her brain he backed out of the room and turned and nearly ran over a woman whod been standing by the door lucas she said and showed a tiny smile weather his heart thumped that hardly ever happened any more now three times in three days with catrin with jael corbeau i was just marcy you know i heard i was coming down to take a look weather said she was a small woman with wide athletic shoulders and a slightly crooked nose that might have been just a shade too large her eyes were dark blue and her short hair just touched with white shed be thirtyeight lucas thought and god she looked good i talked to hirschfeld he did the surgery and he said shes got a good chance she was pretty torn up when she first came in and he was worried but they got it together she was hit hard another nut case lucas they keep coming she was a surgeon she saw the victims especially the children four times a year about lucas said crimes down burglarys down rapes down robberys down even murders down except for nut cases everybodys getting too old for crime she said everybodys got a job lucas said jobs cure everything and cracks going away she looked up at him and asked whatre we talking about i dont know want a cup of coffee ive gotta go im running down south ive got a door to kick down lucas said now she did smile lucas so see you around huh he didnt say anything for a few seconds then really if youve got the time sometime anytime he said anytime but now i just gotta i just gotta go he backed away from her as hed backed out of the room backed up almost to the outer door then turned and pushed through behind him weathers smile softened shed heard him talking to marcy in that few seconds she thought something had changed maybe lucas drove south through town replaying the talk with weather played it once played it again what she looked like what she sounded like shed once owned a dress that she planned to wear for her wedding to lucas that hadnt happened the relationship had dissolved in blood in the very hospital where theyd talked where marcy had gone under the knife another nut case whod died for his efforts weather karkinnen shed wanted kids two or three pasties was an allnight greasy spoon off lyndale avenue when it first opened it sold indigestible meat pies but now it was all fried bacon fried sausage and fried hamburger with home fries or french fries and catsup and suspiciouslooking pecan pie lettuce was not in demand the coffee was mediocre on the other hand it was open all night had racks of free papers inside the front door and nobody cared if a customer spent an hour drinking a cup of coffee del was deep in conversation with the counterman when lucas showed up he broke off the conversation and they took a booth and the counterman followed him over with a plastic carafe of coffee and two cups the counterman was tubercularly thin with round john lennon glasses and shaggy hair he was rolling an unlit unfiltered cigarette between his dry lips anyway thats what happened he told del he shook his head shoulda known better he said he only wanted to stay a couple of days ill tell you what those accordion guys are sneakier than they look del said some of that music is pretty damn romantic the blue skirt waltz you know that one and you know women like to dance i wouldnt have no more suspected him than i wouldve suspected a a banjo player or something coulda been worse del said yeah how she couldve run off with one of the eagles the bartender didnt laugh he shook his head and shuffled back to the counter del looked at lucas and said love problems lucas didnt want to hear that he said did you find loring yeah hell be here any time did you stop at the hospital she looks like shit del her skins the color of a piece of paper shes gonna make it del said she had about a million units of blood it was running out of her as fast as they could put it in look they stopped the bleeding right thats most of it with that kind of wound stop the bleeding yeah suddenly lucas felt tired he hadnt gotten much sleep since hed left his cabin three days before and now it jumped him and he felt greasy he thought literally greasy like he needed to shower right now he took a sip of the coffee it lived up to its billing mediocre this isnt fun anymore was it ever of course it is lucas said when all we had was aliee and lansing all the goddamn media pouring in all the attention everybody running around that was kind of fun id pick a different word fuck it it was fun you were enjoying yourself del so was i so were the mayor and rose marie right up to when marcy was shot yeah well they were talking aimlessly pointlessly when loring came in loring was a very large man nature had given him square teeth and a naturally mean expression he was wearing a black raincoat over jeans and brown pennyloafers he got a coffee cup from the counterman slid in next to del poured a cup of coffee and stirred in a couple of ounces of sugar pat kelly lucas said yeah hes got that threestall garage hes been doing a game or two every month supposed to be a nice layout loring said you been inside lucas asked no but i heard about it theres a back door then some stairs and a door at the top of the stairs theres a toilet up there and a refrigerator and a coke machine full of cold drinks and beer big table kelly deals security depends i asked but the guy i asked said he didnt see any loring said that was small stakes two or three grand if dels right about this one and they got seven guys playing then theres a hundred and seventyfive thousand in cash on the table so probably security dont want to go walking into some asshole with an ak del said he yawned and poured out the last of the coffee kellys too smart for that loring said his security would be good hate bad security del said some goddamned workoutfag with a baseball hat and a gun thats why i wanted loring lucas said we can stand behind him i thought it was my brains and it was my body all the time loring said pat kellys house was on a narrow treelined street where the cheapest hovel went for a halfmillion dollars his house was shingled with cedar the cedar had turned old and dark over the years one yellow light was visible through the frontroom curtains a lamp with a white shade and fringe a double driveway led toward the back where a hulking garage peeked out from behind the house the garage had been built in the same style as the house but the shingles were paler redder new the only light near the garage was on the houses back porch a yellow light the kind thats supposed to discourage insects they parked their cars down the street hooked up and walked toward the drive no light in the garage lucas said made that way loring said no windows you drive by it looks like anything but a casino looks like a rich dudes house del said they turned up the drive shouldertoshoulder and unconsciously began spreading out and each of them touched his own hip as they walked feeling for the tender comfort of a gun they were passing the house when a voice in the dark called can we help you gentlemen police officers lucas said toward the voice how many was we no way to tell were looking for a particular player do you have some id lucas still couldnt spot the voice he could feel del edging further away from him on one side loring idling away on the other an inch at a time so they wouldnt all get taken down with a single burst a little stress he grinned and held up his cardcase lucas davenport he said and friends the voice spoke softly into a cell phone lucas thought and two minutes later a side door opened on the garage pat kelly stepped out a thin whitehaired man wearing a white dress shirt open at the throat he looked tentatively down the driveway and said davenport yeah me and loring and del jesus like old home week whats going on you got trick bentoin up there whats he done you got him lucas asked well so well just run up and get him lucas said youre gonna scare the shit out of my guests kelly said were just a bunch of friends yeah yeah yeah lucas said impatiently look you heard this lady cop got shot this afternoon yeah whats that got to do with trick something lucas said so were gonna go up why dont i just ask him to step down nah if people knew exactly what was going on they might start running were gonna have to go up pat i guess its up to you how we do it kelly shook his head hey if you wanna go up youre the cops they found seven guys sitting around an empty greenbaize table on a beige carpet there was no money in sight no chips no cards an air of innocence smudged with cigar smoke a television in the corner was tuned to espn trick bentoins chair was turned toward the tv with the exception of trick the guys were all beefy and everyone of them wore a dress shirt suit jackets and sport coats hung off the back of plain wooden chairs trick was thin and looked a little like a cowboy in a cigarette ad trick lucas said you gotta cash out we need you downtown me he was surprised the other six players looked at him yeah its that rashid albalah thing lucas said man were right in the middle of sports sports what del asked sports talk sorry thats the radio del said and the only goddamn place you ever watched sports was a book in las vegas come on along what if i told you i was on a roll trick asked you could just ask the guys to wait until you get back loring said one of the guys grunted huh and a couple of them grinned sorry we need you lucas said he looked at the other men other than the single grunt none of them had said a single word or had met his eyes and said well wait at the bottom of the stairs pat kelly followed them down that was relatively civilized he said this is a nice place lucas said but dont push it i never push kelly said genially never ever trick bentoin appeared a minute later pulling on a rumpled jacket shook his head and said down four i thought you were on a roll lucas said i was id been down nine another two hours id of owned their asses each and every one he looked at the three cops and said well im not gonna run whatre we doing we need to haul your ass out to stillwater tomorrow for a little discussion with rashid albalah vbu couldve called trick said i wouldve come in couldnt find you didnt even know you were at the game for sure and if wed called and youd found it inconvenient lucas let his voice trail away so youre gonna put me in the fuckin jail trick asked well lucas said we dont want to take a chance thats such a pain in the ass ill get some psycho up all night screaming i need some sleep i gotta spare bedroom loring said if you really wont run i wont run trick said you guys know me better than that lucas thought about it for a minute then said all right lets do that then we wont have any bullshit either checking him in you want me to bring him over to your place loring ask im up early tomorrow ill be down at the office about eight lets meet there lucas said ill make some calls tonight and get the interview set up del said ill be there too ill come out to stillwater with you marcys gonna be okay loring said yeah i just dont want any early calls tomorrow lucas said no goddamn early calls chapter eighteen tuesday fourth day of the case as beaten up as he was he hadnt been able to sleep hadnt been able to drive marcy out of his head or weather or catrin and jael corbeau was there in a corner watching he even thought about standing in the barnyard with mrs clay the night he delivered the fishing boat and what mightve happened with their lives in other circumstances and he thought about the olsons dead together in the hotel and their son running toward the highway pulling his hair out to the sides of his head as though trying to pull a devil out of his skull he hadnt been able to sleep but somehow must have for a while he might have been asleep he thought when the alarm went off and shook him out of bed it was one of those nights when he couldnt tell whether he was awake or only dreaming that he was awake the dreams punctuated by the liquid green light from the clock as he touched it at two three four and five oclock he didnt remember touching it at six and now at seven the alarm went marcy he called the hospital and identified himself she was still listed as critical in intensive care still alive still asleep he stood in the shower for ten minutes slowly waking up drove out to a super america store for a shot of coffee rolled into the parking ramp a few minutes after eight loring was waiting in homicide with trick bentoin del called hes on the way loring said he says to turn on your cell phone yeah yeah del looked as beatup as lucas felt grinned when he arrived said well you look like shit and lucas said so thats two of us del asked have you been to the hospital no i called shes still asleep lets go over for a minute del said you can get more facetoface they walked over in the cold morning breathing steam into the air the streets were crowded with cheerful goingtowork people not long lucas thought before thanksgiving and then christmas christmas coming del said picking up the thought at the hospital they got almost nothing from the nurses because the nurses knew almost nothing lets go see if weathers in lucas suggested yeah dell looked at him curiously weather couldnt look at lucas not last year anyway had something changed yeah come on weather was in the womens locker room a nurse went in and got her and she came out in her scrubs and booties she said lo del youre looking like you look a little tired thanks del said drily lucas asked you talk to any of your pals about marcy we cant get anything downstairs her blood pressures a little funky weather said it could be shock but hirschfelds afraid she mightve sprung a leak theyre watching her lucas panicked sprung a leak what does that mean sprung a leak weather touched his hand lucas it can happen as messed up as she was itd be a miracle if they did everything perfectly if its a leak its not huge shes just a little funky jesus christ weather weather said to del youre gonna have to watch our boy here theres nothing he can do about this but hes going into full lucas mode lucas was still shook when they left and del was more curious than ever youve been talking to weather bumped into her last night first time wed talked forever she seems different del ventured the unfinished part of the thought was like she didn t hate you anymore time passes lucas said on the way out to the prison they talked tactics with trick according to your brilliant plan trick said i sit on my ass until you tell me to walk then i come in yeah but when you come in you come in shining like the fuckin sun del said shining like the fuckin sun for albalah trick said in disgust if that cocksucker died this afternoon wed have to go over to the cathedral and light candles in thanksgiving you a catholic lucas asked fuck no bentoin said fuckin beadrattlin genuflectin ringkissin assholes men lucas are catholic del observed since you got a frenchy name you figured wrong bentoin said so what are you bentoin looked out the car window at the cornfield going by and said sourly an excatholic lucas started laughing and then del for the first time since marcy was shot the interview room was painted an indefinite pastel color as though the painters had a bunch of pastels but not enough of anything so they poured them altogether and came up with a limeycreamrosebaby blue which resolved itself into a pastel sludge albalahs lawyer a pretty good threecushionbilliards player named laziard was sitting on a bench with his briefcase by his left foot reading a pamphlet about items forbidden as gifts to inmates he looked up when lucas came in with del my my a deputy chief laziard said you must be a little worried hey del we figure youre gonna sue us for a billion dollars lucas said you got the number right laziard said genially as lucas and del chose spots on the benches so we thought we should show a little concern just in case we find trick again lucas said just in case a wrinkle appeared on laziards forehead i thought del had him del shrugged i talked to him but i didnt arrest him i didnt have anything to arrest him on he told me he was checked into the days inn down on the strip and when i snuck out and checked he was but the next day when we went down to pick him up hed checked out we just missed him lucas said the problem is he mightve gone back to panama the guys in the county attorneys office dont want to hear any of this del saw him shit they want to see trick what are you telling me laziard demanded what the door opened in the back wall and they all turned rashid albalah stepped into the room a guard a step behind him albalah was a shavedhead black man with a heavy face and twoday beard he glowered at lucas gave a few seconds of hate to del the guard pointed him at a bench albalah sat down and asked laziard how much longer were trying to figure that out laziard said what whatre you trying to figure out albalahs voice was rising get me the fuck outa here theres a problem lucas said trick went away and the county attorneys office is being a stickinthemud about it they want to actually see his ass before they do anything im sure well find him sooner or later sooner or fuckin later albalah shouted i packed my shit this morning im ready to go right now motherfucker this is not going well del muttered to lucas what whatd you say albalah was getting angrier the guard snapped cool down albalah looked at him and the guard took a halfstep forward and set his feet just cool down keep your place albalah sagged on the bench i packed my shit he said to lucas youre supposed to get me the fuck out of here i packed my shit up man were doing what we can del said im the guy who brought the whole thing up you know lucas jumped in i didnt actually come out here myself to talk about cutting you loose i actually came out with a question he looked at laziard a question for your client a question you know about the aliee maison case lucas said to albalah there was another woman killed the same night the same place yeah yeah i been seeing it on my tv albalah said this woman sandy lansing she was dealing but she was just the street hookup we dont know who was running her wed like to find out and we thought you might know you know all that shit albalah shook his head fuck you all right lucas stood up i figured there wasnt much chance when you gonna get me out of here albalah asked soon as we find trick weve got some staffing problems with this aliee thing but we can probably spring a guy on it you know halftime anyway as soon as the aliee thing is done with if trick hasnt gone back to panama or something i mean ill bet youre out by spring summer at the latest albalah almost got up this time and the guard stepped away from the wall spring fuckin spring lucas shrugged its this goddamn aliee thing we cant catch a break were working on it richie rodriguez albalah said his lawyer said stop but albalah continued the bitch was run by richie rodriguez who gots a place in woodbury he gotta a whole bunch of apartment buildings or some shit del looked at lucas and said theres a richard rodriguez on the party list thats him richard albalah said you call him dick if you want to piss him off goddamn it laziard said lucas looked at albalah and said thanks well push the trick bentoin thing we owe you you owe me and you gotta get me outa here im fuckin innocent albalah was pleading now ah well more or less lucas said he took a step toward the outer door following del laziard asked will i hear from you this afternoon before lucas could answer del whod opened the door said whoa he reached out and a second later pulled trick bentoin into the room by his shirt sleeve hi guys bentoin said shining like the fuckin sun you pricks laziard said albalah was stunned but after gaping at bentoin for a second he started to laugh and a minute later was laughing so hard that he had to lean on his attorney for support so hard that lucas del laziard and bentoin started to laugh and finally even the guard on the way back to town dels phone rang he answered listened for a second and said yeah hes right here he just hasnt turned his fuckin phone on he handed the phone to lucas its frank lester was calling with three pieces of news were rolling on this multiplepersonality idea the olsons were murdered dude the shrink called it mrs olsons head was on top of some blood spray from her old man and from the way the spray hit her face she was looking toward him when she was shot when her body was recovered she was looking straight up toward the ceiling so he was killed first lucas said absolutely but the gun was next to him all right lucas said what happened to that bloom guy we were checking out black checked him and isnt getting anyplace the guy seems really straight we got a better name lucas said a richard rodriguez hes on the list how good very good have you seen lane around there he should be back from fargo yeah hes here lester said get him on the rodriguez guy full bio well be back in half an hour see you then hows marcy lucas asked same i guess i checked this morning when i came in and nobodys said anything else halfhour lucas said things were beginning to move like watching the ice go off the river in spring nothing happening nothing happening and then boom breakup when they got back they walked trick over to the county attorneys office left him and headed back to city hall lane was waiting outside lucass office with a wad of paper in his hand he ion saw them coming and walked down the hall waving the paper hes our guy hes a dealer anyway moved here from detroit eleven years ago got busted a couple of times for vagrancy now he owns a bunch of small apartment buildings here and in st paul and out in washington county through a realestate investment company in miami lane was talking at a hundred miles and hour and they were swirling around each other in the hall looking at pieces of paper he lists himself as an apartment manager on his state tax returns i looked at the returns going all the way back and he showed up nine years ago at twentytwo thousand and now hes up to ninety but he never lists his ownership anywhere he doesnt have to goddamnit this looks good lucas said del nodded hiding the money but i wonder why hes still selling dope if hes got the apartments he pyramided them i think lane said he cant stop yet maybe hes got a pal at the bank who knows he has another income cause it looks like he bought the first apartment with a cash downpayment and nobody asked any questions then used the equity in that one to finance the next one paid on that a while then used the equity in the two of them to buy the third and then the equity in the three to buy another one and kept doing that until he got where he is now the total assessed value in twelve buildings is ninepointfive million and theyre really worth twelve or thirteen but his own money hes got maybe a million into them the rents dont cover the payments oh they cover them barely as long as he never has a vacancy lane said but youre never a hundred percent in apartments not for long anyway what hes doing is if somebody moves out he keeps paying the rent out of the dope money until he gets another tenant i bet hes getting a lot of his maintenance done on the underground economy paying in cash so the dope money is invisible it just goes away and he gets paid out of miami and nobody looks at that up here del said thats right said lane he files all of his taxes hes clean a few more years of this and he can sell the whole thing out pay some capital gains and hes a multimillionaire what happens if the dope stops lucas asked cant stop said lane he needs a hundred percent occupancy to pay his financing costs and the only way he can get a hundred percent is to pay the rents on the vacant apartments himself strange nobody noticed lucas said how they gonna notice lane asked lucas and del looked at each other thought about it for a moment then lucas shrugged i dont know i talked to some guys up at the assessors office and they dont know a way lane said and del said you know what it reminds me of the namiami entertainment porno houses namiami entertainment was a mobrelated company out of naples florida that bought three porno theaters around the twin cities the cities liked them because theyd agreed to business conditions that were more restrictive than the previous owners would agree to namiami had done away with the jerkoffbooth peep shows ended the sale of adult novelties had taken down outside advertising signs and though they still ran porno films in the theaters had generally blended into their neighborhoods theyd operated for years before the tax people got curious about how they managed to get seventy or eighty percent of theater capacity for their film showings a little investigation suggested that actual capacity was more like ten percent the theaters it turned out were the most excellent device for laundering large amounts of small bills so what we got lucas said is a dead woman who dealt dope to rich people shes killed at a party where her dopedealer boss happens to be and who claims he didnt know her nobody else seems to have a motive most people barely know her but one guy who does know her derrick deal all he has to do is think about it and he figures out who killed her he mustve known rodriguez and he did it without even knowing that rodriguez was at the party del said he didnt have our list right and derricks not above a little blackmail he tries it and gets himself killed for his trouble lucas said gotta be this guy lane said nothing else fits whatd he say when we talked to him says he got to the party late never saw aliee didnt know lansing got bored and left around two oclock lane said so he admits he was there pretty late yeah lets talk to sallance hanson about this lucas said to del lets go see marcy and then go see hanson see what she knows about rodriguez okay and to lane find this rodriguez dont approach him just spot him for us stay with him start tracking him lucas and del didnt get to hansons right away when they walked into the hospital a nurse saw them coming and cut them off theres been a problem theyve had to take officer sherrill back into the operating room what she looked at her watch about fifteen minutes ago they decided they had to go back in ah jesus lucas said how bad the nurse shook her head i dont know i know they were watching her blood pressure and they were worried about it dr hirschfeld made the call about a halfhour ago she was pretty strong when she went in though was she awake no how long will they be in there he looked down the hall toward the emergency operating theater theres no way to tell until shes fixed lucas looked at del i told you man i got a bad feeling del asked the nurse have you seen dr weather karkinnen around yes she was down asking about officer sherrill just a few minutes ago i think shes doing her morning rounds lets go lucas said they tracked her down in the surgery wards talking to the parents of a child whod had some reconstruction work after a car accident lucas stuck his head in the room and weather saw him and said ill be just a minute they waited in the hall listening to the murmur of voices lucas pacing until weather came out i dont think its too bad she said i think its that one leak they said she was pretty strong del said well weathers eyes slid away from lucas she was in a lot better physical condition than most people who come in aw man youre saying she wasnt that strong lucas this had to be done if theyd waited she would have gotten weaker and that would have been worse hirschfeld thought he had to go in now is she gonna make it weather nodded once quickly yes this time her eyes held on to his sallance hanson knew rodriguez only slightly hes quite a respected realestate investor but hes not part of the usual group the group that comes to my parties do you think hes the one who killed aliee were just doing a second round on everybody lucas lied he went back to rodriguez im curious about the investor part our preliminary workup showed him as an employee an apartment manager not an investor well like i said i dont know him that well but thats not the way he talks thats not the way he dresses either hes a coarse man but he has a nice taste in clothes so do you by the way she reached out folded back the lapel on lucass jacket read the label and asked whered you get this barneys really nice material you went to new york i have a friend there i visit sometimes lucas said he pushed the topic back to rodriguez why is he coarse what makes you think that hes just every once in a while something slips out hell say twat or something a lot of guys say twat you know when theyre looking for an effect or theyre trying to shock you or piss you off i even know one guy who tried to tell me it was a variation of twit lucas grinned he had to be a moron yes well yes but with richie ive heard overheard richard say it sort of casually like that was the word hed normally use in that place and if he said woman it was because he was trying to be polite hes a coarse man with a layer of politeness that he learned somewhere maybe a book or something do you know anything about his financial dealings no no nothing although every time i talked to him thats what he wanted to talk about he was always complaining about his tenants late with the rent or skipping out or whatever del chipped in you never saw him with sandy lansing i just dont remember you know lansing was dealing drugs she looked at del for a moment then at lucas then back to del look i know ive talked to my lawyer and he says telling you this is no crime i know some people at the party were using drugs and id heard that you could sometimes get something from sandy but i didnt want to slander a dead woman del leaned back on the couch he was wearing a black leather jacket jeans and a ragged thirtyyearold political tshirt on which the words lick dick in were barely legible he grinned showing his yellow teeth you oughta tell that to derrick deal derrick she was puzzled a guy we know del said hes in the icebox down at the morgue right up to that point i was trying to make nice with her lucas said when they were out on the sidewalk fuck the bitch shes one of those people wholl drive you to communism del said he scratched the side of his face he hadnt shaved for a couple of days after we see about marcy maybe you oughta talk to your friend bone not a bad idea lucas said but first he took out his cell phone turned it on and punched in a number lane answered yo this is lucas you find him ive seen him i took hendrix along hendrix interviewed him after the party hes got an office in st paul on the street level down from a skyway and we can see him in his office you can see him now no but i can see the door hes gotta come out im with him lets get some pictures of him we might want to take them around okay and if he gets closer to minneapolis call me ill leave the phone on im probably gonna want to look at him this afternoon wherever he is marcy was out of the operating room and back in the recovery room tom black was standing in the corridor outside the operating suite with a nurse when lucas and del walked in black stepped toward them she came through it okay they had a pretty good leak but they stopped it and everything else seems to be holding but shes not awake theyre keeping her asleep they want everything tying together before she wakes up and starts moving around they talked about that for a minute the way lucas had been tied down once when he got shot in the throat and hadnt been able to move his head for three days and about the pinkingshears incident when dels hips had been immobilized for two days then del said im gonna go see this gal over at the bca see if the states got anything on rodriguez whatre you gonna do lucas looked at his watch ive got a date god help me catrin was sitting in a back booth facing the door when lucas arrived he smiled when he saw her and she nodded and then paid a lot of attention to picking up a cup of coffee and taking a sip hey he slid into the booth on the opposite side and waved at a waitress i hope im not tearing your day apart she said shed dressed down this time in jeans and a cornflowerblue shirt that didnt seem to have a button a subtle outdoorsy peekaboo blouse i was watching the aliee thing on television and it seems like people are going crazy lucas nodded and tried to keep his eyes on her face its worse than ive ever seen it weve had some bad ones before but this is nuts are you making any progress or cant you tell me if we were making progress i might not be able to tell you but since we arent i can tell you we arent the waitress came by and they both ordered salads and coffee then they spent a couple of minutes in dragging chitchat until catrin said i called you up because youre the only person i can call up and talk to im in pretty bad shape you look terrific you even look happy more like anesthetized she said then she shook her head i shouldnt be here why not i cant even tell you that i mean i would tell you if i knew have a little trouble sleeping cant stop your head going around big dark dreams keeping you up she tilted her head to one side and looked at him curiously im not suffering from depression if thats what youre asking but you did huh i recognize the description yeah i had a friend with the problem we were worried about her she eventually got straightened out chemicals of course whatd you do i had this superstition about chemicals so i just waited until it went away i knew what was going on and i read about it and in most cases itll go away so i waited i hope to jesus it doesnt happen again but if it does ill do the chemicals im not going through it again good call she said but my problem its the good old midlife crisis lucas havent really had mine yet he said knowing you you probably wont not until youre about sixtyfive and realize that youre not married and you dont have any grandchildren and then youll wonder what happened i could have grandchildren lucas said a little truculently ive got a kid who you dont see much what are we talking about here he asked suddenly irritated maybe im dragging you into your midlife crisis with mine she said the waitress came with the salads and nobody said anything until she was gone and then catrin said way back when after i left you and you didnt call i called yeah twice if youd have called four times i wouldve come back the next time i saw you you were walking around with some skinny blonde with a terrific ass and these little bell bottoms and you stopped on a street corner and she tried to stick her tongue down to your tonsils now lucas blushed i dont even remember he said she maneuvered a lettuce leaf into her mouth and crunched on it watching him he pushed his salad bowl away and waited anyway she said about two days after i saw you with the blonde i met jack and we started dating and i liked him a lot and i liked his parents and they liked me and my parents were delighted he was one year away from his md so we just got married and he did his hitch in the army and then we went down to lake city and bought a house and had kids and dogs and sailboats and goddammit testing the word goddammit here i am twentyfive years later what happened to me i thought i was gonna have a movie but all ive ever been is the woman in the background of somebody elses movie she thought about that and poked her salad fork at lucas and said thats what were talking about metaphors the other day when we met i used that movie metaphor it just jumped up and i said it ive been thinking about it ever since whens my movie lucas sat looking at her for a long moment and catrin said say something and lucas sighed and said if i could only figure out a way to run for the door without freakin out the restaurant she sat back and didnt quite snarl at him youd run for the door catrin i know women who run businesses and make a zillion dollars a year and drive around in mercedes benzes and every night they go home and wonder what the hell happened how they could ve forgotten to have kids theyre fortyfive years old and have everything but kids and thats all they think about no kids then i meet people like you who have these great kids and theyre all messed up because theyre not running general mills shed wiped her mouth with a napkin and now tossed the napkin into the middle of her unfinished salad her eyes were bright and a little too wide and he started to remember her temper he thought ohoh and she said her voice rising a notch so all im going through is some kind of routine female bullshit that ill get over he shook his head no you see women thinking along these lines and about half the time it ends in disaster they walk on their old man and their kids and they get their freedom and they wind up living in a crummy apartment and selling cupcakes in the local foofoo dessert bar if you ask them if theyd go back they think a long time and most of them say theres no way to go back but if they could on some kind of negotiated terms they would what about the other half the ones who dont walk then they come to some kind of accommodation but im not sure how happy they ever are not having tried it so youre saying im fucked she said well youve got a problem youve got to think about it a long time she looked away and said im thinking about moving out i didnt tell you that the other day i wanted to impress you with how wonderful i was after all these years does your husband know lucas asked at some level maybe but he wouldnt want to think about it i mean he seems happy enough hes got all the prestige and his patients like him and hes delivered half the kids in town and weve got a sailing club and hes got a hunting shack across the river in wisconsin and all his buddies youve got friends too dont you housewives waiting for death three or four of them have actually taken off what happened to them theyre selling cupcakes in foofoo dessert bars she said and grinned at him not really one sells real estate and not very well one works in a decorating business and doesnt make much one went back to school and became a social worker and got a job in st paul and shes okay ones a waitress whos trying to paint and youd take pictures photographs maybe you think i couldnt i dont even know how youd go about it its not like id be broke like i said the other day weve got money so why dont you just go ahead and do what you want without walking just tell him look im gonna be busy for the next couple of years remind me to stop by once in a while cause hes in the way she said anything id do itd be a hobby wed have to go to london for shows and someplace for family medical conventions and id have to cook at thanksgiving and christmas for the kids and wed have to keep up with our friends i couldnt think i just need to think and what happens to jack you know what i think she looked at him steadily i think if we got divorced in january hed be married again by december vbuve got somebody in mind for the job lucas asked no he doesnt fool around but he needs a wife to hold him up and if i moved out there are plenty of women around town whod sign up as candidates lucas shook his head you know what i bet hed be devastated i bet he wouldnt be married in five years youd be a little hard to get over she smiled at him a sad smile thanks you gotta think about it lucas said probably the most important thing youve thought about since you got married or got pregnant i didnt think about those things i just did them she said so think about this she nodded lets get out of here outside on the sidewalk she said this whole conversation took a kind of unexpected turn it was more like therapy than anything youve thought about this more than i expected you would have i had a woman i wanted to marry and didnt she wouldnt im still not over it lucas said when i look around city hall or the county courthouse the place is full of wounded people i dont know what happened i dont remember this happening to our parents generation it probably did but they just never told us catrin said yeah lucas took a step back so think about it one of the things im thinking about she said is sleeping with you but ive got to decide whether to do it before i walk just to try it out to see if ive got anything left or just go ahead and walk out and sleep with you later lucas was offended like i dont have a say in it she regarded him for a minute then shook her head not much you already want to sleep with me if i really wanted to force it i could press up against you and youd get all kinds of catholic guilt and everything and youd go raving up and down the house waving your arms and then youd do it jesus im a piece of meat not that she said she reached out with an index finger and pushed against his chest youre just one of those guys who likes to sleep with women you need the comfort and youre not seeing anyone now so i could do it if i wanted to i just have to think he took another step back well let me know now she laughed and for a moment she looked like she was nineteen again i will from his car lucas used his cell phone to call his friend bone fifteen minutes later bones secretary pushed him past a panel of waiting middle managers in the bankers outer office bone was looking at two computer monitors at the same time he turned away from them when lucas came in and said sometimes i feel like ive got so much radiation going through my skull you could put a roll of film behind my head and get an xray they played pickup basketball twice a week bone had once been a suspect in a case lucas had worked now he was not only a friend but through his banker connections could get lucas useful financial information i got that stuff on your guy confidentially of course but there wasnt much would you loan him money bone leaned back there are two things you look at before you loan a guy money history and security he never had much security but boy his history is good too good no such thing as too good bone said it just cant be too bad what if you depend on a hundred percent tenancy in your apartment buildings to meet your financing and then make it is that too good he cant be doing that bone said he rocked forward and shuffled through the papers looked from one to another punched a few numbers into one of his computers and pushed a key then he said jeez thats a little tight isnt it hes greasing it with dope money lucas said ah what i need to know thisll never get to a second person past me would the guy whos making his loan know about this about the dope bone spun his chair around until his back was to lucas he was looking at a walnut bookcase full of financial manuals a few computer guides the complete works of joseph conrad and a tattered multivolume set of prousts remembrance of things past a copy of the oxford study bible was jammed sideways on top of the proust after a minute without turning back bone said hed have to know something but maybe not the dope lucas asked of the chair bone spun the chair around he had a lean wolflike face he grinned showing his teeth maybe not because theres another good possibility that bankers dont like to talk about the other possibility is he found a guy at the bank and either bribed him to okay the loan or kicked back part of the loan itself but whatever happened the bank guy would have to know i dont see how he could avoid it if his iqs over eighty bone said then i hope i havent screwed anybody here you might be reading about it lucas said this rodriguez bone was a smart guy he knew lucas wouldnt be on a routine errand aliee you might be reading about it lucas said again del called to suggest they meet in st paul lucas checked on marcy by phone then got his car and headed across the river rodriguezs office was in the windshuttle building hooked by skyway to galtier plaza lucas dumped the porsche in the galtier parking garage and found lane and del loitering in the skyway hes down there now talking to his secretary see the temps office look one window to the left the guy in the pink shirt thats him lane handed lucas a pair of miniature pentax binoculars and lucas looked down through the skyway windows at the man in the pink shirt rodriguez was ordinary at sixtwo or sixthree he had thinning brown hair and a gut he didnt look latino he looked like an everyday minnesota white guy he was intent on the secretarys computer screen he said something to her looked at a printer looked back at the computer tapped the screen then turned back to the printer as a piece of paper rolled out as he turned back and forth lucas got a good view of his face youre sure this is the guy this is the guy lane said he looks like a city councilman lucas turned to del whatd the bca say he had a fairly heavy juvenile record in detroit burglary mostly they think he was running dope early on just deliveries on his bike then got his nose into it he didnt do much in the way of sales then he just disappeared they never tried to find out where he went they were just happy he was gone they did some assessments on him when he was in juvenile care they say hes smart but as far as they can tell he never went to school after the fifth grade all right lucas said he handed the glasses back to lane and said you go home relax have a couple beers visit your girlfriend whatever but i want you back on this guy tomorrow morning at nine oclock wherever he is and you can plan to stay on him everyday all day until we take him down good lane nodded wherere you guys going lucas looked at del we better go talk to rose marie rose marie had just broken free of a press conference when lucas and del arrived they could see her through the glass door of her outer office waving her arms around as the receptionist shook her head in sympathy lucas pushed through the door rose marie nodded at them turned back toward the receptionist to finish what she was saying saw dels lick dick tshirt did a worried doubletake lost her thought and asked what we gotta talk inside her office with the door closed lucas said i think we got the aliee killer id say maybe eightyfive per cent rose marie looked from lucas to del and back to lucas and asked who a guy named rodriguez they laid it out for her at the end she said so we know who it is but we cant convict him thats pretty much it lucas admitted when you make the leaps you can convince yourself that hes the guy but a jury i dont think so one thing he doesnt look like a dopedealer he looks like a washingmachine salesman what if he isnt the guy we put together a case if we can put together a solid enough case to convince ourselves maybe well have a chance or maybe well stumble over something lucas said i mean we convicted rashid albalah and he didnt even do it so we brace the loan officer from the bank as soon as we do it hes gonna go out the back door make a phone call and rodriguez will know were on his ass del said good thought we ought to have rodriguez tapped lucas said if we can get him talking about it do we have enough for a tap rose marie asked probably lucas said we can get that going this afternoon the best thing that could happen to the county attorneys office is to have something to distract from the albalah story when it breaks if we can hang rodriguez for aliee albalah moves to page nine albalah has already broken rose marie said the county attorneys guys decided itd be better to get out there first with the news put some of their own spin on it still rose marie nodded ill get them started on a tap then rose marie laid out the situation with tom olson he was out of the hospital but was being tailed by relays of homicide and intelligence cops who would stay with him twentyfour hours a day aliees funeral had been delayed until the elder olsons bodies were released so they could all be buried together and that might be a while yet because the situation in the bloomington motel room was so complicated if olsons the guy the one whos going after everybody else in revenge for his sister we think he might go after jael corbeau again or the other woman catherine kinsley or that jax guy jax checked out rose marie said hes gone to new york but says hell be back for the funeral hes probably shopping for the right outfit to wear when he throws himself in her grave so were just watching lucas asked no weve had these family briefings every day and were going to continue them in fact olsons coming here in she looked at her watch about twentyfive minutes were going to try to point him at kinsley well talk a little about aliees relationship with her kinsley and her husband are going up north to their cabin which is way the hell out in the woods you cant even find them with a map well have a team at her house waiting if olson goes that way how about jael lucas asked we think hes less likely to try her because he tried once and she ran him off rose marie said but well have a team there too id appreciate it if youd stop by and talk to her shes scared and shed like to have you around all right lucas said and listen i know angela harris is a smart shrink but i saw olsons face when he came running across the grass to tell us about his folks and man i dont know about this multiplepersonality stuff but that was real that was so strong that if his personalities were gonna dissolve or whatever they do that would have happened right then i mean ive never seen anything like it ever were keeping that in mind of course rose marie said but its what weve got right now so were set del asked stepping toward the door if everything went exactly right exactly right we could have both these guys in twentyfour hours rose marie said if the bank guy calls rodriguez if olson goes for kinsley theres gotta be at least one time in life when everything works del said one time bullshit lucas said out in the hall when they were away from rose marie he added she says theyre keeping in mind that it might be somebody else but theyre not they just put all their chips on olson and we put all of ours on rodriguez del said yeah but theres a major difference lucas said whats that were right they might not be chapter nineteen del went off to coordinate with the county attorneys office on the wiretaps and the subpoena for rodriguezs bank records lucas went down to the homicide office and spent an hour looking over the typescript of the rodriguez interview and talked to frank lester and sloan about the multiplepersonality idea everything i know about it i learned from tv sloan said but you gotta admit the guy looks good hes got motive he had access to the shooting car he could get close enough to take his parents out when he came running after us after he found the bodies he looked like his head was trying to explode lucas said he was trying to pull the hair out of the sides of his head ive never seen anything like it then he dropped in his tracks could be psychological pressure from the other personality lester said or maybe hes just goofy what we saw was real he wasnt faking anything if his other personality killed his parents the personality we saw didnt know it lucas said lucas left the city hall as the streetlights were coming on fifteen minutes later he slid to the curb at jael corbeaus house and headed up the walk every room inside the house was lit everything outside was dark including the front porch when lucas reached for the doorbell a voice from the corner of the porch said go on in chief who is that he asked he didnt turn his head jimmy smith from dope you cold lucas asked still speaking at the door panel nah im wearing my deerhunting camies excellent lucas pushed through the door into the living room where he met another dope cop alex hutton who stood to one side with a hammerless in his right hand he slipped it away when he saw lucass face and said franklin and jael are upstairs cooking franklin cooks it seemed unlikely hes teaching her how to make oneminute meals you know for during football commercials the guy has talent lucas said hutton took a step closer dropped his voice and said i dont know where this chick has been for the first part of my life but she is hot i thought you were married with about nine kids lucas said dropping his voice too he added besides she sorta likes other girls i only got three kids and i think jael likes a little of everything hutton said glancing at the door that led into the back of the house and the kitchen if she wanted to bring another chick along i could handle that conceptually anyway except that your wife would stab you to death fuck my wife shes history im abandoning her i figure if i abandon a wife and three kids the papers will pass on the story you only get in trouble for five or more i forgot all about stakeouts lucas said the sexual fantasies and all that when youve got nothing to do as he walked up the stairs lucas could hear franklins gravelly voice he was saying all right hands clear of the counter hands clear jael im arranging the cheese sacks nope no good gotta be like you just threw them in the fridge lucas leaned in the kitchen door and a second later hutton came to stand behind him franklin and jael had their backs to them and jael was closing the refrigerator door franklin looked at his watch and asked ready ready five seconds four three two one go jael jerked the refrigerator open pulled out two sacks of grated cheese threw them at the kitchen counter snatched a plate out of the cupboard opened a bag of bluecorn nacho chips and spilled them on the plate too many chips too many chips franklin warned she grabbed a handful of them off the plate threw them back in the bag quickly arranged the others on the plate and franklin said fifteen seconds jael opened the two bags of cheese working frantically spread a small handful from one bag over the plate of chips opened the other spread another small handful and asked is that good youre looking good but youre a few seconds behind franklin said gotta keep rolling she picked up the plate and pushed it into the microwave said one minute pressed a series of buttons and the microwave started to hum then she went back to the refrigerator grabbed a jar of salsa popped the top got a spoon and dumped three large spoonfuls into a small glass dessert bowl glanced at the microwave timer put the top back on the salsa jar stuck it in the refrigerator and wrapped up the top of one of the cheese bags while watching the timer then she reached out not too soon not too soon franklin said jael jabbed a button popped open the microwave door thrust the salsa bowl inside slammed the door and pushed the resume button might be too much time franklin said no i think were okay jael said working quickly she wrapped up the top of the second cheese bag put both cheese bags back into the refrigerator took out two beers stepped back to the microwave said three seconds there was a popping sound then another franklin said shit i told you there goes the salsa the microwave beeped and jael opened the door and looked inside the interior was spattered with little gobbets of salsa ill get it later she said classic line franklin said with approval she pulled out the dish full of chips and the bowl of salsa turned to the cooking island saw lucas for the first time put the chips on the butcherblock top and said time franklin looked at his watch one minute twentynine seconds if you add ten seconds going and coming you couldve missed a pass play i dont think i can cut much time she said you just dont have the moves worked out yet franklin said you lost time with the chips arranging them you lost time getting the salsa out and now you gotta go back and clean the microwave jael looked at lucas and asked did you know that if you heat up salsa too fast the onions pop like popcorn everybody knows that he said as franklin turned around franklin seemed mildly embarrassed ive been cooking seriously for half of my life and i didnt know that she said even the idea of heating it up seemed pretty brutal gotta have it about mediumwarm a little better than room temperature hutton chipped in you want boilinghot cheese on the chips mediumwarm salsa very cold beer you want that range do all men know this she asked all three of them nodded and said at once of course the house originally had four bedrooms and a full bathroom upstairs jael had wiped out the bottom floor as a studio had rebuilt a kitchen upstairs in what had been the master bedroom the other three shed turned into a snug little living room dining room a small library office and her own bedroom the space was carefully assembled and connected and lucas felt comfortable theyd chatted with franklin and hutton for a few minutes eating the nachos with melted cheese i can feel my heart clogging up this stuff is absolute shit jael said and then jael said to lucas lets go talk as she stepped past him she caught his wrist in her hand and led him out of the room hutton raised an eyebrow in the living room lucas sprawled on a couch while jael settled back in an oversized chair lucas said great chair and jael said all guys dont really know about that nachocheese thing youre right theres probably some raggedyass cowboy out on a ranch in north dakota somewhere who doesnt have either a tv or a microwave she said it really wasnt bad if you eat that stuff three days in a row youll be as big as franklin franklin completely filled an average doorway in fact franklin used to be about your size she nodded getting rid of the topic i went to see marcy a couple of hours ago i just missed you shes hanging on lucas said his face going grim but shes harder than goddamn nails if anybody can make it back shes the one i feel you know guilt i guess dont he said this has nothing to do with you really it has something to do with a nut and some asshole who killed aliee and sandy lansing i cant get plains body she said but i finally found dad hes on st paul island which is about as far from here as you can get and still be on earth itll take him a few days to get here how is he lucas asked devastated id like to get the thing done with ill see about it lucas promised this thing with plain when did that end a year ago a year i thought it might be more recent the way he acted time was not a big deal with plain everything was right now he could read a history book about rome and get angry about the roman empire tell me about aliee lucas said was there anybody that she talked about anybody who might be a little over the edge are you questioning me but she smiled and when she did her tornpaper face was beautiful tough and vulnerable at once no no of course not and if you want to talk about something else thats fine but i start brooding about this kind of stuff vbu know why most people are freaked out by the idea of shoplifting if you get somebody killing several people hes either completely psychotic delusional nuts living in a different world listening to god or he thinks hes got a reason this guy were looking for he thinks hes got a reason so there should be some connection to aliee somewhere a connection her dad was weird he came onto me a couple of times i often thought he was a little wrong not a killer but he i think i dont know she lifted her hands to her temples his relationship to aliee and the other girls he tried to act paternal but he was always looking at them if you know what i mean yeah he was turned on vfeah and aliees mom wasnt much of a prize either my mom didnt care what i did for a living she thought the earth owed me one and let it go at that but lil was living through aliee and i think she knew about lynns interest in sex you think lynn might have abused aliee no nope i think aliee would have told me and i think i would have seen it in her the way she acted around her father no maybe it was just my expectations somebodys a dad you dont think of his standing around trying to get a shot at the asses of his daughters friends happens all the time lucas said ill do it for sure but he was creepy about it so no ideas i told you before i really think youve got to look at the people on the internet those people weve got somebody checking that a computer guy named anderson if you can think of anything specific along those lines call him but the thing is when he ran aliees name through alta vista he got matches were trying to narrow them down whats alta vista a search engine on the net you can look for names and so on okay well ill think about it you know all about her brother tom were looking into him lucas said hes an amazing guy from what she said is he nuts she didnt think so she thought he was holy jael said how bright was she lucas asked mmm youve got to be smarter than average to make it as a model but not a lot smarter she wasnt intensely bright so why were you hanging out with her she smiled i thought everybody knew that they know you were sleeping with her but i thought there had to be a better reason there wasnt jael said she was deep into herself into feeling good into feeling thats what she did best and she spread it around she could make you discard everything else and feel good the sex was wonderful very intimate and very playful and very sexual i mean i cant really explain it to you because you dont know what im talking about and youre not in a position to find out did her appearance have anything to do with it and her being famous probably there was a whole package when you were with her you felt sexy and important and wicked and fun and shed make you forget everything else and just feel thats why she did those short pops it was another aspect of feeling for her so what about her boyfriend jax whatd he think about all this sleeping with other women she shrugged jax carried her bags and slept with her every once in a while hes basically a remora hes probably back in new york right now looking for somebody else he is you didnt like him its not that i just didnt care about him didnt even think about him when he was standing in front of me he made himself into what he is not my fault he wants to carry bags and hang out with pretty women and thats what he does sounds bad lucas said he doesnt think so they sat in silence for a moment then jael said you and marcy had a relationship for six weeks or so it was a little too intense she cocked her head why would you walk away from intensity other people go their whole lives without intensity they dream about it like i said this was a little too much we were headed for a disaster vbu mean like youd strangle her or something no but something was going to happen and wed wind up hating each other lucas said we didnt want to do that risk it shes still sort of hung up on you jael said you know what wouldve been fun for the three of us to go away you and me and marcy she said it so conversationally that lucas was neither embarrassed or surprised he said im a little too catholic for that marcy would be too if she was a catholic oh i dont think so jael said not marcy anyway i think she might be interested in the idea really shed said it with some certainty and now he was surprised he looked a question at her no no we werent playing we hardly had a chance to talk jael said but you can sort of pick out people who like to feel marcys one of us you mean a little gay lucas asked no thats not what i mean youre one of us i could tell from talking to you and the way you look at women i gotta stop talking about this lucas said sure she said it really makes me nervous thats the catholic part she said youve probably been fighting it all of your life maybe he said you know she said later im a little scared i know you should be the way plain was killed he probably never had a chance even to say anything the guy is nuts but hes not some great force we just havent been able to find him we will soon i hope i dont like being cooped up im thinking of heading out to new york as soon as i can get plain taken care of you could leave that to your father she shook her head dad couldnt handle it so new yorks an idea lucas said but you wouldnt have any protection i could stay in a hotel how could he find me something to think about lucas said downstairs as lucas was leaving hutton asked learn anything new it wasnt meant as a doubleentrendre but lucas turned it into one a little more than i wanted he said on the way home he called st annes and got elle on the line i know its cold but i could take you for an ice cream never too cold for an ice cream she said ill walk over meet you there the icecream shop was across the street from st annes and was recognized as the local nun hangout elle was sitting with three other nuns in a booth near the front of the shop when he walked in and she laughed and said something to one of the other women and then stood up and led the way toward the back a scene lucas thought virtually identical to millions that had taken place in bars that night if you took away the odor of spilled milk and of course the nuns get a break she asked and added i told jim to make you a chocolate malt thats fine weve got a couple of things working i think weve got an eye on the guy who killed aliee and weve boobytrapped everybody the second guy might be going after youre sure theres a second guy i think so and hes the guy whos bothering me the homicide people have a candidate tom olson ohhh no the thing is they have a theory lucas said the theory is the same kind of mental pressures that made him an ecstatic also made him a multiple personality and one of those personalities is a psychotic who made a run at jael corbeau but got chased off killed plain came back after jael corbeau but shot marcy instead and then killed his parents you say theory the malt came he took it shucked the straw and told her what they had the police shrink the prediction on the apparent double suicide at the end she was shaking her head i would love to talk to this man if you convict him and send him to the state hospital i will go see him multiple personalities are so rare theyre rarer than than supernovas he smiled at the comparison now if i knew how rare supernovas are on the basis of pure chance youd say that the chances of tom olson being a multiple personality are nil elle said just like your chances of winning the lottery but somebody will win the lottery so he could be i would really like to talk to him elle said if he is disassociating whatever that means whats going to happen hell break down he could go so far down that he essentially becomes vegetative and might not ever recover probably wouldnt hed probably die in a bed that bad that bad they made desultory small talk for a few minutes about her fall classes at the school about students developing a new interest in the old testament amnon and jael they knew who they were she said terrific he said then ive talked to weather a couple of times at the hospital her eyes shifted away quickly furtively and then back she knew about guile but she wasnt instinctively good at it she had to plan what he asked nothing elle god bless me what god bless me what i cant i dont really want to talk about weather she called you lucas said she called and asked about me elle wouldnt look at him i cant talk to you everything thats been said by everybody is in confidence aw man this could be a problem lucas said now she sat up why you dont have another relationship some things have come up lately lucas if you have any chance of recovering with weather youd be a moron not to take it oh boy he said mmmanohman after he left elle he went home turned out the lights and sat in the dark in the living room tried to make sense of the aliee case tried to make sense of his relationship with weather weather had become entangled in one of lucass cases and had been taken hostage by a crazy pecker wood killer on a revenge trip shed talked him into surrendering but lucas hadnt known that hed set up an ambush involving a police sniper whod fired a highpowered varmint bullet down a hospital corridor exploding the pecker wood head like a pumpkin the idea had been to get him out in the open to get his weapon pointed in some direction other than weathers head and then take him out the plan had worked to perfection except for one small item weather had been looking at lucas straining toward him full of a kind of strange goodwill toward her captor whod seemed to be not an entirely bad man that in one minute and in the next the mans brains were literally blown across her face with fragments of bone she was a surgeon and no stranger either to blood or death nor was she a sentimentalist but this was something else and when it was done shed been unable to talk to lucas shed known the trouble was a kind of psychological reflex a kind of phobia a mental tic but knowing it didnt help she drifted away went faster than that actually walked away hurried away didnt hate him nothing like that just couldnt deal with his nearness and the constantly played sound sight feel of the slug going through a mans brain three inches from her own but lucas thought time passes time passes he closed his eyes in the dark and saw the scarred face and teasing eyes of jael corbeau the slightly plump intense face of catrin the shoulders the toobig nose the feel of weather time passes but sometimes it beats the shit out of you as it goes chapter twenty wednesday the fifth day of aliee maison lucas checked on marcy black was slumped in a visitors chair and when he saw lucas got up he was a little shaky unshaven nothing happening but she started to wake up she went back down but they say she was close to the surface she should wake up today lucas looked in marcy had always been the most active person in the office always had something rolling something moving she didnt look right propped in the bed she looked thinner gaunt wasted he patted black on the shoulder and said take it easy the main offices of the atheneum state bank were off university avenue three blocks from the state capitol building in st paul in a redbrick building with four white wooden pillars out front the neighborhood started trending up when the porno movies moved out and the hookers had been pushed further west away from the state legislators the upward trend had stalled and now the whole strip had a shabby goingnowhere ambiance like a squashed paper cup outside a convenience store the taps on four of rodriguezs phones one home two business and a cell were in place along with taps on the home and cell phones used by bill spooner an assistant vicepresident in the commercial loans department lucas and del drove to the bank in a beatup city car trailed by an assistant county attorney named tim long from the parking lot lucas called rose marie rose marie who had been waiting for the call phoned the bank president and asked him to make time for a quick talk with lucas she got back to lucas and said hes waiting be a little careful hes one of those hailfellow types whos always ready to help a member of the legislature and never forgets when he has lucas said see if you can find spooners car del nodded crunch him he said lucas and long went inside spoke to the bank presidents secretary she went back into his office and popped out a minute later followed by the president himself already i just talked to rose marie a couple of minutes ago traffic was light lucas said the bank presidents name was reed he was a genial man overweight a patriotic panoply red face white hair blue eyes red tie white shirt blue suit an american flag in the corner with a plastic eagle atop the staff in gold when lucas outlined the general nature of their questions reed leaned back in his leather executive chair and said ive known bill since we were kids he was six years behind me at cretin his parents godblessem theyre both dead now used to play canasta with my parents theres never been anything wrong with any of his accounts hes one of our best loan officers i was godfather for his oldest son im sure theres nothing wrong now lucas said we just want to talk with him about mr rodriguez their personal relationship anything he might be able to tell us that could help us in our investigation i dont know that we could help much our financial records are confidential long interrupted mr reed we know about your confidentiality requirements and were just trying to handle this whole matter as discreetly as possible if you wish we can get a subpoena for your loan records and we can call a squad car and transport mr spooner to minneapolis for questioning we thought this would be better chief roux thought it would be better i appreciate that senator roux was a good friend reed said after a moment of silence and a thoughtful inspection of lucas he said lets go talk to billy and see what he has to say billy was a minnesota wasp fairhaired onceslight but now carrying a few too many pounds he was wearing a gray offtherack suit and black laceup shoes and he was guilty of something lucas thought his eyes went flat at the introductions and when they settled into their chairs and lucas explained what they wanted he said as far as i know richard rodriguez is entirely legitimate he has a perfect payment record thats out problem lucas said its a little too perfect from our review it appears that he needs a onehundredpercent residency rate to make his payments were wondering why you would give somebody a loan under those conditions a lot of small reasons and one big one spooner said the big one was he helped our minority loan level in our neighborhood we have to be sensitive to redlining issues and as a responsible hardworking intelligent minority person we decided we could go with him as long as the risk wasnt too great the first building he was interested in was for sale at such a good price that we could have loaned him almost all of the money even if he hadnt had a down payment but he did have a down payment not much but it was all of his savings and guaranteed that hed stay right on top of the business and he had the minority status of course that swung it after that with a lot of hard work he kept his record perfect and we were always ready to help when he wanted to expand his horizons so he got a great price on the original building long said what are the chances that he delivered part of the original purchase price to the seller under the table to drive down the apparent price i wouldnt know about that spooner said stiffly what are the chances that he uses dopedealing money to make up shortfalls in tenant rents lucas asked dope richard rodriguez i dont think so lucas leaned into spooners desk if we got a subpoena for your loan records and asked a state examiner to look them over you think hed say they met state loan standards absolutely the minority status alone would bring applause from the state banking department spooner leaned back and relaxed a hair the way a fence relaxes when he realizes that a cop doesnt really have anything on him lucas looked at long and shrugged long dipped into his briefcase found a paper and handed it to reed its a subpoena for your loan records reeds face turned a little redder i thought we were handling this on a friendly basis we wanted to lucas said but bill here is bullshitting us so were gonna have to see all the records im not bullshitting you spooner said youre bullshitting us billy yes you are lucas said and ill tell you what this case is part of the aliee maison murder investigation if rodriguez turns out to be involved because of his drugdealing and youre helping him cover up well then youre involved thats called murder one on the tv shows murder one in minnesota is a minimum of thirty years in a cell the size of your desk you look like you might be young enough to do the whole thirty wait wait wait spooner said i have absolutely nothing to do with any of this i want a lawyer right now those are the magic words long said to lucas no more questions and read him his rights when they were done with the reading of the rights reed agreed to print out the loan records and long walked out to the parking lot with lucas its the reading of the rights that scares the shit out of them he said lucas nodded the question is will spooner make a call he made the call long went back in the bank and lucas climbed in the passenger side of the city car hes driving the lexus in the corner del said lucas looked down at a silvertoned car nosed in next to a power transformer so hes spending some money hes a banker del said hes gotta have some kind of car to impress the neighbors del took the car to the end of the block and found a spot where they could see spooners car dels phone rang twenty minutes later and long came on im not going to make lunch ive got a thing ive got to do with a subpoena he said hes moving absolutely sweetheart long said del said hes moving and a minute later they spotted spooner pushing through the front door carrying his briefcase pulling on a thighlength black trench coat he went to the lexus tossed the briefcase across the front seat onto the passenger side and rolled out of the lot they followed a block behind a halfdozen cars between them past the capitol down the hill toward downtown st paul where del closed up and lucas eased down in the seat halfway through downtown spooner took the lexus into a parking ramp del pulled to the side shoved the gear shift into park said ill catch him at the skyway exit turn on your phone and jumped out when spooner was out of sight up the ramp lucas walked around the car and went looking for a parking meter del called ten minutes later got him hes at an attorneys office goddamnit so what do we do ill call you back in two minutes lucas said he punched the off button re dialled lanes cellphone number lane answered and lucas said wheres rodriguez in his office i can see his sleeve nothing going on a few things my feet hurt like hell ive got homicides interview notebook on the case and im reading all the interviews a nineyearold kid tried to sell me what i believe are counterfeit baseball cards and the st paul cops rousted me thats about it no trouble with st paul nah just checking on why id been standing in the skyway for two hours reading a notebook lane said okay our guys at an attorneys office hes about two blocks from you let me know if anything happens a mickey mantle rookie cards gotta be worth more than twenty doesnt it chump lucas redialed del rodriguez is at his office so so lets hang for a while give it an hour anyway twentyfive minutes into the hour del called hes moving where looks like the parking garage goddamnit stay with him if he heads to the car ill pick you up where you jumped out five minutes later del was back in the car lucas drove around to the parkinggarage exit and as they picked up spooner dels phone rang he took it out listened for a second said lucass phone is on now and then handed it to lucas im a fuckin secretary he said vbur boy made the call lester said yeah when six or seven minutes ago he was calling from a lawyers office yeah we took him there hes out and were on him again whatd he say sounded like he was reading out of a script he said mr rodriguez allegations have been made against you by the minneapolis police i will no longer be allowed to have any direct dealings with you on the mortgages on your buildings and i wanted to inform you that in the future your account will be handled by mrs ellen feldman then rodriguez said what are you talking about the police and then spooner said im not at liberty to discuss it but you can get more information from minneapolis deputy chief of police lucas davenport or mr tim long assistant hennepin county attorney then rodriguez said is this about the party and spooner says im really not at liberty to discuss it i suggest you call chief davenport or mr long im sorry this had to happen i felt we had an excellent working relationship i have to go now i hope this works out for the best then rodriguez says okay well thanks for everything you know and thats it thanks for everything lucas said he means the phone call pretty goddamn neat phone call too lester said he warns him but theres nothing in it to hang him with either one of them after lucas hung up they tracked spooner back to the bank he drove back slowly well within the speed limit when he was inside lucas said fuck him lets go see marcy weather was outside the intensivecare ward talking to tom black they saw lucas and del coming and weather smiled and del said something good happened what lucas asked as they came up shes somewhat awake everythings pretty much stabilized shes still critical but its looking pretty good for the first time lucas went to the ward window and looked in can we go in let me get a nurse they just took a guy in the nurse came said severely one minute say hello and out she gave them masks to hold over their faces and led the way in marcys eyelids were at halfmast when lucas del and black loomed beside her her eyes opened fractionally and after a moment the corners of her lips twitched sleeping on the job black said i aint signing off on the overtime youre still on the homicide payroll lucas said if you die can i have your gun del asked she tried to say something but lucas couldnt hear and he leaned forward her lips looked parched almost burnt what fuck all of you she whispered and she turned her head another fraction of an inch shes better lucas said delighted she says go fuck ourselves weather said i cant believe cops i never could the bullshit gets so deep she was smiling when she said it lucas squatted next to the bed speaking through the blue mask youre hurting he said but youre gonna make it were tracking the guy who shot you her head rolled away and her eyelids drooped again everybody out the nurse said in the hall lucas said she looked pretty good huh she looked pretty good pretty good black said i was amazed del said she took a fuckin man man she looked a lot better he hitched up his jeans and they all nodded at each other shes not out of the woods weather said keep that in mind its a long trip back on the way out the door with del lucas stopped said hang on a minute and went back inside weather was walking away back to the interior of the hospital hey weather she stopped waited he came up took a card out of his id case scribbled his cellphone number on the back of it and said keep an eye on her while youre here okay you know the docs better than any of us if anything changes ill call she said she took the card and lucas headed back out on the sidewalk del said what gave her my number in case anything happens with marcy lucas lied she could have gotten to him through the police switchboard and she had that number hed actually gone back because of a little subconscious twitch he went back to look at her ears she was wearing inky blue sapphire earrings onecarat stones he recognized them because hed given them to her he smiled on the way back to the office and del said our girls gonna be all right maybe he said back at the office lucas put in a call to louis mallard at the fbi in washington mallard had enough clout to extract anything from any government computer anywhere he agreed to find and send along everything available on rodriguezs miami company when he got off the phone with mallard lucas walked down to rose maries office need a meeting he said marcys awake i know shes gonna make it rose marie put a finger to her lips shhh dont hex her while they were waiting for the meeting to get together lane called i got bored and walked by rodriguezs office window he was working on the computer in his office how many people saw you the secretary maybe but i was disguised as a cool guy which for me takes no effort and i put a little shine on her through the window lane you fucking anyway rodriguez was signed on to etrade etrade yeah i bet hes scared and dumping stock like i was saying youre a fucking genius lucas called mallard back can you get into etrade records if i wanted to mallard said del came to the meeting along with frank lester towson the county attorney and long the assistant county attorney just back from the atheneum bank with a pile of paper no public relations people i wanted to make sure everybody knows what were doing lucas said were looking at this guy rodriguez and i will tell you this just based on feel and experience and a few things we know about him he killed aliee and sandy lansing vbure pretty sure towson said pretty sure lansing is dealing several kinds of dope to rich people and wannabes working for rodriguez rodriguez is at the party they have some kind of conflict and rodriguez kills her right there in the hallway maybe its even an accident the mes saying it looks like her head was smashed against a door jamb so rodriguez tried to stuff her in the closet and is surprised by aliee who was in the bedroom maybe aliee heard the noise of lansings head hitting the door jamb or maybe she just woke up at the wrong time anyway she sees something and rodriguez takes her out at this point he walks away maybe down the hall to the next room and goes out the window or maybe he just walks through the crowd and drifts away what do we have for sure towson asked we have the fact that rodriguez was a punk in detroit came here with no money and got rich fast we have a guy wholl tell us that hes a dope wholesaler and that sandy lansing worked for him selling dope i dont doubt that once we start working on that angle now that weve got his name that well be able to find a few other ties between them weve got rodriguez at the party weve got a guy derrick deal who knew lansing pretty well and thought she might be selling a little dope and he was a guy who would do a little blackmail if it looked profitable he almost certainly knew who her boss was because a day after i talked to him he was murdered in a way that was at least reminiscent of the way aliee and lansing were killed no passion just brutal efficiency i dont see how you tie deal to rodriguez rose marie said i dont directly what im saying is deal didnt know aliee so if he was going to blackmail somebody for murder it had to be somebody tied to lansing the only person at that party tied to lansing as far as we know was rodriguez long looked at towson wed need some kind of color chart or maybe a power point presentation to sell that to a jury towson shook his head were not at a jury yet we need more were just starting on the guy del said long leaned into the discussion i got all the paper from atheneum spooners boss was looking over my shoulder and you know what if we push the guy hell tell us the loans shouldnt have been made the goddamn things are dirty rodriguez was paying him off can we crack him towson asked i dont know hes sort of a nebbish but hes scared and if he keeps his mouth shut i mean hes got a lawyer and if he claims that the loans were on the upandup and keeps going back to this minority business and if rodriguez doesnt talk theres not much we can get him on well get some paper going on him lucas said if hes been paid off by rodriguez he might have an incometax problem towson said to long talk to the irs lester summarized the case against tom olson he had motive he had opportunity he had access to a car that we now know for sure was used in the marcy sherrill shooting how do you know that long asked we took the slug out of the car door it didnt penetrate the passenger compartment it wound up inside a plastic handle inside the door it came from marcys revolver long nodded okay but you havent found the that was used on marcy lucas said no thats a problem del said yup especially since hes been here and not back in fargo ever since the shooting we went through his motel room and his car after his parents were killed no gun the gun that was used to kill his parents belonged to his father it was his fathers car gun whered you get that lucas asked olson told us his father kept it under the frontseat cushion we ran the serial numbers traced it to a gun store up in burnt river lynn olson bought it six years ago you think he did his parents towson asked weve got this whole theory lester explained the multiplepersonality concept and explained the trap theyd set for olson the trap better work towson said because the multiplepersonality theory sounds like bullshit a secretary stuck her head in and said lucas youve got a call from the white house the group all looked at him and lucas said what the guy said hes with the white house he didnt sound like he was joking you better take it rose marie said lucas took it on the secretarys desk mallard said i bet that impressed everybody the switchboard lady told me you were in a meeting in the chiefs office it certainly impressed the shit out of me lucas said whats happening your boy rodriguez started selling out his accounts monday morning itll be a couple of days before he gets the checks but hes got a quartermillion in the mail goddamn lucas said ive only got one thing from miami rodriguez set up the miami company nine years ago the attorneys name is haynes and as far as the guys in the miami office know hes straight smalltime private office businessoriented guy does real estate that kind of stuff mallard youre a good egg lucas said ho ho very funny mallard said by the way you remember malone of course how is she shes fox trotting with somebody else mallard said uhoh gonna be number five could happen anyway well grind some more on rodriguez but i thought youd want to know he was collecting cash thats one more thingtowson said when lucas told them about mallards call and its a good one weve got to slow him down though so what do we do rose marie asked some lawyer shit del said looking at towson the irstowson said tell them about the dope maybe they can do something about the money hes got coming rose marie said so we push on rodriguez and we keep baiting olson everybody agree everybody nodded best we got lester said chapter twentyone del took a call from narcotics and headed that way lucas borrowed a uniformed cop from the patrol division put him in plainclothes and sent him to relieve lane on the phone to lane he said when he gets there i want you to brief him then go on over to the county attorneys office talk to tim long and look at all that loan paperwork on spooner spooners critical if he knows anything at all about rodriguez then he probably knows about everything if we crack him we may have enough how much paper lane asked about a ton lucas said goddamnit lucas how come im always the one stuck with paper cause you can read im not so sure about the other guys so get your ass over here also an fbi computer file just came in on rodriguez and his money ill print it out and leave it with lester take it with you see if theres anything that you know what shit i dont know correlates or something when he was done with lane he got out the phone book got the number for browns dialed and asked for india she came on the phone a minute later lucas identified himself and asked are you gonna be around for a few minutes until six i want to stop by he said when he got off the phone lucas walked down to homicide with the printedout fbi file left it with lester did you guys print those pictures of rodriguez uh yeah i think theyre down in id they handled it lucas went down to the identification division the photo guys name was harold mcneil a former uniform cop who got tired of cold squad cars and got the photo job by lying photography he said was a longtime hobby although he didnt know a smallformat camera from a yak he read a book called learn photography in a weekend fooled around with the departments cameras and after a week or so was better than the last guy and kept the job he had two good shots of rodriguez a fullfrontal head shot and one side view got some heads i can use in a spread lucas asked yup mcneil turned around opened the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet and took out a handful of photos they found sets front and back of a halfdozen guys lucas stuck them in his pocket ill bring them back he promised thats what everybody says nobody ever does mcneil said lucas got his coat and walked across town to browns the cold air felt good the walking felt good india was behind the desk and smiled when she saw him coming did you ever see any of these guys with sandy lansing lucas pushed the stack of photos at her there are two photos of each guy india took her time looking at them another woman came along and asked whats going on lucas said police were trying to see if we can find somebody sandy lansing might have gone out with ive seen her with a guy a few times the other woman said she stood at indias elbow and they went through the photos together india slowly shaking her head i dont think so she said finally this guy but i dont think it was him the other woman said i dont think so either sorta like that though if you put him in a suit its not him this guy looks a little rough india said youre right the other woman said she looked at lucas i dont think ive ever seen any of them lucas looked at the one photo theyd talked about a honeyhaired white guy roundfaced but without rodriguezs heft he and rodriguez looked nothing alike thanks he said strikeout back at the office lucas had a note to call tim long at the county attorneys office he did you cant count on getting anything from the irs long said i talked to a guy over there and they said if we get anything that looks like hidden income to send them a copy of what we get but theyve had too much trouble with citizen complains to go after a guy who theyve never had a problem with he was audited a couple of years ago in a random audit and everything worked out to the penny which it would if hes faking his cash flow with drug money yeah well the irs guy said you catch em we fry em but they aint gonna hang up his investment money and have a congressman screaming at them not when theyve got a whole file that says the guy is clean another strikeout rose marie said olson isnt moving hes not doing anything youre talking to him arent you in the family briefing yeah she looked up at the office clock were gonna do it again in about fifteen minutes why dont you tell him in utter confidence that weve got a candidate for the guy who actually killed his sister if hes nuts and anything is going to get him stirred up that should do it lucas dont give him the name lucas said tell him you cant do that but theres a possibility that well know something in a couple of days the idea is to get him cranked get him back in the mood if hes the one doing the killings i dont know another benefit is itd keep him from pissing on us in the press after leaving rose marie lucas walked over to see marcy tom black was sitting next to her bed and her head was turned toward him when lucas walked in black said she comes and she goes shes asleep right now lucas got another chair and carried it over to marcys bed two beds down an old man with a shock of white hair a desiccated face and a thin hawk nose tried to breathe worked at it what do you think of this olson guy black asked hes maybe crazy lucas said you think uh hell be doing a trip down to the state hospital hard call a guy executes his parents its pretty easy to say hes nuts yeah well black exhaled and looked down at the tile floor what lucas asked id hate to see the fucker get away with what he did to marcy black said no goddamn justice in the world if you can blow her up and get away with it lucas looked at him for a moment black was marcys best friend on the force and he was gay so they didnt have the sex problem that tended to come up around her that had come up with lucas listen thomas my friend if youre thinking what i think youre thinking stop thinking it you havent thought about it no i havent you get some guy you cant stop a pederast or a serial rapist and you just cant get at him then i might do some thinking but i sure as hell wouldnt mention it to anyone to anyone and i wouldnt pop somebody for shooting a cop you know cops get shot thats part of the job marcy knew it could happen hell it already happened to her once its not like shes an innocent little lamb but if he gets away jesus tom give it some time well get him ill tell you what i think maybe its fifty percent olson maybe fifty percent somebody else you cant go popping a guy on fiftyfifty chance its got me fucked up dude black said i know marcy woke up a couple of minutes later recognized both of them croaked i could use a beer i got one but i already used it once black said if we could find a bottle someplace she smiled she looked almost okay lucas thought howre you feeling like i got hit pretty hard you did you dumb shit you aint the goddamn secret service and jael aint the president lucas said she closed her eyes for a minute seemed to drift off then snapped back hows jael weve got her covered twentyfour hours a day lucas said franklin taught her how to cook nachos i feel hollow she said she licked her dry lips i dont hurt black stood up you want me to get the nurse no no i just feel hollow del shuffled in said hello squatted next to the bed and looked at marcy after a minute he grunted youre doing okay im gonna stop coming over here every five minutes you want some magazines not for a few days yet she said her voice going weak she turned her head back straight closed her eyes and took a couple of breaths lucas thought shed gone back to sleep again then she turned back and looked for lucas her eyes going in and out of focus did you meet that old friend he nodded yes youre careful we can talk about it next week youre teasing me shes going through her mid life lucas said i dont know if anybody can help her marcy said mmmm great office gossip in intensive care black said marcy asked what else is there and closed her eyes again this time she did sleep after two minutes del stood up looked at lucas put a finger to his lips and tipped his head toward the door lucas whispered were going you take it easy to black and followed del to the door outside del said you remember that logan guy the other dealer that outer gave us along with bee yeah we never had time dope hit him three hours ago thats the call i got they got almost a kilo of coke and a couple of sacks of mem were doing a little dance with him gave him a stack of photos and told him if he could put two of them together he might have something to deal with he chose rodriguez and lansing did you talk to tim long about it lucas asked not yet get with him figure out a plea and run it past logons attorney well want a statement as quick as we can get it today lucas said thats pretty quick with a lawyer involved i know you gotta tell his attorney that theres a shortterm expiration date on the offer right now logan can give us something new if we find another connection we dont need his client if that happens logan goes to stillwater and does the whole enchilada im outa here del said lucas looked at his watch and headed back to the office stopped again to talk to rose marie what happened with olson you tell him she nodded that weve got a candidate and im going to push rodriguez see if we can get him to panic lucas said why cause the only case were going to get against him will be circumstantial the stuff is starting to pile up but if we can get him to do something irrational like dump a bunch of money and run for it if we can bust him with a plane ticket to venezuela or something thatd look good to a jury all right we need some public action for the movie people anyway ever since aliees funeral was put off theyve been pissed what are you gonna do that depends on rodriguez he knows that were onto him well watch him the rest of today tomorrow i dont know maybe ill go over and talk to him maybe bust him for the cameras haul his ass over here then turn him loose again shake him let me know lucas went back to his office sat in his chair put his feet up on a desk drawer and thought about it and ten minutes later walked down to homicide and found lester when you guys cleaned out sandy lansings house did you get any photos albums anything like that a few dozen photos nothing real recent family stuff lester said we didnt find a camera in the place well there was an old polaroid in the bedroom closet but it was so old i dont think you could get film for it anymore how about video she had a vcr and a few tapes but the tapes were all movies and some lowrent commercial porn no video camera what she do in her life everybodys got a camera she went to parties lester said and bars as close as we can tell thats it she went out every night of her life she worked out at a fitness place three times a week she had about six cds and a compact stereo that probably cost her two hundred dollars a mediumsized sony tv and the basic cable package that was about it we need to tie her tighter to rodriguez gonna have to do it from the other end lester said this girl was a little strange as far as i can tell she didnt have any interests except going out a million dresses fifty pairs of shoes a big collection of costume jewelry larry martin checked the workout club and found out that they use these magnetic cards to check you in she went mondays wednesday and friday and all she did was a fortyfiveminute class designed to keep your butt looking good so she wasnt even interested in working out wasnt interested in music not interested in tv had about six books and no pictures not many lester said did you look at the porn no but larry did she wasnt in it other than that it was just standard jerkoff stuff out of california hot tubs and swimming pools and blow jobs huh ever wonder why we live in minnesota so we dont have to put up with that scum lester said what a poop lucas said he stood up and stretched scratching for anything huh at this point just after dark with rushhour building outside the door lucas started thinking about dinner then took a call from the cop sent to watch rodriguez this is really exciting stuff the cop said wish i was plainclothes and got to stand in skyways all the time you calling to thank me or what some dude pulled into rodriguezs office hes got a briefcase bigger than my dick and they sat down and started looking at paper this dude is pushing all kinds of paper across the desk i cant tell you anything about it because all i can see is their shirt sleeves so im after about an hour the guy puts all the paper back in the briefcase and comes out and rodriguez pulls up his computer and i figure he isnt going any place and maybe i ought to check this other dude and you went after the second guy and rodriguez skipped on you lucas finished fuck no im looking at him right now rodriguez i mean anyway i followed the other guy into the parking ramp and he gets into a car thats got magnetic signs on the doors coffey realty i got the phone number off the door and the tag number off the car and then i ran back to make sure rodriguez wasnt going away anyway rodriguez is still here and he was dealing heavy with a guy from a realestate company all right you done good i owe you a donut or something two donuts with them little sprinkles you want these numbers lucas looked up the tag number for the dealers car and got a name and an address when he called coffey realty and asked for kirk smalley smalley was in and working i need to talk to you lucas said after identifying himself i can be there before five oclock coffey realty was located on university avenue just down from the state capitol a block from the atheneum bank as he parked his car in the gathering darkness lucas made a mental note to check on connections between the realestate company and the bank then walked up and pulled on the realestate companys door locked there was a light inside and he knocked a moment later a balding man with rolledup shirtsleeves came to the door peered at lucas then opened it officer davenport yeah come on in im kirk smalley smalley locked the door behind them and led lucas back to an interior office big place lucas said as they walked back were a pretty goodsized company smalley said we specialize in commercial real estate so we dont do a lot of mass advertising but we do pretty well he dropped into a swivel chair behind his desk waved lucas at a visitors chair and asked what can i do for you are you handling a realestate deal for richard rodriguez smalley swung back and forth in his chair thinking about the question and then said can you tell me why you want to know i can tell you some things if youre handling a realestate deal is this confidential if we need your official testimony well subpoena you youd have no choice about talking if you see what i mean what richard rodriguez is in the mafia smalley grinned at lucas its serious lucas said now smalley sat forward youve got to keep it confidential unless you subpoena me sure that didnt sound like enough we will lucas added smalley shrugged he called me today richard did and asked me how hard it would be to sell off his realestate holdings he wanted to know how long and how much i told him how much depends a little on how long but if he was in a hurry we could lay them off on a realestate investment trust in a couple of weeks but unless we were lucky hed take a hit how big a hit lucas asked cant tell could be two hundred thousand dollars right now after his mortgages are paid off richard could take out a couple of million if you take two hundred off the top of that hes down to a millioneight then youve got to take capital gains and state taxes out plus our commission hed wind up with something like a millionthree walkaway lot of money lucas said sure but that two hundred thousand is purely thrown away a little bit would go to taxes and commission and so on but hes basically taking a fifteen per cent hit by trying to sell it quick two hundred thousand in the context of a millionthree is a big chunk whatd he say lucas asked smalley came back with his own question whyre you investigating him theres a possibility that hes using large amounts of drug money to make up the difference between actual rents on one side and his mortgage and maintenance payments on the other lucas said smalley considered that for a moment then said you mean he cooked the books but he cooked them up i never heard of that thats what we think its a form of moneylaundering lucas said the investigation is in the context of the overall investigation of the aliee maison murder holy shit smalley was impressed and he was a smart guy you think he did it strangled aliee i cant tell you that were conducting an investigation lucas said so answer my question whatd he say when you told him about the hit he said sell it i said listen richard he doesnt like to be called dick i said listen richard if you could give us two months and he just cut me off and said dump em then it was lucass turn to think after a moment he asked if youd heard about this investigation unofficially what would you do do id drop the deal like a hot rock smalley said we dont need to mess around with aliee maison and all of that we sure as hell dont need to peddle a couple million bucks worth of real estate to a reit he said reet and then have them come back and tell us that we sold them a bunch of cooked books thats not the kind of reputation you want to build so do what you want lucas said drop him you want us to drop him i dont care what you do lucas said drop him if thats best for your company this is an official call youll be subpoenaed in the next day or two but if you were to call him and drop him we wouldnt object certainly smalley scratched his chin looked at the telephone then back at lucas youre using me to fuck with him im just trying to uphold the law mr smalley right i almost forgot they sat together for a few seconds contemplating the law and then smalley said ill call him tomorrow morning lucas took dale street down to and got on the interstate heading west he was inching toward his own exit at cretin then at the last second moved back left and continued across the mississippi river bridge into minneapolis and down south to jael corbeaus studio lucas rang the bell and a voice fifteen feet away said go on in chief lucas jumped jesus i thought you were a bush i feel like a fuckin bush then sotto voce on a radio its davenport as lucas pushed through the door he said tell dick weed its his turn out here two more bored cops were sitting in the studio watching a portable tv that was set up on the floor plugged into a dvd when lucas walked in one of the cops paused the picture they were watching the mummy whichever one of you is the dick weed im supposed to tell you its your turn out there one of the cops looked at his watch bullshit i got fifteen minutes yet you looking for jael yeah shes upstairs reading is she decent aw man dont ask me that it gives me a hardon let me put you down for sensitivity training we have it every saturday morning at six ill be there count on it the cop restarted the mummy halfway through a street riot it resembled the media sc rum outside city hall lucas went halfway up the stairs called jael she came to the top of the stairs and said hey davenport whats going on whatre you doing lucas asked im down to reading a book called natural ash glazes whatd you have in mind i dont know i thought id check you out we could roll around town for a while he said her face brightened thats the best offer ive had in weeks if i have to sit around here any more ill scream lucas told the other cops that theyd be gone for a while one of them said hang on and pulled on a pair of camo coveralls im going to sneak out through the garage give me two minutes give us a chance to see if anything moves after you leave so they sat watching the mummy for a couple of minutes and then lucas said lets go outside the door jael took his arm and the bush said wish i could go jael jumped lucas laughed and said got me coming in down the sidewalk she asked see anybody no dont look around what if the guy follows us she asked then we follow him but what if hes watching from further away and we dont see him but he follows us anyway lucas loaded her into the porsche not possible he said they pulled away from the curb lucas watching ahead and in the rearview mirror jael craning left and right looking for headlights lots of cars but i didnt see any headlights come on she said so hes probably not around but what if reach behind your seat there theres like a black plastic bag she got the bag opened it took out the little bubble light and looked at it gimme it lucas said he look the light licked the suction cup and stuck it on the dash the cord plugged into the cigarette lighter a minute later they rolled down the ramp on iw and lucas dropped the hammer the porsche took off running through moderate traffic and a halfmile down he flipped the switch on the flasher and jael laughed and the speed went up and jael braced herself against the dashboard and said now youre showing off as they went past the mark they flew along the interstate cars ahead of them scattering like chickens at an open spot lucas killed the flasher and said no point in advertising and backed off the speed a notch bringing it down to ninetyfive a minute later they burned past a highway patrol car that had been hidden behind a ryder truck aw shit lucas said highway patrol she said yeah i know stop or go go she said he went and the needle pushed past to and jael said he turned his flashing lights on i think hes coming hes coming but youre still gaining exit coming up diamond lake road on car at the top of the ramp lucas pushed it until the last second then cut right took the ramp the car at the top was turning left so lucas went right around the corner down a long block turned left accelerated to the end of the block turned left again and rolled down the window they could hear the siren from the highway patrol car but it was north and then west of them going the wrong way they usually turn right if they lose a guy lucas grunted we gotta get south they zigzagged south and west past oak hill cemetery under another limitedaccess road jael teasing lucas as he lurked through residential neighborhoods avoiding headlights shut up shut up he said and she laughed and said mr speedo they finally made and lucas took the car onto the highway past two exits off into a bookstore parking lot part of a shopping complex now whatyael asked we go to the bookstore for an hour then walk over and get something to eat and maybe go shopping for a while gotta stay off the road for a couple of hours there arent that many black porsches around what if they stop us anyway she asked then i lie like a motherfucker lucas said i thought cops got free passes not if theyre showing off for a girl lucas said i hope you like books she did like books and disappeared into the art section lucas browsed through literature slowed down at poetry found a collection of philip larkins stuff and was reading through it when she snuck up behind him guns n ammo she predicted reaching for the book he let her have it and she turned it over in her hands and then looked up at him showing off for a girl eh he shrugged not really i dont read much fiction but i read poetry she closed one eye and examined him youre lying like a motherfucker nope one of the other cops told me you once owned a computer company thats how you got rich yeah but it was really somebody else who did the computer stuff lucas said i just had some good ideas at the right time thats what its all about isnt it having the right ideas at the right time she turned the book over you think id like him he thought for a minute and then said nope hes a little too guy for you who then emily dickinson shes my favorite probably the best american poet ever all right ill try her she said otherwise all i got was this she held up a book with a pot on the cover that said japanese ash glazes i got a deep interest in ash myself lucas said after the bookstore they went to a bagel place and got healthy bagels as they were eating jael paging through her collection of dickinson she suggested that they go back to the bookstore so she could buy some mysteries i always go into the bookstores and wind up buying books for work or something serious but if ive got to keep sitting in that house i gotta have something else i cant stand tv anymore if you want to buy mysteries theres a place on the way back that we could stop nothing but mysteries sounds good she licked a drip of sundried tomato humus off her thumb we need to kill some more time but in the car she said at your house do you have both a bathtub and a shower or are you just a shower guy no i have both since weve gotta kill time why dont we go back to your place and jump in the tub its been a while since i had a really great backwashing they were sitting at an uphill stop sign and lucas had one foot on the clutch and let the car roll back a few feet then accelerated forward and rolled back thinking maybe i need a little more romancing he said finally besides another commitment not exactly but im sort of between everything he said i know youre not gay the way you look at me thats not the problem but it had been a long time he remembered standing outside the cabin and looking up at the great smear of the milky way stars and feeling not insignificant but lonely and alone its just casual sex lucas therapy she said maybe im still too catholic besides what about the guys at the bookstore they need the sales whatre their children gonna eat if we dont buy books you remember what it feels like sitting in a tub with a woman between your legs all slippery and slidey and youve got the soap in your hands she was laughing at him again lucas let the car roll back and accelerated and let it roll back and accelerated and said all right good choice she said fuck the guys at the bookstore she was laughing but later that evening she said for three hours i almost forgot about plain chapter twentytwo thursday day six of aliee maison frank lester was carrying a brown sandwich bag up the city hall steps when lucas caught up with him the next morning half jogging through the cold twilight trailing a long streamer of steam baloney sandwiches peanut butter and jelly lester said he held up the bag he was wearing ski gloves i understand you were out late with jael corbeau yeah a little late rolling around town lucas said evasively she didnt want to go back home not a goddamn thing happening not with corbeau not with kinsley maybe we fucked up maybe olsons not the guy hes been preaching every night he goes around to all these churches the guys whore tracking him say hes completely looney but the people at these churches they love him last night he started to bleed aw man i dont want to hear that lucas said cant figure out how he did it thought maybe he has a little razor blade stuck on his belt or something but they say he got all cranked up and he spread his arms above his head screaming and all of a sudden the blood started seeping out of his palms and then he gets a red spot on his shirt right you know right where the spear went in jesus exactly whats happening with rodriguez pushed a button last night lucas said maybe today well see something hope so he looked past lucas and lucas turned a tv remote van squatted down on the street its engine running wonder if theyve got a microphone on us better not lucas said id slam their butts in jail for that talk to the judge we could probably get them three years yeah they both watched the van for a few more seconds no signs of life just the exhaust and they went inside lane came by ten minutes after lucas got to his office we need an accountant to look at some of that paper from the bank he said ive got it narrowed down to a few questions but i cant answer the questions without an expert what are the questions how could spooner give him the loans thats the basic question if i could have gotten a home loan on the same terms id be living on one of the lakes the loans stink lucas leaned back in his chair see thats why i had you reading the paper id rather be bustin somebodys balls so get me the accountant and ill go over and bust spooners lets talk to rose marie rose marie had a better idea she knew the banking commissioner from the old days made a call and got lane lined up with a bank examiner shed just gotten off the phone when the secretary buzzed her rose marie picked up listened for a minute then said its rodriguez and pushed another button rose marie roux yes this is she listened for a long minute then said im not aware of any of this chief davenport is leading that aspect of the investigation and we havent met yet this morning no i cant tell you anything if he did that as part of the investigation i assume he had good reason i appreciate that mr rodriguez but theres really no more that i can tell you i can have chief davenport call you when he comes in yes im sure he would yes im sure he would after another minute of backandforth she politely said goodbye hung up and said to lucas not a happy man some realestate deal was canceled you did have good reason sure were trying to panic him weve got him tapped he stopped scratched his head said how come a cop called me and told me about his appointment with a realestate dealer but we didnt get it on the wire taps he had to have called the guy lane said hes a dopedealer dummy hes got a blind phone lucas stood up and said shit howd we miss that all of his good calls have been going out somewhere else rose marie asked but how would you find a blind phone if lucas shook a finger at her we need to talk to the phone company and get incoming phone numbers yesterday afternoon wait a minute whos watching the lines somebody from narcotics i guess rose marie said call down and get a number two minutes later lucas was talking with the narcotics cop who was monitoring rodriguezs lines did he just take a call from a realestate dealer nope hes gotten a couple of calls from one of his apartment managers they had an electricpanel fire last night hes been making calls to some of his other managers and a maintenance company he just talked to the chief i assume you know that what line was that the cop gave lucas a number but no realestate dealer nope lucas rang off got rose marie to dig a st paul phone book out of her desk looked up coffey realty dialed and asked for smalley smalley came up and lucas asked we just got a call from mr rodriguez he sounded a little upset i assume you called him yeah just a little while ago he was not a happy camper can you give me the number you called well sure i guess coffey said i dont have it here i want to call him back lucas said just a sec ive got it on a piece of paper where here it is lucas copied the number and said thanks i would stay away from mr rodriguez for a while until he cools off anyway i plan to stay away from him forever smalley said lucas hung up and rose marie said different number yeah he punched in the number for the monitoring cop got him and said we think rodriguez is using a blind phone that were not monitoring i want you to call him make like you dialed a wrong number see if its him if the voice is right the cop said gimme the number he might have callerid lucas said he wont get it from this phone get back to me lucas said goddamnit we should have known this rose marie said when lucas had hung up a blind phones pretty basic for a dealer water under the rug lucas said he looked at lane you get over to the bank guy if its like you think call me well go bust spooners balls all right i should be back to you before noon lane said are you going to call rodriguez rose marie asked im gonna get sloan to go over and see him lucas said i want to see how he handles himself rose maries phone burped she picked it up listened pushed a button said this is rose marie then looked at lucas thats rodriguez number its his voice on the other end excellent lucas said now maybe we make some progress but weve got to get him talking sloan was on his cell phone lucas got him told him to bring a car around to the hospital were gonna go talk to rodriguez marcy was sitting up still paperpale five years older than shed been the week before the corners of her eyes creased with pain lines but her eyes were clear and black perched on a chair next to her bed said theyre gonna put her in a regular room thats progress lucas said he bent over the bed and kissed her on the forehead man im glad to see you up i had all these premonitions she looked at him for a moment then asked whatve you been up to what he shrugged youve got that innocent look and that really close shave you get when youre really satisfied with yourself what have you been doing lucas grinned i dont have the guy who shot you but i think weve got the guy who did aliee sloan and i are gonna go bust his chops yeah she still looked suspicious who is it as he filled her in on rodriguez he caught her attention wavering once or twice she really wasnt back yet he realized almost not quite when he finished with rodriguez he asked what are they telling you about recovery time think you could be back by wednesday maybe not she said they said if everything goes well im gonna have to do some rehab maybe may may jesus you were hit hard they might have to go back in black said therere a couple pieces of bone floating around inside that oughta come out but thats gonna be a while yet you hurt lucas asked her she nodded yeah started this morning i dont think its gonna stop for a while drugs lucas said sloan showed up and chatted for a while then he and lucas left headed for st paul and rodriguez outside the door on the way to the car lucas said before i was scared about her now im pissed shes hurting and theres not a goddamn thing we can do about it get the guy who did it sloan suggested the guy who did it thinks hes the messiah lucas said theres a difference between thinks he is and is sloan said to me hes just another fat asshole on his way to a cell at stillwater on the way to st paul lucas said lets stop and see if spooner is at his office bust his balls a little bit want me to be the nice guy sloan asked we dont need one we just need to scare this guy but spooner wasnt in reed the bank president came out of see them and said i suspended him with pay i think hes innocent but we dont want a question i pray to god that he and alicia understand that whos alicia his wife reed said we really need to see him you think hed be at home he was earlier today do you have his address lucas asked reed frowned looked at the secretary and then said give him billys address then with just a hint of defiance and call billy and tell him that these gentlemen are on their way spooner lived a block from highland park an affluent residential area ten minutes from the bank the house was an upright twostorey whiteclapboard place set well back from the street with oak trees in the front yard sloan pulled into the driveway and they got out as they did spooner came to stand in the picture window and for a second lucas had the strange feeling that spooner was somebody else but who he didnt know when spooner saw them he headed to the door a dishwaterblonde replaced him in the window she was wearing a pink blouse and a gold watch spooner met them on the front steps pulling on a coat as he stepped outside he shut the door behind him ive talked to my attorney and he said that i shouldnt talk to you unless hes present he said well shoot lucas said to sloan a wasted trip sloan said to spooner what does your attorney think about us talking to you you not talking back im just not supposed to talk to you so tell your attorney were here and want to set up a meeting the loan papers we subpoenaed are being reviewed by a bank examiner and an accountant right now and we need to talk about it sloan said and tell your attorney that were making the case against rodriguez for dopedealing and murder and the more we look at him the more we find lucas said that the case on rodriguez is a hell of a lot more serious than a little fudging around with loans and that youre going to buy a piece of his prison sentence if we dont start seeing some cooperation spooner had his hands in his pockets and he flapped his coat panels like wings jeez jeez you guys i dont want this but you come on like im going to jail what can i do but call my lawyer so why dont you call him and talk to him ill come in ill tell you everything i know about richard but ive got to have some legal protection when lucas asked when will you come in anytime jeez when do you want me to come this afternoon when but i want my lawyer there the blonde woman was standing in the window with her arms crossed peering out at them is this your wife sloan asked spooner looked then said yes shes really freaking out my god my job lucas was thinking lane had just gone to see the examiner and they would want that opinion before they talked to spooner so come in tomorrow tomorrow morning call your attorney make an appointment with the chiefs secretary ill be available any time you are okay spooner shuffled uncertainly opened the screen door as if to go back in the house then said just as lucas and sloan were turning away you know i wasnt lying the other day i still dont think richard is involved with any of this youre wrong youre watching him you know hes done this were all over him lucas said and theres not a lot of doubt the question is how much do you know if you know enough ill tell you everything but theres just not much that i know i mean his loans they were a little risky but his record thinking that hes a dopedealer i his mouth opened and closed a few times as though he were flabbergasted i mean i dont believe it hes a nice guy tell me something nice that hes done lucas said well spooner seemed to grope for something then said i cant think of anything specific but hes been to our house and hes nice to my wife and hes nice to other people i mean hes just a nice guy to sit around and have a drink with well lucas said its something to think about in the car sloan said a nice guy man hes dealing dope people who deal dope know about him they pick him out of blind photo spreads lucas said and if you look at those loans the guys a goddamn hustler even if he is nice sloan said you remember dan marks lucas said now there was a nice guy sloan said everybody agreed until the trouble started and they took apart his garbage disposal lucas said i didnt know fingernails would do that sloan said they thought about fingernails and headed back into st paul rodriguez was at his office another patrol cop had been stuffed into a sportcoat and left to keep an eye on him they found him shifting from foottofoot in the skyway eating popcorn out of an oversized box hey guys he said when lucas and sloan stepped into the skyway he looked at the popcorn box in his hand and said gift from the st paul guys their precinct is right inside whats he doing lucas asked working on his computer he went away for a while and i lost him but he came back in his car no he walked back into the building somewhere you see the building entrance his office opens off that hallway when he put on his coat i ran down but he was already out the door into the hallway he was out of sight when i got there so i went back to the parking garage and waited to see if he was coming out he never came out and when i checked again he was back in the office so he went someplace inside yeah but its all hooked into the skyway through there so he could have gone anywhere he was gone for maybe twenty minutes put on his coat yeah they thought about that for a minute but nothing occurred to them except that he probably hadnt been on his way to the can maybe we need a couple more guys lucas said if were serious about him the cop agreed as it is ive got my car parked down on the street but if he comes out the ramp and turns the wrong way im gonna be pretty obvious doing a uturn fifteen feet behind him lucas looked at sloan and said more guys and soon my feet are killing me the cop said rodriguez was not what lucas expected he was not latino he didnt look latino or sound latino he didnt sound like a drugdealer either most drugdealers had a streak of macho in them or if not that then a bit of backslapper bullshit rodriguez looked and sounded like a white middleclass businessman whod crawled up out of the working class sweating the details of whatever kind of business he was in he was a large guy thicknecked thickwasted roundshouldered maybe he drank too much and if so itd be beer or if not beer something serious vodka martinis with a pearl onion lucas had seen the same guy in car salesmen machineshop owners bartenders union officials he saw it sometimes in lawyers who came from a workingclass background and rodriguez was mad what the fuck are you doing what the fuck do you think youre doing bustin my reputation and my bid ness dealings ill tell you what im getting my lawyer down here right now he snatched up a telephone and were gonna add this little patch of harassment to the lawsuit i dont need no goddamn apartment buildings because im gonna get rich suing the city of minneapolis for about a billion bucks and this aint the first time you minneapolis cops got nailed doing this kind of harassment bullshit and vbure dealing drugs richard lucas said we can prove that we can prove you ran sandy lansing weve got people who will stand up in court and say so we can prove you got a bunch of bullshit loans that you supported with dope money and the irs is gonna come after your ass weve got all that the question is can we get you for killing aliee we know you did it we just gotta fit the suit to you bullshit i never touched that bitch hed been punching numbers into his phone set and now he spoke into the phone let me talk to sam the cops are here hassling me davenport and some other guy he listened for a moment then thrust the phone at lucas talk to him no were leaving lucas said i just wanted to get a look at your ass were coming for you richard fuck you rodriguez said and into the phone he wont talk to you theyre leaving yeah yeah as lucas and sloan went through the office door into the hallway they heard the phone clattering on the desk and a minute later rodriguez was in the hall behind them let me tell you assholes something he said let me tell you something you and me my goddamn mother was no bettern a whore in detroit i dont even know who my daddy is even my name is some kind of joke my old man was probably a polack or a litvak or some other fuckin eastern european he was building steam as the words rattled out of his face i got outa detroit by my fingernails and i busted my ass every day of my life to get where i am now some twobit fuckin cops are saying i killed somebody ill tell you what i never killed anybody i never killed anybody i never even slapped anybody in the face i just wanted to get out of that fuckin detroit and be somebody and now i am and you assholes enough on the assholes lucas snapped youre an asshole rodriguez said both of you are so why dont you slap me around a little or something huh he inched closer to lucas cmon hit me i wont hit you back itll just give me a little more to sue you with you motherfuckers youre ruining my bid ness and suddenly his face crinkled up and he said my bid ness youre ruinin my bid ness and he turned around and went back through the door into his office jesus sloan said impressed the guy was i mean those were tears yeah lucas scratched his head then shrugged lets go were sure hes dealing drugs sloan asked unless hes got an evil twin the rodriguez interview put a blight on the day and they drove mostly in silence back toward minneapolis drop you at the hospital sloan asked nah im gonna i dont know what im gonna do what if were wrong about rodriguez ive been sitting here thinking about that lucas said but were not you know what were doing weve gotten to the place where we think dopedealers are automatically subhumans but both of us could think of guys who push a little dope and arent all that bad as guys love their wives not a lot of them sloan said most of them are dirt not a lot but some some of them are human beings you know what it reminds me of remember when you were interviewing sandy lansings father and he started off on niggers and all that yeah hes the flip side of rodriguez here was a guy who coulda played the nice old candyshop owner on a tv show but then he opens his mouth and this bullshit comes out rodriguez is a dopedealer and his story is this pathetic struggle to get out of the slums fuck i dont know he thought about it for a minute then said what i do know is rodriguez is a drugdealer he was running sandy lansing he was at the party where sandy lansing was killed he denies all of it and thats the only tie weve got del called sloan handed lucas his cell phone and asked irritably why dont you turn on your fuckin phone whats going on lucas asked im at boo mcdonalds and i got some seriously bad fuckin news del said mcdonald was the paraplegic radio and computer monitor all right you know that little rat who publishes spittle hes got a new story out and it names rodriguez what yeah the little jerk im going over to scream at him scream at his parents but rodriguezs name is out rose marie was livid you gotta tell me the truth lucas this isnt the little push you were talking about no nobody got the name from me or any of my people not from me or anybody i know lester said theres gotta be fifty or sixty people in the department who know the names ive had about nine calls in the last halfhour and what do i say rose marie asked i cant say no its not rodriguez because it is so i say i cant comment on an ongoing investigation and you know what that means that means yes and everybody knows it the spittle kids got a leak lucas said we know this goddamn place leaks if i find the fuckin leak that guy will find himself out on his ass and ill spend the rest of my term trying to fuck his pension rose marie snarled i want you to put that word out that im looking for the guy and his job and his pension are on the line thats a little strong lester said im not sure theyll believe it itll give them something to think about she said by god im gonna have ia look into this brace a few people im not gonna have this shit im not going to have it lucas said i can tell you one thing this morning i asked you guys to send a couple more people over to watch rodriguez we better put a serious net around the guy now i mean forget about jael corbeau and catherine kinsley hes gotta be number one on this other fruitcakes hit list lucas went back to his office found two notes one said call jael the other call catrin he called jael who said the dozen longstemmed roses you sent to my house havent arrived yet im sorry i thought uh well i mean i thought you were supposed to send them to me ive been waiting lucas said god hes such a wit jael said i need a man with wit maybe so anything going on can i get out of here not yet he told her quickly about the leak in the department itll be on the news whatre you doing tonight she asked i mean this isnt another proposition id like to rejoice in the blood of the lamb what he was confused this guy whos trying to kill me hes preaching at some church tonight jael said id like to see him one of your guys here did and its supposed to be something else man i dont know lucas said that might not be such a good idea cmon dont be a stickinthemud she said besides you can bring a gun and im going nuts lets get the sports car lets go see him ill call you things are going on over here if i can get away maybe he called catrin she was on a cell phone and answered in her car let me pull over to the side she said her voice was showing stress he thought she might have been crying what happened but shed put the phone down a moment later she came back well i told him that i thought we had some problems and that i was thinking of going away that i thought i might want to be by myself for a while you know what he said i dont he said well whatever you think you have to do let me know it was like i wasnt sure i could make it to lunch catrin i really cant advise you i just dont know he just walked away from me catrin said now i wonder if he isnt having an affair or something it was like he was waiting for me to say something if the guy has any sensitivity at all if he knows you at all then he knew something was coming lucas said its like waiting for the ax to fall when it does there isnt much to say you know about everything that anybody might say lucas what are you talking about weve been married for more than twenty years when we were talking at lunch when you asked if you were just screwed i mean look at your old man if he argues with you hes being domineering and hes not letting you lead your own life if he doesnt argue with you but is absolutely supportive tells you to do whatever you want then hes being patronizing and you feel like your life is a hobby because hes got all the money and youre going to london for plays and all that and if he lets you go he doesnt care so i mean when you talk about being screwed hes about as screwed as you can get whatever he does is wrong it sounds like youre on his side she said there was an undertone of disbelief absolutely not look half of my friends have been divorced and most of the other half are fucked up im fucked up ive been through this jesus im on your side catrin because were old friends if i was your husbands friend id be on his side because nobodys right or wrong and in that case youve just got to go with your friends well i talked to one of my girlfriends down here actually i had lunch with three of them my best friend and a couple that ive always been friends with and i knew by the way one of them was acting shes on jacks side thats gonna happen lucas said and some old friends of jacks will be on your side thatll surprise you too you said you belong to a golf club yes whats gonna amaze you is a couple of his male friends are going to put the moves on you the loose woman not just trying to get laid mean some of them will but some of them will have been looking at you for a long time and liking you lucas hey its gonna happen if you walk i dont think ive got any choice now she said listen what youre telling me have you thought about telling jack scream at him a little bit throw a little crockery i mean do you still love him after a long silence she said i dont think so aw jeez what happened was his reaction made me angry she said so angry but i feel like i dont know im a little excited in a dirty way like i just broke out of jail aw jeez you keep saying aw jeez whats that supposed to mean youre hurting a lot worse than you know but youre going to find out he said sos jack i cant hardly stand to think about it well maybe but im getting out he couldnt think of anything to say thinking about her sitting on the side of a road talking about the end of her marriage on a cell phone to somebody she hadnt seen for twentyfive years so congratulate me she said now she did start crying awww jeez rose marie came down the medias got rodriguez surrounded his lawyer just called the county what happened to you i was talking to an old friend her marriage is breaking up lucas said did you have anything to do with it no not directly i mean im not fooling around with her maybe i could have said something that would have changed things i dont know shes just an old friend huh rose marie might have been skeptical you cant take care of everybody lucas they dont even want you to shes needs a little help lucas said ive got no advice rose marie said now rodriguez is gonna sue us of course and tom olson has called twice in the past halfhour asking about rodriguez but im not in ive got to come up with a story whens he coming in youve got a briefing yes in a halfhour id like you to be there she said sure i dont know what i can say if he tries to throttle me you could hit him over the head they were still talking when the phonetap monitor called we got some stuff on rodriguezs blind phone three calls in a hurry where the first one to miami to an unlisted number i mean weve got the number but when we tried to check on it the directory supervisor said she needed to see some paper before she can give us a name another blind phone i bet i think so anyway he told whoever answered not to send jerry up that he had a problem we think it might have been a delivery hell i know it was a delivery ive heard the same thing two hundred times in almost the same words the cop said nothing specific mentioned like it would be if it was legitimate just you know that delivery we talked about with jerry better hold off ive got some problems up here good give me the miami phone number lucas said he scribbled the number on a pad ive got a guy with the fbi who might be able to help great then there was another call this one to a realestate guy he asked the guy to look into selling the apartments and suggest that a reet might want to buy them i dont know the name its reit real estate investment trust lucas said it could be a way to get out in a hurry well the guy he talked to he was hot to handle it you want the name yeah lucas wrote down the name and the third thing is he called another dope guy he said ive got to shut down my business for a while tell everybody im sorry the other guy said whats the problem rodriguez said just a problem the cops think i had something to do with that aliee thing theyre messing with me and the guy said wherere you calling from and rodriguez said i got a good phone and the other guy said id throw it in the river if i was you if they think you were involved with aliee theyre gonna tap you three ways from sunday and rodriguez said well tell everybody ill call you back when its over and that was it we need that number and times and transcripts lucas said he jotted down the number and when he got off he looked at rose marie and said its piling up when rose marie was gone he called mallard and gave him the miami number and called del and gave him the local number del called back fifteen minutes later and said that number is out to another blind phone but narcotics knows it they picked it up on a pen register a couple of months ago a guy named herb scott thats all they know a number and a name in the computer want them to look a little closer absolutely put him on the list if nothing happens by tomorrow night were gonna sweep them all and see if we can shake anything loose mallard called back a few minutes after del that number goes with a guy who lists his address in a place called gablesbythesea i guess its a ritzy neighborhood ive got a guy checking with the locals thanks piling it up for a moment he thought about running down the new realestate dealer but decided against it that might make the phone tap obvious and the phone might still be valuable sloan called come on down to homicide theres something you got to see lucas walked down and found a halfdozen cops laughing around a smallscreen tv what thats rodriguezs apartment sloan said penthouse somebody said a wavering picture was focused on a window surrounded by reddish concrete then moving in slow motion rodriguez appeared in the window and pulled the curtain across it when he was out of sight the loop started again the window rodriguez the curtain guilty guilty guilty a cop said and somebody else with a little edge of sarcasm if he wasnt guilty why would he pull the curtain and a third guy if it was me id be pointing a rifle out the window theyd love that yeah until a little bullet hole appeared on the forehead of one of them blonde c a woman with a gun said watch it cameramen olson came by trailing the bentons the packards and lester moore the newspaper editor who is this rodriguez olson demanded everybodys saying he did it rose marie said hes a suspect lucas lucas said we think hes a drugdealer actually were sure he is and we have at least two sources who say that he was running sandy lansing that is sandy lansing was the street dealer for drugs brought in by rodriguez rodriguez was the wholesaler more like the local franchise owner and lansing was one of his employees amazing olson said franchises and employees did he pay her social security moore broke in can you get him not yet lucas said maybe on drugs we have no direct connection to the murder but we can put him at the party we can connect him with lansing we have him denying that he knew her we can probably show that they dealt drugs together we can project it as a drug argument that went bad he killed lansing maybe even accidentally by cracking her head against a door jamb aliee comes out of the bedroom just at that point and he kills her to get rid of a witness olson stood up slowly peered at the bentons and then at moore you mean she was killed as a bystander that all this happened because she was at the wrong place thats a possibility lucas said olson said i dont believe it this is not a casual killing all these people dead it cant just be chance it cant be we dont really know that it is rose marie interjected lucas is just outlining one possible theory my good god olson said he put his hands on the side of this head as he did the day he found his parents and pulled the hair straight out as he did that day just before his collapse lucas stood up stepped toward him took his arm easy i cant i cant sit down olson stumbled and lucas guided him around to the chair olson looked around the room at the faces all pointed toward him and said this cannot stand this cannot when he was gone frank lester said if that doesnt get him cranked i dont know what will lane came back took all goddamn day but the bank examiner comes in on our side she says the loans are funky thats the technical expression funky exactly but theres a problem lane said i created it i made the fundamental investigatory error i asked one too many questions no asked two too many ive told you about that lucas said yeah so ive got this bank examiner whos got nice legs by the way even if she wasnt a big rock n roller and i say what would you do if youd caught him doing this during a bank examination and she says wed tell him that the loan was weak and depending on the status of their other loans we might require action and i say thats it and she says whatd you think we were gonna do shoot him so then i make the next mistake i ask another question you already had two questions naw that was like question one and onea now im at question two i ask how many commercial loans are there in minnesota gotta be hundreds of thousands huh and she says well many tens of thousands anyway and i ask this is question twob how many are this bad i figured shed say something like we get one or two a year you know what she said im afraid to know lucas said be very afraid lane said she said there might be a few thousand lucas said goddamnit yeah our hold on spooner just got slipperier on the other hand i thought of this on the way over here what spooner doesnt know it lane said youre a sneaky fuck lucas said its a quality i admire in a cop as the earlier darkness settled in and the lights came up del came by with an icecream cone and said im gonna go see marcy wanna come yeah let me get my coat on the way over lucas told him about catrin del listened finished the cone in the cold night and then said shes probably gonna want to jump in bed with you to prove to herself that shes still desirable and that shes as good as she was in the old days what am i gonna do well i dont think jumping her is gonna be the answer he looked at lucas or is it no i mean man shes really nice but shes really fucked up so give her a really understanding talk about how she is fucked up you might want to find a different phrase and that she shouldnt do anything until shes gotten herself straight again that doesnt sound like something catrin would go for lucas said how do you meet these women anyway theyre all so fuckin tangled up i dont know its a special talent what you need is some chick that comes up and says wanna see my harley and you say is it a sportster and she says its whatever you want it to be ive often wondered if you had a fantasy life lucas said i guess that questions answered yeah well if i were you id go home and think about this catrin chick for a long time especially if shes still a friend they walked along for half a block and then del added there is one bright side to the problem yeah yeah its your problem and not mine marcy was sitting up awake but she looked distant her eyes a little too bright the docs are worried that she might have a touch of pneumonia black said they say it shouldnt be serious but theyve got to deal with it lucas squatted to look straight into her face howre you feeling a little warm still hurt always hurt goddamnit he stood up theres got to be better drugs yeah but they fuck up my head id rather have a little pain marcy said hows the case i understand this rodriguez guy is out in the open they talked about rodriguez and she stayed awake but she didnt look as good as she had lucas thought she looked like she had the flu after chatting for a while he told the others he was going to get a coke and wandered out of the room as soon as he was out he headed for the desk and asked is weather karkinnen the nurse looked past him weather was headed down the hall toward them he walked toward her and said youve heard about marcy this pneumonia thing yeah ive been keeping up she said its not too serious yet theyre managing it cmon weather is this gonna turn into something she shook her head i cant tell you that lucas shes young enough and healthy enough that it shouldnt and were right on top of it but she was hit hard and her lung took some of it so we gotta stay on top of it thats all lucas i dont know any more she said in exasperation i just dont know all right they stood awkwardly then she touched his arm and said ive been seeing this rodriguez guy on television thats you isnt it your part of the case yeah hes the guy the problem is how do we get at him theres almost nothing at the scene that would help were building a circumstantial case they walked along lucas talking about the case theyd done this when they were living togther lucas talking out problem cases the talking seemed to help seemed to straighten out his thinking even when weather didnt say much they fell back into the pattern weather prodding him with an occasional why do you think that or where did you get that or how does that connect they turned at the end of the long hall and del stepped out of marcys room and looked down at them and went back inside on the way back weather said whatre you doing tonight want to go out for pasta i cant he said shaking his head you know what it gets like im going nuts but could i call you yeah i think you can she said she grabbed his ear pulled his head down and kissed him on the cheek see ya she said chapter twentythree lucas ate alone a quick slicedbeefandcucumber sandwich in the kitchen stood in the shower for a few minutes soaking then changed into jeans a sweat shirt over a golf shirt a leather jacket and boots he thought about taking the tahoe it would fit better with the crowd but jael really liked the porsche he took the porsche across the ford bridge and up the mississippi then west to jaels studio shed picked out an outfit like his leather jacket and jeans cowboy boots and a turquoiseandsilver necklace we look like were going to a square dance she said cmon downstairs in the studio she said i left my house keys in the back just a minute and when she went to get them one of the ambush cops sitting on the floor with a play station looked up and said youre breaking my fuckin heart davenport hey were going to church yeah the cop said and aw shit now i missed the yellow block jael came back with her keys and said were rolling the cop looked up at lucas one eye closed and lucas shrugged and followed her out the door olson was preaching at the christ triumphant evangelical church a good part of an hour west of minneapolis in the town of young america the church was a long narrowfaced white clapboard building with a bell tower in the new england style with a nearly full gravel parkinglot to one side lucas parked between a trickedout ford f and a chevy s with a snow blade in a slot where the tahoe would have fit perfectly the porsche crouched between them looked like a cockroach between two refrigerators and down about ten slots lucas noticed a nondescript city car huddled behind a van outside the church a thin pinkfaced man in a long black trench coat stood next to a salvation armystyle kettle with a sign that said please donate and under that in small letters suggested donation per person jael said i thought reverend olson didnt accept compensation and the man standing with the kettle said this is for the church maam reverend olson doesnt even take gas money out lucas put a fivedollar bill in the kettle and the man said thanks very much folks you better get inside if you want to get a seat the church was severely plain inside white walls naturalwood floors a center aisle between two ranks of pews and a rough wooden cross at the far end the pews were twothirds full with a couple of dozen people still milling around lucas and jael sat near the back the place was warm and they took off their coats in the far left corner of the church two women from narcotics chatted quietly with each other in five minutes the pews were full and people began sitting in the aisle the fire marshal would have a heart attack if he saw this lucas muttered as people continued to jam into the church jael leaned toward him and said see the women what women in the dark blue vests she pointed with her chin lucas took a minute to pick them out a halfdozen women were working around the front of the room passing out sheets of paper stopping to talk to people laughing chatting then lucas picked out a couple of bluevested men also working the crowd couple of guys too see the guy in the parka hes got one on underneath oh yeah i didnt see him i wonder they were whispering and lucas whispered what is this a cult the lights began to dim and lucas shrugged then one of the women in blue vests gave them a stack of paper to pass down their pew and they each took one and passed the rest lucas peered at the writing in the dimming light the words to a halfdozen songs and on the back some kind of drawing he put the paper in his lap and looked up as olson appeared at the front of the church stepped up on the dais and started with howre yall tonight some people said fine or good olson said im not very good how many of you knew that aliee maison was my sister hold up your hands twothirds of the audience lifted their hands so you know my sister was murdered and my parents were murdered and that a man named amnon plain was murdered i want to talk to you about that he talked about his sister and his parents for twenty minutes how he and sharon olson and their parents lived their lives in burnt river a quiet familyoriented smalltown existence for the most part with the one difference that aliees looks and talents made i didnt know any difference i didnt know that even there in burnt river running along the water fishing with dad getting in apple fights with my friends and bbgun fights im sure more than a few of you been in bbgun fights even a few of you women huh a ripple of laughter and acknowledgment ran through the audience i didnt know in all of that young childish fun even there the evil was reaching out to us long tentacles reaching out of new york out of los angeles long wispy fingers of evil settling over the minds of us all lucas felt a creepy tingle olson had a deep resonant voice and knew how to play it although it seemed to drop to a whisper and though it seemed to be aimed at each individual it was loud enough to be heard perfectly and he had the deep stocky build and the square powerful head that gave him a quality of suppressed violence he talked about the evil and about its expression on television in the movies in fastfood businesses and on the internet i have been around a little bit i was in the marine corps i worked as a shore patrolman at subic bay on payday i know all the trouble that people can get into with sex and with dope and with greed and with the need of possession i knows that theres some of it in all of us but i also know that an adult can fight it maybe not win but can choose to fight but have you personally looked into this newest evil this internet that all the schools and libraries now are trying to sell us have you looked on the internet i have i looked at a library with a librarian one of our people showing me and the evil on the internet is beyond belief beyond anything you might encounter at subic beyond anything you veterans of the world have seen beyond all of that and it is flowing straight to our children with that as a base olson began to preach on the evil of the world and the light to come on jesus who was with us all the time and who would be visible in the next few years the end of times was upon us the preaching lasted for twenty minutes a rising and ebbing of emotion the emotional appeals coming in waves that would crest each higher than the last with olson wandering halfway down the aisle talking calling on the children of god reaching into the pews to touch people both men and women the audience rocked with him in a shoulderpushing rhythm the noise of the audience the heat inside the church and olsons voice together finally climaxed in a long desperate wail and when the wail died olson was smiling but were gonna be okay because were the children of the lord and that lucas thought was it for the night olson in an almost businesslike way began talking about amnon plain a biblical name amnon and plain thats important as soon as i heard the name i thought this was a message as soon as i heard of his murder i was sure of it ive spoken in this church about my admiration for the plain people our brothers the amish and the mennonites and although our beliefs may be different in that thing in the belief in the plain we agree the plain will save you you have seen some people here in blue vests those are handmade blue vests they all made them themselves if you accept the plain make yourself a vest put it on then kill your tv kill your internet connection turn away from the magazines that overflow with the evil suddenly they were back in it but this time it was different humping along in an almost orgasmic frenzy built around the word plain and the evocation of the death of amnon plain and the clear message to gods children as the frenzy built jaels fingers dug into lucass leg dug in and held and as olson talked the lights in the church continued to dim until it was nearly dark inside with the only light around olson at the front as he preached he was tying himself in a knot lucas thought his body was shaking with the violence of his words people began to stand up and cry out then the entire congregation was on its feet and the wailing began again and olson in the light reached a new climax dropped to his knees in an agony and threw up his hands palms to the audience blood ran from wounds in his palms down his forearms and the wailing became so intense that lucas could hardly bear it then olson collapsed and the wailing stopped as though a switch had been thrown and the people of the audience looked at each other in stunned appreciation a man from one of the front rows went to kneel beside olson and then another and between them they got him back on his feet and led him to the side of the room and then out of sight the thin man whod been collecting money outside stepped into the light at the front of the church and said into the nowhushed room reverend olson will be back in a moment for those of you who are new to the church or our community and are interested in reverend olsons concept of plain i would like to say a few words there is no church of plain no money is collected there is no organization if you feel that you can be plain and you wish to be plain then make a vest or dont make a vest if you dont wish to some of us find it easier to make the vest as a reminder of what we are about but i dont want any of you women making vests for your men they should make their own and if it doesnt come out just right then show them how but let them do the work the vest wont save you its just a piece of cloth but youll find that it keeps you very very warm on the back of your song sheet weve included a little sketch a little pattern for making your vest there was a rustle of paper as people looked and the man said if youd like to sing youre welcome to if anyone is a bit too warm youre welcome to step outside for a bit so why dont we start with you are my sunshine and all of you singers make room for those who need to get out for a breath a number of people started moving toward the back and lucas grabbed jaels arm and they stepped over the last couple at the end of the pew into the aisle and out into the churchyard id say we got our moneys worth jael said looking back at the church the first chorus of you are my sunshine broke through the doors lucas was looking at the paper in his hand none of these songs are religious songs he said theyre all like oldtimey singalong songs you want to go back and sing jael asked no ive had about enough lucas said so have i when he started talking about plain that was like being electrocuted they walked back to the car climbed in and she said i know this is going to sound like the hollywood bullshit olsons trying to get away from but hes good hes really good at it something about the way he looks like a big tough hillbilly and his voice you gonna make a vest lucas asked theres something in what he says jael said especially if you dont have to sign up for the great christian march to the pearly gates the way he was talking anyone could be plain theres a lot of that plain feeling with potters except that its too late lucas said at this point being plain is purely a luxury that most of us cant afford like big expensive artist pots in the car she asked do you think that the blood was faked that he cut himself not unless hes the biggest hypocritical phony on the face of the earth and he sure doesnt give off that vibration but if he was the biggest hypocritical phony he wouldnt give off that vibration i dont know but ill tell you what i saw him go down faint or have some kind of a fit after his parents were killed and he wasnt faking that this thing tonight was over in that direction it looked real to me so hes nuts depends on your definition of nuts lucas said there are some genuine ecstatics running around out there and he apparently is one of them maybe theyre nuts i dont know you dont think he did it you dont think he killed plain jael said theres some evidence that he did i wasnt asking you a question jael said i know theres some evidence but i can tell you dont think he did it vbure wrong i think its possible that he did it but the being who did it is not the one we see tonight we saw a saint maybe theres a devil in there too we just havent seen it yet they were halfway back when lucass phone buzzed you turned your phone on jael asked i thought the joke was you never turned it on things are coming together lucas said as he rumbled it out if somebody makes a move i want to know it he thumbed the answer button yeah this is frank lucas wherere you at down on by france somebody moving your boy rodriguez is dead lester said what he mightve killed himself lester said thats what theyre saying cmon man howd he jumped down that open space thing inside a building what do you call it an atrium he jumped down the atrium in his building hes pretty busted up whos there couple of our guys and now st pauls coming in im heading over ive got to call rose marie and then im going see you there chapter twentyfour jael bitched and moaned but lucas dropped her at her studio before he went on to st paul and the st paul scene was a businessdistrict replay of the murder scene at silly hansons with cop cars piled up along the curb and four big tv vans parked illegally down the street reporters and cameramen milling around them a woman from one of the stations pointed at him at the porsche and lights came up putting a nearly opaque glare on the windshield as he threaded his way past them he could hear a woman shouting lucas lucas and somebody slapped the car he pulled in beside a jeep that he recognized as lesters got out showed his badge to a st paul cop and asked where the cop pointed at the buildings main doors and lucas walked in down a hallway toward a cluster of cops then out into the open atrium space rodriguez was still on the floor uncovered his face had been crushed like a milk carton lester nodded as lucas walked up ah for christ sakes lucas said in disgust who was on him pat stone and nancy winter he said over there stone and winter were both patrol cops borrowed for the loose net theyd had on rodriguez lucas walked over and asked what happened winter said he left here went out to his apartment went inside we saw the light come on in his living room and we were just getting snug when he walked back out and got in his car so then he drove over to a comp usa and went inside and bought some stuff we didnt get close enough to really see what he was getting and then he came back out and drove back down here you couldnt see what he bought no id already gone back outside but i could see him through the window at the cash register nothing big whatever it was still got to have it on him unless somebody took it in his briefcase all right then what happened i watched the ramp exit while pat ran back to the skyway and watched his office winter said when he showed up in his office then i was gonna call nancy back stone said picking up the story but he never showed up in the office i was in the skyway so we know he didnt go out that way arent there other skyway exits not open this late stone said only open my way you can only get out of the building three ways the skyway past me the parking ramp and the front door that has a pushbar the other ground floor doors are locked we thought maybe hed stopped in the can winter said i showed my badge to the lady in the ramps pay booth and then i got my keys out and started jingling them like i was looking for my car and walked up the ramp until i saw his car to make sure hed parked then i walked back out and pat still hadnt seen him so i sorta strolled over to the door and looked in i didnt have a key so i couldnt get in at that point and i saw this lump way down on the floor i wasnt sure what it was but i got the lady in the pay booth to let me inside and you saw him how long from the time he drove in the garage until you saw the lump lucas asked weve been trying to figure that out we were talking on cell phones so you can probably get the exact time from the calls but i figure it was about ten minutes winter said i think it might have been a little longer stone said i think it might have been ten minutes before you walked up the ramp then another few before you came back out then walked down and looked in the door maybe twelve or thirteen minutes you can tell from the phone calls winter repeated the two cops were anxious to get out from under lucas realized and he couldnt see what else they mightve done all right lucas said you done good guys stone glanced at winter relieved lucas went back to the circle of cops around rodriguezs body wheres his briefcase up there he pointed up at the railing around the second floor of the atrium he set it down before he took the dive if he took a dive hes a big guy to have somebody throw him over without a fight one of the st paul cops said goddamn tv was all over him he was about to lose his ass another one said lucas said i want to look in his briefcase crimescene guys working it one of the st paul cops said take the elevator lucas went up found a crimescene cop probing the briefcase papers he said this thing he held up a plastic box in his latexcovered hand what is it lucas asked the crimescene guy turned it in his hand zip disk twopack how about a receipt you see a receipt in there the cop dug back into the briefcase and came up with a slip of paper he held it away from himself in better light comp usa zip disk twopack lucas walked back downstairs the st paul chief of police was coming down the hall two steps behind del del lifted a hand and the st paul chief said he jump lucas said i dont know but id send a guy down to get his computer i think he came down to clean out his disk drive maybe changed his mind when he walked up to the railing they all looked up at the railing the st paul chief said woodbury is out at his apartment they say theres no note didnt have time to write one lucas looked at del you wanna ride out to woodbury del looked down at rodriguezs body then up at the railing and said might as well elvis has left the building as they stepped away the st paul chief said if he jumped he took a lot of problems with him on the way out to woodbury del called the woodbury cops and got directions rodriguezs apartment was in one of his own buildings the penthouse suite the cop said deploying a capital p thats what im told find out who was watching his phones tonight lucas said find out if there was a call del checked not a single call at his apartment today he said goddamnit rodriguezs building was a routinelooking apartment with a peagravel finish over concrete block double glass doors with a line of mailboxes and buzzers between the two doors a woodbury patrolman sent them to four the top floor his apartment door was open and lucas stepped in with del just behind dope money del said as soon as he was inside all the walls had flocked wallpaper the furniture all came from the same store and that was swedish modern highstyle graphics on the walls a plainclothes cop stepped toward them chief davenport im dave thompson how are ya this is del whatd you get not much yet hes got a lot of paper in his office taxes mostly no suicide note nothing like that we checked the answering machine nothing there no computer in the house talk to his neighbors hes only got one on this floor the cop said we havent been able to find them yet its a married couple they left here about six people downstairs said they looked like they were going out a little dressed up all right mind if i walk through no like i said there just isnt much to see mirrors in the bedroom big tv hes got a home theater lucas and del did a quick walkthrough all the way to the back the master bedroom was at the end of a central hall mirrors on the bedroom wall beside the bed and two more on the ceiling heavy pine chests and chestofdrawers with black metal fixtures the next room up was a small office with a builtin desk a rolodex a twodrawer filing cabinet and a telephone a cop was on his knees going through the cabinet grab the rolodex lucas said we will the theater had a projection tv and a wall of video and stereo equipment with a big blackleather circular couch facing it a leathercovered refrigerator sat next to the couch the room originally had been two bedrooms lucas thought the join was imperfect a ridge running around the ceiling and walls dope money del said a goddamn dealers wet dream the woodbury plainclothesman wandered toward them and lucas asked find anything like a wall safe no no nothing like that you might want to tear the place up a little lucas said its about fivetoone that he has a little hideout someplace in here check the power outlets see if any of them dont work del said thats a longtime crowd favorite lucas had stopped in the kitchen a book of matches lay open on the counter next to the sink you think he smoked lucas asked del del looked at the ceiling then at the curtains sniffed and said i dont think so why had these matches sitting here lucas picked them up then looked at the sink grains of black stuff in the strainer he put his finger in it and rubbed lightly and took it out what del asked the woodbury cop strained to see looks like ash lucas said he burnt something maybe lucas said and that was it a group of cops standing around on a carpet with toodeep burgundy pile looking at the leroy neiman print whatre we gonna do now del asked you think its a suicide yeah i could buy it it would solve a lot of problems id like to know a little bit about his medical history though del said doctors yeah see if he was depressed if hed ever been treated but maybe he just saw the walls coming own walked up to that atrium and just an impulse from the second floor christ lucas shook his head thats a high second floor you look down from there you know you aint gonna bounce im seeing a guy whos freaked out hes got tv all over his ass he knows hes in trouble on the dope hes built up this fortune and he sees it drifting away maybe hes even guilty about aliee who knows anyway he puts down his bag and dives over the rail sounded good maybe id give it a strong maybe del said reserving the right to change my mind so lets see what the me says lucas dropped del back downtown thought about going over to see jael decided against thought about calling weather but she wasnt the one to talk to about death and destruction not when they might be limping back to some kind of reconciliation and was that what they were talking about is that what she meant when she said he could call her what the fuck did she mean and why was he screwing around with jael and jesus he didnt even want to think about catrin so he went home thought about the game for a few minutes then took a shower and crawled onto his bed ran it all around his head and drifted off to sleep he woke twice during the night lay awake for an hour each time running it through in the morning he shaved showered and still tired headed into downtown st paul on the way he took out his cell phone and called the department photo guy i got a picture i want you to take he said chapter twentyfive friday the seventh day of aliee rodriguezs building had been cleaned up and was open for business except for the cops working on his computer nobody would have known lucas stopped at rodriguezs office and was introduced to his secretary a young woman who was dealing with her loss with equanimity ill be working by tomorrow night she told lucas in this economy a dead guy could get a job whoops maybe i oughta rephrase that do you think that richard would have committed suicide lucas asked he wasnt the moody type she said but she pressed a finger to her lips thinking on the other hand when he decided to do something hed do it impulsivelike real quick so i mean with all this publicity but i dont know maybe you really dont know a person until he does something like this and then of course you dont know him at all because hes dead so like you never really get a chance to know anybody you know when you think about it in the hall lucas told the st paul cop she seems to be dealing with it yeah a little too well if you ask me i wouldnt be surprised if she was holding a little cash for the boss or a little product cash maybe not dope shes too ditzy to be trusted with dope lucas said well probably find out that shes the brains behind the operation they both looked at her through the window slit beside the office door she was talking to another cop unconsciously twirling a ringlet of hair with an index finger lucas and the st paul cop looked back at each other and simultaneously said maybe not you know what i really need lucas said i need to find the maintenance guy the maintenance man looked worried ill do anything i can to help what i need to know is how would you get out of this building if you couldnt go out the ramp and you couldnt go out the front door and you couldnt go out the skyway you mean like if there was a mystery man here last night exactly the maintenance man thought about it couldnt do it he said finally hed need a key but all the keys are on two rings and you have to know what youre looking for before you can use one otherwise its just a bunch of numbers on the keys so if you wanted to get just one youd have to steal the whole ring which nobody did even then you still wouldnt know which key opened what until you tried them all thatd take a couple of days if thats all you did so lets say the guy didnt have a key well there are some windows on the second floor that open so he could lower himself down but thatd be pretty obvious i mean there are cars on the street at that time of night and its a long way down lucas said hed need a big rope yeah the maintenance man thought for another minute puzzled you say he cant go out through the garage nope well if it were me id hide in the building until the cops were gone and then id just jump out and walk away with the crowd lots of places to hide st paul went through here pretty thoroughly last night and this morning no kidding had me running around like a madman how about access to the alley nope them overhead doors lock with padlocks and ohh wait a minute what the regular door there theres a great big deadbolt on it but it opens from the inside lucas said yeah i never use it if we got a big delivery they ring and we open the overheads lets go look lucas suggested the maintenance man started toward the far end of the building it locks with a key from the outside you cant just pull it shut no nope gotta lock it with a key from the outside or with the knob from inside the maintenance man said they walked down the basement stairs along a dark corridor to a loading dock lucas stepped over to the access door the door was metal with a small window with inset wire mesh he said dont touch the lock you got any lights yeah the maintenance man found a wall switch and turned the lights on they both looked at the lock and lucas said the bolts open aw man lucas looked around the dock and asked did rodriguez ever get anything here his furniture probably you ever see him here otherwise no nobody comes down here except for deliveries unless theres something wrong with the plant hmph better go talk to st paul lucas said whatd st paul say del asked first they said it was all bullshit it didnt make any difference there was no indication that there was anyone else in the building then they started pissing on each other lucas said over here wed be shooting at each other thats a kinder gentler city lucas said they were walking across town lucas with a largesized manila envelope in one gloved hand the day was even colder than it had been early in the week and though the sky had turned blue a gusty wind was cutting along the streets shoppers were bundled in long coats and businessmen snarled into the wind if you dont tell me whats in the envelope im gonna be pretty fuckin embarrassed when we get there del said pretend like you knew all along yure just bustin my balls because you got up crabby nope im actually pretty cheerful lucas said and that surprises me del said i figure youve either solved the case or youre frickin jael corbeau why couldnt it be both lucas asked cheerfully nobodys that lucky del said so whats in the fuckin envelope let india tell you lucas said when we get to browns india philip the manager and the other woman whod looked at rodriguezs picture were waiting at the desk when lucas and del arrived at browns hotel lucas slipped a photograph out of the envelope and passed it across the photograph had been taken that morning with a digital camera and had been printed out only a halfhour earlier do you know this guy del tried to edge sideways to get a look but lucas cheerfully blocked him off thats him india said the other woman nodded and philip looking down his nose at the photo said yes ive seen him did he know derrick deal he may have philip said he probably did i think i saw the three of them talking once at least once so maybe he was definitely around here india said del reached out took the picture glanced at it and said its like i been telling you since the start lucas its that fuckin spooner youve got to be kidding rose marie roux said she was leaning back as far as she could in her office chair hands covering her eyes as if to block out the horror of it all weve already started taking credit on rodriguez he was murdered lucas said it kept me up half the night thinking about it and remember how we decided that if angela harris could make an accurate prediction about the murders of the olsons then wed have to pay close attention i remember so i was awake half the night working this out and when i got done i made two predictions first that id find a way the killer could have gotten out of rodriguezs building and second that the people at browns would recognize spooner im also making a third prediction we know we only got about half the people at the party franks got his people running pictures of spooner around to the party people we interviewed im predicting that somebody will put him at the party ah mother run it down for me rose marie said lucas ticked the points off we had a guy who came out of the slums of detroit with no education and two years later is setting up a miami corporation to buy legitimate apartments which he uses to wash his drug money thats a little too sophisticated if its too sophisticated where did he figure out how to do it how about a banker what does the banker get out of it how about dope money and women what does rodriguez get how about financing a way to wash his dope money and legitimacy he was a smart guy even if he didnt have much education what happens at the party who knows but spooner winds up killing sandy lansing maybe accidentally aliee witnesses the killing so he has to kill her he then evaporates maybe goes out the window i dont know in any case he doesnt come up on our party list hes not part of that crowd hes just lansings boyfriend and a lot of people dont even know her wait a minute rose marie said theres a fairly big jump in there all the other stuff is linked but thats a pure jump let me finish lucas said we identify rodriguez as being at that party because unlike spooner hes known to be rich and single and so he gets some attention from the other partygoers when albalah links rodriguez and lansing we assume that since they were dealeremployee that thered been a falling out we then assume that derek deal knew about them because we knew rodriguez was lansings boss we assume that deal went to rodriguez tried to blackmail him and got killed for his trouble but when i took a photo of rodriguez over to browns nobody recognized him and i remembered that back when i first talked to deal he wasnt absolutely sure that sandy lansing was a dealer he thought she might be but he didnt know and that suggests to me that he didnt know who her boss was he definitely knew who her boyfriend was we confirmed that today with the photo of spooner he went to spooner not rodriguez and he got killed of all the people who were at the party the ones most likely to finger spooner as being there were lansing who was dead and rodriguez who couldnt because that would drag the whole drugapartment deal out into the open so then i talk to spooner i try to intimidate him by suggesting that were about to bust rodriguez and let him know that were watching rodriguez that were all over him spooner realizes that if we really come down on rodriguez his goose is cooked rodriguez will try to stay clean as long as he can but hes not gonna suck it up for firstdegree murder hell talk to us and one thing that will come out is that spooner was at the party and spooner had some kind of relationship with lansing sex dope something hed be as good a suspect as rodriguez but if rodriguez commits suicide spooner knows were watching rodriguez and probably suspects that includes tapping the phone so he goes to rodriguezs apartment and slips a note under the door probably something unsigned maybe even typed it says something like theyre coming for you you gotta get anything incriminating off your computer burn this note and we find ashes in the sink at rodriguezs apartment del said though he could of flushed it nothing gets rid of paper like burning lucas said he continued so spooner watches rodriguez until he sees him leave for home then hides out in the building where he can watch the entrance from the ramp rodriguez goes home gets the note thinks oh man if they get the computer my goose is cooked he stops at comp usa to get a zip disk because he plans to dump his files to the zip disk then either writeover the hard drive or just take it out and throw it in the river theyre cheap enough spooner knows were watching so he cant just whack rodriguez and walk out the skyway or the ramp or the front door which would be the logical way to get out especially if youre in a little bit of a hurry he has to sneak out the basement door howd he know about that del asked who knows maybe from hanging around with rodriguez maybe he actually scouted the building the day before whatever the reason if rodriguez was murdered the killer snuck out as though he knew the place were being watched howd he kill him rose marie asked hit him with something flat and hard not a baseball bat because the wound would be wrong maybe a twobyfour ooo sting the hands del said he then hauls rodriguez over to the railing hangs him over head down and lets go rodriguez hits headfirst and hes gone lucas said ill tell you something rose marie said remember when those people were doing their swan dives over in the county government building i saw a couple of those they didnt go headfirst they just let themselves fall and generally landed flat rodriguez would have had to have made a conscious decision to dive to land headfirst that doesnt feel right even people who want to die dont want their identities erased their faces broken up i hadnt thought about that but youre right lucas said del nodded they all sat and thought about it rose marie swinging back and forth in her chair and finally she asked have you guys figured out the rest of it weve figured out that well never get him if thats what you mean del said lucas nodded weve publicly said or let it be known that we think there are two killers working one who killed lansing and aliee and somebody whos killing in revenge for those murders therefore the most likely candidate as the rodriguezkiller is that second man especially since rodriguezs name was leaked but we know it cant be because we were watching the guy whos probably the second man and he was clear over on the other side of town and the second man even if it isnt olson also wouldnt have known how to lure rodriguez back to his office wouldnt have known that rodriguez had a twentyfourhour police escort wouldnt have known about the phone taps all of which would count about zilch with a jury and wed already pretty much pinned the aliee and lansing killings on rodriguez and the details were leaking even the suicide fits its too late to change our minds del said xq if we did change our minds and we bust spooner the defense would put rodriguez on trial and theyd win rose marie said youve got me twothirds convinced its spooner but if you were talking to a jury itd still be eightytwenty for rodriguez all weve got as evidence on spooner is this long chain of lucas davenport suppositions suppositories del amended thats not totally true lucas said we can put him with both lansing and deal nobody could put deal with rodriguez if we can put him at the party itd be weak but usable if rodriguez wasnt there as an alternative candidate rose marie said you havent even suggested why hed kill lansing with rodriguez we could suppose it was some kind of criminal fallingout between wholesaler and retailer another ten seconds passed in silence then rose marie said so what do i tell olson hes coming in here in fifteen minutes so i can give him the official word on rodriguez and say that were satisfied that aliees killer is dead what do i say now bullshit him lucas said tell him that theres some evidence that rodriguez was the one but were continuing to examine other possibilities hes gonna want some kind of closure rose marie said fuck closure lucas said nobody gets closure with this bunch nobody deserves it del muttered lucas asked del to check with the homicide cops who were circulating spooners picture among the known partygoers ive got to do some paper he said maybe when youre uptodate with homicide you could check with marcy tell her ill be over as soon as i can when del was gone lucas went back to his office locked the door looked at his watched leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes ten minutes later his eyes popped open time to move he got up walked back down to rose maries office and peeked door closed he stepped inside and asked the secretary the olson bunch in there yup a pretty sadlooking bunch too lucas backed out of the office got his coat put it over his arm oon and went to the end of the hall where he could see the chiefs office door but where somebody also might think he was waiting for somebody to come in the front door out on the street the media wagons were piled up a squarejawed trenchcoated reporter was doing a standup with city hall as background more air time for aliee a cop named hampstad wandered by leered at lucas and said you hear the one about the guy with the headache aw jesus lucas said guy goes to the doc and he says doc you gotta help me i got this terrible headache it feels like somebody is pounding a nail through my forehead like i got a big pair of pliers squeezing behind my ears its tension from my job i cant stop working right now but the headaches killing me you gotta help so the doc says you know i do have a cure exactly the same thing happened to me i was working too much and i got exactly the same headache then one night i was performing oral sex on my wife and her legs were squeezing my head really tight really hard and the pressure must have done something because the headache was a lot better so i did this every night for two weeks and at the end of two weeks the headache was gone and the guy says im desperate doc ill try anything the doc said well then ill see you in two weeks so the guy goes away and two weeks later he comes back for his appointment and hes the most cheerful guy in the world and he says doc youre a miracle worker i did just what you told me and the headaches gone vanished i feel great i think its got to be the pressure and by the way youve got a beautiful home saw it coming lucas said without cracking a smile bullshit saw it coming youre cracking up inside hampstad said have i mentioned our sensitivity sessions we have them fuck a bunch of sensitivity hampstad grumbled nobody has a sense of humor around this place anymore at the end of the hall olson stepped through the chiefs door and lucas pushed away from the wall gotta go he said he walked down to the front doors looked at the media wagons for a count of twenty then started back toward the chiefs office he heard them as he was coming to the corner and nearly ran headlong into olson they milled for a second lucas said sorry sorry excuse me and then olson said chief davenport we just talked to the chief yes i knew you were coming not very satisfying olson said she was much more i dont want to say evasive but she was much less positive than i had expected about this rodriguez man lucas looked at him for a long beat then at the rest of the group from burnt river could i speak to you privately for just a minute lucas said olson nodded looked at the burnt river people said excuse me for a minute and he and lucas walked down the hall toward the front door the chief is uh did you know i came to see you preach last night i thought that might be you in the back i wasnt sure olson said i was impressed im not from the same stream of christianity as you im a roman catholic but i was affected lucas said letting himself grope for the words what im trying to say is i know youre a good man i could see it last night i hate lying to you the chief wasnt lying but to tell you the truth most of us think that rodriguez was innocent that he may have been murdered himself what olson was stunned but his voice was hushed then who a banker named william spooner he essentially set rodriguez up in the drug business showed him how to launder his money he was carrying on an affair with sandy lansing then why dont you were investigating him every way we can but to be honest please dont tell anyone i told you this its going to be very difficult to get him on this the two chief witnesses against him would be sandy lansing and rodriguez himself theyre both dead and even if we arrested him a defense attorney could simply prosecute rodriguez during spooners trial and frankly rodriguez is a much more inviting suspect even if he didnt do it are you saying that spoonerll never be punished olson asked i dont know whats going to happen i really dont lucas said i dont know what to say olson said i should talk to chief roux again dont do that itll just cause problems for her shes trying as hard as she can with all the media attention she wants the media to concentrate on rodriguez for a few days since it cant hurt him anymore while we go after spooner this is i dont know ill tell you what you can do lucas said trying to feel the sincerity you can pray for us after what i saw last night i believe it will do some good olson looked at him for a moment a speculative examination of several seconds then said i will lucas said goodbye shaking olsons hand then walked through the group of burnt river people down the hall and to his office felt the dark finger of hypocrisy stroking his soul all for justice he thought or for something winning maybe lucas waited in his office until he figured olson would be gone then walked down to homicide to talk to lester we need to put a couple of people on william spooner he said more to cover him than to watch him whats going on lester asked i just gave spooners name to olson i didnt tell rose marie so shell have a little insulation but if olson starts wandering around in his car and were too far back he could walk right up to spooners front door and nail him before we could catch up man i dont know about this lester said shaking his head we were willing to do it with jael and catherine kinsley use them as decoys and they werent even guilty of anything yeah but they sorta volunteered lester said they had no choice frank their names got leaked and played in the papers and on television and somebody in this department leaked them they wouldnt have volunteered if their names hadnt already been out there all right all right i get a little puckeredup sometimes will you put some guys with him yup ill do it now one more thing if you dont mind lucas said i talked to spooner about coming in today with his attorney i dont want to do that now tell him that after rodriguezs death were reassessing the case and it may not be necessary for him to come in at all i can do that id do it but i dont want to talk to him lucas said we dont want to lie to him at this point after leaving homicide lucas walked over to the hospital del was just leaving took her back into intensive care he said he looked a little frightened pneumonias getting on top of her can she talk lucas asked shes asleep they say its controllable but she looks worse to me than she did yesterday ah man let me see del went back inside with him a nurse led them in but marcy was asleep as del said back outside lucas led the way to weathers office nobody home what do you do around here to find out whats going on black left ten minutes ago to get something to eat he said theyre still optimistic what does he think hes not a doctor del said i know but what does he think he thinks shes getting into trouble del said they went back down to intensive care and stood outside and looked at her after a while they walked back to city hall lucass door had a see me asap note on it from loring lucas and del walked down to homicide and found loring taking a statement from a pale blond man dressed all in black in a different age he might have been an undertaker whats going on lucas asked there you are loring said this is john dukeljin he was at the party at sallance hansons he picked william spooner out of a photo spread says he was at the party ooo lucas said thats excellent almost sure dukeljin said he was leaving we were coming back i saw him coming down the front walk silly has that lowvoltage lighting all along there we could see him quite clearly and i pointed him out to my friend but he got to the end of the walk before we did and he went the other way why did you point him out to your friend was there something about him lucas asked i thought he might be gay dukeljin said mr dukeljin and his friend are gay loring said why he was carrying a bag carrying a bag is way over with for men but usually if you see a man carrying one you know unselfconsciously its something to think about lucas looked at loring sometimes you show a tiny flicker of intelligence vbure just jealous loring said what del asked we never found sandy lansings purse loring said if we had we probably would have made her as a dealer lucas looked at dukeljin do you think your friend would recognize spooner i havent been able to get in touch hes out on a project hes an engineer but i pointed this fellow out im sure hell remember that and the bag you know because its so over with i dont know if hell exactly remember the face wheres this project lucas asked in rochester something to do with the mayo clinic hell be back tonight dukeljin said lester came in while they were talking and said loring told you yup pain in the ass lucas itd be better for everyone if it was rodriguez close the books and walk away cant do that yeah i know lester said i just talked to rose marie and she said the spooner id was your third prediction shes a believer so ive got four guys all night with spooner and were tracking olson somethings got to pop soon theres just too much pressure building if anything happens have them call me s weather called i understand you were checking on marcy sherrill and stopped up yeah were pretty worried lucas said i talked to the people in medicine and they still think shell be okay they got on it right away shes in intensive care so they can keep a closer eye on her tom black is probably hanging around there could you tell him that hes really sweating it lucas said sure ill walk down there now and i want to get together i need to talk with you lucas said but you know what its like i heard about the rodriguez fellow doesnt that solve a lot of problems no not really ill tell you about it could we get lunch tomorrow sure it might be a little late ive got two jobs tomorrow and the second ones scheduled for ten oclock thats okay ill try to get over there listen just call me anytime ill keep my cell phone on and ill run over whenever youre ready at the end the day lucas stopped back to look in on marcy no change he walked back to the parking ramp got his car and headed south to jael corbeaus studio shed been making pots a couple of new cops were sitting around in her studio watching when lucas walked in she looked up and said dinner time talked me into it he said one of the cops said thats the goddamnedest thing ive ever seen you oughta see her make pots its like weird interesting jael said if i got interested in that the cop asked is there someplace i can take lessons yeah about a hundred she said this is one of the big ceramics places in the country its so goddamned neat he said the other cop raised his eyebrows and shook his head playing with mud jael looked at him and said playing with mud can be fun and she dragged the tip of her tongue over her upper lip oh god take me now im ready to go the cop said and jael laughed and said to lucas ten minutes to clean up they ate at a fastfood place on ford parkway a few blocks from lucass house we could go see a movie lucas suggested why dont we go for a hike walk up the river path pretty cold itd feel good im stuck in that house im not staying in much longer jael said another couple of days and then im leaving for new york let him find me if he can they dropped the porsche at lucass house and walked a mile up the river road talking about the day lucas told her his doubts about rodriguez and the possibility that somebody else was involved she told him about talking with the cops as she shifted through her day and the one cop who might actually be interested in ceramics or interested in your ass lucas said i can tell the difference you can tell the way a persons face lights up when he sees a pot being thrown she said he really thought it was neat he was amazed well maybe hell get into it youre not the potter type she said no but i like the potter types you certainly demonstrated thats not what i meant he said with a little impatience i like people who can do things craftsmen good carpenters good bricklayers good reporters good cops its all sort of the same they walked out to cretin turned south back toward lucass house weird name for a street she said named after a bishop he said ive got a friend who went to school in normal illinois and another guy who went to cretin the high school in st paul theyve always had this idea that they ought to get cretin and normal tshirts and hang out that would be funny for about one second she said after that it would get annoying back at the house lucas shut the door behind them and jael said now i feel hot after all that cold air want a beer i got a movie the other day streets of fire looks neat in a cheesy way tot all right lucas went and got two beers and when he came out she had the dvd case and was dropping the disk in the dvd player lucas punched up the tv with the remote handed her one of the beer bottles and dropped onto the couch the movie came up and jael took a hit on the beer then set it on the coffee table and peeled off her sweatshirt she was wearing a plaid shirt under that and under that a bra she dropped them all on the floor then peeled off her jeans and underpants and picked up the beer maybe we could have some sex while were watching the movie she said if you play your cards right lucas said manipulating the remote move over to the left youre blocking the screen ill block the screen she said she straddled one of his legs and started tugging at his belt buckle ill block the damn screen chapter twentysix saturday day eight he took jael back home at two oclock then restless and awake a little moody from the sex he took west to the belt line decided at the last minute to go north and drove the north then east across the north side of the metro area then south again and back into st paul on the trip took most of an hour and he used the time to think about jael and weather and catrin he felt a strong tie to weather he couldnt help it if she called in the morning and said to hell with it lets get married next week hed probably say yes on the other hand she was making some preliminary moves toward what might be a reconciliation and he was sleeping well not sleeping with jael he was risking the weather tie with a woman who wouldnt be around long he knew jael would be moving on and jael knew he knew it and when he wasnt looking at her he hardly thought about her at least on a conscious level but his car kept steering itself to her doorstep and he kept winding up in a bed or on a couch or on the floor with her and he liked it most of that was jael herself she was not selfconscious about sex and not particularly concerned that lucas enjoyed himself she was getting her own and letting lucas take care of himself which he did and he liked that this was serious casual sex so now he was going to lunch with weather the lunch had the feel of a crisis meeting if nothing happened tomorrow it was likely nothing would happen at all a moment was occurring he could pick it up or let it go and he really wanted to pick it up but maybe if he could just get another week of rolling around with jael maybe two weeks he thought of the legendary quote from st augustine that so beguiled his highschool classmates who were headed for a seminary please lord make me pure but not yet then there was catrin a problem that might be more serious than jael she pulled on him and he couldnt help thinking that if it didnt work with weather it might yet work with catrin he was curious about her liked her a lot twenty years before might have gotten serious about her twenty years ago and as he thought about it he wondered if one reason that hed never married was the relationship hed had with her so long ago she had somehow immunized him against marriage that that had been a moment and on that moment hed passed he pushed the porsche down the ramp on to let it wind kicked it out of the chute and past a firebird like the pontiac was parked and decided that his brain was getting tired of italics had to make a decision but if he could just get another week or two out of jael could he be happy did he even want to be fuck it he said aloud but he didnt mean it he was hanging a little over on a nearly empty interstate when he passed snelling avenue thirty seconds later he flashed past a highway patrolman going the other way on the other side of the highway he saw the flashers come up and grinned took the porsche up the ramp at cretinvandalia and turned left toward home the guy had no chance at ten oclock the next morning a cop called to say that olson was moving we dont know what hes doing he got out on the interstate and hes done a couple of laps around the st paul side he stopped once at white bear avenue to get gas how close has he gotten to highland park he took e from to so he went right past spooners exit at randolph or at seventh if hed gotten off at either one we would have been screaming our heads off but hes just driving keep calling me lucas said weather called while he was in the shower ive got a problem she said no lunch he asked dripping water on the hallway floor she could hear the disappointment im sorry but this thing just came up and ive got to deal with it doesnt sound medical lucas said its not lucas im being damnit we need to sit down and talk this out i have not had a sexual relationship since we split up why face a disappointment any sooner will you shut up will you just shut the fuck up for a minute she said all right he said i have not had a sexual relationship but there was this doctor the frenchman you know about this she asked i know you were going out with some frenchman not going out with i went out with him three times or four times or maybe i dont know five or six times we never really stopped or anything i was busy or he was busy and it sort of drifted and then he had to go back to paris for a while he came back yeah he called last night and he wanted to have lunch today she said he was pretty insistent even when i said i was pretty busy i think ive got to go talk to him and im ultimately not interested in frenchmen she said well jesus weather why dont you just tell him to blow it out his froggy ass i dont think that would exactly be a diplomatic way to handle it you arent the fuckin state department he let himself get a little angry about it and ive got to work with him hes an important guy around here they talked for another minute or two and he let himself get a little angrier and at the bottom of it was satisfied that she was impressed by the anger then he went back to the shower finished cleaning up and got dressed all right he picked up the phone and dialed jael she answered on the third ring and he said your problem is youre too victorian thats my problem all right she said lazily hang on he could hear her yell its okay its for me and then she was back have you had breakfast im barely awake its not even tenthirty she said ill come get you if you want cant ive got a halfdozen people coming at noon were working out a joint show and weve got way too many people were trying to figure out how to screw some of them youre welcome to come over but you wouldnt like the people and i dont want any of them thrown out any windows goddamnit i cant find anyone to talk to this morning he said and tonight my dads getting in were all going over to the airport to pick him up so no dinner no midnight snack you ever tried phone sex she asked tried once but it doesnt work i feel like a silly jerkoff thats sort of inevitable she said on the other hand im good at giving it i wouldnt want to use the word brilliant but then im a modest kind of guy really thats interesting she said i mean how would you start it are you still in bed yeah what are you wearing he asked a flannel nightshirt and underpants and socks she said socks jesus that makes it a little harder lucas said come on davenport all right you know that fake indian dreamcatcher youve got hanging over your sink yeah go get it he said go get it what for listen are you going to do this or not well i just wanted to know vbure gonna need that hawk feather he said after a moment she said hang on wait a minute you still there she came back yes didnt i see one of those lady remington legshavers in the bathroom yes bring that too lucas said ill tell you right now im not shaving anything she said you dont use those things to shave lucas said you use them to shave you naive little waif you ill be right back she said the city hall was quiet there were fewer tv trucks at the curb and the homicide office was mostly empty del called on the cell phone and said hot damn youve turned it on yeah whats going on nothing i was just calling to ask all right im turning this fucking thing off no dont do that listen im gonna take off with the old lady this afternoon go see an aunt of hers and then maybe go look at some carpet youre doing carpet yeah maybe for the family room all right well see you later he wound up in his office with all the paper on the case he found nothing new but strengthened his sense that spooner was at the bottom of it then lester called and said that the gay friend of john dukeljin who had identified spooner as being at the party and carrying a shoulder bag remembered seeing a man with a bag but couldnt pick spooner out of a photo spread par for the course lucas said you find anybody else two other people think they saw him but the guy is sort of a nebbish and the light was bad they had those strobe things you dance to so thats what we got rose marie called and said heres a mystery for you why would the head of the state highway patrol call me up at home and say tell that fuckin davenport to knock it the fuck off lucas thought for a moment must be political he said hes a republican i thought it might be something like that she said is olson coming in this afternoon lucas asked no i told him wed call if there were any serious developments all right im outa here see you monday and lucas knock it the fuck off whatever it is he called catrin at her home ready to hang up at a mans voice what are you doing she didnt need to ask who it was a good sign well im moving out when im staying with a friend tonight jack seems to be mostly amused she said maybe he thinks im going through some kind of phase its making me really angry if youd like to get a bite and talk ill meet you halfway god lucas could we tomorrow she asked im just really jammed today i mean i packed away my daughters first communion pictures okay okay dont tell me youve got my cell phone you never answer its now permanently on at least for the duration of the aliee thing ill call you he had wicked designs on three women was worried sick about how he could possibly juggle them and he couldnt get a date theyll always take you at saks he said to his office walls they took him at saks for a lot lucas how are you the customshop salesman said we have got something for you ive been saving it two new fabrics from italy you wont believe that theyre wool he killed two hours at saks and wrote a check for three thousand dollars and took a call halfway through the fitting from the cops who were tailing olson we got a concept the cop said im interested we just took olson back to his motel hes preaching tonight down in west st paul you know where the southview country club is yeah hell be at a church right around there he actually got off this tour he was doing and drove into the church parking lot like he was just figuring out where it was then he went back to driving and finally wound up here at the motel and what we got to thinking was what if hes timing something huh yeah when you think about it west st paul and spooners place in highland park you dont connect them but if you look at a map it aint far about six miles and most of that is interstate he could do a round trip in less than fifteen minutes what if he does his weird preaching thing then tells the pastor or whoever that he needs to be alone for a bit to recover or thinks of some shit like that goes out to his car runs over to highland park wastes spooner runs back and there he is all those witnesses who say he was at the church sounds hollywood yeah well thats our concept could be his concept too how many guys we got on spooner tonight two or four ill make sure its four you need any more help on olson lucas asked if he goes to the church we could use one more car for a while anyway all right get me a radio and ill come out and sit with you im not doing anything he spent the rest of the afternoon walking around town got his hair cut visited a game store three bars and a gun shop where a dealer tried to sell him a scout rifle by steyr id have to shoot a deer that dressed out at pounds to get my money back lucas said looking at the rifle on the hoof thats a pound whitetail thats a whitetail the size of a chevy pickup its not the deer its the aesthetics of the machinery the dealer said the dealer had quit his job as an english teacher to take up gun sales look at this piece the bolt handles weird lucas said its german its weird forget the bolt for a minute look whys the scope way out there on the end ill tell you why the dealer pointed out the window swing it at something across the street keep both eyes open and then let your right eye just look through the scope lucas swung whoa thats nice you shoot where youre looking they didnt mean it to be but this is the perfect north woods deer rifle theres never been anything better calibers too small as too small have you been smokin something strange a is absolutely not for a pound deer and the bolt handles weird you arent the artist i thought you were davenport the dealer said i can barely contain my disappointment at six oclock he drifted down toward west st paul located the church then got dinner at a steak house and made it back to the church a little before seventhirty he hooked up with one of the surveillance cops a guy from intelligence and got a radio and a pair of binoculars im getting pretty tired of this the cop said maybe something will pop lucas said where do you want me see that hill if you go up there there are a row of houses where the backyards look right down on the parking lot if you could go up there find somebody at home and hustle them a little how will i know which car is olsons call us when youre set and when olson rolls in and hes inside ill walk over to his car and point a flashlight up at you well have somebody inside the church watching olson were most concerned that he might find a way to sneak out and get rolling before we know it or maybe have another car ditched here by one of his burnt river pals all right ill set up lucas found a house with lights showed his id and got permission to sit out on the patio the owner dug a webbed folding chair out of a lawn shed and gave it to him olson was already moving a little early he arrived twenty minutes before he was due to preach the intelligence cop spotted the car for him and lucas settled down to wait the radio burped every few minutes when olson started preaching when other cars came or went and an occasional observation on life four people in two cars were at spooners watching front and back and they weighed in from time to time spooner was at home but the front drapes were drawn then spooners garage lights came on and a minute later spooner backed out in his car the people watching him scrambled spooner drove five blocks to a super america bought something walked a halfblock to a blockbuster video rented a movie and drove back home the garage door went down the watchers settled in the guy on the radio said olsons getting cranked the crowds rolling with him a minute later theres a guy coming from the north side hes walking a pooch got him then one of the cops watching spooner said spooner just came out in his shirt hes looking up at his roof what the fuck is he spooners down spooners down holy shit dave dave do you see and they lost them and then they were back west west west jesus go back no go back jesus get ems down here get ems lucas was running around the house into his car every step of the way he could hear people screaming on the radio in one minute he was on mendota road in two minutes on robert street then on and he was moving as fast as he could without killing anyone flashing past cars weaving through traffic praying that he wouldnt run into a highway patrolman running and all the time the traffic on the radio became more shrill goddammit were losing him were losing him we need some goddamn help somebody lucas made and headed north and called im coming up if youve got a runner tell me which way then a cop coming back we dont know we dont know i thought you said you were losing him spooner spooner were losing spooner wheres the shooter wheres the shooter i dont know man i dont know we never saw him dave where are you dave did you get west then dave i got west man but i dont see anything nothing moving lucas if youre coming in get up on the seventh street ramp and put on your flashers and see if anybody shies away lucas thought hes gone if they were down to blocking ramps the shooter was gone and he was spooner died on his front lawn with his wife screaming over him and two cops trying to stop the blood with their hands he took a magnum slug four inches to the left of his sternum he took a couple of minutes to die but he didnt know it except for technical purposes he was dead when the slug hit ins chapter twentyseven lester drove over from minneapolis in time to see the body hauled away he and lucas stood on the spooners lawn and watched the ramsey county me working and lester said we may be fucked personally i mean we gotta go talk to rose marie so she wont be blindsided by the press i know lucas said before we do that we ought to wring out olson and we have to fill in st paul on what we were doing and get them to grab spooners papers and his computers and close off his safedeposit boxes get some people in early tomorrow and notify every bank inside a couple hours driving time about the boxes and maybe get a warrant for the house and grab any keys hes got jesus lucas its gonna look like we got him killed and then were persecuting his wife lester said persecuting his wife wont make a hell of a lot of difference if they hang us for killing her husband lucas said but if spooners dirty then we might kick loose of the whole thing weve got to go after him hard aw man lester was shaken up he kept coming back to the body still on the ground now under a tarp listen this aint you lucas said this is me im the one who tipped olson there are only two possibilities olson tipped the killer hes managing the killer or somebody else put the killer on spooner i dont think anybody else leaked spooners name its gotta be olson so what do we do ill go talk to rose marie you stay out of it i wont mention your name ill just tell her that i asked you to put a couple people on spooner and thats really what happened except that i went along with it lester said bullshit i didnt ask you before i did it afterwards what were you gonna do tell olson to forget the name and you were just helping protect rose marie by not running to her right away aw man just sit tight lucas said he got on the phone and called del filled him in im gonna go shake olson if you want to come along ill meet you del said do you know where he is ill have the guys at the church call us when he heads back to his motel we want to get him alone a st paul cop across the street in the backyard of the house opposite spooners was yelling something and two st paul plainclothesmen trotted toward him something going on lester said lucas hung up his phone and got on the radio called the cops watching olson tell me when hes heading back to the motel the minute he heads that way you got it chief back on the phone calling the cops who were watching jael somebody may be coming keep her away from the windows keep her away from the doors if anything moves shoot it he and lester walked across the street one of the st paul plainclothesmen said we got a shell what kind one of the patrol cops whod found it said mag hes shooting a rifle lucas said one of those ruger carbines i bet the shell ejected and this one he couldnt find what does that tell us lester asked damned if i know lucas said lucas called rose marie ive got a problem ive got to come see you what happened ill come see you lucas said rose marie lived in a comfortable neighborhood on the south side of minneapolis a fifteenminute drive from spooners lucas didnt think about what he was going to say except that whatever it was he had to cover lester and the other cops rose maries husband was just walking out the door with the family cocker spaniel when lucas arrived as long as its not another killing he said genially i hate to wreck your mood lucas told him grimly oh boy here in town over in st paul thats a little break rose marie was reading she dropped the book on the floor when lucas pushed through the front door and called hello lucas whats going on william spooner was shot to death a halfhour ago over in st paul my god she was appalled its worse than that he said he told her the story made it as flat as he could she listened without much change of expression and when he finished said let me think for a minute she took the full minute and then said were gonna have to talk to the mayor i can put it off until early afternoon then what i dont know youve saved several peoples butts over the years but this could be tough especially if we cant make spooner as the guy who killed rodriguez and the others you dont sound nearly as pissed off as i thought youd be lucas said well she shrugged im not i know what you were doing the fact is spooners name would have leaked sooner or later just like rodriguezs and just like the muffdiving thing this way we controlled it i controlled it lucas said i think for damagecontrol purposes we ought to keep the emphasis on me id especially hate to see anyone else get hurt she shook her head i think its just you and me if they hang you theyll get me for not controlling the department which is bullshit its politics she said anyway i can put it off until after lunch you say you want to shake olson go do it ill get the st paul chief moving and serve some warrants on mrs spooner god help her if we can get something going by noon or one oclock the mayorll think twice before he throws us to the dogs if we actually get somebody if we start a hunt with an actual name then weve solved the crimes especially if we can make the case against spooner then weve solved the crimes and the whole thing becomes moot lucas looked at his watch fifteen hours he left rose maries house in a better mood than when he arrived but the leaking of spooners name seemed in retrospect unforgivably stupid on the other hand if it had worked it would have seemed brilliant like napoleon at waterloo beaten by a hairsbreadth but beaten the cops at the church called olson was moving west on headed back toward his motel lucas scrambled to get to dels picked him up and filled him in on the spooner ploy so youre now one of four people who know what happened he said should have worked del said we had a wrong concept in our heads lucas said we figured the killer walked up close range like he had to with plain and bang a pistol but he was only close with plain because he had to be he was inside a building a fuckin rifle man if wed found a shell from a would have had a twoblockwide net around spooner but a i assumed it was a pistol sod we all del said i wonder why that chick in the matrix building yeah the oriental chick why she didnt see the rifle if that was him its a small gun man you could put it down your pants leg if you wanted to walk with a limp del thought it over looking out the window at the dark then howd he get spooner to come outside huh i didnt ask that lucas said the surveillance guys said he came out and looked at his chimney you got your phone yeah call st paul see if spooner took a call st paul was already working it spooner took a call the st paul cops said supposedly from a neighbor down the block who said spooner might have a chimney fire spooner had run outside to look his wife said st paul was in the process of tracking the calling number that could be interesting lucas said got a buck that says its from a pay phone del said olson beat them to the motel by ten minutes lucas and del checked in with the surveillance cops then headed up to olsons room i want you down the hallway out of sight lucas said im going in hard if i need you to interrupt ill call you on the cell phone and ill ask for an update as though i were calling downtown give me a minute then come knock on the door how do i come in soft he might need somebody to give him a little sympathy del stayed out of sight lucas knocked on the door heard a mans voice call just a minute and a minute later olson came to the door buckling his belt he looked out past the privacy chain frowned and said chief davenport we got to talk lucas said sure olson slipped the chain out and lucas banged in hard put a hand on olsons chest before he had a chance to react and shoved him back against the bed olson fell back on it and lucas kicked the door shut and screamed how the fuck did you do it who are you working with olson eyes wide tried to sit up but lucas crowded against his legs slipped his out of its holster and held it by his side what whatre dont give me that shit lucas said you set him up you know you set him up you got your own parents killed and i dont want to hear any bullshit what what lucas took a breath i told one guy about bill spooner one guy you so tonight bill spooner is shot to death on his own lawn in front of his wifes eyes coldblooded murder shot with a rifle i dont i oh no no no olson stuttered i told i told i told oh no i told four people i told four people my god i told four people who but the question died with a knock on the door del should have stopped any visitors lucas stepped back opened the door looked del was standing in the corridor something came up he said he looked past lucas at olson who was now sitting up on the bed lucas stepped back and del asked you already tell him about spooner yes del looked at olson spooner was lured out on his front lawn by somebody who told him he had a chimney fire the st paul police traced the phone call it came from a cell phone registered to your mother what to your mother del repeated olson looked from lucas to del my god im sorry he said i didnt know she had her own phone you didnt have anything to do with it lucas said skeptically i told four people olson said at dinner friday night i told the bentons and the packards where are they now they went back home for the weekend olson said how far is burnt river lucas asked five hours by car do you have their phone numbers lucas asked yes of course i want you to call them lucas said if somebody answers like mrs benton i want you to ask for her husband if mr benton answers i want you to come up with a reason to talk with his wife just thank them for helping you out id feel like id be betraying them olson said but you wont be if theyre home lucas said ill know people are dying del said olson made the calls from the motel phone with lucas listening on an extension both couples were at home couldnt be them olson said you only told four people lucas said only those four we walked across the street to perkins and had dinner together before they left right after dark on friday lucas thought for a moment burnt river burnt river what if theyd been going about this all wrong or half wrong a deep old connection but not family someone whod known her from the old days someone whod he picked up the phone and called lane you know that genealogy you made up who was the guy who nailed aliee on the baseball diamond gimme a minute im watching the game lane said a moment later he was back louis friar he said the people up there call him the reverend but he doesnt know why thanks im running talk to you tomorrow lucas said he turned back to olson who is louis friar hes a guy up in burnt river would either the bentons or packards know him lucas asked yes his parents especially louiss parents and my parents and the bentons and the packards and a few other families were all in the same social circle play cards and stuff he once had a sexual relationship with aliee thats just a rumor everybody in burnt river believes it they all seem to think it happened yes i know olson said do you think he might have felt protective toward her you think he might have no no hes just a guy hes got a lawn service he goes around to resorts and stuff and does landscape maintenance single guy del asked yes deer hunter probably i dont know him that well he was a couple years behind me in school lucas got back on the phone called rose marie call the airport authorize the big chopper we need to go to burnt river right now tonight three of us you think you might make the fifteen hours she asked got my fingers crossed lucas said get over to the airport ill call chapter twentyeight to lucas it felt like three in the morning like hed been up forever but the chopper lifted off a few minutes before ten oclock with lucas del and olson in the back before they left the metro area lucas called the howell county sheriffs department got switched to the sheriff and gave him a quick summary he asked if a sheriffs department car could meet them at the sheridan airport the nearest to burnt river the sheriff said hed send a couple of cars and would ride along himself kind of interesting he said the flight took a little over an hour lucas was unaffected fixedwing planes scared him when they came down unexpectedly the people inside wound up as postagestampsized pieces of meat with a helicopter you always had a chance the sky had been mostly cloudy in the cities but they put down at sheridan under crystalline skies with stars as brilliant as those that lucas had watched from his cabin the week before they were met by two ford explorers with light racks the sheriff and two deputies climbed out to shake hands and the sheriff said who do we want to find first this friar guy ifeah lucas said if hes not around well want to talk with his parents and take a look at his house see if theres any sign that he might be involved with aliee you might have trouble getting a warrant if youve got nothing more than an urge to look around the sheriff said he was a squareshouldered squarefaced man with a brush mustache he wore jeans and cowboy boots even with the snow our judges arent all that cooperative weve narrowed down the number of people outside the police department who knew about the man who was shot tonight lucas said there were exactly five that includes mr olson here and we know where he was tonight and two burnt river couples who are here at home but if friar isnt here and he couldnt be if hes involved in the shooting tonight not unless hes got his own chopper then we think hes worth looking at he once had a sexual involvement with aliee okay i know the guy now one of the deputies said if hes the guy who nailed aliee they call him the reverend what do you think the sheriff asked the deputy you think he could do it far as i know hes just a good ol boy the deputy said he mightve had a couple of dwis over the years nothing serious how about if his parents tell us they told him about spooner lucas asked might get you a warrant on that the sheriff said especially since its aliee so lets go lucas said del and lucas got in the back of the sheriffs truck while olson got in with the other two deputies once inside del told the sheriff i told your guys to kinda keep an eye on olson he said hes not entirely out of the woods yet they can do that the sheriff said he pulled a cell phone from his pocket turned it on ran through a call list and pushed a button a minute later he said hey carl this is me you get anything on friar yeah when at mcleods uhhuh uhhuh okay were going out that way then he rang off and looked at lucas you may have wasted a trip the burnt river town cop says a guy he ran into at the yerinandout store saw friar shooting pool with some friends at mcleods tavern out on the lake they were there a halfhour ago goddamnit lucas said so what do you want to do the sheriff asked were here lets talk to him lucas said then we can go wake up the bentons and packards and find out what they have to say it had to come out of here someplace along the line it had to come from olson the bentons or the packards but he was no longer sure of it what if it was a departmental leak or what if olson was lying and he was running another guy one of his disciples maybe somebody who thought olson was jesus whatever you say the sheriff said he called the other car and they swung toward mcleods mcleods looked exactly like five hundred other lakeside taverns snowcovered parking lot with mounds of plowed snow on the side fake darkbrown logcabin styling small windows under the eaves at the front a christmas wreath on the door snowmobile parking at the lakeside we dont have any snow in the cities yet lucas said as they pulled in thats because youre practically living in miami the sheriff said i guess that accounts for the palm trees outside the office del said to lucas talk in the bar stopped when they all walked in lucas could feel the heads turning they clumped down toward the game room through a haze of barbecue smoke the deputy who knew the reverend said thats him in the red shirt louis friar was focusing on the fiveball when he saw them all coming he stood up and grounded his cue and said evening sheriff he looked puzzled then saw olson and said hi tom sorry about aliee jeez the sheriff said could you come back over here and talk with us for a bit sure whatd i do friar handed his cue to a friend nothing apparently but we need to talk the sheriff said they got in a corner away from the bar and lucas quickly told friar the problem well yeah my folks told me he said i mean i couldnt have told you the guys name tonight but i couldve told you friday night and all day yesterday spooner right banker did you tell anybody lucas asked well sure those guys over there they all turned and looked at the three men friar had been shooting pool with when did you tell them friday night i guess my folks got home about ten oclock and we just had that snow come through i was over there blowing out their drive and they told me i came down here afterwards for a couple brew skies you know i told a couple people do you think they might have told anybody lucas asked look friar said i doubt theres anybody in burnt river who hasnt heard this guys name by now the bentons told my folks and my folks probably told a couple more friends and i imagine the bentons told more everybodys interested in what happened to aliee shes the most famous person ever come from here or ever will shes the only person in the whole county or maybe all the counties around whoever had her face on a magazine goddamnit lucas said the sheriff waved at the three guys around the pool table you guys could you step over here for a minute when they did clustering around he said we want to know did any of you hear about this banker fellow the suspect in the aliee case from anybody besides louis nobodys gonna get in trouble we just need to know how much the names gotten around two of them admitted passing the name along two of the three had heard the name in conversation on saturday or sunday so everybody knows lucas said everybody said a guy in a green shirt what happened anyway somebody shoot that asshole lucas looked at him exactly somebody shot that asshole really they wanted details lucas shook his head and said man the question is is there anybody in town who might pull something like this a guy in a gold flannel shirt said what was he shot with a rifle we think the shooter was fifty yards out or so and hit him in the chest that aint much of a shot with a rifle a blueflannel shirt said i woulda gone for a neck shot you always go for a fuckin neck shot and the next time you come back with a deer i expect to be a grandpa friar said wasnt a mag was it gold shirt asked lucas and del both focused on him what a mag yeah it was lucas said they all looked at gold shirt whos got a mag gold shirt swallowed looked at his friends you know who it is its that jackoff martin scott friar slapped his forehead goddamn steve he looked at lucas it was martin scott whos that hes the jackoff cocacola truck driver for howell county gold shirt said he shoots a mag a ruger and hes always had this thing about aliee i mean bad he works free for her parents mowing their yard and shoveling snow and shit because he thinks that when she comes back theyll let him hang out with her he says he saw her tits once when she was out in their pool green shirt said i called him a lying sob i said nobody in howell county ever saw her tits but the reverend here and he never saw them but once but martin said hed seen them only about sixtysix billion people seen them by now gold shirt said then he remembered olson and swallowed and said jeez sorry tom hes nuts he thinks hes in the cocacola army walks around twentyfour hours a day in his coke uniform said blue shirt yeah but you know what green shirt said couldnt be him vbure full a shit gotta be him friar said nope because guess what green shirt crossed his arms lucas bit what because a whole bunch of those people got shot on monday wasnt it a monday lucas had to think it seemed like a thousand years ago but marcy was shot on monday afternoon and all the others yeah he said monday green shirt looked at his friends martin works on mondays oh yeah friar said and the chances of that carpsucker randy waters letting him off are slim and none hes a slave driver green shirt said i wouldnt work for him said blue shirt hes a mean sonofabitch i saw him pick up the back end of a chevy camaro one day right down on river street light car gold shirt said lets see you pick one up green shirt said your balls would pop like birthday balloons lucas jumped in so could somebody call this waters guy and find out if scott was here last monday thatd settle a lot i can call him the sheriff said if he aint home he and his old ladyll probably be up at the port friar said gold shirt bought a round as they clustered around the bar the sheriff got the bartenders phone book and made a series of calls from the kitchen when he came out he said to lucas and del we better run out to martins house yeah yeah he had last monday off he told waters he had to go to the cities to help the olsons with aliee he told him if he didnt get the day off hed quit thats how serious he was lucas looked at friar so where does this guy live hard to explain but we can show you friar said they left the bar in a convoy of two pickups and the two sheriffs department explorers they went into burnt river then out the other side then off on a side road for a hundred yards martin scott lived in a small log cabin with a stickbuilt garage across a wide snowcovered drive the snow had been driven on but there was no sign of a truck at the house and only a single lighted window a pizzapansized satellite dish perched on the corner of the house aimed at the satellite over reno a propane tank sat off on one side of the driveway and next to the garage a leanto covered four or five cords of split wood all of it was illuminated by a blue yard light he aint home friar said looking at the dark house they all got out of the trucks and gathered next to one of the explorers how do you know del asked maybe hes asleep he burns wood and the wood stove aint going friar said that smoke there he pointed at a thin stream of smoke burbling out of a fourinch wide stack thats from the propane burner you only turn that on when you aint home to keep the wood stove going why dont you guys wait lucas said to the sheriff del lucas and del took out their pistols and walked up toward the house lucas knocked then pounded on the door no sign of life he opened the storm door and tried the doorknob locked the sheriff came up and said lets look around back the house had a back porch but the door apparently wasnt used much it hadnt been shoveled since the last snowfall and there were no tracks crossing it lucas stood up on the back porch and tried to peer through the window want a flash the sheriff asked he handed lucas a flashlight lucas shined it in the window and saw a kitchen gold shirt had wandered over to the garage and pulled the centeropening doors far enough apart to see inside trucks gone he said lucas started down the far side of the house del and the sheriff trailing behind one window showed a fiveinch slit in the curtains lucas looked at del and said if i boosted you up could you look in there i guess lucas made a stirrup out of his hands and del stood in it and lucas boosted him up the side of the house the sheriff handed him a flashlight and del looked through the window a minute later he said all right and lucas let him down del handed the flashlight to the sheriff and said to lucas this is the guy whatd you see the four shirts and two deputies and the sheriff pressed around ill let you look del said could you pull one of those pickups up here gold shirt ran back to his pickup gunned it out of the driveway and up to the house lucas took the flashlight from del and they all scrambled into the truck bed lucas shined the light through the window they were looking into what might have been a bedroom at one time now it was a shrine the walls were covered with the thousand faces of aliee maison all carefully cut out all pasted flat to the wall thousands of green eyes looking out at them from the wall opposite in the center of the room sat a single lonely wooden chair where a man might sit to look into the eyes the sheriff took it in muttered something under his breath then turned to a deputy go yank swede out of bed and get a warrant tell him i need it right now tell him i need it ten minutes ago because im already in the house and lucas added get this guys tag number and the make on his truck and call me quick as you can a dodge ram metallic black in color blackpipe running boards impact bars on the front and red script on the door that says martin scott gold shirt said as they walked around the front of the house lucas called rose marie we aint got him but we know who he is he said a deputy up heres gonna call dispatch and we need to get a truck description and tag out on the streets the sheriff opened the house by the simple expedient of punching out the window on the front door reaching inside and unlocking it he told the four shirts to hang around but wouldnt let them inside the sheriff lucas del and one other deputy went into the house the house smelled bad from the first step like hes been skinning some mink in here the sheriff said they went back to the shrine and looked in from the outside they could see only the wall opposite from the inside they could see that all four walls plus the ceiling had been done in aliees face the sheriff shook his head this gives me the creeps he said if hed showed me this on a nice summer day with aliee running around alive itd give me the creeps its a little too much lucas agreed green shirt was up on the porch us guys just want to come in and take a quick look or go back to mcleods its too goddamn cold out here to be hanging around the sheriff looked at lucas who shrugged i dont care maybe theyll see something we dont so the sheriff let them come in as del and lucas probed scotts bedroom and kitchen they found a box of twelvegauge shotgun shells skeet shot in a bedroom closet but no shotgun a scoped winchester magnum and a ruger semiauto carbine so maybe hes got a shotgun with him too lucas said ill call it in del said a small living room had black velvet curtains to block the light a love seat was pushed against one wall opposite the couch was a projection tv a sony with a screen five feet wide and next to the tv a rack of tuning and sound equipment a nintendo console sat on the floor next to the couch with a dozen game boxes and next to that a dreamcast console with even more games five small speakers were spotted around the room with a sub woofer the size of a trash can next to the tv nine hundred and ninetynine channels of shit on the tv to choose from del said sounding like he might be quoting someone in the kitchen they found nothing at all the last of the shirts had taken a look at the shrine and gold shirt came out in the kitchen opened the refrigerator took out a beer and screwed off the top what the hell are you doing the sheriff asked he aint gonna need it gold shirt said gonna go to waste gimme one of those friar said gold shirt opened the refrigerator handed him a beer as he unscrewed the cap friar said the thing about martin is he always thought hed be famous that might be all he thought about he thought he could do it by starting small here in burnt river and if he worked hard and kept his nose clean coke would take care of him hes been working his ass off driving that goddamned truck for ten years and id have to say he aint made much progress up the corporate ladder he took a pull on the bottle and then added such as the corporate ladder is around here you think he could kill a guy lucas asked nobodyll go hunting with him blue shirt said he likes them guns a little too much one time this guy i know was walking in from his deer stand gold shirt jumped in ray mcdonald blue shirt continued and he bumps into martin and martin goes you smoke cigarettes and the deerll smell it a mile away so ray goes on home and hes laying in bed that night about to go to sleep thinking about nothing and then all of a sudden he realizes that he was about a halfmile away when he stripped that butt and threw it away blue shirt looked at lucas del and the sheriff a look that said this is of significance lucas took a minute to decipher the look hed been watching him through his scope yup ray said he almost shit in his pants laying there in bed martin scott had been looking at him smoking through a scope on that magnum didnt shoot him del said but i bet he was thinking about it blue shirt said martin is fuckin looneytunes and he was a looneytunes when i met him in kindergarten late that night when lucas and del and a pensive tom olson were a hundred miles out of the sheridan airport on the way back to the twin cities the sheriff called i got some sorta bad news he said ah god i dont need any lucas said no time for it we didnt find scott but we found his truck the sheriff said its parked next to the coke truck at the distribution center we talked to randy waters again and he said that scott parks it there on nights he thinks will be extra cold because his garage doesnt have heat its not gonna be that cold tonight lucas protested whats it gonna be maybe ten below the sheriff said thats nothing lucas said nothing yeah i know and we cant find scott i dont think hes in town but even if he is in the twin cities looking for his truck wont do you any good keep an eye out lucas said if we dont find scott maybe hell show up for work lucas told del who shook his head gotta be him though del said you saw the room but what do you think hes hitchhiking down to the cities no he just got down somehow be nice to know the car though halfway back lucas said i just thought of something else you know that oriental chick at the matrix she saw the guy we think was the shooter only for a second or two but she thought it was the vendingmachine guy she also thought he looked a little porky and so did jael when a guy tried to break into her house that night but when st paul picked up the vendingmachine guy he wasnt porky he was skinny yeah i bet this asshole martin scott was wearing his coke coveralls one of those guys said he wore them twentyfourhours a day i bet thats what this chick was reacting to the coveralls the kind a vendingmachine guy would wear thats thin del said but its there lucas said my ass is kicked del said just before they landed you gonna drop me yeah but im gonna cruise up and take a look at jaels place make sure theyve spread out that perimeter ill ride along for that del said theyd left lucass car at the motel because it could only handle two and had ridden over in olsons rattletrap volvo im going back to the valley olson said as he drove them back to the motel back to fargo tomorrow e have somebody call me when youre gonna release the bodies ill come and bury them but i wont wait here anymore this place is a suburb of hell oh bullshit its a pretty nice place del said irritably think about the last week olson said his voice was mild quiet ten days ago i had a family now i dont but its not so much individual people who did this theyre just souls trying to get through life its the culture that does it its a death culture and its here right now it comes out of tv it comes out of magazines it comes out of the internet it comes out of video games look at that television set that poor martin scott had the biggest most expensive thing he owned except for his truck and all those video games and he was a hardworking man worked hard but the culture burned him out reached out through that satellite dish and grabbed him we see it in fargo but you can still fight it there here this place is gone too late for this place too late youll see shut the fuck up del said chapter twentynine sunday day nine six oclock in the morning olson parked at the hotel and said call me when the bodies are ready lucas said he would as they got in lucass car del said he could still have a finger in it nah theres no conspiracy here del its just a fuckup a goddamn bullshit drug murder and then a nutcase on the loose goddamnit where do you think scott is here lucas said in the suburb of hell yup somewhere fuck that guy del said there were two guys in jaels yard we get a car about once every five minutes one of them said theyre getting a little more traffic up at the kinsley place but man theres just nothing going on all right they went inside quietly as they could a cop was sitting on an easy chair in a hallway watching a tv on the floor we didnt want to get any tv flicker on the windows he explained is jael asleep yeah wheres the perimeter two blocks out on every side we got every street covered hes gonna have to parachute in if hes coming what im worried about if he comes is a suicide run lucas said hes got that shotgun i just wish hed come the cop said this is boring my goddamned brains out back in the car lucas said id like to go up to kinsleys if you dont mind take ten minutes look around its all right with me two blocks from jaels at a fourway stop a crossingcar paused and as lucas approached then pulled slowly across the intersection old goat del said yeah lucas crossed the street going straight ahead then said wait a minute he swerved did a quick uturn and said urgently were going after the goat get your goddamn pen out write down the tag number call it in they were back at the intersection the old slowmoving gto already at the end of the block lucas went after him the gto paused at a stop sign the driver seemed unsure of his destination looked both ways lucas closed up behind putting his headlights on the license plate of the other car del said got it call it in tell them we want an answer right fuckin now what remember back in the motel when we called in lynn olsons drivers license and asked then to run down his vehicle registrations he had a volvo an explorer and an old collector gto i bet that fuckin scott parked his truck with the coke truck and walked over to the olsons place and took the gto how many gtos do you see around anymore at six oclock in the morning del was already talking on his cell phone getting switched reading the number hed written on his arm the gto went straight ahead lucas turned left did another uturn and switched off his lights crept to the end of the block the gto took a left at the next corner lucas accelerated around the corner lights off ran as hard as he could almost to the end of the block jammed on the brakes and crept forward again the gto was halfway down the block at the end of the block it stopped then turned right hes just weaving around lucas said as he accelerated in the corner thats gotta be him del was listening all right he looked at lucas its him get everybody here get everybody on the street they began vectoring squad cars toward the gto trying to stay out of sight but four or five minutes after the catandmouse game began the driver of the gto realized he was being tracked lucas again crept to the end of the block and saw the gto already turning the next corner and when he got to that corner and crept forward the gto was two blocks away and accelerating goddamn it he mustve seen us lucas said he jumped on the accelerator and the porsche whipped around the corner and they were flying along the narrow street too fast to do it without lights if anybody was out walking and lucas switched the lights on and up ahead the gto busted a stop sign and was out of sight and del was screaming street names into the telephone they made the corner and the gto was already turning at a street light west on lake del shouted hes headed west on lake street he stopped talking to brace himself as lucas downshifted and the engine screamed they drifted through the intersection and lucas began running up through the gears and del started with the phone again hes at fifteenth fourteenth thirteenth twelfth where is everybody behind us lucas said he could see flashing lights in the rearview mirror no time for his flashers he didnt even think about them and then del shouted hes making a turn under the interstate he goes on the fuckin interstate we got him lucas said that goddamn thing is a concrete trough del braced himself again as lucas drifted the turn theyd closed some distance on the gto which was now only a few hundred yards ahead the gto driver busted another traffic light but lucas was forced to slow and lost ground and then the gto was on the onramp and out of sight lucas accelerated after him spotted him as they came off the ramp and started eating up the ground between them del stopped shouting into his phone long enough to ask whatre we gonna do when we catch up with him i havent figured that out yet lucas said maybe not pull up beside him that would be a bad idea del said unless you got your own shotgun hidden in this car somewhere well just get on his ass and push him lucas said hell either lose it or well pen him there were four or five other cars on the roadway there was still an hour before the morning traffic would start after fifteen seconds with the porsche trailing by two hundred yards the gto crossed in front of a slowermoving ford and swerved onto the shoulder lane immediately the air was full of gravel a small rock bounced off the porsches pristine hood and lucas groaned and said im gonna shoot your ass for that he moved far left and the gto plowed along the shoulder lane for another ten seconds and then suddenly hooked into an upcoming exit del had time to say jesus before lucas cut across the highway and barely made the ramp approach at the top the gto was moving way too fast to make the corner the driver tried but the big car slid out of control hit a curb while skidding backwards bounced across a bus bench and spun sideways into the pump pad of an amoco station lucas had both the brakes and the clutch pinned to the floor bounced across the intersection narrowly missed a flying piece of bus bench and finally stopped in time to see a man humping out of the gto he was carrying a long gun and was headed for the gas station lucas killed the engine and he and del were out on the street del still screaming into the phone through the plate glass window of the station they could see the gto driver pointing his gun at a woman who had her hands over her head but he was screaming at somebody else and a moment later the man inside the cashiers booth pushed the door open the driver pushed the woman inside the booth and closed the door behind them all in ten minutes half of the onduty minneapolis police department was there lucas talked to the man in the booth by telephone we know who you are mr scott you cant get out of there i dont think you want to hurt yourself or those innocent people thats not what youre all about i dont want to talk to you scott said we think its best to keep the lines of communication open lucas began i want to talk to your negotiator lucas looked at the phone unsure that hed heard it right but he had whatever you say mr scott the negotiations began just before seven oclock because of scotts fixation on a woman aliee somebody decided that they should try a woman negotiator first that seemed to work the negotiator and scott had a friendly chat to establish trust and then scott listed his demands a northwest airlines jet at the airport with enough fuel to get them to cuba or hed start killing his hostages aw jesus christ lucas said he went to look at the paint job on his porsche the tv trucks began showing up at rose marie was there at with lester two seconds behind that the guy lester asked looking toward the gas station thats him lucas said you owe me some money for a porsche paint job by the way howre we gonna get him out of there rose marie asked i dont know lucas said hes locked in a bulletproof booth with about six hundred cokes a hundred pounds of corn chips and hostess cupcakes a thousand bucks worth of cigarettes and a tv sounds like a good weekend lester said as long as he doesnt kill the hostages rose marie said she looked around at the line of tv trucks you think we could get any more coverage than this i dont know we might be missing the russians or the chinese but thats about it lucas said the negotiator was sweating on the monitor scott was saying i know what youre doing ure stalling im not going to put up with it ive seen this same deal twenty times i know youre supposed to stall but ill tell you what i know there are planes that fly out of here every day for los angeles and san francisco and hawaii and any of those will get to cuba dont give me any of that shit about reprogramming the computers or getting gas lets just get me down to the airport and on the plane before i have to kill this lady here i think we got a problem the negotiator said to rose marie del standing next to lucas said more than one look at this lucas looked in the same direction jael corbeau trailed by three unhappy cops was marching down the street toward them a cop at the perimeter moved to stop her but she pointed at lucas and lucas said aw jeez and waved her through thats him she asked she was dressed in black from head to foot a black woolen coat black slacks black boots and small black pearls at her ears she was luminous thats him hes a guy from burnt river named scott yeah the guys told me martin scott so howre you gonna get him outa there the negotiator said listen hes gonna set a deadline and i wouldnt be surprised if he did it killed the hostages if hes suicidal i dont think hes suicidal lucas said hes just nuts he tried to cover his tracks on a couple of these things i dont think he wanted to be caught yeah well maybe on the other hand he may pop that woman the negotiator said rose marie said what do we do figure out some way to start him toward the airport maybe snipe him lucas suggested she looked at lester wheres that iowa kid the iowa kid was the department sniper hes on his way so lets set him up if he gets a clear shot she looked at the negotiator we need some more time ask him how he wants to get to the airport what will keep him safe aw man lucas said what i dont know look at this bullshit he waved at the tv trucks there were eight or nine of them four helicopters orbited overhead well thats what it is rose marie said she looked at the negotiator ask him how he wants to do it as the negotiator was talking the mayor arrived he looked at the gas station then at lucas howre you gonna get him outa there an armored car aw man lucas said will you shut up rose marie said can i talk to that guy for just a minute the negotiator looked at lucas and said we have established an element of trust between us oh bullshit he sounds like hes making the moves before we are lucas said you trust him he doesnt trust you let me talk to him rose marie looked at the mayor who shrugged im no expert he said go ahead said rose marie lucas took the phone this is lucas davenport im the guy who chased you with the porsche and i want you to know you fucked up a perfectly good paint job tough shit what do you want i want to come up to the gas station door and talk to you away from this crowd youre up there in a bulletproof booth i cant hurt you you cant hurt me and you got the hostages i just want to talk to you away from this crowd about what about tv what about all this fuckin tv give me two minutes i wont come inside ill just stick my head in the door after a moment if this is a trick ill kill this lady this is no trick im just tried of all the bullshit lucas said he walked up to the station with his hands open held at armpit level stopped at the door pushed it slowly open then leaned inside how are ya what youre doing a henry fonda impression no i just dont want anybody to get killed especially me what do you want to work a couple of things out with you first of all you dont want to go to cuba you know what they do to you in cuba they put you in prison forever the last guy who hijacked a plane down there hasnt been seen since they might be commies but they dont like criminals theyll stick you into a wet drippy dungeon with a bunch of rats and youll wind up looking like the count of monte cristo stillwater prison is a goddamned garden spot next to anything youll get in cuba maybe ill take that chance scott said being the hard man lucas thought lucas could see him clearly through the glass a thatch of strawcolored hair a heavy ruddy face plasticframed glasses and the coke coveralls look you see all those cameras out there what if i walk one of those cameras up here and let you make a statement to the world about what you were doing for aliee then we cut out all this cuba bullshit and killing innocent people in front of tv cameras so everybodyll know youre an asshole and you just come in and tell us what happened to you youll have lawyers and everything youll be treated well what channel scott asked lucas thought gotcha and said any channel you want id recommend channel because they play right into fox which has the best news department as im sure you know no no none of that fox bullshit channel three thats cbs down here scott asked yup lets talk to somebody from channel three see what they say scott said lucas walked back to the line whats going on rose marie asked were talking lucas said i gotta go get some movie people he felt like he was plodding through kneedeep mud he spotted ginger house from channel three with her cameraman pointed at her and gestured she tapped herself on the chest and lucas nodded and shouted bring your cameraman she trotted across the police line with the cameraman in tow and other reporters began screaming in the background lucas said you will now owe me more than you can ever possibly repay what she was a nicelooking redhead with freckles on her narrow nose were gonna walk up there and the guys gonna give us a statement and then maybe something goodll happen is it dangerous she asked she sounded reluctant no i dont think you know whats dangerous ginger the cameraman asked whats dangerous is if you turn this down i swear to god ill go back to the truck get out my gun and shoot you in the forehead every goddamn person in the world is gonna see us do this we do this were gonna be movie stars or ill be dead she said hell youre a secondstring reporter in minneapolis thats the same thing as being dead anyway the cameraman said she thought about it for a second then said okay as they walked up to the gas station she said to lucas i dont have to blow you or anything for doing this well yeah that is part of the deal lucas said maybe ill just describe what i would have done and you can handle it yourself she said trying for a sweet smile but she was shaking what do i say to him fall back on your cliches lucas said lucas pushed the door open said this is ginger house from channel three the cameraman focused on scott ginger said ill have to come in there to do the introduction i dont have a gun or anything better not be a trick scott said we got a tv and its tuned to channel three he nodded at a small fourinch television sitting on a shelf inside the booth im too nervous for any tricks ginger said and her voice carried conviction she stepped through the door and then turned to face the camera with scott looming behind her through the bulletproof glass the cameraman refocused on her he whispered youre live ginger said this is ginger house were standing in an amoco station off iw in minneapolis where mr martin scott is holding two hostages mr scott is suspected by minneapolis police of involvement in the murders done in revenge for the aliee maison killing last week mr scott has agreed to be interviewed exclusively for the channel three good morning show how are you mr scott smiling she pivoted toward scott who smiled and said well ginger im pretty busy this morning as you can see aw jesus lucas muttered to himself he turned and looked back toward the growing crowd he could hear the howling of the other tv people from where he was standing jesus h christ they talked for ten minutes and scott wasnt bad lucas thought he explained the killings cogently and justified them plain had exploited her death by selling pictures of her naked the same night she was murdered her parents had gotten her involved in dope and deviant sexuality in the first place spooner of course had actually killed aliee at the end of the interview ginger asked could we just ask a question of two of the hostages sure go ahead the woman was named melody weve been treated very well better than i expected mr scott has been a gentleman she said with a slight unidentifiable accent then she did a little fingerwave at the camera the other hostage a darkhaired young man named ralph said i just want to get out of here ive got classes this morning weve got a quiz as ginger and the cameraman walked back across the gas pad to the police lines the howling of the press seemed to swell again lucas leaned in the door so now youve had your air time now if you kill anyone theyll figure everything else was bullshit and you were a phony all the time im thinking scott said and the woman melody said to lucas please please get me out of here and to scott please let me go i cant yet scott said he looked at lucas there oughta be more than this there is no more than this martin lucas said he gestured at the crowd at the cameras you just spoke to the entire world i dont know he said there oughta be more lucas sighed looked around then said all right maybe there is what ill be back he trudged back across the parking lot rose marie said what were getting there its like pulling a goddamn snail out of a shell he spotted jael and walked over to her i gotta ask you a favor they walked together toward the gas station and jael said im gonna wet my pants thats good lucas said for six billion viewers youre gonna wet your pants sort of a trip isnt it lucas leaned in the door again mr scott im sure you know this young woman youve been trying to kill her she wants to apologize to you for any wrong she might have done to aliee and in turn she wants you to apologize for killing her brother who she deeply loved jael stepped just inside the door lucas had warned her to stay close so she could back off if scott did anything crazy as long as hes inside the booth you should be okay she began mr scott i am truly sorry she did it almost perfectly lucas thought fixing him with her eyes letting him take in her tornpaper face i had a hard childhood look at my scars she said she touched her face i was in a car accident they talked for a few minutes then scott shook his head as though dazed so whats the deal he asked lucas lucas said the deal is this we go back to the lines we get another camera of your choice we come back here you shuck all the shells out of your rifle uh wheres the shotgun in the car i couldnt reach it after the crash all right anyway you shuck all the shells out of the rifle lay the rifle to the side then you open the booth and you surrender to jael were talking the worlds biggest tv audience here and then we all walk across the gas pad and youll be taken into custody with a lawyer right there what channel three you want ginger back lucas asked no she was okay but she was a little too smooth she didnt have that good jagged quality how about uh what do you think six theres a woman with six sort of an understated beauty if you know what i mean not ellen exactly ellen shes out there martin he thought about it for a long beat then all right ellen lucas went back pointed at ellen goodrich who raced out of the crowd towing her camera lucas what can i say and whatre we doing were gonna do the surrender aw jeez thats just thats just he thought she might weep with gratitude but she didnt lets go lucas said the surrender went well to a point lucas thought jael made a statement a formal apology for any wrongs that had been done to aliee scott apologized for the killings but said he still felt that they were necessary but that jael through her gracious actions had made up for some of it then with the tv camera focusing on him scott jacked the slide on the ruger until shells stopped popping out he said i hereby surrender to jael corbeau a brave woman he reached out and popped the lock on the door as it opened the darkhaired hostage ralph screamed you cocksucker he snatched the small portable tv off the shelf and as scott turned startled ralph hit him in the face with it scott went down as though hed been struck by a meteorite and lucas shouted hey and tried to get the door open but the woman melody began kicking at scott screaming sonabeech in an unexpected mexican accent then she snatched a can of pyroil starting fluid off the shelf and began hitting scott in the back of the head slicing off swaths of scalp scott pushed up tried to crawl through the rain of blows jael was there lucas tried to push past her but she screamed you killed my brother you motherfucker scott stunned and bleeding looked up and she kicked him in the eye and he went down again the camera was crowding in and lucas swatted jael to one side and tried to get at the darkhaired man who was beating scott with the remnants of the portable tv lucas grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him across scotts body and threw him into the cameraman the cameraman ralph and ellen goodrich all went down in a heap melody screamed suddenly panicstricken and ran past and for a moment lucas and the stunned bleeding scott were behind the counter in a little pool of peace and privacy scott tried to push himself up and lucas whispered this is for marcy asshole and hit him in the nose as hard as he could there was a satisfying crunch of bone and scott went down for the count an hour later the mayor said i thought it went pretty well you know all things considered chapter thirty the media attention was intense through the morning until football started by nine that night most of the outoftowners were gone on monday lucas rose marie frank lester and the mayor met in rose maries office rose marie said were getting a ton of stuff on spooner he was in it up to his neck and the ramsey mes office is saying theyre not so sure that rodriguez was a suicide they found residue of wood preservative in his hair told you lucas said comfortably he was hit with a goddamn twobyfour and dropped over the bannister by spooner spooner not only killed rodriguez i bet hes the guy who leaked rodriguezs name to spittle set him up made him the bad guy killed him spooner had a safedeposit box over in hudson lester said there were some documents that say he made a personal loan to rodriguezs company in miami for a halfmillion dollars then the feebs say there was a lien registered on the companys property with dade county rodriguez couldnt sell the company without the lien being settled which meant that spooner had an alarm if rodriguez tried to get out spooner had another hook too if rodriguez tried to sell hed have to settle the mortgages and as the loan officer at atheneum spooner would have known whered spooner get the halfmillion for the personal loan the mayor asked there was no halfmillion it was a fictitious loan that was spooners cut in the business lester said they put it on paper and hid the paper in fifteen years with interest spooners cut is maybe two million and that way spooner always had a hold on the business if he and rodriguez had a personal falling out he could file suit down in dade county and nobody up here would ever know and rodriguez would have to settle still would have worked even after rodriguez died lucas said if anybody even found out about the loan they might have thought spooners investment was a little questionable but hell itd be a minor thing especially if he trotted out all that bullshit about helping minorities and so on is anybody going to sue us the mayor asked i dont know rose marie said spooners wife might she knows that spooners name was mentioned in our briefing of olson and that led indirectly to his death that wont get her anywhere the mayor said ive done those kinds of suits and shed be lucky to get a buckandahalf we didnt kill her husband his own greed killed him along with a nutcase and then theres albalah rose marie said he might not be around long enough to sue lucas said the guys from narcotics said he went back on the street but all of his old territory was under new ownership the new owners dont want to give it back theres gonna be trouble that would clean things up nicely the mayor said what a cocaine war hey dopers die theres not a lot you can do about it the mayor said its a tragedy of course no man is an island etcetera they all nodded when the mayor was gone rose marie looked at lester and lucas and said were good i dont believe he bought the whole thing lucas said meaning the mayor he didnt he knew there was some bullshit going on but he was a very good lawyer he knows there are times when you dont ask the obvious question so were good lucas said by the skin of our teeth lester said but were still good rose marie said she stood up and did a heavy little hopandskip over to her window not quite a jig all these other cities all these big crimes the media goes in the controversy lasts for months we have a big crime and bang one killers dead and bang the other guy confesses to a national audience one week the goddamn movie people think the sun shines out of our asses lester seemed embarrassed he said yeah but you know dont say it rose marie said dont even think it cant help it lucas said a lot of things got fucked up this time around and i personally fucked up most of them i jumped all over rodriguez i bought olson i didnt think that the shooter could be using a rifle because it was a dirty harrys pistol i didnt think about the way the word gets around in a small town weve all got a little hubris in us rose marie said yeah yeah lucas said you more than most she added tom black said they took her up to a regular room shes better lucas said shes gonna make it black said you gotta go get some sleep del told black marcy was awake dont do that pneumonia shit any more lucas said she didnt smile she whispered hurts i know goddammit hurts she said again she looked at lucas like he might be able to help he sat helplessly with his hands in his lap i know it does lucas hadnt seen jael since the fight in the gas station although shed left a message and he had a callback slip from catrin weather needed to talk to him about a frog the message slip said he didnt quite know how to start instead of starting instead of deciding anything he went back to his office put his feet in a desk drawer leaned back in his chair and tried to work it out one thing was he really wanted a couple of more days with jael of course weather the only woman hed ever really loved but remember the time that he and catrin jeez that thing with the lady remington that hed done with jael on the phone catrin had invented that he smiled remembering and hed almost fallen asleep when the phone rang he jumped opened his eyes picked it up a womans voice said lucas
