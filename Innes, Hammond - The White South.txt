the white south disaster in the antarctic the noise of the shattering ice was so loud that we had to shout if we wanted to make ourselves heard the floeberg was quivering it was like being on a ship battered by giant seas we could actually see the ice shaking the boats rocked and the packing cases tied together rolled over our floe was like an island in the midst of chaos all round us the ice was breaking up now we were right in the thick of what we had been watching for so long and in a little while i should be down in that maelstrom fighting to get a rope across to the ledge i felt fear gripping at me hammond innes the white south disaster in the antarctic dawn was breaking as the first news of the disaster reached london it was th february and the rattle of milk bottles was the only sound in the black frostbound streets up in the city covent garden and billingsgate were halfway through the days work and the pubs were open in nearby fleet street a reuters operator was handed a news flash and his fingers ran automatically over the keys of his machine as he transmitted the message to subscribers two blocks away in the office of a big london daily a sleepy subeditor heard the clack of the message as it came through on the teleprinter he watched it as the carriage of the machine jerked back and forth then the yellow tongue of paper was thrust through the slit in the glass top he tore it off and stood there reading it capetown feb reuter sos received from factory ship southern cross ship is caught in ice in weddell sea and in danger of being crushed norwegian factory ship haakon miles from position of southern cross going to rescue reuter the subeditor yawned tossed the sheet of paper into the news basket and returned to the work of subbing a feature page article in a big office block in fenchurch street the telephone rang incessantly on the third floor these were the offices of the south antarctic whaling company and only the cleaners were there the telephone went unanswered in whitehall at the admiralty a messenger hurried along the empty echoing corridors he handed a message to the duty officer the duty officer rubbed the sleep out of his eyes read the message through placed it in a basket marked for immediate attention and inquired about tea high up above queen victoria street an operator at one of the switchboards in faraday buildings noted the urgency of an incoming call from capetown and searched the telephone directory then she switched the call from the offices of the south antarctic whaling company to the flat of albert jenssen in south kensington albert jenssen was still in bed the telephone woke him and he was half asleep as he groped for the receiver and lifted it to his ear a moment later and he was sitting up in bed wide awake and speaking rapidly into the phone when he had finished he replaced the receiver automatically and sat there for a moment regardless of the cold air that blew in through the open windows a dazed expression on his face then he fell upon the telephone and call after call went out from the flat in south kensington cables to durban the falkland islands and the whaling stations of south georgia calls to sandefjord and tonsberg in norway to leith in scotland to the bbc to a cabinet minister and finally to the admiralty the duty officer at the admiralty was forced to abandon his second cup of tea and interrupt an admiral in the midst of shaving and by eight oclock messages were pouring over the ether admiralty to cinc american west indies admiralty to hm sloop walrus at port stanley in the falklands director south african naval forces capetown to admiralty london british broadcasting corporation to australian broadcasting commission and as the official messages increased in a desperate effort to avert disaster the news agencies joined in and the tempo grew reuters correspondent capetown to reuters london up to new york tass to moscow havas to by midday more than million people knew that a ship of tons belonging to a british whaling company was locked in the grip of the antarctic ice and was being slowly crushed as they sat at their desks or worked in their factories they were secretly thrilled at the thought of over men face to face with death in the pitiless frozen wastes of the antarctic the admiralty ordered the sloop walrus to proceed to south georgia refuel and then make an attempt to reach the southern cross a south african naval corvette was despatched from capetown also with orders to refuel at south georgia the board of trade diverted a tanker unloading in durban to south georgia to fuel search vessels del norske hvalselskab of sandefjord norway announced that their factory ship haakon which had steered for the southern cross within half an hour of receiving the first s o s at hours was now within miles of the ships last position the united states government offered the services of the aircraft carrier ohio then cruising off the river plate meanwhile events moved fast in the antarctic an early report that the southern cross had dynamited an area of clear water and was being warped round was followed by the news that the way out of the ice was blocked by several icebergs which were charging into the pack the tanker josephine and the refrigerator ship south were standing by on the edge of the pack together with the rest of the south antarctic companys fleet unable to do anything by midday the whole of the starboard side of the southern cross was buckling under the pressure of the ice and at hours captain hide the master gave the order to abandon ship in a final message before unloading the radio equipment on to the ice eide warned the haakon not to enter the ice beyond the line of the icebergs that was the last message received from the southern cross all that night the lights blazed in the south antarctic whaling companys offices in fenchurch street but no message came through from the survivors utter silence had closed down on the abandoned ship and it was clear that this was the worst sea disaster in peacetime since the titanic went down in the most detailed picture of the events leading up to the disaster available on the morning of the th was contained in a feature article in londons largest daily the writers main sources of information were jenssen london manager of the south antarctic whaling company the companys agent in capetown the admiralty del norske hvalselskab and the files of his office library the article gave the full story of the south antarctic companys whaling expedition it was headed disaster in the antarctic and read the southern cross left the clyde on th october last with a total of men and boys in charge of the expedition was bernt nordahl factory manager hans eide was master and as assistant manager was erik bland son of the chairman of the south antarctic whaling company about per cent of those on board were norwegians mainly from sandefjord and tonsberg the rest were british with her sailed an exadmiralty corvette converted to act as a whaletowing vessel and the refrigerator ship south the southern cross arrived at capetown on th november where her catchers and a tanker were waiting for her the expedition sailed on rd november the fleet then consisted of the factory ship a vessel of tons whale catchers each of under tons two buoy boats three exnaval corvettes for towing whales one refrigerator ship one of the towing vessels was later sent back to capetown to pick up electric harpoon equipment the company intended to experiment during the season with the electrocution of whales a method of killing that was in its infancy prior to the war the whaling season in the antarctic is of four months duration december january february march these are the summer months and whaling expeditions are limited to a certain period by international agreement in an attempt to preserve the whale and allow uninterrupted breeding unrestricted killing during the last century in the arctic resulted in the complete extermination of whale in the northern hemisphere for many years the present season for fin whale opened on th december but prior to that operations are permitted against the sperm whale most expeditions avail themselves of this in order to test equipment this season apart from the south antarctic companys expedition there were eighteen others ten norwegian four british one dutch one russian and two japanese on th november the southern cross sighted south georgia and was in radiotelephone communication with the shorebased whaling stations on this island they reported unprecedentedly bad conditions temperatures were much lower than normal with pack ice still piled against the western and southern shores of the island their catchers operating in a mile radius spoke of heavy drift ice with bergs much more frequent and much bigger than usual on nd december the southern cross commenced operations her catchers killing sperm whale in seven days despite low temperatures and severe gales on th december she began fullscale operations she was then about miles west of south thule the most southerly of the sandwich group and steaming southwest reports of both nordahl the factory manager and captain hide the master to the london office all spoke of violent and incessant gales low temperatures loose pack ice and an unusually large number of gigantic icebergs whale seemed very scarce by comparison with the previous bumper season and on boxing day nordahl reported trouble with the men this is almost unheard of in norwegian or british whaling fleets where the men have a financial interest in the catch but when jenssen was pressed for further details he said he had no statement to make on the matter the matter must have been serious however for colonel bland chairman of the company left london airport on nd of january for capetown in a privately chartered plane he undertook the journey against the advice of his doctors he had been seriously ill for some time with heart trouble with him went his daughterinlaw a german technical adviser on the electrical harpoon and aldo bonomi the wellknown photographer his daughterinlaw mrs judie bland is the daughter of bernt nordahl on rd january news was received at the london office that nordahl the leader of the expedition had disappeared the previous night presumed lost overboard colonel bland arrived at capetown early on the th and left the same night together with nordahls daughter in the towing boat which had been dispatched to collect the new harpoon equipment on reaching the southern cross on the th colonel bland assumed control of the expedition only whale had been caught at that time against a previous seasons total of in a week of bad gales the ten catchers had only brought in whale bland sent his catchers out in a wide search they found heavy pack ice to the south and southeast and one of the catchers had difficulty in extricating itself from the ice all catchers reported few whale meanwhile radio contact had been established with the haakon miles to the southwest the norwegian ship reported whale in plenty colonel bland decided on the th to steam south a great deal of loose pack was encountered but on the rd the vessels were in open sea in lat s long w with an abundance of whale operations from the rd january to th february produced whale on the th and th there was a bad storm and on the night of the th one of the catchers which had run into the ice for shelter damaged its rudder on a floe when the wind had died down a catcher and a corvette were sent to its assistance but in the early hours of the th these two vessels were in collision in the ice one of them being sunk and the other set on fire the mishap occurred about miles southeast of the southern cross and within sight of the catcher they had come to rescue both crews were reported safe on the ice with the loss of two men another corvette was sent to the assistance of the three vessels meanwhile the southern cross which had already refuelled from the tanker completed the transfer of whale oil to this ship on the night of the th the corvette reported that heavy pack ice was preventing her from approaching nearer than miles to the damaged catchers no further news had been received from these vessels the wind had risen again to gale force but despite this the southern cross herself went to the assistance of the catchers at pm on the th she sighted the corvette which had run into loose pack in order to shelter from the heavy seas the whole fleet was then together with the exception of the three missing catchers for owing to the bad conditions no catchers had been sent out after whale a conference was held on the southern cross and it was decided to steam into the pack ice following leads which ran east and west in the direction of the damaged vessels it is not difficult to picture the scene the southern cross big and squat like an enormous tanker with her fat funnels aft steaming into the ice the sea slopping about in the stern hole through which the whales are drawn up on to the afterplan there is a gale blowing and the southern cross is steaming into it steaming against the whole weight of the pack ice thrust westwards by the howling fury of the wind all round her is loose pack a flat broken plain of white glimmering in that peculiar twilight that is night in a region where the sun never sets the loose pack draws closer together until it is solid pack ice there are icebergs now and they are smashing into the pack and the great ship steams steadily on along a lead of black water that winds deeper and deeper into the ice past the icebergs right into the heart of the danger area was it madness to go on risking all for a handful of lives that factory ship represented nearly ј of money and on board were over lives what drove colonel bland on what made him take the risk what about his officers didnt they warn him a ship like that of tons with specially strengthened bows can smash through ice feet thick but if those jagged edges once grip her thin steel plates they can smash her in no time didnt he realize the danger or was the lead so narrow that once they were in it they couldnt turn back but had to go on the truth of the matter we may never know all we know at the moment is that at hours on th february the southern cross was firmly beset by the ice and she was sending out an s o s sometime during the night that lead must have come to an end the westwarddriven pack ice closed round her and in a matter of hours she was gone that a ship of tons should be crushed so easily may seem strange to those who remember that filchner and shackleton beset in much smaller vessels in this same weddell sea existed for months in the ice and saved themselves in the end but these men were explorers their ships were specially built for the ice the sheer sides of the southern cross were never designed to withstand the huge lateral thrust of ice piled up into pressure ridges by the battering force of giant icebergs for the full story of what happened we must await the reports of survivors in the meantime it is to be hoped that the government and other whaling companies will do all in their power to speed the rescue of these men they probably have good stores of whalemeat and blubber on the ice with them but their equipment is unlikely to be very good and they clearly cannot survive a winter in the antarctic so much for the story of the southern cross disaster as the public knew it then it was a nine days wonder that ousted everything else from the headlines of the worlds newspapers then as the rescue attempts dragged on without success it quietly faded out interest revived momentarily when the united states aircraft carrier ohio arrived on the scene and flew its first sorties but bad weather hindered the search and since the failure of protracted rescue attempts is not news and public interest wanes rapidly in the face of negative results the fact that well over men were marooned somewhere in weddell sea was forgotten by the middle of march winter was setting in conditions became very cold with new ice beginning to form by the nd all search vessels had turned back they refuelled at grytviken in south georgia and proceeded to their bases by th april jan eriksen factory manager of the nord hvalstasjon grytviken reported to his company all search vessels have now left grytviken haakon and rest of del norske hvalselskab fleet passed within miles south georgia yesterday on their way back to capetown there are now no vessels in the area of the tragedy winter is closing in if any survivors are still alive god help them for no man can until summer i am preparing to close down the station that report wrote finis to all attempts to rescue any possible survivors of the southern cross it was dispatched to the offices of the nord syd georgia hvalselskab in oslo and eriksen began the work of closing the whaling station at grytviken as the antarctic winter closed in on the icecapped island of south georgia but the story doesnt end there for on st april two days before he sailed with his men for capetown eriksen radioed a message that set linotypes and presses the world over rolling out the name southern cross in great flaring headlines for on the st april but this is duncan craigs story let him tell it duncan craigs story of the loss of the southern cross the camp on the iceberg and the trek that followed chapter i i did not actually join the southern cross until january only three weeks before the disaster occurred indeed a month before that date i was unaware of the existence of the ship or of the south antarctic whaling company i am not a whaler and apart from a seasons work in greenland with a university exploration club i had never before been in high latitudes i wish to make this point clear at the outset so that those who have long experience of antarctic conditions and of whaling in particular will understand that what is familiar to them came to me with the impact of complete novelty the reason i have been asked to set down a full account of all that occurred is due to the fact that through circumstances largely outside my control i was in close association with the personalities concerned in the disaster and know probably more about the real cause of what happened than anyone now living my connection with the events that led up to the loss of the southern cross began with the new year i was emigrating to south africa and on the night st january i was waiting in the offices of a private charter company at london airport in the hopes of hitching a ride to capetown the decision to emigrate had been made on the spur of the moment and if id known then where it was going to lead me id have turned right back pocketed my pride and resumed the routine of a clerks life in the offices of messrs bridewell faber tobacco importers of mark lane the flight was scheduled for hours the plane had been chartered by the south antarctic whaling company for a colonel bland there were five seats available and blands party numbered three that was all i knew tim bartlett the pilot of the aircraft had tipped me of at a new years eve party the night before as far as he was concerned it was okay hed take me but it was up to me to talk my way into one of the two spare seats bland arrived at twelvethirty he came into the terminal offices stamping and blowing through his cheeks is the plane ready he asked the clerk his manner was peremptory he had the air of a man always in a hurry there were three other people with him two men and a girl a blast of cold air blew in through the open door and outside i saw a big limousine its lights glistening on the wet tarmac a uniformed chauffeur brought in their baggage the pilots waiting the clerk said if youll just sign these forms colonel bland and heres a cable arrived about half an hour ago i watched his thick fingers rip at the envelope he pushed his hornrimmed glasses up on to his forehead and held the cable closer to the light his eyes were hard under the tufty brows and his bluish jowls quivered slightly as he read then he swung round abruptly here read this he said to the girl he held the flimsy cable sheet out and it shook slightly in his thick hairy hand the girl came forward and took it she was dressed in a pair of old slacks and a green woollen jersey a lovely mink coat was draped carelessly over her shoulders she looked tired and her face was pale under its make up she read it through and then looked at bland her lips compressed into a thin line her eyes blank well blands voice was almost violent she didnt say anything she just looked at him and i saw she was trembling slightly well he barked again and then the violence inside him seemed to explode first you and now your father what have you got against the boy his fist suddenly crashed down on the desk top ill not recall him do you hear your father had better learn to get along with him any more ultimatums like that and ill accept your fathers resignation hes not the only leader available hes the only one that can get you the results youve been accustomed to she answered defiantly a flush of anger colouring her cheeks bland was about to reply but then he saw me and stopped he turned abruptly and seized the forms that the clerk had thrust towards him his hand shook as he signed them and as i watched him capetown seemed to recede id met his type before he was the aggressive selfmade business man even to the black hat and black overcoat with astrakhan collar he was as hard as a lump of granite and he looked as though he were on the verge of a nervous breakdown to ask him for a lift in his plane would be like asking for the loan of a gold brick from the bank of england and the hell of it was that id burned my boats id given up my rooms requested my bank to transfer what little money i possessed to capetown and the letter throwing up my job had been posted that afternoon as though he sensed that i was watching him he suddenly turned and stared at me his small blue eyes were distorted by the thick lenses of his glasses are you just waiting for a plane sir or do you want to speak to me he demanded aggressively im waiting for a plane i said he grunted but didnt take his eyes off me whether i get it depends on you i went on my names craig duncan craig the pilot of your plane is a friend of mine he told me there might be a spare seat and i was wondering whether youd be youre trying to scrounge a lift the way he put it made me curl but i kept a tight hold on my temper and said id very much like to come with you to capetown well you cant and suddenly i didnt care perhaps it was his manner perhaps it was the way hed spoken to the girl theres no need to be offensive colonel bland i said angrily all i asked for was a lift and i reached down for my bags just a minute he said the violence seemed to have died out of him as i looked up he was leaning against the desk his thick fingers tugging at the lobe of his left ear there are some two hundred thousand people waiting to get to south africa why should i take you more than any of the others it happens that im the one that asked you they didnt i had picked up my bags now forget it i said and moved towards the door all right craig he said as it happens there is a spare seat if the pilot vouches for you and youre through the formalities in time you can have it he seemed to mean it thanks i said and made for the door to the airfield check you bags and sign the papers he said the abruptness was back in his voice ive done all that i said i did it in advance just in case i didnt want him to think that id taken it for granted id get the lift his thick brows dragged down over his eyes and his jowls quivered then he suddenly laughed where did you learn efficiency in business or in the services in the services i replied which the army no the navy that seemed to exhaust his interest in me he turned and watched the baggage being weighed tim bartlett came through from the flight office with his copilot a man called fenton he glanced at me with a lift to his eyebrows i nodded and he grinned he introduced himself and fenton to bland and asked the clerk for the passenger details as he glanced through the papers he said to bland i see youve increased your party from three to four yes mrs bland wanted to come he nodded in the direction of the girl tim bartletts brows lifted and he nodded which is weiner he asked one of the two men standing in the shadows by the door came forward slowly into the light i am weiner he said his voice was a guttural whisper and he moved like a marionet as though jerked along against his will by invisible strings he was a jew and his clothes were several sizes too large for his shrunken body he had a bald head thin emaciated features and a tubercular cough do you wish to see my papers he asked in that same wretched whisper no thats all right tim said and i am bonomi aldo bonomi it was the fourth member of the party he stepped out of the shadows into the light with the swagger and bounce of an opera singer he wore a camelhair coat with padded shoulders and tieon belt and round his neck was a silk scarf of peacock blue with little yellow designs gold rings flashed as he seized tims hand and pumped it up and down i am so pleased to know that we shall be in such good hands you are an artist i can see that i too am an artist i go to take pictures for el colonnello he paused for breath and peered anxiously up into tims face but i hope you are a careful driver last time i fly the driver he make play with the airplane and i am very seek tim got his hand back from the italian and said its all right you neednt worry mr bonomi it will all be very dull i hope and he went out to the airfield the rest of us followed as soon as blands party had had their passports checked and been through the customs we piled into the plane the luggage was strapped down the doors closed fenton came through from the cockpit and told us to fix our safety belts the engines roared into life and the plane taxied out on to the tarmac the lights of the airport glittered frostily we made the end of the runway and waited there for the okay from the control tower my stomach suddenly felt hollow it always does before a takeoff that uninsurable half minute i dont know anyone whos really got over it i looked round at the others their bodies were selfconsciously relaxed the muscles under the surface rigid against the possibility of a crash nobody spoke bland had closed his eyes the girl had her hands thrust deep in the pockets of her fur coat her grey eyes were wide and stared straight in front of her little curls of fair hair had escaped from beneath the silk scarf that covered her head bonomi wriggled in his seat he couldnt keep still he was like a rubber ball his head darting about one moment peering forward out of the window the next twisted round to examine the inside of the plane only weiner seemed completely relaxed he lay slumped in his seat like a bundle of old clothes a nerve twitched at the side of his mouth but his expression was one of complete apathy his hands were held against his stomach the long nervous fingers plucking at the locking device of his safety belt the engines suddenly roared the plane rocked and vibrated then the brakes were off and we were gathering speed down the runway i braced myself automatically and peered out of the window where the lights of the plane showed the concrete streaming by the rear end of the fuselage bumped twice and then lifted the lights of the control tower showed through the darkness moving slowly away from us then suddenly we were riding air smooth and steady the note of the engines changing to a solid drone the seat pressing my body upwards the control tower was a rapidly receding pinpoint of light now headlights cut swathes along the narrow ribbon of the road bordering the airport then we banked and the lights of london stretched away to the darkness of the horizon clear in my mind like a montage was the notice id pasted on my office desk gone to south africa was it only yesterday evening id put it there i thought of mr bridewell standing there staring at it uneasy suspecting a legpull completely unable to comprehend why i had left even my letter wouldnt explain that to him i undid my safety belt now i was actually on my way i wanted to sing shout do something to show how i felt across the gangway the little jew was still twining his fingers round the lock of his belt behind me bland suddenly said judie change places with franz i want to discuss this electrical killing gear with him i half turned in my seat nobody seemed to notice my surprise the girl said dont you think you ought to rest im all right bland replied gruffly doctor wilber said damn doctor wilber if youre not careful youll kill yourself ill take a lot of killing he stared at her for a second wheres that cable i gave it to you the girl felt in the pocket of her fur coat and brought out the crumpled flimsy cable i heard him smoothing it out on his briefcase then he snorted bernts no right to cable me like this anger was catching hold of him again hes not giving the boy a chance i heard the cable crushed in the sudden clenching of his fist then the trouble is that only erik stands between him and full control of the company when im gone his voice was a deep angry rumble thats not fair the girls voice blazed not fair eh what the hell am i to think they werent a week out of capetown before there was trouble between them and whose fault do you suppose that was the girl demanded angrily bernt was playing on his lack of experience thats eriks story what of that do you expect me not to believe my own son yes but you dont know him very well do you you were in london all through the war and since then i know when a boys being victimized bland snapped back why bernt even had the nerve to cable that he was causing trouble among the tonsberg men theres never any trouble with whalers theyre far too interested in the success of the expedition if bernt said he was causing trouble among the tonsberg men then he was the girls voice steadied hes never thought of anything but the interests of the company you know that then why does he send me this ultimatum why does he demand eriks recall because hes seen through him seen through him thats a fine way to talk of your husband i dont care you may as well know the truth about him shut up elands voice vibrated like a plucked string i wont shut up the girl rushed on its time you knew the truth eriks shut up blands voice was thunderous dont talk like that i can see whats happening to him now you undermining him at home and your father undermining him out there his confidence in himself is being sapped by the pair of you no wonder he needs his confidence the girls tone was half contemptuous half hysterical you dont know him at all do you you still think of him as the gay reckless boy of ten years ago sailing his boat winning ski jump championships you think thats all he wants well it isnt he likes to control things men machines an organization he wants power power i tell you he wants control of the company and hes got his mother how dare you talk like that god do you think i dont know erik by now she was leaning forward across the gangway her body rigid her face a white mask ive been meaning to tell you this for some time ever since that first cable but you were too ill now if youre well enough to travel youre well enough to know what i refuse to listen bland was trying to keep down his anger youre hysterical youve got to listen im not hysterical im telling you what i should have told you i tell you i wont listen damn it the boys your husband do you think i dont know that her voice sounded frighteningly bitter do you think he hasnt made me aware of that every hour of the day weve been married bland was peering at her through his thick glasses dont you still love him he asked love him she cried i hate him i hate him i tell you she was crying wildly now oh why did you agree to send him out as secondincommand you seem to forget hes my son blands voice was ominously quiet i havent forgotten that but its time you knew the truth then wait till were alone the girl glanced at me and saw that i was watching her all right she said in a low voice franz the man next to me jerked in his seat come and sit back here change places with franz he ordered the girl and try to calm down she got up heavily and changed places with the german i watched her as she settled in the seat across the gangway from me her face was tense her small hands clenched so tight the knuckles showed white she sat there quite still and rigid as though frozen i sat back and stared out of my window at the red glow of the port navigation light the kent coast was sliding from under us ahead the corrugated surface of the channel was lit by a crescent moon and above the drone of the engines i caught snatches of blands conversation the equipment has arrived cable two days ago from the cape tauer iii is picking it up ive ordered sudmann to wait for us all prepared for test i think i was too excited to sleep in the end i got up and went through into the pilots cockpit fenton was at the controls tim was pouring coffee from a thermos well theres the last youll see of england for a bit he said nodding through the side window should begin to get warmer tomorrow getting on all right with blands party ive hardly spoken to them i said bland and the girl have just had a hell of a row now hes talking to weiner about some new equipment or something weiners german isnt he thats right hes an expert on electrical harpoons hes on loan to bland from one of the big ruhr companies poor devil think of it four months in the antarctic flying over the alps is quite cold enough for me is bland going out to the antarctic too yes theyre all going as far as i know theres a boat waiting for them at the cape to take them out to the factory ship i gather theres some sort of trouble on board the southern cross anyway bland sounded as though he were in a hell of a hurry to get out there do you mean to say the girls going as well i asked he shrugged his shoulders dont know about her he answered she only joined the party at the last moment according to her papers shes norwegian by birth and south african by marriage looks rather a poppet she doesnt behave like one i answered more like a wild cat and shes all tensed up over something its an odd setup you should worry you got your ride didnt you if you want company go and talk to aldo bonomi there must be something behind the bounce for hes one of the worlds best photographers like some coffee no thanks i said ill sleep better without it he set down the flask that reminds me id better hand out some blankets you might give me a hand will you duncan back in the main body of the plane everything was just as id left it bland and weiner were poring over sheets of figures the girl sat staring out of the window she didnt look up as we came through it seemed as though she hadnt moved since i went through into the cockpit bonomi however had fallen asleep his mouth slightly open his snores lost in the sound of the engines we handed round the blankets breakfast at treviso tim said as he went forard i settled in my seat across the gangway from the girl she had wrapped her blankets round her but she still sat tense and wideeyed my thoughts drifted to south africa and the new world that lay ahead i still had a sense of excitement about it it wasnt real yet i thought of table mountain as id seen it once before in a vivid dawn from the bridge of my corvette as i convoyed reinforcements for egypt and the sicilian campaign what sort of a job would kramer find me when i got there the drone of the engines gradually lulled me to sleep a frozen dawn showed us the alps as a wild barrier of snowcapped peaks with the crevassed glacier ice tumbling down through giant clefts then we were over the flat expanse of the lombardy plain and setting down at treviso for breakfast i was right behind bonomi as we went into the canteen i was curious about bland and i thought bonomi the most likely of the four to gratify my curiosity he picked a table away from the others and i seated myself opposite him i gather youre a photographer mr bonomi i said but of course you have heard of aldo bonomi no er yes of course i murmured quickly the corners of his mouth dragged down and he spread his hands in a little gesture of despair you do not fool me you have not heard of aldo bonomi where do you leev mistair craig his brown eyes gazed at me pityingly i thought of the people i met at the office and at my rooms i was right out of this world and youre going to take pictures of whaling in the antarctic i said si si the waiter came and he ordered speaking fast in italian may i order for you mistair craig i think i get you something good thanks i said and when the waiter had gone i asked him whether he liked the idea of going to the antarctic he gave a little shrug to his shoulders it is business you understand but its a rather unusual assignment isnt it unusual peraps but my business is often unusual one day i take pictures of a zoo another day i am photographing the rand mines then again i am with the canadian railways you travel quite a bit then but of course oh you do not understand i am aldo bonomi everyone wish for my photographs one week i am in america next i am in paris travel travel travel i am always in trains or aeroplanes and now youre going to the antarctic with colonel bland tell me what do you think of him you heard the row he had with his daughterinlaw is there something wrong on board the factory ship his hand fingered his little green and red bow tie mistair craig i never talk about my clients it is not good for business you understand the flash of white teeth in his swarthy face was half ingratiating half apologetic he smoothed his hand over the shining surface of his black hair let us talk about you he said the waiter came with our breakfast as he poured the coffee bonomi aid you emigrate to south africa yes i nodded that is very exciting you throw up everything you go to another country and you start again that is the big adventure you have no job but you go all the same that needs guts eh you are a man with guts i like men with guts you like a drink with your coffee and as i half shook my head he said just a leetle one so i can drink your health besides i like to drink with my breakfast he turned to the waiter due cognaci what makes you think i havent got a job i asked as the waiter disappeared if you have a job then you do not need to ask for a ride it is all fixed by your company i know because i an always working for some company but tell me that makes you leave england i shrugged my shoulders i dont know i said i just got fed up but something make you decide very quick eh oh i do not mean something serious you understand life ac is not like that always it is the little things that make up our minds for us i laughed at that youre right there and suddenly i was talking to him telling him the whole thing he was conceited effeminatelooking and full of his own importance but he was easy to talk to i suppose ive been feeling a sense of frustration ever since the war ended i explained i went straight from oxford into the navy when i came out i had a queer idea that my country owed me a living then i found that commanding a corvette didnt qualify me to run a business i finished up as a clerk with a firm of tobacco importers that is not so much after commanding a ship eh he nodded sympathetically the waiter came with the cognac saluted he said as he raised his glass i wish you buona ventura mistair craig and what is the little thing that brings your frustration to a head eh a fiver i said mr bridewell the man who ran the business gave us each a fiver on new years eve but the fool had to make a speech about it and you do not like this mistair bridewell no it wasnt that hes a decent little man and it was a decent gesture but i couldnt stomach the lecture i thought it was a hard way to earn a fiver i went out and got drunk with it and during the course of the evening i ran into bartlett the pilot of our plane he told me he was flying to south africa with two spare seats and i decided to chance it i understand but do you know what conditions are like now in south africa oh i know the postwar boom is over the same as it is in england but a fellow i met during the war said he could always find me a job if i came out ah yes a fellow you meet during the war he shrugged his shoulders and stared at his drink at length he gave a little sigh and said well i wish you luck i hope the job he have for you is a very good one tim bartlett came in then and said it was time to leave we finished our drinks and walked out to the plane but as we roared down the runway and swung into the blue of the italian skies south africa seemed suddenly less exciting i should have contacted kramer about that job first id known it all along but id pushed the thought into the back of my mind now as south africa became a reality and a rapidly nearing reality the problem of that job loomed more and more important the trip over the med was bumpy the sea very blue but flecked with white the western desert looked cold and drab cairo came up at us marked by the geometrical square of the pyramid at giza an icy wind blew dust across the airport tim told us thered be a sixhour stop there wed start again at ten bonomi went off with a journalist friend whod arrived in a boac plane bland decided to rest his big face was pale and sweaty he looked ill and exhausted weiner was suffering from air sickness i stood around wondering what to do with the time on my hands cairo was one of the places id got to during the war id just made up my mind to go and find some place to get a drink when a voice behind me said mr craig i turned it was the girl she looked cold and pale could you would you mind taking me into cairo for a drink or something her grey eyes were wide and her mouth trembled slightly i think she was on the verge of tears she was all wound up like something thats tied too tight and ready to burst come on i said and took her arm i could feel the tightness inside her she wasnt trembling but it was there fake a charge of electricity we found a taxi and i ordered the driver to take us to shepheards hotel there was a long silence as the taxi rattled out through the airport gates i didnt hurry her i knew it would come she suddenly said im sorry why i asked inflicting myself on you like this i i dont think ill be very good company dont worry i said just relax ill try she said and closed her eyes at shepheards i took her to a table in the corner whatll you have i asked whisky she said i ordered doubles we tried a little small talk it didnt work when the drinks came she drank in silence i gave her a cigarette she dragged at it as though her nerves were screaming out for a sedative wouldnt it help to tell me about it i suggested perhaps she said itll help spread the load i added it always does and its not likely well meet again she didnt say anything it was as though she hadnt heard she was gazing at a noisy group at a nearby table but she didnt see them god knows what she saw for a girl who couldnt be more than twentyfive her face looked almost haggard suddenly she said im scared about my father i dont know why im scared but i am it came over me last night in the plane it was as though she put her elbows on the table and rested her head in her hands oh god she said in a choking voice it all seems such a mess i wanted to do something to comfort her but there was nothing i could do i lit another cigarette and waited at length she raised her head all last night she said i was thinking about my father and erik down there in the antarctic erik is your husband is he i asked erik bland yes she nodded and your fathers there too yes hes the manager of the factory hes also leader of the expedition her fingers were clutching her glass so hard that the knuckles showed white if only erik werent there she whispered and then with sudden violence if only hed been killed during the war she looked at me sadly but its always the wrong ones that get killed isnt it and i wondered whether there was somebody shed been fond of she looked down at her glass again im frightened she said eriks been working for this for two years through his mother whos norwegian hes got a lot of sandefjord men of his own choosing into the crew and now this season hes persuaded colonel bland to let him go out as assistant manager they werent a fortnight out of capetown before he was cabling that my father was turning the tonsberg men against him there were other cables and then finally one which said nordahl openly saying he will have control of the company soon my father would never say a thing like that not in front of the men i know he wouldnt its all part of a plan to drive a wedge between him and colonel bland is nordahl your father i asked bernt nordahl yes hes a wonderful person her eyes came alive for the first time since id met her nineteen seasons hes been out in the antarctic hes as tough and she checked herself and her tone flattened as she said you see elands just had a stroke its heart trouble he knows he hasnt got long to live thats why he finally agreed to erik going out this season normally he wouldnt he knows he hasnt sufficient experience but he wants erik to follow him in the company its natural any father would but he doesnt know him he doesnt know what hes like and your father does i suggested she nodded yes she hesitated and then said that cable bland received at the airport last night it was from my father it said either erik must be recalled or he would resign i looked at her trying to understand why she had married erik bland she wasnt beautiful she was a little too stockily built for that and that ridiculous little uptilted nose gave her face a snubbed appearance but she had grace she had strength too and a bubbling vitality that showed even through the blank misery of her present mood shed been brought up on skis and long treks through the mountains id been at the landings at aandalsnes in i knew the country and to me she was all norway with that lovely golden hair creamy skin and wide generous mouth she was the sort of girl thats born to fight for the right to live alongside her man and from what id heard on the plane it was clear shed made a wrong choice mind if i ask you a personal question i said her grey eyes were suddenly defensive go ahead she said why did you marry erik bland she shrugged her shoulders why does any girl marry the man she does she answered slowly it was in erik was very attractive hes tall and fair and very boyish hes a fine skier dances beautifully and keeps a lovely little yacht at the dronningen everybody thought i was very lucky and he was a sham yes when did you discover that during the war we grew up during the war didnt we before all i thought about was having a good time i studied in england and in paris but it was the parties and the skiing and the sailing that i lived for then the germans came her eyes which had sparkled for a moment clouded now all the boys i knew disappeared from oslo they went north to join the fighting and when that was over they were back some of them for a little time but one by one they drifted away some across the north sea to join the norwegian forces some through finland and russia others up into the mountains to continue the fight she stopped then her lips pressed tight together but erik didnt go i finished for her no there was sudden violence in her tone you see he liked the germans he liked the nazi way of life it fascinated him it satisfied a sort of its difficult to put into words a craving for selfexpression do you understand i thought of the mother who adored him and the father whose personality and achievement had dominated his whole life leaving him nothing to strive for i could understand i nodded it meant nothing to him that norway was fighting for her existence she went on he didnt seem to understand her voice trailed away when she spoke again it was in a softer tone perhaps it wasnt altogether his fault life had been made too easy for him but why wasnt he interned i asked hes english isnt he well south african he claimed boer descent on his fathers side and of course his mothers norwegian their police checked on him periodically that was all was colonel bland over in norway during the war no london but eriks mother remained at sandefjord shed plenty of money so it didnt make much difference to him she hesitated and then said we began to have rows i refused to go out with him there were germans at most of the parties he went to he took them skiing even out in his yacht he just couldnt see my point of view then the resistance got going i tried to make him join i thought if i could only get him to mix with the boys who were going on with the fight hed wake up to understanding what it was all about i kept at him until at last he agreed to join they thought he might be useful because of his german contacts we forgot that the germans might think him useful because of his norwegian contacts he went up into the hills for one of the drops a week later the same dropping ground was used the resistance group collecting on that drop was practically wiped out nobody suspected except you i said as she stopped her teeth biting into her lip she nodded slowly yes i got it out of him one night when he was drunk he actually he actually boasted about it said it served them right that they were on the wrong side anyway it was horrible i hadnt the nerve to tell the resistance he knew that and he she glanced up at me quickly nobody knows what i have just told you she said so please she tossed the request aside as unnecessary it doesnt matter though her tone was suddenly bitter no one would believe it hes so devilishly charming thats the hell of it to know what he is and see him keeping up his front of popularity his father she spread her hands helplessly and sighed youve never told him about the resistance business of course i said no she said i wouldnt want to tell any father that about his son not unless i had to there was a long silence after that there was nothing i could say she stared past me her mind far away out there in the white wastes of the antarctic where she was going suddenly she finished her drink it was a quick decisive movement like the ringing down of the curtain i can hear dance music she said with a sudden hard brightness lets go and dance as i rose she put her hand on mine thank you she said for being so nice i dont know how she managed it but we had a lovely evening perhaps it was reaction maybe it was a sheer effort of will but her gaiety which was forced and brittle as we went on to the floor became quite natural as we danced she danced with her body very close to mine she seemed to want to dance with complete abandon and she danced divinely once she murmured you said wed never meet again her lips were almost touching my ear in the taxi going back to the airport she snuggled close to me and let me kiss her but when the taxi swung in through the gates of the airport she straightened up as she made up her face i saw the worried look was back in her eyes she caught my glance and made a wry face cinderellas home again she said and her voice was flat then with a sudden rush of warmth she took my hand in hers its been a wonderful evening she said softly perhaps if id met somebody like you she stopped there but thered have to have been a war first wouldnt there you see i was a spoilt little bitch myself it was just on eleven the others were waiting for us we went straight out to the plane ten minutes later the lights of cairo were vanishing below us and the black of the desert night stretched ahead we settled down to sleep it must have been about four in the morning that tim came through from the cockpit the sound of the door sliding back woke me up he had a slip of paper in his hand he went past me and stopped at bland shaking him awake urgent message for you colonel bland he said speaking softly bland grunted and there was a rustle of paper i turned in my seat elands face was white and puffy he was staring down at the slip of paper that trembled in his hand he swallowed twice and then glanced across at judie who was fast asleep is there any message to be sent tim asked him no no theres no reply elands voice was barely audible it was as though hed been belted in the stomach and all the breath had been knocked out of him sorry to bring you bad news at this time of the morning tim went back to the cockpit i tried to get back to sleep but i couldnt i kept on wondering what was in that message somehow i was certain it had some connection with judie twice i turned round each time bland failed to notice my movement he wasnt asleep he was sitting there slumped in his seat his eyes open and staring at the message dawn came and with it a glimpse of mount elgon on the starboard beam shortly afterwards the snowcovered peak of kilimanjaro was above the horizon and we were landing at nairobi for breakfast we all sat at the same table bland didnt eat anything i thought at first that he was suffering from air sickness the last part of the flight had been pretty bumpy but then i saw he kept on glancing at judie he looked almost scared bonomi who was sitting next to me suddenly leaned closer and said what is the trouble with colonel bland he looks as though he is very seek about somethings i dont know i said but he got a message during the night when we got up from the meal i saw bland motion for judie to join him outside he wasnt gone long and when he came back he was alone wheres mrs bland i asked is anything wrong no he answered nothing his tone made it clear it was none of my business i lit a cigarette and went outside i thought maybe judie had gone to powder her nose but as i turned the corner of the building i saw her walking alone across the airfield she was walking aimlessly as though shed no idea where she was going and didnt care anyway i called to her but she didnt answer she just kept on walking following her feet changing her course like a ship without a rudder i ran after her then judie i called judie she stopped then and half turned waiting for me to come up with her her face was quite blank whats happened i asked her eyes were empty her whole being withdrawn inside itself she didnt answer i caught hold of her hand it was as cold as ice come on i said tell me its the message your fatherinlaw received during the night isnt it she nodded bleakly what did it say for answer she opened her other hand i took the crumpled ball of paper and spread it out it was from the south antarctic company dispatched at hours it read eide reports manager nordahl lost overboard from factory ship stop further information later signed jenssen her father dead i read the message through again wondering what i could possibly say to her shed worshipped him i knew that from the way she had talked about him in cairo hes a wonderful person i remembered the way her eyes had lit up when she had said that the message didnt say how it had happened didnt even say if thered been a storm it just said lost overboard who is eide i asked the captain of the southern cross her voice sounded numbed i took her arm and we walked on slowly for a while in silence then suddenly the pentup emotion inside her broke out how did it happen she cried wildly he couldnt have just fallen overboard hes been on ships all his life somethings wrong down there somethings wrong i know it is she began to cry then her whole body shaking her head buried against me like a puppy thats lost its mother i remember thinking then that if erik bland had had any decency hed have cabled her himself chapter ii it was summer in capetown as we swung down towards the airport the scene was like a colour plate the houses all white and table mountain a mass of brown rock against the brilliant blue of the sky my stomach felt hollow inside me somewhere down there my future was waiting for me if i could find it i was excited and nervous all in one it was the start of a new life the very fact that the sun was shining in a clear sky gave me a wonderful sense of freedom id left winter behind as we touched down on the long ribbon of the runway i wanted to sing then i glanced across at judie and the mood was gone she was slumped in her seat staring tensely out of the window the way she had been all the way from mombassa i remembered the ride in the taxi at cairo and then i remembered that moment on the airfield at nairobi when she had broken down with her grief i wished there was something i could do but there wasnt at the airport buildings i thanked bland for the trip he shook my hand his grip was like iron but his face was white glad we could give you a lift he mumbled conventional good wishes automatically and then went out with weiner at his heels i said goodbye to tim bartlett and then bonomi popped up like a jackinthebox smiling and shaking my hand if south africa is no good mistair craig you go to australia he said here is the name of a man in sydney who is useful tell him aldo bonomi send you he handed me a piece of paper on which he had scribbled an address i thanked him and wished him luck in the frozen south he pulled a face i prefer to stay here i think then he shrugged his shoulders and grinned but i sacrifice everyting for my art even my comfort then judie was coming towards me well this is goodbye duncan she said and held out her hand she even managed a little smile her fingers were warm and firm in my hand just two ships she said are you going to a hotel yes i said ill go to the splendide ill probably end up in some dingy boarding house but just for a few days im going to pretend im important she nodded and smiled where are you staying i asked her but she shook her head we part here she said we shall probably go straight on board everything is arranged in an hours time well be sailing out of table bay i hesitated i didnt know quite what to say but i had to say something i hope you you i just couldnt put it into words she smiled i know and thanks then suddenly on a higher pitch if only i knew what had happened if only hide or erik had cabled details but theres nothing at the airport nothing her fingers squeezed my hand im sorry youve got problems of your own good luck and thank you for being so sweet she reached up then and kissed me on the lips and before i could say anything she had turned and her heels were taptapping across the concrete floor as she went out to the car that was waiting for her she didnt look back that should have been the end of it i should have got myself a job and they should have sailed for the antarctic but it didnt work out that way i got myself fixed up at the splendide and then rang kramer he was down in the book as a mining consultant his secretary told me he wouldnt be in till after lunch in the end i didnt get him till almost tea time he sounded pleased to hear from me until i mentioned why i was in capetown you should have written me old man he said then i could have warned you this isnt the moment to come out here looking for a job not when you havent any technical qualifications but you said you could get me a job any time i reminded good god he said that was during the war things have changed since then theyve changed a lot in the past year and you couldnt have picked a worse moment than this its sticky very sticky old man right now theres a scare on and everyones got cold feet whats the trouble one of these west rand outfits a company known as words has turned out a stumer its only a small company but everyones panicky afraid the whole field may turn out the same way but im throwing a little party out at my place tonight come along may be able to fix you up with something he gave me the address and rang off i put the phone down and sat staring out of the window the sunshine suddenly seemed a brittle sham i went and had a bath and whilst i was lying there thinking it out the phone bell rang i flung a towel round me and went through into the bedroom is that craig it was a mans voice abrupt and solid craig speaking i said oh bland here said the voice and my spirits sagged again my daughterinlaw tells me you commanded a corvette during the war thats right i said where and how long for i didnt see what he was driving at but i said pretty well everywhere i took command of her in and had her for the rest of the war good there was a slight pause and then he said id like to have a word with you can you come down to room you mean here in the hotel yes i thought you were sailing right away im staying here the night the tone was suddenly abrupt when can you come down im just having a bath i told him but ill be down as soon as ive dressed fine and he rang off i didnt hurry over my dressing i needed time to think it out id got a damnfool idea in my mind that i couldnt shake off it was that question of elands about my being in command of a corvette during the war but at last i was dressed and couldnt put it off any longer i went out and took the lift down to the second floor i knocked at the door of number bland answered himself come in craig he said he took me into a big room facing adderley street what would you like a whisky thatll do fine i said i watched him as he poured it his hands shook slightly his movements were heavy and slow he gave me a cigar with the drink sit down he said now then suppose you face facts young man you havent got a job and youve found that the prospects here arent too good oh i dont know i said defensively i havent started to look i said lets face facts he cut in with the imperturbability of a man accustomed to being listened to i know a lot of people here ive interests in south africa too theres a gold scare on and things arent going to be easy for a newcomer he settled his big bulk carefully into a chair i waited he sat for a moment staring at me impersonally suddenly he heaved himself farther back into the chair im prepared to offer you a job with the south antarctic whaling company he said what sort of a job i asked i want you to take command of tauer iii thats the towing ship thats waiting to take me out to the southern cross sudmann her skipper and the second mate were involved in a car crash last night theyre both in hospital what about his first mate i asked hes not on board he was taken ill before tauer iii left the factory ship i gather you know that nordahl the manager of the southern cross is dead its essential that i get out there as soon as possible ive spent all day looking for a man to take command of tauer iii but i cant find anyone suitable those that are suitable dont want to spend four months out in the antarctic it was only this evening that my daughterinlaw told me you had commanded a corvette during the war these towing boats are exnaval corvettes converted i rang you straight away but i havent the necessary papers i said i couldnt just walk on to the bridge of he waved his thick hand ill fix that you can leave that to me i take it theres no technical problem you can remember how to handle them eh you havent forgotten your navigation no but ive never taken a ship into the antarctic i dont know that that doesnt matter now then as regards terms youll get the same pay as sudmann thats ј a month plus bonus youll sign on for the season with the option of being landed at the cape or taken back to england you understand that your command of tauer iii will be a temporary one covering the trip from here to the factory ship youll hand over to the senior mate in the catcher fleet i cant engage you over their heads but well find you something interesting to do and youll have the same pay as if you were in command of the boat now what do you say i dont know i said id like to think it over there isnt time his voice had sharpened i want to know now i must get out there and find out whats happened have you no further news about how nordahl met his death i asked yes he answered a message came through just after lunch nordahl disappeared thats all there wasnt any storm no reason for it at all he just vanished thats why i want to get out there in the silence that followed i tried to shake my thoughts into some sort of order id be away nearly four months and then the search for a job would start again whilst who knows kramer might have talked to somebody so that id get the offer of a job at this party ill need to think this over i said im seeing a friend this evening ill let you know after that his cheeks quivered slightly i want your answer now he said i got to my feet im sorry sir i appreciate your making me this offer but you must give me a few hours he was about to make some violent retort but then he thought better of it for a moment he sat regarding the end of his cigar then he gave a grunt and levered himself up out of the chair all right he said ring me when youve made up your mind ill wait up for your call i had a drink or two at the bar downstairs hoping to see something of judie in the end i got the hall porter to call me a cab all the way out to kramers place the thought of judie and her fathers mysterious death occupied my thoughts i felt as though i were destined to be mixed up in the business id felt like that ever since bland had phoned me and something inside of me had kept saying give yourself this one chance to get clear of it give yourself this one chance but as soon as i reached the party i knew that it wasnt going to be any good i was destined for the antarctic kramers house was built on the lines of a dutch farm a lot of money had been spent on it a good deal more had been spent on the interior the party was in full swing there was plenty of liquor about the males were mostly business men there were a lot of young women kramer greeted me with warmth but the way he talked i might have come out there just to get an introduction to one or two of the gurls as he called them he left me in the clutches of a pretty little thing who proved a salacious gossip i passed her on to a man in the hardware industry and went to the bar a group of men were discussing the latest mining gossip one of them said but suppose the mine wasnt salted of course it was salted another replied if it werent absolutely certain theyd never have dared go as far as arresting vynberg i thought all along the assays were too good to be true sure it was salted said the third a stout american with a lot of gold fillings but vynbergs only the front poor devil theres others behind him who ive heard three names mentioned vynbergs and two guys i never heard of before bland and fisher they were unloading for all they were worth twentyfour hours before the thing broke excuse me i was bored standing there by myself or perhaps it was the association of the name bland everybody i meet talks about the effect of the words crash on the financial situation out here just exactly what is words the three pairs of eyes fastened on me and were instantly hostile i only arrived out here from england this morning i explained quickly you mean to say you dont know what words is the american asked me i know nothing about finance i said i sensed their instant relief well ill be damned said the american its a real pleasure to meet somebody who hasnt got his fingers burned words is the market name for wyks odendaal rust development securities the abbreviation has turned out remarkably apt the ten shilling shares have risen from nineteen shillings to just over five pounds in the last four months on development reports showing high values at comparatively low depths now the whole games bust wide open the managing directors been arrested theyve stopped dealing in the shares on the stock exchange i dont reckon you could give em away right now and theyre too thick to be used for bumph he added crudely ive had some myself whos this man bland i asked almost without thinking you mentioned young fellow i mentioned nobody of the name of bland and if i had its a common enough name and i dont like people listening to what im saying his fishlike eyes were staring at me coldly i glanced at the others the hostility was back in their eyes too i turned away and picked up my drink when i had finished it i slipped quietly out and strolled down through the velvetsoft shadows to the lights of capetown it was beautiful the air smelt of blossom and the cool of evening after hot sun down where the lights began i got a taxi back to the hotel as i went towards the desk to get my key a girl got up from a corner of the entrance hall and came towards me it was judie i scarcely recognized her she had on an offtheshoulder evening gown and she was wearing little highheeled slippers she looked much taller and more graceful a fur cape was flung round her shoulders ive been waiting for you she said her face was very pale in the gold frame of her hair for me i said why have you made up your mind yet will you take command of tauer iii her eyes pleaded as they stared at me yes i said thank god she breathed if you hadnt it would have meant waiting for them to fly a man out from england i couldnt have waited that long im sorry i said realizing what a wait of even a few hours had meant to her she took me straight up to blands room he nodded when he heard my decision everythings fixed he said i guessed what your decision would be he picked up the phone ordered a taxi to stand by and arranged for our luggage to be brought down yes mr bonomi and mr weiner will be leaving too also mr craig room he turned to me as he replaced the receiver get yourself packed up craig he said were leaving tonight tauer iii lay in the inner basin of the harbour picked out in the dock lights as she chafed the concrete she didnt look much like a corvette she was dressed in black and grey paint the bows had been built up for smashing through the ice and all the armament that gives the jagged look to a warships profile had been cleared out of her her line was quite smooth now though still basically the corvette line with the low afterdeck she looked what she was a narrowbuilt very fast very powerful tug two seamen came down the gangway for our bags they were big bearded men they said god dag as they passed us the deck hands were all norwegian but by the grace of god the chief engineer was a scot there was a knock at the door of my cabin and there he was me names mcphee he said he was a little man with thin sandy hair he held out an oily hand im craig im taking over from sudmann his face lighted up and he seized hold of my hand godchrist mon he cried anither scot theres no anither scot walking his ane bridge in the whole fleet yere the one and only the rest of em is all norwegians the appointments temporary i said but i couldnt help smiling at his excitement i hope youve got some scotch on board to celebrate with och aye ahve got a wee drap tucked away he peered up at me quickly tell me mon do ye know anything aboot these tin cans i hope to christ ye do for shes an excorvette and a mean cow in a big sea when shes got some ice on her you neednt worry mcphee i said i was brought up in corvettes och now thats a relief sur me ah was on the big ships then well have plenty to talk about i said now what about fuel and water tanks all full steam up aye weve been standing by ready to sail since this morning fine i said as soon as we get the okay from colonel bland well be moving out any of the norwegian hands speak english most of them speak a word or two then send the brightest linguist up to the bridge will you aye aye sur as he turned to go i stopped him mcphee when was this ship last cleaned down she smells dirty he grinned och thats whale he said yell no worry aboot it once you get alongside o the factory ship its not very pleasant i said wait till yeve got four rotten carcases alongside yell remember what yere smelling noo as the pure odour of carbolic when hed gone i went up on to the bridge it had been rebuilt together with the accommodation i looked aft along the slim length of the ship the paint was beginning to show rust marks and she was dirty over everything hung the indefinable sickly smell of whale like a mixture of oil and death on a light breeze but warps were neatly coiled and everything was greased and cared for it might not be navy fashion but it was workmanlike one of the crew tapped me on the arm the hr direktor he said bland was coming up the gangway i watched him lumber forard along the deck and then he was heaving himself up on to the bridge find your way about all right he inquired yes thanks i answered come into the chartroom then and ill give you the position of the southern cross he found the chart he wanted shes about there he said stabbing his finger at a point roughly three hundred miles west souwest of the sandwich group i marked the spot with a pencil shes working her way south eide says theres a good deal of ice about and the weathers thickening well get their exact position tomorrow he turned and pushed through the door on to the bridge met the chief yet he asked hes a scot yes ive just been talking to him engines all right yes i said he nodded our agents here have fixed everything ive got all the necessary papers with me you can get going as soon as youre ready do you need a tug ive never had to be towed out of port yet i said his big hand gripped my arm you and i are going to get on fine he said and levered his bulk down the ladder to the deck below i stood for a moment looking out across the litter of cranes to the starfilled warmth of the night over table bay the palms of my hands were sweating i was nervous a strange ship and a strange crew and out there way way south pack ice and a fleet of ships whose operations i didnt understand footsteps sounded on the ladder to the bridge i turned it was one of the crew kaptein craig he pronounced it kreig mcphee speaks me to come here good i said i want somebody to translate my orders for me ja he nodded his big bearded head his eyes glinted below the greasy peak of his cap i speak engelsk good i am two years on american ships i speak okay all right i said you stand by me and repeat my orders in norwegian whats your name peer he said peer solheim i told him to get hold of the coxsn and arrange for a man to take over the wheel the coxsn was short and broad he rolled forard like a small purposeful barrel okay kaptein he called up to me and i saw that he had placed men at the warps and at the fenders the gangway had already been brought on board let go forard i ordered solheim repeated the order the heavy warp was hauled inboard my mouth felt dry it was a long time since id done this slow ahead the engineroom telegraph rang before solheim had repeated the order the helmsman understood let go aft i watched the warp come in heard their report of all clear in norwegian as the gap between ship and quay widened i ordered starboard helm and watched the bow come round the stern didnt even graze the concrete of the wharf the men with the fenders stood there watching the concrete slide by and then they glanced up towards the bridge i felt suddenly at home steady as she goes i ordered as the bow swung to the mouth of the basin half ahead the engine pulsed steadily the bridge plates vibrated gently under my feet the concrete arms of the basin mouth slid towards us out of the warm night we passed through into table bay a voice at my elbow said its good to see the navy at work i turned to find judie standing behind me muffled in her fur coat she smiled i thought of all the times id manoeuvred my old corvette in and out of harbours id have traded a years pay then for the compliment and the smile and the presence of a pretty girl on the bridge out of the corner of my eye i saw blands bulky figure turn abruptly on the deck aft of the bridge and make for his cabin we were both a little scared you might have trouble getting out of the basin judie said i grinned at her you thought i might run into something i accused her well wed only your word for it that you could handle a corvette she smiled but now i am requested to inform you that the company has the greatest confidence in your ability to sail the ship thanks i said is this bland speaking or you she laughed then im only a daughter of the company so to speak its the chairman who has confidence in you in a flash of inspiration he thought the message would be more appreciated if delivered by me i glanced quickly down into her eyes what about you i asked a wise girl reserves judgment she said with a little laugh and then suddenly as though she knew the thought that was in my mind she turned and left the bridge with a quick good night i stood for a moment gazing at the stars identifying the blazing constellation of the southern cross table mountain was a dark shadow crouched above the lights of the city a shadow that blocked out the night sky i was suddenly conscious of the helmsman okay kaptein he asked nodding towards the binnacle he was steering s w okay i said and clapped him on the shoulder when i laid off the course i found the man was correct within degrees all next day we steamed souwest at a steady thirteen knots through blazing summer sun and a blue windless sea i wasnt a whaler and i couldnt adapt myself to their free and easy ways i ran the ship the only way i knew the way id learned in the navy i took the coxsn with me in the morning on an inspection of the ship and was surprised to find that the decks had been hosed down mess tables scrubbed the galley shining and the men practically springing to attention all grins whenever i spoke to them when i reached the engineroom i said to mcphee its almost like being back in the navy he grinned and wiped a greasy hand across his freshlyshaven jaw dinna fool yourself sur he said this is a whale towing ship not a corvette but theyll play your game for a day or two the word got round you were a navy officer and not a whaler a lot of em were in the navy during the war they were tickled to death when they heard there was to be an inspection i felt the blood mounting to my face therell be no more inspections then i said curtly och dinna spoil their fun sur itll be the talk of the fleet when we reach the southern cross how they had a british navy officer for the trip and stood to attention and were inspected he winked dinna spoil their bit o fun he repeated and then anxiously yere no offended because ahve put ye wise to it all being a wee bit of a game of course not i said looking over the list of the crew later in the day i found a name that didnt seem to fit in doctor walter howe i was on the bridge at the time and i got mcphee on the blower whos this doctor howe and why havent i seen him i asked presumably he messes with the officers aye but its no verra often we see him for breakfast mcphees voice replied up the pipe hes the biggest soak in the whole whaling fleet and thats saying something he also kens more aboot what makes a whale tick than anyone else hes a scientist hes worked for the south antarctic company since the war hes a wee bit o a nuisance at times but hes no a bad sort when ye get to know him i got to know the doctor that night i had had coffee and sandwiches up on the bridge and when the coxsn relieved me i went down to my cabin put on a pair of slippers and relaxed with the assistance of a bottle of scotch from sudmanns locker then the door opened and doctor howe came in he didnt knock he just came straight in my names howe he stood swaying slightly in the doorway looking at me uncertainly out of rather bulging bloodshot eyes as though he expected me to deny that that was his name he was a tall lath of a man with a pronounced stoop and an oddly shaped head that was all forehead and no chin he had a prominent adams apple which jerked up and down convulsively as though he were continually trying to swallow something his eyes dropped to the whisky bottle do you mind pouring me a drink he moved forward into the cabin and i saw that the sole of his left shoe was built up he wasnt lame but that slight shortness of one leg gave him an awkward rather crablike way of walking and he swung his right arm out wide as though to balance himself he sat down on my bunk and fingered his frayed and dirty collar as though it were to tight for him i poured him a drink and passed it to him he absorbed it as the desert absorbs rain ahah thats better he said and lit a cigarette then he saw i was looking at him and his thick rubbery lips twisted into a quick impish smile im ugly arent i he said and then as i turned quickly to my drink oh you neednt be embarrassed it amuses me when im drunk he paused and then added and mostly im drunk he leaned forward suddenly tense ugly duckling thats what my sisters used to call me god damn their eyes thats a hell of a way to start a kid brother out in life fortunately my mother was sorry for me and she had money of her own i started drinking at the age of puberty he gave a harsh laugh and put his feet up on the bunk lying back and closing his eyes his clothes were dirty and looked as though he slept in them whats your job with the company i asked my job he opened his eyes screwing them up as he stared at the ceiling my job is to tell em where the whales go in the summer time im biologist oceanographist meteorologist all rolled into one its the same as fortunetelling only i use plankton instead of a crystal and im called a scientist any of the old sky tiers manage just as well by intuition only dont tell bland that ive held this job ever since the war and it suits me to stop him sneering at himself i said i dont know anything about whaling as youve probably gathered whats plankton and who are the skytters he laughed it was a gobbling sound that jerked at his adams apple the ungainly head slewed round and grinned at me like a gargoyle plankton is sea food the stuff the fin whales feed on oh god now were off he sat up and knocked back the rest of his drink pushing the empty glass towards me in an unmistakable manner i filled it up theres two main types of cetacean he said assuming a mock schoolmasterly voice those with teeth and those with finners whale like the spermacetti have teeth and live on large squids from the ocean bed the fin whale has a mouthful of finners and lives on plankton which is like a very tiny shrimp he gulps twenty ton or so of water into his mouth and then forces it out through the fins which act as a sieve the water goes out the plankton remains it needs an awful lot of plankton to keep an eightyton whale alive he added mostly we catch fin whales so if you know where their food is well thats what i try to do forecast by water temperature currents weather and so on where the plankton is and skytters i asked as he paused skytter is the danish origin of the english word shooter and its pronounced the same way the skytters are the catcher skippers its always the skipper who operates the harpoon gun sometimes we call them gunners he lay back as though exhausted by this brief dissemination of information the silence must have lasted over a minute whilst i racked my brain for something in common that we could talk about queer about nordahl he said suddenly i only just caught what he said he seemed to be talking to himself he was a wonderful man i could hear judies voice saying exactly the same thats what his daughter thinks i said to hell with his daughter he cried angrily thrusting himself up on to one elbow a little bitch that falls for a tyke like erik bland shouldnt be able to call bernt nordahl her father dont shout i said bland might hear you do bland good to know what his son is really like he stormed angrily whats wrong with him i asked he sat up swinging his feet off the bunk nothing he said except the way hes been brought up and the way his mind works his voice was bitter blands a fool to think he can make his son fit to take over the business by sending him out for one season all bland thinks about is finance its bernt nordahl who handles the whaling side he was the best skytter in norway then after the war he and bland floated the south antarctic company nordahl took over management of the factory ship in some outfits its the master of the factory ship whos in charge of operations in our case its the manager and in the four seasons weve been operating weve got more whale than any other outfit why because i know where the plankton is because the sky tiers have good intuition no because old bernt nordahl can smell whale and the whales went through the factory ship cheaper faster and with less waste than on any other factory ship and thats because the men would do anything nordahl says they worshipped him or rather the old crowd did the tonsberg men he gulped down the rest of his drink and now hes dead lost overboard nobody knows how or why he shook his head i dont know what to think hed been on ships all his life the very words judie had used he was as much at home in these frozen seas as wed be in london he couldnt just vanish like that by christ he added violently ill ferret out the truth of what happened if it takes me the rest of the voyage i think it was then that i got the first premonition of trouble ahead howe had buried his head in his hands and was rocking gently to and fro id like to know what was in his mind that night he died he murmured what are you thinking of i asked suicide suicide his head jerked up as though id hit him no he said angrily no hed never have done that he shook his head you dont know him of course he was a small man but he had great energy and a sense of humour his eyes were always twinkling he was a happy man the thought of suicide would never enter his head he enjoyed life but if bland were planning to hand control of the company to his son surely that might be grounds for suicide i suggested howe gave a quick laugh a jackal laugh half bark bland pinched his girl once he said bernt nordahl didnt commit suicide then no he went and consoled himself with a married woman he smiled as though at some secret joke no whatever happened he didnt commit suicide his fingers had tightened on his empty tumbler so that i thought hed crush the glass then he leaned forward and picked up the bottle automaticaly filling the tumbler to the brim with neat whisky why is bland in such a hurry to hand over the business to his son i asked because every man dreams of a son to carry on where he leaves off he snarled and i understood then why he needed to stay drunk but why the hurry i asked why why why his voice had risen again youre as full of questions as a damned school kid i was a schoolmaster once he added irrelevantly taught science he took another gulp at his drink you want to know why bland is in a hurry all right ill tell you hes in a hurry because hes going to die and he knows it hes had two strokes already and as far as im concerned the sooner hes dead the better hes a financial crook with about as much sense of his voice jerked to a stop his mouth stayed open the jaw slack he was gazing at the cabin door i twisted round in my seat the door was open as it had been all along and framed in it was elands heavy bulk he came in and i saw that his face was mottled with the pressure of his anger get to your cabin howe he said in a terrible controlled voice and stay there youre drunk behind him in the passage i caught a glimpse of judies pale face howe cringed away from him as though he expected to be struck then his long neck jerked out im glad you heard he breathed i wanted you to hear his voice steadied it was unnaturally quiet as he said i wish you were dead i wish youd died before you ever left south africa and came to norway and met anna halvorsen his hands clenched and he stared vacantly into space i wish id never been born he whispered craig get him in his cabin elands voice shook i nodded come on i said to howe the man staggered to his feet swaying slightly he still had the vacant look but he turned his head and focused slowly on bland his hands clenched again and he thrust out his head like a tortoise peering into blandd eyes if you killed him he hissed god help you his face was twisted with venom hate blazed in his eyes elands big hands caught hold of him what do you mean by that he looked as though he was on the point of battering howes ugly face to pulp howe seemed to relax slightly his thick lips drew back from his teeth in a smile it was as though he suddenly dominated bland as though the other were afraid of him and he knew it if uriah the hittite had lived he said softly what would have happened the next time dont talk to me in riddles bland snapped then have it in plain words howe shouted you tricked bernt out of the woman he loved and now youve been trying to trick him out of his interest in the company for all i know youve done worse than that but dont worry bland ill find out the truth about his death and if youre the cause of it he stooped his head down so that his eyes were looking straight into blands ill kill you he said he turned then swaying slightly and reached the door his body inclined as though leaning against a strong wind bland found his voice again as from today you cease to be in the employ of the company he said abruptly howe turned smiling slyly i shouldnt do that bland he said wouldnt look good first bernt then me too much like making a clean sweep he was face to face with judie now in the doorway i saw her shrink back her eyes were very wide her face a pale mask howe stopped and stared at her a moment then he laughed and still laughing staggered along the passage to his cabin judie watched him go her lips a tightdrawn gash of red against the white of her face she didnt say anything bland turned to me he gave an apologetic shrug of his shoulders im sorry you should have been witness to such a melodramatic scene he said the mans not right in the head im afraid id never have employed him but for nordahl but until this moment i didnt know he knew certain personal things it gives his warped mind the sense of a grudge id be glad if youd keep the matter to yourself of course i said the man looked terribly shaken his face had a bluish tinge and his heavy cheeks quivered good night he muttered good night i replied he closed the door behind him i poured another drink land sat there wondering what the hell id got myself into chapter iii next day the sun had gone the sea was grey and flecked with whitecaps a southerly wind drove ragged wisps of cloud across the sky in a nights sailing we seemed to have left summer behind us the wind was cold and i began to think of the miles of iceinfested seas that lay ahead the deck heaved as tauer iii lurched over the waves like a drunkard things were different this morning the crew stood about in little groups talking furtively there was a sullen brooding air about the ship there were not friendly grins as i inspected the ship that morning and later in the day an ugly fight broke out between two of the men the coxsn wouldnt let me interfere so i got mcphee up on to the bridge and asked him what the trouble was weel he fingered his jaw the way he had its no exactly easy to explain ye see this is a nordahl boat the men are all from tonsberg and noo that they know nordahl is dead how did they find that out ye canna have a row like there was between bland and howe last night wioot it getting aroond the ship yed be surprised but the men are fond of howe the same way they were fond of nordahl but they dont have to fight about it och that was just their way of blowing off steam the coxsn was quite right to stop ye from interfering ye see theres no love lost between the tonsberg and sandefjord men and its a sandefjord man got hurt sandefjords one of the whaling towns of norway isnt it i asked aye the biggest and tonsberg another whaling toun but they dont have to fight just because theres rivalry between the two towns och ye dont understand its this way nordahl was a tonsberg man when he and colonel bland started the company after the war nordahl had a free hand wi the signing on of the crews naturally he signed on tonsberg men but mrs bland shes norwegian ye ken she comes from sandefjord och its maybe joost gossip but they say she fancies herself as a wee bittie queen of the place whatever the cause of it sandefjord men were included in the crews last season an this season the proportions aboot fiftyfifty weel it dinna make for smoothrunning theres a natural resentment amongst the tonsberg men so they took it out of this poor devil from sandefjord aye thats aboot it theyre in an angry and soospiscious mood angry because they werent told aboot nordahls death soospiscious weel theres one or two persons they wouldna mind shoving overboard meaning who i asked but he shook his head ahm no saying anither worrd do you mean bland and his son i asked him am no saying anither worrd he repeated but i saw by the glint in his eye that id hit the nail on the head well i hope they dont do anything foolish i said its coming up dirty he cocked his eye at the sky to windward and nodded aye itll be a dirrty nicht ahm thinking but theyll sail the ship all reel ye dinna ha to fash yerself aboot that and the sandefjord man hell be all reel noo he hesitated shuffling his feet awkwardly yell no pass on what ah said jist noo aboot theyre wanting to get rid o one or two persons of course not he suddenly grinned its the deil when yeve got factions like this an theyre cooped oop togither in a godforsaken place like the antarctic for moonths on end its no so bad on the catchers and the towing ships each ship is either tonsberg or sandefjord wi a smattering of scots in the enginerooms the sandefjord laddie is only on board here because he was held in capetown for hospital treatment but i tell ye its no sa gude on the factory ship you mean theyve a mixed crew on the southern cross i asked him aye an it isna only the crew thats mixed its the flensers and lemmers and labourers thats mixed too and theyre a violent bluidy bunch o bastards he shook his head gloomily and turned to go perhaps youd care to have a drink with me later i suggested his face relaxed into a dour smile aye ah would that and he slid down the ladder to the deck below leaving me with a welter of halfdigested thoughts in my head i paced up and down for a time my mind saturated with conjecture perhaps bland sensed this its the only explanation i can give for the sudden intimacy of his conversation i handt seen him all day hed kept to his cabin but about seven oclock he pulled himself up on to the bridge he was muffled up in coats and scarves and he looked even broader than usual his face was blue and puffy the bloodvessels showing through the skin in a mottled web has the southern cross given you her position yet he asked yes i said i got a message from captain eide this morning good he peered over the helmsmans shoulder at the compass and then stared out to windward screwing his eyes up behind his thicklensed glasses hear there was a fight he said yes sandefjord versus tonsberg tonsberg won i added i dont know quite why i put it like that i suppose i wanted him to talk he gave me a quick glance and then leaned his heavy bulk against the windbreaker women are the devil he muttered i think he was speaking to himself but i was leeward of him and the wind flung the words at me you married he asked turning abruptly towards me no i said he nodded slowly it was as though he were saying youre lucky a mans no match for a woman he said looking straight at me a mans mind and interests range a womans narrow theyve a queer distorted love of power and theyre fonder of their sons than they are of their husbands he turned his head away and stared down at the sea where it was beginning to break inboard over our plunging bow i didnt say anything for a moment i thought the sudden intimacy had been broken but then he said human relationships are queer have you ever thought what a thin veneer our civilization is its little more than a code of manners concealing the primitive human nature doesnt change i said he nodded it becomes cribbed by the regulations and hoodoos of society but i agree it doesnt change once let slip the leash of organized society he didnt finish the sentence but stood with his face to the wind as though to cool the inflamed bloodvessels that webbed it what exactly are you trying to tell me i asked bluntly he looked round at me then peering up at me through his glasses i dont know he said but youre intelligent and youre outside it all a man must have somebody to talk to when things are getting too much for him he turned his head back to the sea again hunching it into the fur collar of his topcoat he was like a big bullfrog squatting there against the windbreaker howe told you i was dying it was a statement rather than a question he said something about you having had a couple of strokes i told him well im dying he said it matteroffactly as though he were informing a group of shareholders that the company had traded at a deficit were all doing that i said he grunted of course but were not usually given a time limit the best man in harley street gives me a year at most his hand gripped the canvas of the windbreaker and jerked at it as though he wanted to tear it in little shreds a years not long he said hoarsely its twelve months three hundred and sixtyfive days and at any moment i may get another stroke and thatll finish me he suddenly laughed it was a bitter violent sound when youre told that it changes your approach to life things which seemed important before cease to be important others loom larger his hand relaxed on the windbreaker when we reach the southern cross he said get to know my son i want your opinion of him he turned abruptly then and went ponderously down the ladder to the deck below i watched him go wishing id been able to hold him just a little longer there were questions id like to have asked him in the middle of our meal that night the radio operator brought bland a message his heavy brows dragged down as he read it then he got to his feet a word with you craig he growled i followed him to his cabin he closed the door and handed me the message read that he said i took the message to the light it read eide to bland men demanding inquiry nordahls death erik bland has rejected demand please confirm rejection mood of tonsbergtmen dangerous whale very scarce position s w pack ice heavy i handed the message back to him he crumpled it up in his big fist the damned fool he growled itll be all over the ship that hes not happy about eriks decision and eirks quite right to reject a demand like that its a matter for the officers to decide he paced up and down for a moment tugging at the lobe of his ear what worries me is that they should be demanding an inquiry at all if the circumstances warranted an inquiry then erik should have ordered it right away instead of waiting for the men to demand it and i dont like hides use of the word dangerous he added he wouldnt use it unless the situation was bad he swung round on me whats the earliest we can expect to reach the southern cross eight days at least i answered he nodded gloomily a lot can happen in eight days the worst news in that message is that theyre getting few whales when men are busy they havent the energy to brood but when no whales are coming in ive seen men change from smiles to hatred in the twinkling of an eye when the whales have been lost and theyll link it in their minds with nordahls death damn them theyre a superstitious lot and nordhal had a nose for whale what are you scared of i asked youre not suggesting that the men would mutiny are you presumably a factory ship comes under normal british maritime laws it takes a lot to drive men to mutiny of course im not suggesting theyd mutiny but they can make things damned awkward without going as far as mutiny theres three million pounds invested in that outfit to make money on a capital outlay as big as that in a four month season everything has got to move with clocklike precision he began tugging at the lobe of his ear again erik cant handle a thing like this he hasnt the experience then put somebody else in charge i suggested captain eide for instance he looked up at me quickly his small eyes were narrowed i could see the battle going on inside him pride against prudence no he said no he must learn to handle things himself he paced up and down he didnt say anything the silence in the cabin was the sort of silence that is audible i could see the conflict working in the man with sudden decision he went to the door ill have eide report independently he threw over his shoulder i went up on to the bridge the sea was a heaving mass in the dreary half light i stood there for a moment watching the heavy weight of water surging white across the bow every time the little ship plunged an albatross wheeled over the mast its huge wings were still as it planed into the wind the air was bitterly cold a thin film of ice was spreading on the windbreaker so that the canvas was stiff and smooth to the touch i went into the wheelhouse and looked at the barometer no good said the bearded norwegian at the wheel he was right the glass was very low and still falling the sommer she did not kom eh his bearded face opened in a grin but there was no answering humour in his blue eyes the door flung back and judie entered the wind blowing her in with a swirl of sleet she shut the door with difficulty the weather looks bad she said her face was pinched and cold were getting into high latitudes i reminded her she nodded bleakly i offered her a cigarette she took it and as i struck a match to light it for her i saw that her hand was trembling slightly she gulped in a lungful of smoke and then asked was that message from hide yes i said what did it say i told her she turned and stared out through the window the sea was cold and grey a tumbled mass of water barely visible yet seeming to crowd its menace right into the wheelhouse she didnt speak for some time and when she did she startled me by saying i feel scared its just the weather i said she dropped her cigarette and ground it out violently with her heel no its not the weather it its something i dont understand she turned and faced me i should just be feeling wretched because hes dead it should end there with sorrow but it doesnt and then she said again im scared i stepped forward and took her hand it was cold as ice its rotten for you i said but theres no need for you to worry things will sort themselves out when we reach the southern cross i dont know she said i feel as though thats just the beginning she looked up at me her grey eyes were deeply troubled walter knows something knows something that we dont her voice trembled she was overwrought why should howe know anything we dont i said youre imagining things im not imagining things she answered violently im seeing things for the first time i didnt say anything and we stood there for some time quite silent she didnt attempt to withdraw her hand from mine but there was no contact between us then she suddenly jerked her hand away pulled a packet of cigarettes out of her pocket and offered me one is this the farthest south youve ever been she asked her voice controlled and a little abrupt yes i said and raised my other hand to show i was still smoking but im not new to ice when i was twenty i went on a university expedition to south east greenland so you are an explorer she took one of her cigarettes and i lit it for her but youll find it very different down here the land mass of the south pole makes it much colder she took a long pull at the cigarette and added but its unusual for the pack to be so far north at this time of the year its like it was in the summer of when shackleton came down here in the endurance i was in oslo just after the war i said i went over to bygdoy and saw the from i think that must be the best exhibition of polar exploration in the world yes i like it too we are very proud of the from the conversation languished there so i said i suppose this is your first trip into the antarctic no she replied not my first when i was eight years old my father brought me with him to south georgia my mother had just died and we had no home bernt was one of the sky tiers at grytviken i was there about two months then he sent me to friends in new zealand he said it was time i learnt english i learned my english in auckland i was there a year and then he took me back with him at the end of the next season is grytviken in south georgia i asked yes there are shore stations there i made three or four trips with my father in his catcher then youre quite an experienced whaler i kidded her no she said im not like gerda petersen whos she i asked gerda is the daughter of olaf petersen she answered olaf was once mate on my fathers catcher when he was at grytviken gerda and i are the same age we used to play together when we were at grytviken but shes tough shes more like a man this is her second season with our company her father says hell make her the first woman sky tier in norway she must be tough i said she laughed poor gerda shes not very beautiful you know she ought to have been born a boy shes passed all her exams she could be master of a ship like women are in russia but she prefers to come south as her fathers mate his men worship her she may not be very beautiful but i think shes very happy a sudden gust of wind hit the wheelhouse the ship heeled and dipped violently i caught a glimpse of the white sheet of spray flung up by the bows as they crashed into a wave felt the whole ship tremble the door burst open and the coxsn came in judie said i think ill go below now ill come with you i said i want to get some sleep before the storm breaks i told the coxsn to wake me if it got worse and took judie below i saw her to her cabin below decks the movement of the ship seemed much more violent i was very conscious that the worst was yet to come ill introduce you to gerda judie said as i held the door of her cabin open for her shes very fat and very jolly and youll like her she gave me a quick smile i hope youll have enough clothing she said itll be cold up on the bridge when dawn comes fortunately sudmann and i are about the same size i said i wished her good night and closed the door back in my own cabin i took off my boots and climbed into my bunk with my clothes on for a long time i lay awake listening to the straining of the ship sensing the growing pressure of the wind and seas and all the time wondering about the factory ship still two thousand miles souwest of us the full force of the storm hit us just after four in the morning i woke to sudden consciousness feeling the weight of the water holding us down the struggle of the ship against the fury of the elements was there in every sound of her in the creaking of the cabin furniture in the jerk and shudder of the engine in the staggering movement of her as she plunged and climbed plunged and climbed i could feel the steel of the cabin walls bending under the strain she was like a live thing fighting for breath i rolled out of my bunk and fumbled for my sea boots the coxsn came in as i was dragging on my oilskins he didnt say anything he just nodded and went out again outside the full force of the wind hit me thrusting me against the rail taking my breath away seas rolled green over the after deck i hauled myself up to the bridge the short night was over but the dawn was a grey half darkness the coxsn had headed her into the wind the waves seemed mountains high their tops a hissing whirl of spindrift and the sleet drove parallel with the wavetops a wild driven curtain of darkness i wont attempt to describe those next eight days they were eight days of unrelieved hell for everyone on board sometimes it rained more often it just blew the weight of the wind varied but i doubt whether it ever dropped below force it was from the southwest varying about two points either side the sea was like a mountain range on the move there wasnt a dry place in the ship nearly everyone was seasick in all those eight days we only saw the sun once and that was a watery gleam that flashed out for a few minutes through a vent in the storm wrack i ceased to think about the object of our journey or about the southern cross i ceased to think about anything but the ship my mind was a blank of sleeplessness in which the safety of the ship was the only tangible idea i saw hardly anything of the others i was up on the bridge most of the time bland came up twice his heavy features blue with cold and the exhaustion of seasickness each time he asked for our position the man had a driving purpose which was accentuated by the knowledge of his illness his interest in life had narrowed down to an urgent desire to reach the southern cross as soon as possible he was impatient at our slow progress impotently angry at the elements i remember him standing there on the bridge and shaking his fist at the sea and shouting damn you damn you as though curses could subdue the wind some ice had formed on the rungs of the bridge ladder he slipped as he went down and a wave bursting against the side of the ship nearly swept him overboard he was wet through and badly shaken he didnt come up to the bridge again judie came up once and i was angry with her telling her to keep to her cabin i think i threw some bad language at her i was too wrought up to know what i said it had the desired effect and she didnt come up again but after that every morning one of the crew brought up a flask of brandy fra fru bland i was grateful to her for that bonomi was the only one of the passengers who was a daily visitor on the bridge he was suffering badly from seasickness but hed struggle up each day with his camera regardless of the danger and take pictures of the storm his greeting was invariably the same it is turn out nice again yes and his monkeylike face green under the olive tan would crack in a wide grin once i asked him about doctor howe is he sick i asked he is sick of course he answered but what is sickness to a man who drink two bottles of whisky a day he is incredible that man in a way the storm was a good thing there was no more trouble with the sandefjord man the crew were fully occupied with the weather this according to the old hands was quite unprecedented it was much colder than it should have been and the gale prolonged itself out of all expectation but by the th we were in s w some miles east of south georgia daylight was now virtually continuous throughout the twentyfour hours visibility fortunately was not too bad for on the th we sighted our first iceberg and shortly after the evening meal the masthead lookout reported land on the port beam this was the first of the sandwich group it was the only glimpse we got of it as the storm clouds closed in and heavy icy rain reduced visibility to a few miles our course was still s w and we began to sight icebergs regularly some of them big towering masses of ice pinnacled and ramparted like floating forts one we passed must have been fully three miles long with a completely flat top except for one steep and sudden mass like the superstructure of a ship it bore in fact a striking resemblance to a monstrous aircraft carrier coated in ice i was constantly up on the bridge now for we were closing the last position we had received from the southern cross we should have been in radio telephone communication the r t set had a radius of miles or more but early in the storm our aerials had been brought down and it had been impossible to rerig on the night of the th the gale got worse than ever heavy freezing rain brought visibility down to almost zero and in the half light around midnight i reduced speed shortly afterwards the lookout called down isen i rang for slow ahead and a few moments later caught the white glimmer of ice ahead it wasnt a berg it was our first taste of loose pack the floes were small and broken the thawing fringe broken from the pack ice farther south and flung northeastward by the storm the coxsn shook his head gloomily nefer haf i seen the ice up here in sommer i turned the ship westward and remained at slow ahead early that morning the wind suddenly veered to the south and died away to a gentle breeze the clouds drifted away astern and we saw the sun clearly for the first time in eight days it was low on the horizon and had little warmth but it was wonderful just to see it the sky was blue and the world looked suddenly cheerful but the sea remained a mountainous heaving mass and despite the blue of the sky it had a peculiar cold green colour away to the south a glimmer of white showed the fringe of the loose pack ice through bleary eyes i watched the sun climb quickly up the sky soon everything was steaming then gradually the suns light paled the warmth died out of it and the blue gradually faded from the sky a damp cold gripped the ship the horizon faded the distant line of white that marked the ice became blurred and then vanished merging into what looked like a low strata of cloud at sea level then the sun vanished altogether the colour drained out of everything the scene became a flat black and white picture it was cold like an etching then the sharpness of it faded as the fog rolled over us enveloping us in its chill soundless blanket we kept at slow ahead with lookouts in the bow and at the masthead i was taking no chances with icebergs though in that brief glimpse of the icelittered sea to the south i had seen no sign of any shortly after ten bland himself came up on to the bridge eight days of enforced idleness and little food had made a great difference to him his face was leaner the bluish tinge had gone and the mottled veining of his skin was not so noticeable his movements were quicker too and his eyes more alert whats our position he asked his tone was crisp the personality that had driven the man to the top of his own world was there in his voice fiftyeight south thirtythree west i told him i took him into the wheelhouse and showed him the position on the chart roughly miles west of south thule the southernmost point of the sandwich group we ought to be able to get the southern cross on the r t he said sparks is rigging a new arerial now i told him ill let you know as soon as he makes contact he nodded and went out on to the bridge he stood for a while staring out into the fog he stood like that for several minutes his big hands encased in fur gloves gripping the icestiff canvas of the windbreaker suddenly he swung round on me ive been mixed up in whaling for the last twentyfive years he said ive never heard of summer conditions as bad as this i made the same remark that judie had made eight days before that it was the sort of conditions that shackleton experienced in the endurance in he gave a grunt this isnt a damned polar expedition he growled this is business see any whale this morning none i said wheres howe i havent seen him since the storm started i replied he turned and barked an order in norwegian to one of the crew the man looked at him it wasnt exactly insolence but the mans manner was sullen as he said ja and crossed the bridge to the ladder bland spoke to him sharply the mans face darkened ja hr direktor he muttered and slid down the ladder to the deck below bland said something violent under his breath and walked to the starboard wing of the bridge he stood there alone peering out over the side until howe appeared howe looked thin as a wraith beside the squat bulk of the companys chairman he had a weak growth of beard that looked untidy on his queer face and his eyes were bloodshot but he was sober standing in front of bland he seemed nervous as though without liquor inside him he found it difficult to face the man for the last four years nordahl has employed you as a scientist bland rumbled his small eyes looking the other up and down with marked distaste now its up to you to justify that appointment conditions out here this summer are abnormal the last report we had for the southern cross spoke of few whales weve seen none by tomorrow morning i want a report from you on the probable movement of whale in these conditions i understood you to say i was no longer employed by the company howes voice had developed a slight stutter his adams apple jerked up and down under his scrubby beard forget it bland said you were drunk i shall assume you didnt know what you were saying your continued employment will depend on your usefulness to the company now get to work i want a full report first thing tomorrow morning bland turned on his heel howe hesitated i knew what he wanted to say he wanted to tell bland that it was unfair to expect the impossible that the very abnormality of the conditions made it so he was being blackmailed and he knew it bland wanted whales howe was to produce them like a conjurer or be sacked his adams apple jerked violently once or twice his mouth opened and then suddenly closed he turned and stumbled past me to the bridge ladder shortly afterwards bland went below an hour later bonomi called up to me to say that the radio was working i left the coxsn on the bridge and stumbled wearily down to the deck below my eyes were bleary with lack of sleep and the strain of staring into days of wind and sleet and the mornings impenetrable blanket of fog bland and judie were both in the wireless room judie had dark circles of strain under her eyes but her smile of greeting was warm and friendly you must be dead she said the daily flask of brandy was a great help i said she looked away quickly as though she hadnt wanted to be thanked bland turned his big head towards me he had taken off the little fur cap with the ear flaps that hed been wearing and his mane of white hair was rumpled he looked like a rather surprised owl just trying to get the southern cross on the r t he said weve been speaking to the haakon one of the sandefjord factory ships shes got eight whale in the last ten days now shes steaming south towards the weddell sea hanssen the master says hes never known conditions like this hes about three hundred miles westsouwest of us the radio crackled then clear and distinct came a voice speaking in norwegian i guessed it must be the southern cross for bland stiffened and his head jerked round toward the receiver the radio operator leaned down towards the mike ulloulloullo syd korset tauer iii anroper syd korset there was a quick exchange in norwegian and then he turned to bland i have captain hide for you he said and passed the microphone across to him the chairmans thick fingers closed round the bakelite grip bland here is that captain hide ja hr direktor this is hide the voice crackled in singsong english faintly reminiscent of a welsh accent whats your position i nodded for sparks to take it down fiftyeight point three four south thirtyfour point five six west i made a swift mental calculation elands eyebrows lifted in my direction thats about forty miles west of us i said he nodded and resumed his conversation this time in norwegian i didnt listen i couldnt concentrate enough to pluck the sense out of it from the few words id managed to pick up the warmth of the cabin was enveloping me my eyelids became unbearably heavy sleep rolled my head against the wood panelling of the cabin wall then suddenly i was awake again a new voice was talking over the radio talking in english theyre holding out for an inquiry ive told them there isnt going to be any inquiry its a waste of time theres nothing to inquire into nordahls gone and thats all there is to it it was an easy cultured voice smooth like an expensive car but it was just a veneer it revealed nothing of its owner the real trouble is that the seasons been terrible even the sandefjord men are grumbling as for the tonsberg crowd theyre more nuisance than theyre worth if you hadnt been coming out id have sent the whole lot home well talk about that when i see you erik bland cut in his voice an angry rumble how many whale have you caught so far fin whale a hundred and twentyseven thats all the fogs just beginning to lift now perhaps the luck will change but theres pack ice to the southeast of us and the men dont like it they say conditions are abnormal i know all about that said bland what are your plans were cruising east now along the northern edge of the pack well just have to hope for the best hope for the best elands cheeks quivered you get out and find whale and find em damn quick boy every day without whale is a disaster do you understand if you think you can find them when i cant well youre welcome to come and try the voice sounded sharp and resentful bland gave an angry grunt if nordahl were alive dont you start throwing nordahl at me his son interrupted in a tone of sudden violence im sick of hearing about him hes dead and the mere mention of his name as though it were a sort of talisman wont produce whale well be with you in a few hours now bland said soothingly well talk about it then put hide back on hides voice was comfortingly calm he spoke in norwegian and bland was answering him in the same language there was a pause then suddenly his voice was back in the cabin again shouting hval hval en av hvalbaatene har sett hval blands face relaxed he was smiling everybody in the cabin was smiling i looked at judie she leaned towards me and i saw that even she was excited theyve sighted whale she turned her head to the radio again and then added they have seen several pods they are all going south into the ice how many whales to a pod i asked she laughed depends on the sort of whale only one or two in the case of the blue whale but three to five for the fin whale she shook her head but its bad for them to be going south the skipper of the southern cross signed off and bland turned to me you got their position he asked i nodded and got stiffly to my feet sparks handed me a slip of paper on which hed written the present position and course of the southern cross i climbed up to the bridge and laid our course to meet up with the factory ship tauer iii turned heeling slightly as the helmsman swung her on to the new bearing i told the coxsn to wake me in four hours time and went below for the first real sleep id had in eight days but i didnt get my full four hours the messboy woke me just after midday and i dragged myself up to the bridge the coxsn was there sniffing the air you smell something ja he was grinning i smelt it at once a queer heavy smell like a coal byproduct now you smell money he said that is whale the southern cross ja how far away fifteen maybe twenty mile good god i said i was imagining what the smell must be like close to i ordered the helmsman to point the ship up into the light southerly wind an hour later the fog began to lift and i ordered full speed slowly the fog cleared revealing a bleak ice green sea heaving morosely under a low layer of cloud away to the southeast i got my first sight of the ice blink this was the light striking up from close pack ice its surface mirrored in the cloud the effect was one of brilliant whiteness crisscrossed with dark seams the dark seams were the water lanes cutting through between the floes all faithfully mapped out in the cloud mirror above it bonomi was up on the bridge with his camera when id worked out our position and sent a lookout to the masthead he came across to me you feel good now eh everything is fine he grinned his cheerfulness added to the sense of depression that had been growing up inside me i wasnt looking forward to closing with the southern cross for one thing it meant the end of my temporary command for another well all i can say is that i had developed an uneasy feeling about the southern cross bland is saying we must go south into the weddell sea bonomi babbled on i ope so he says that after nordahl hanssen is the best whaler in norway and if he take the haakon south then we shall go too in the weddell sea i think i get very good pictures you will see he was getting on my nerves and i was too dead with lack of sleep to have any hold over my tongue dont you think of anything else but your bloody pictures i said he looked up at me with a sort of shocked surprise but what else should i think of he peered up at me as though gauging my temper do not worry about losing the ship i find a nice job for you oh carrying my camera we were both laughing at his little joke when there was a cry of ship ahoy from the masthead ten minutes later a thick blur of smoke fine on the starboard bow was visible from the bridge bland judie weiner they all came up gazing excitedly at that first glimpse of the factory ship trying out by the look of it bland said i glanced at him quickly his small eyes gleamed behind their glasses for him the smoke meant money for judie it meant something different and her gaze was clouded bonomi was excited he positively bounced up and down and insisted on shaking everybody by the hand weiner looked at it with the apathy of a man to whom nothing has a sense of reality howe also came up on to the bridge and stood a little removed from the rest gazing out towards the smoke i wished i could read his thoughts i saw him glance covertly at bland and then back again towards the smoke on the horizon and in that instant i felt a tingle run up my spine judie caught my eye i hope the whales she didnt finish the sentence but stared at me her mouth slightly open caught in the utterance of the next word i think she knew that howe worried me bland went aft to the wireless room then the others followed howe was the last to go he stood gripping the windbreaker with his bony hands conscious of my gaze he turned and looked at me then he swung away and stared for a moment south towards the ice blink i watched him fascinated his glance went once more to the factory ship and then back to the mirrored brightness of the pack ice he stared at it for a long time then he turned quickly i must go and prepare my report he said and there was a curiously sly lift to the corners of his mouth as he said this once i went down to the wireless room it was a babel of sound norwegian voices boomed out of the r t receiver catchers to the factory ship the factory ship to the buoy boats and towers everyone was talking on the air at once i gathered the whales were plentiful bland was smiling and in intervals between communications he was discussing the new electrical equipment with weiner sometimes in english sometimes in german it was a strange and rather wonderful sight as we closed the southern cross it wasnt just a factory ship it was a whole fleet of ships i examined them through my glasses there were five catchers strung out in a line behind the southern cross they appeared to be idle another catcher was almost alongside there were two towing ships i recognized them by their corvette lines there were also two oldtype catchers that i was told were buoy boats that is to say they were towing vessels that could be used to supplement the catcher fleet if required behind these was an old whaling ship which ferried the meat to the refrigerator ship a vessel of about tons which was lying astern of the others near this was a large tanker and more catchers were scurrying about on the horizon to see all those ships gathered together in these hostile southern seas fired the imagination it was such a gigantic operation a litter of masts that reminded me of dday bonomi gripped my arm and pointed across the port bow a spout of vapour rose not two cables length away from us and the water boiled as a smooth sleek shape like a submarine dived there was a snort almost alongside and another spout thrust ten or fifteen feet into the air so close that the wind whipped some of the water on to our decks it was our first sight of a whale bonomi dived for his camera we were in the midst of a pod i brought the ship round in a wide circle to come up parallel with the southern cross in doing so we passed right through the black oily smoke that drifted to leeward of her the thick noisome smell closed down on us like a blanket it was a heavy oily allpervading smell it seemed to weigh down on the senses thick and cloying and penetrating as we emerged from it i could hear the sound of voices on the factory ship and the clank of winches the stern was open like a dark cavern and a whale was being hauled up through it to the afterplan the ship was big about twenty thousand tons her steel sides already rusting towered above us as we glided alongside up on the bridge a man in a fur cap held a megaphone to his lips and called down to us it was eide i caught the name that was all the rest was in norwegian judie said hes lowering a boat and coming over to us himself her face looked puzzled i wonder why she added i glanced across at bland he was standing in the port wing of the bridge gazing aft to where the catchers were strung out in a line his brows were dragged down and his face had a thunderous look we were all there on the bridge when eide arrived he was a gaunt bony man with hatchetlike features and a trick of continually chewing on a matchstick which he slipped to the corner of his mouth when he spoke he was wearing a thick polonecked sweater and his gabardine trousers were secured by a wide leather belt with a silver buckle weil bland barked at him whats the trouble why arent all the catchers out eide looked quickly round i will speak in english he said noticing that the man at the helm was watching him there is trouble half the men in the ship have struck also the men on five catchers and one towing ship the tonsberg men bland asked ja they have threatened to stop the others working but they have not yet made any trouble theyre waiting to see what i do is that it hide nodded elands fist thudded on the bridge rail youve not much more than a hundred whales to show for six weeks work he was almost shouting and now when we are right in the midst of whale they strike why whats their complaint they want an inquiry into nordahls death hide hesitated and then said also they wish your son to be removed from the position of acting manager whos behind all this kaptein larvik i think he speaks for the others as you know he was a great friend of nordahl it is he i think who start this idea of an inquiry but they are all of them in it now larvik petersen korsvold schnelle strand and jensen blands hand clenched into a fist then it relaxed he took off his glasses and wiped them slowly his heavy jaw was set his small eyes steely i watched his mouth spread into a tightlipped smile then he put his glasses on again very well he said quietly if thats the way they want it he glanced quickly at hide who do they want as factory manager instead of my son kaptein petersen hide replied he is a good leader and he manage one of the south georgia stations for three seasons he returns to catching because he likes the active life all right captain hide you will signal for the captains of those five catchers and the towing ship to come on board for a conference with me i shall then give them an ultimatum either they get on with the job or they are relieved of their commands perhaps they will refuse to come hides voice sounded embarrassed good god bland exploded if things have been allowed to get as out of hand as that then there are other methods of dealing with them how will they get on in the antarctic without oil and supplies from the factory ship come pull yourself together eide we can be just as tough get down to the wireless room and instruct them to come on board the southern cross right away his jaw thrust out suddenly and if they try to make conditions tell them theyd better not aggravate me further whilst youre doing that well get our things into the boat craig he said turning to me youll come with us the coxsn can take temporary command here before you know where you are youll be in charge of a catcher he was almost grinning now he was the sort of man who thrived on a fight but i must say i didnt much fancy the role of strikebreaker amongst a lot of norwegians whose feuds i didnt fully understand eide was leaving the bridge now but bland stopped him why didnt erik come to report this himself he demanded the skipper of the factory ship hesitated then he said he is on the foreplan he could not come bland grunted hes got assistants hasnt he he growled i must say that at that moment i felt some sympathy for erik bland whatever the mans nature hed certainly been handed a tough job and i didnt blame him for staying up on the foreplan i looked at judie to see whether she was feeling sympathy for her husbands position but she was staring up at the towering ugly bulk of the southern cross and i realized that her thoughts were on her father chapter iv i wasnt present at the meeting between bland and the skippers of the tonsberg catchers but i saw them leave and i got the impression that bland had given them something to think about there were five of them tough bearded men with fur caps on their heads thick jerseys under their windbreakers and feet encased in kneelength boots they stopped at the head of the gangway talking together in a little bunch they were joined almost immediately by two other men one was short and stout with a jolly wrinkled face and the appearance of a seal the other was a big man with a jagged scar on his cheek over which his beard refused to grow they stood a little apart from the others for a moment talking earnestly in low voices as i passed them i heard the man with the scar say ja kaptein larvik then he turned away and the other joined the group at the head of the gangway i was being conducted round the ship at the time captain hide had allocated me a bunk in the second officers cabin and had detailed one of his officers a scot from leith to show me round my guide had taken me first to the flensing decks this is the centre of activity in a factory ship when the whales are coming in there are two flensing decks the foreplan and the afterplan and both looked the sort of charnel house you might dream up in a nightmare men waded kneedeep in the bulging intestines of the whales their longhandled curvedbladed flensing knives slashing at the bleeding hunks of meat exposed by the removal of the blubber casing the winches clattered incessantly the steam saws buzzed as they ripped into the backbone carving it into starshaped sections still festooned with ragged strands of red meat men with huge iron hooks dragged blubber meat and bone to the chutes that took it to the boilers to be tried out and the precious oil extracted the noise and the smell were indescribable and the work went on unceasingly as whale after whale was dragged up the slipway the men working like demons and the decks slippery with blood and grease i followed one whale as it came up through the cavity in the stern it was eighty feet long and weighed nearly a hundred tons the men on the afterplan fell on it when it was still being winched along the deck the flensers cut flaps of blubber from around its jaws hawser shackle was rigged in holes cut in these flaps and in a moment the winches were ripping the blubber off the huge carcase the flensers cutting it clear of the meat as it was rolled back to clear the blubber from the belly they winched the whale over on to its back and as it thudded over on the deck urine poured out of its stomach in a wave and the pink mass of the tongue flopped over like a huge jelly stripped of its blubber it was winched to the foreplan the meat was cut away from the backbone and then the bone itself was cut up and sent to the pots in just over an hour that hundredton monster had been worked up and absorbed by the factory ship i want to give a clear impression of this ship because only then is it possible to appreciate the shock of what happened later she was a floating factory a belching stinking muckheap of activity two thousand miles from civilization her upper works were black with grease and filth from the cloud of smoke that rolled out of her trying out funnel and over everything hung the awful smell of whale it was like a pall it was the smell of decaying flesh mingled with oil and fish and lying on the air thick and cloying like an inescapable fog but though her decks might present the appearance of some gargantuan slaughterhouse below all was neat and ordered as in a factory there were the long lines of boilers hissing gently with the steam that was being injected into them and with gutters bubbling with the hot oil there was the refrigeration plant and machinery for cutting and packing and dehydrating the meat there were crushing machines for converting the bone to fertilizer there were laboratories and worskshops sick bays mess rooms living quarters store rooms electric generating plant everything the southern cross was a wellstocked wellpopulated factory town when we got up on deck again the five catchers that had been lying idle astern of us had already scattered in search of whale four carcases were lying alongside gashed to prevent decay through the internal heat of the mass of dead flesh and horribly bloated through being inflated with air to keep them afloat one of the towing ships was bringing in five more the whole fleet was in action now with whales spouting all round us it was an incredible sight standing there on the deck of the factory ship we could hear the dull double thud of the harpoon guns in action i saw one catcher quite close the sky tier was running down the catwalk that connected the bridge with the gun platform perched precariously on the high bows he seized the gun his legs braced apart waiting for the moment to strike twice the catcher drove the whale under then suddenly the spout was right under the catchers bow i saw the sharpended point of the harpoon dip as the gun was aimed then it flew out a hundred and fifty pound javelinlike projectile with a light forerunner snaking after it there was the sharp crack of the gun and then the duller boom of the warhead eroding inside the whale as it sounded next moment the line was taut dragging at the masthead shackles and accumulator springs as the heavy line ran out and the winch brakes screamed the whole thing took on the proportions of a naval operation but by this time my stomach was in open revolt i thanked my guide hurriedly and staggered off to my cabin maybe if i hadnt been so tired my stomach could have stood it but the gale and sleepless days had weakened my resistance to that insidious filthy smell i gave up all i had to the cabin basin and cold with sweat fell into an exhausted sleep on my bunk i didnt wake up until kyrre the second officer came in he grinned at me as i opened my eyes you are ill yes the corners of his eyes creased in a thousand wrinkles and he roared with laughter he was a big blond fellow with a beard and gold fillings to his teeth soon you are better he added no more whale you mean youve finished catching for the day i struggled up on to my elbow i felt weak but my stomach was all right now finish for the day ja his eyes suddenly lost their laughter finish for altogether i think he said the whale go south it is what you say the migration he shook his big head i do not know he muttered it is very funny this season i have been four times to the antarctic but it was never like this before he scratched at his beard with a great dirty paw of a hand maybe we have to go south too that means going through the pack ice doesnt it i said putting my feet over the side of the bunk ja he said and his eyes looked troubled ja through the pack ice it is bad this season the haakon she is going south already we go also i think then suddenly he grinned and clapped me on the back come my friend we go to have some food eh but first you try some aquavit that is good for the stomach he produced a bottle and glasses this is good stuff real line aquavit he thrust the bottle in front of me so that i could see through the colourless spirit the back of the label on which was printed the name of the ship in which the liquor had crossed the line skaal he said when hed filled the glasses he knocked it straight back i did the same it was like a fire in my throat god i said real firewater firewater he roared with laughter ja that is good firewater now we eat eh the officers mess was plain and well scrubbed the predominating note bleak cleanliness most of the men wore beards they didnt talk i dont imagine they ever talked much once the food was served but a sense of tension brooded over the table covert glances were cast at bland where he sat with judie on one side of him and hide on the other judie was toying with her soup her eyes were blank she might have been alone the man next to her made some remark she ignored it which is erik bland i asked my companion it was as i had guessed the man sitting next to judie was her husband he was taller and much slimmer than his father but he had the same round head and short thick neck stripped of his beard the features might have been those of bland thirty or forty years ago but there wasnt the same strength there was no violent set of the jaw no dragging down of the brows from a wide forehead instead there was a sort of arrogance i drank my soup and watched him as he talked to the secretary who was sitting on the other side of him his manner suggested there was more of his mother than his father in his makeup nevertheless with his fair hair and blue eyes he looked a fair example of cleanlimbed norwegian youth the soup was followed by plates piled high with slabs of meat covered in a thick gravy i was hungry and though it was a little too highly spiced i was enjoying it until somebody said now you are eating whalemeat it is good eh my mind conjured up an immediate picture of the charnel house of the flensing decks and i pushed the plate away from me this brought a roar of laughter if you do not eat whalemeat captain hide said i think you will starve on the southern cross another gust of laughter shook the room and i realized that they were all glad of something to laugh at well ill stick to bread and cheese this evening i said it was good rye bread freshly baked the laughter evaporated a gloomy silence invaded the room again when the meal was over eide asked me to have a drink with him he took me to his cabin and we talked about the war he had commanded a norwegian destroyer and i found hed been with several convoys that i had been attached to at length i brought the conversation round to nordahls disappearance but all hed say was its a complete mystery i dont understand it at all whats your opinion of erik bland i asked purposely putting the question so bluntly that he couldnt evade answering it without appearing rude how do you mean he asked guardedly i gathered hed been causing trouble with the tonsberg men eides brows lifted on the contrary hes done everything to smooth things over hes young of course and inexperienced but thats not his fault hell learn and a lot of the men like him but he didnt get on with nordahl did he eide hesitated youve seen the messages to colonel bland eh i nodded well he said nordahl wasnt an easy man to get on with im not saying he wasnt a good leader he was but he expected people to accept his views without question he was impatient of opposition and wasnt open to suggestion that suits the mentality of the skytters whose job it is to act and not to think but it made the daytoday management of the factory ship difficult there must have been more to it than that for nordahl to send that ultimatum to colonel bland i suggested there was a short embarrassed silence and then eide said if you do not mind i would prefer not discuss this matter with you you understand there are politics in every company and it is better not to talk about them of course i said i understand youre not by any chance from sandefjord are you he looked at me and his lips spread into a brief smile my home is in kristiansand he said i am master of the southern cross this trip because andersen who was a tonsberg man has retired after that i switched the conversation back to the war about half an hour later i excused myself and went down to my cabin i was still very tired and i slept as though id been drugged at breakfast the next morning there was soup and more whalemeat and a koldtbord of pressed whale beef tinned fish and brown norwegian goats cheese the pressed whale beef was good shortly after breakfast i was told that bland wanted to see me in his cabin i didnt know it then but this was the morning of the fatal decision id already been up on deck the wind had sprung up again a roaring blast of bitterly cold air out of the souwest the clouds were low and threatening to the south the prevailing grey was turned to brilliant white by the ice blink it was as though the moon were about to rise the catchers were scattered searching for a whale thick smoke continued to belch from the tryingout stack but the clatter of winches had ceased and the smell of whale was less noticeable eide and erik bland were in the cabin when i entered bland himself was seated in a swivel chair his elbow resting on the desk the mans face was pallid he was wiping his glasses and i noticed that there were thick pouches under his eyes craig i want you to meet my son he said erik this is commander craig erik bland came over and shook my hand glad to have you with us he said his manner was friendly my father thinks youre a fine sailor if i am i said the credits due to the british navy my antagonism was already melting his manner was easy and natural he might not have the drive and pugnacity of his father but his manners were better and he had confidence in himself i suddenly began to wonder how much of judies reactions were due to a father complex bland swung round in his chair so that he faced me sit down craig he said ive got a job for you he put his glasses on and began fingering the lobe of his ear for some reason that i dont understand the tonsberg men have got the idea that nordahls death wasnt accidental the man behind the whole thing is larvik but thats neither here nor there im not interested in the logic of their suspicions im interested only in the fact that they are suspicious and that until their suspicions are settled one way or the other it interferes with the working of the ship and the catchers ive told them that an inquiry will be held and since they seem to have an idea that in some way i or my son are involved neither of us will be on the committee of inquiry the committee will consist of three people the two members will be captain eide here and my daughterinlaw good god i said youre not going to make her go through the agony of examining all of the men who had conversation with nordahl just before he vanished surely you must understand her feelings in the im not interested in her feelings he growled at me my problem is that a lot of damned suspicious nonsense has got into the heads of some of the men with judie on the committee theyll accept the findings whatever they are in fact larvik has already agreed have you spoken to her about it i asked not yet but surely she has some im not prepared to argue his little eyes glared at me her husband agrees thats no answer i replied hotly do you think you have a better right to speak for her than her husband he asked his voice was suddenly violent i didnt say anything very well he said relaxing now then the reason ive asked you up here is this i want you to act as chairman of this committee youre entirely outside any company politics with you eide and judie on the committee the men will be satisfied well i hesitated i didnt want to be drawn into it i said id find you an interesting job he added and this is it the point he was making was obvious i was being paid by the company and if i didnt know enough to operate one of the whaling ships it was up to me to take on anything i was given whether it was this that decided me or the fact that judie was on the committee and i wanted to lessen the pain of it for her i dont know but i heard myself say all right ill act as chairman good he shifted more easily in his chair get down to it right away the sooner the jobs completed the better there was a knock at the door come in he called it was howe he had a sheaf of papers in his hand his face was slightly flushed and there was a queer excitement in his eyes ah come in howe bland said have you got that report for me howe nodded he didnt seem able to trust himself to speak he came across the cabin with that awkward crablike walk and handed bland the papers bland didnt look at them he looked at howe instead well he said what are your conclusions wheres the best place to hunt for whale in a season like this howe swallowed nervously come on man you know very well not a catcher has reported whale all morning though conditions have been ideal the sky tiers all say we just caught the tail end of a migratory movement where do you think well find whale do we go east or west back towards south georgia or down into the weddell sea well i howes adams apple gave one final jerk through the pack he said through the pack into the weddell sea his mouth had a sly twist to it and his watery eyes gleamed i suddenly had the feeling that the mans report was based on nothing more substantial than the fact that he wanted bland to go south and the strange thing was that bland himself seemed to want to go south too good good he said did you know hanssen was taking the haakon into the pack no the adams apple jerked again apparently he thinks the same so do petersen and larvik and after nordahl theyre the most experienced men we have i glanced quickly at erik bland as his father mentioned the name nordahl but it produced no reaction bland had got up and was staring out of the porthole suddenly he swung round very well captain eide he said his tone was abrupt decisive recall the catchers as soon as they have all come in get the gunners aboard for a conference my view is that we should go south right away weve only just over two months left and to make up for lost time we need plenty of whale have we enough meat to give the refrigerator ship a full cargo no eide replied and looked across at erik bland who added the south is only onethird full she must come with us then now go and recall the catchers he dismissed his son with a nod and turned to me i want the findings of that inquiry completed whilst the catchers are assembling before we start south captain eide has agreed to release the second officer from all duties to assist you in deciding who you wish to come before you to give evidence hes a tonsberg man he speaks english and he was on watch the night nordahl vanished he nodded to us thats all then gentlemen tomorrow we will enter the pack ice the imminence of our entry into the pack ice gave me little enough time to hold the inquiry immediately after the conference in blands cabin the ship turned its bow i towards the ice blink she was travelling at half speed as soon as all the catchers were assembled and they couldnt be more than a few hours steaming away all speed would be made to the south once in the pack i realized that it would be difficult to continue the inquiry captain eide for one would not be available nor would kyrre i was glad id had some experience of inquiries whilst in the navy kyrre had already received instructions and was waiting for me in our cabin i got from him a brief account of nordahls movements on the night hed disappeared and drew up a list of men to be interviewed bland sent down copies of a typewritten notice announcing the inquiry the officers smokeroom had been set aside for it and there was a blank against the time for me to fill in it asked any man who thought he might have information relevant to the factory managers disappearance to come before the committee i found eide on the bridge and fixed for the inquiry to begin at eleven then i went down to judies cabin she was sitting on her bunk very still very scared looking youve been told about this inquiry i asked i made my voice sound as matteroffact as possible she nodded ive fixed it for eleven i said thats in just over half an hour that all right for you yes her tone was almost harsh as though she were bracing herself for the ordeal i turned to go the i stopped its a rotten job for you i said ill be all right she gave me a wan smile at eleven oclock there were five men besides the ones wed called scuffling their feet outside the door of the smokeroom as i passed through them with judie there was a muttered god dag one man said god dag froken nordahl not fru bland but froken nordahl kyrre was already there eide came in as we were seating ourselves right i said lets have the men weve called first in the order we agreed kyrre it took us two hours to get the story of that night out of them but it was quite straightforward there was nothing in any of the evidence to prepare us for the labyrinth of ill feeling and suspicion we were to plough our way through later on the evening of the nd january nordahl had joined the other officers for the evening meal as usual he hadnt talked much but he wasnt any more silent that night than he had been since the ship left capetown he seemed to have had a premonition that the season was going to be a bad one the secretary who saw a lot of him said that he was increasingly concerned about the absence of whale nordahl had a very considerable financial interest in the company judie couldnt say exactly what the figure was but thought it might be as high as thirty or thirtyfive per cent after the meal nordahl had had a few drinks and then worked for half an hour in the office a good deal of his time was spent in the office not only was it necessary for him to supervise the checking of stores and the supply of fuel stores and equipment to the catchers and towing ships but also to keep an eye on the entry of whale brought in and handled since all the men got a share over and above their pay the outfit was run on what amounted to a copartnership basis young bland wasnt much help to him here as he had insufficient knowledge in fact nordahl bore the whole weight of management both as regards policy and detail the secretary said that he was very tired at the end of the day he was sixtytwo years old and the burden of decision and administrative detail must have been considerable after leaving the office nordahl went up on to the bridge he stayed there for a short time talking to the officer of the watch the half light of the antarctic summer light had fallen but shortly after nordahl left the bridge a bank of fog rolled up leaving the bridge nordahl had gone as far as was known straight to eides cabin there hed had two drinks that made about half a dozen hed had during the evening and he was a man with a big capacity for liquor captain hide who then gave evidence said that he had seemed perfectly normal but he was tired you know he added there had been trouble between him and erik bland i must say it since it may have a bearing on his state of mind bland did not know enough about the job on the other hand the trouble was not by any means all elands fault nordahl did not like him and he took no trouble to conceal his dislike also he was impatient he made no allowance for blands inexperience was there open trouble between them i asked captain hide shook his head i do not think so bland always treated the manager with the respect that was his due even when he was provoked but there were those messages to colonel bland things like that have a way of getting round a ship the tonsberg men supported nordahl and most of the sandefjord men sided with bland it did not make for smooth running and nordahl took most of blands work on his own shoulders i suggested ja that is so and you think this was too much for him he was overtired hide nodded after leaving hides cabin nordahl had gone to the wireless room he was there talking to the chief wireless officer till shortly after midnight i then called kyrre who had been officer of the watch during the period nordahl must have disappeared he had come on watch at midnight the ship was stationary and blanketed in fog the navigation lights of the ships riding astern of her were not visible nothing unusual happened throughout his watch after he had been on watch about half an hour the fog suddenly lifted and visibility increased to several miles i asked him whether he had heard a cry or a splash no he had noticed nothing unusual had he seen nordahl or anyone that might possibly have been nordahl up on the deck but hed seen nothing the fog she was very thick i could see nothing beyond the bridge and about twelvethirty the fog lifted and visibility was good ja if nordahl had gone overboard then he would have been seen that is so i was out on the bridge all watch and there was the lookout it was clear therefore that nordahl must have gone overboard between the time he had left the wireless room and just after twelvethirty when the fog lifted finally i called erik bland i nodded to a chair and he sat down he was frowning slightly and his eyes were screwed up so that they were small like his fathers i was conscious again of the similarity in appearance and the dissimilarity in character he seemed nervous theres only one queston i want to ask you bland i said nordahl left captain eides cabin shortly after tenthirty on the night of nd january did he visit you at all no i had a few words with him during the evening meal his eyes flicked towards judie and he gave a slight shrug to his shoulders i never saw him again had you had a row with him it was judie who put the question and i remember the feeling of shock caused by the blunt way she put the question and the hardness of her voice bland hesitated do i have to answer that question he asked me it was clear he was trying to save her unnecessary pain but i had no alternative im afraid so i said he looked at her then and said yes you know as well as i do we couldnt get on together it wasnt the first row wed had what was it about judies voice was drained of any emotion nothing just a difference of opinion about the promotion of a certain man as assistant manager your duty surely was to assist my father not to obstruct him i wasnt obstructing him his voice was pitched a shade higher listen judie your father and i didnt get on leave it at that cant you i had nothing to do with his death nobody is suggesting you had i said he looked at me quickly his face was paler now and there were beads of sweat on his forehead no then what is she driving at and shes not the only one larvik and petersen are spreading the idea through the ship and the tonsberg men will believe anything they say everyone on the ship knows nordahl and i couldnt get on together what they dont know is the reason he turned back to judie your father did everything he could to make things difficult for me i was new to the job yet he couldnt have been more impatient with me over my mistakes if id been on as many expeditions as he had i dont believe it judies voice was sharp and uncompromising whether you believe it or not its true he wanted to put me in a position where id be forced to ask my father to recall me why i asked why because he wanted to control the company after my fathers death he wanted me out of the way this is getting us nowhere i cut in have you any suggestions to make concerning nordahls death no he said ive no more idea how it happened than you have the only explanation i can think of is that he had financial troubles financial troubles eide repeated what sort of financial troubles he was gambling but bland stopped short there its his affair he murmured i dont believe that judie said quietly father never gambled he couldnt possibly have had financial troubles he was interested only in whale he would like to have controlled the company though wouldnt he there was a suggestion of spite in his tone then he gave a quick shrug to his shoulders im sorry gentlemen id rather not say any more about it but he had financial worries i said and you think this may have had some bearing on his death perhaps and you saw nothing of him after he left the officers mess i told you no very well i said i think thats all i glanced at the others eide nodded to indicate that he was satisfied judie was sitting very pale staring at her husband her hands were clenched where they lay in her lap she didnt say anything so i nodded to bland thank you i said he got up quickly i could see he was relieved i didnt know what to think there was clearly something behind his statement that nordahl had been in financial difficulties but just what i didnt know and judie either couldnt or wouldnt enlighten me the last witness i called was the officers messboy who had brought tea to nordahls cabin as usual at six in the morning he told how hed found the cabin empty the bunk not slept in finally eide detailed the steps he had taken as captain to discover what had happened his inquiries had told him no more than wed discovered that morning there are many men on this ship who do not like erik bland he added so much i discover you will hear this after middag when we see the men who wish to give evidence there will be talk of much bad feeling but there will be nothing definite he shrugged his shoulders i think there is no doubt what happens youre suggesting my father committed suicide arent you judies voice trembled as she said this neither hide nor i said anything i must admit it was the conclusion that i had come to nordahl was clearly overworked he may even have had personal worries that we knew nothing of tired and worried his mind had become overwrought captain hide you knew him quite well she went on in a more controlled voice was he in your opinion the sort of man to take his own life hide hesitated rubbing his beard with his fingers no he said not in normal circumstances but please she interrupted i knew him better than anyone he was my father please believe me when i say it would never occur to him to take his own life i said well adjourn now after lunch well see the men who want to give evidence we broke up then but all through middag judie sat silent and pale she hardly ate anything i saw erik bland glance at her once or twice and i thought there was something halfpleading halfscared in the way he looked at her bland himself only once referred to the inquiry he asked me when id be through some time this afternoon i said we only have to take the evidence of those who have volunteered to make statements hurry it he said there are two more catchers to come in thats all and i want to start south as soon as ive had a talk with the gunners but by the end of the afternoon we were still sitting the men who had volunteered to give information were tonsberg men all of them and their evidence put a different complexion on the whole business even allowing for exaggeration it became clear that the trouble between nordahl and erik bland was much more serious than wed been led to believe the trouble it appeared had started a week after the ship had left capetown certain rations essential for the prevention of scurvy had been withdrawn when a deputation headed by one of the boilercleaners had raised the matter with erik bland who had given the instructions to the chief cook instead of admitting his mistake he had enforced his decision nordahl had reversed it a few days later a similar thing had happened over the issue of certain essential clothing bland had accused nordahl in front of the slopchest manager of toadying to the men the first day they handled whale a winch hawser had snapped and one of the lemmers had been seriously injured nordahl had found that the equipment had not been properly inspected bland had told nordahl he wasnt going to be the scapegoat for everything that went wrong on the ship he ignored the fact that he had been given the job of inspecting all equipment before use they had a bitter row on the afterplan in front of the men but the worst row appeared to have been over an error in the figures for whales brought in by hval petersen skipper of hval had queried the figures the mistake was elands he had reported these whales to the secretary as being brought in by hval one of the sandefjord catchers petersen who had come on board to right the matter called the plan foreman to substantiate his claim it was this man who volunteered an account of what had happened in the office bland had refused to admit his mistake whitefaced he had accused nordahl of concocting the whole thing between petersen and the foreman i know what it is he had shouted youre trying to get rid of me youre tyring to get rid of my father too you want to control the whole company nordahl had asked him what he meant by that and he had answered i know what youre up to you crawl to me for financial advice you thought youd make enough out of it to buy control do you think i dont know what you were up to whilst you were in capetown well you wait till the crash comes if i didnt know it was coming id id he hadnt finished but had flung out of the office i recalled the secretary and asked him why he hadnt given us this piece of evidence he replied that he hadnt thought it relevant but i could see that his real reason was that he was scared of losing his job now that bland was manager and his father was on board pressed by me however the secretary confirmed every word of the foremans evidence there was another row in nordahls cabin which was overheard by one of the winchboys all he heard as he passed was bland saying i refuse to sign fire me if you like but see what my father has to say when he arrives and nordahl had answered wearily your father can do what he likes im not going to be saddled with a rat like you and ill see that the company isnt either there had been the sound of a blow then and just as the boy who had been listening outside was slipping away bland had burst out of the cabin his face white and his mouth working with anger he looked as though he were about to burst into tears the boy added i looked at hide remembering his support of bland it was clear somebody had been pulling the wool over his eyes and that could only have been erik bland himself hed almost fooled me too next came the evidence that all this had gradually been working up to the witness was a big man with a scar on his cheek over which his beard had refused to grow i recognized him at once it was the man who had accompanied captain larvik to the gangway that first afternoon just after id come aboard his evidence was that hed been up on the deck shortly after midnight on the night of nd rd january he had gone aft and had seen nordahl smoking a cigar near one of the boats the manager had been pacing up and down in a rather agitated manner the man had seen his face in the glow of the cigar when he went forard again nordahl was still there a few paces farther on he met erik bland going towards nordahl he had stopped then wondering whether there was any fresh trouble between them he had heard the beginnings of an altercation no he couldnt say what was said he was too far away the mens voices grew angry there was a sudden cry then silence he saw bland come back his face was very white then he had gone aft to the point where nordahl had been nordahl was no longer there did bland see you i asked through kyrre no i was beside one of the ventilators and there was the fog i had been watching the man closely whilst he gave his evidence he had a habit of nervously fingering the clean stretch of skin where the scar was he kept his eyes fixed all the time on the table at which we were sitting he spoke in a monotone there was no feeling or interest behind his words i got the idea that he didnt see the scene he was describing and you say blands face was white i asked ja yet it was so foggy he didnt see you standing beside a ventilator he was very much upset eide stirred why didnt you give me this information when i was inquiring into hr nordahls disappearance he asked the man hesitated i was scared he said he didnt look the sort of man who was easily scared whats your job on this ship i asked seaman he answered frowning in puzzlement at the question ever crewed on one of the catchers he nodded on captain larviks catcher i saw the quick shift of his eyes as they glanced at me and then away again he didnt answer i said i dont believe a word of your evidence his eyes looked suddenly shifty who put you up to this was it captain larvik come on man i shouted at him as though i were back on the bridge of my corvette lets have the truth now it was captain larvik wasnt it yesterday when he and the others came on board to see colonel bland he told you to give this evidence the man fidgeted awkwardly all right i snapped you can go i looked across at hide there was no doubt in my mind captain larvik had primed the fellow why i asked voicing my own thoughts hide was fingering his beard i think we should call kaptein larvik i turned to judie for her agreement she nodded her face was set chin slightly thrust out where it rested on the knuckles of her two hands i think he knows something she said quietly peer larvik is a great friend of my father we had a break then whilst captain eide sent for larvik whose catcher had just rejoined the southern cross up on the deck the air was cold i took judie down to my cabin and got one of the messboys to bring us tea it was the first opportunity id had of talking to her alone since we had begun the inquiry look judie i said when the tea had arrived is there anything you can tell us that would help to discover what really did happen put like that it sounded ponderous but i felt awkward i knew what a strain the whole inquiry was on her she stirred her cup for a moment then she said no i dont think i can her voice trembled slightly all i know for certain deep down in my heart is that he did not commit suicide do you believe the evidence of that man with the scar ulvik no she replied no you showed quite clearly that he was lying you agree that captain larvik put him up to it yes but why i asked she looked up at me then and there was something in her eyes that disturbed me he had a reason she said her voice was suddenly beyond her control it was harsh and violent the man was saying what hed been told to say but its what peer larvik believed happened i hesitated but i had to put it to her do you believe your husband murdered your father she didnt answer and i added is that what you believe my voice sounded peremptory her grey eyes were wide as saucers as she looked up at me then suddenly something inside her snapped and she buried her head in her hands i dont know what to think she was sobbing violently its horrible horrible her shoulders shook with the sudden pentup force of her emotions breaking out i went over and put my hands on her arms stop crying i said youre a member of a committee of inquiry not a schoolgirl i shook her it was the only thing to do she was on the verge of hysterics my violence and lack of sympathy checked her stop blubbering and try to reason it out i said forcing her to meet my gaze either your father committed suicide or your husbands a murderer she gasped but i could see her mind was suddenly facing up to the facts that she had been trying to avoid there was a knock at the door it was a message from eide to say that larvik was on board im sorry judie i said dont think i dont realize how rotten this is for you but weve got to find out what was in larviks mind will you question him she nodded and reached for her handbag when she had made up her face again we went down and joined captain hide mrs bland will put the questions i said i nodded to kyrre to fetch in captain larvik at close quarters the whaling skipper looked even broader and even more like a seal he sat down awkwardly on the edge of a chair he was nervous he didnt look at hide or myself his small immensely blue eyes were fixed on judie was it sympathy or was there something else in the expression of his eyes i had an uncanny feeling that those blue eyes were trying to tell her something kaptein larvik she said yesterday when you were on board the southern cross you spoke with one of the crew a man named ulvik she spoke carefully in english ja that is so larvik replied in the same language he was a bergenske and he spoke english with a germanic guttural accent relic of the days when the hanseatic league ruled the bergen shipping trade we have heard ulviks evidence she added and outlined briefly what he had told us commander craig here takes the view that that evidence is unreliable in fact he thinks you instructed the man to give false evidence and you fru bland what do you think she hesitated for a fraction of a second and then said i think so too larvik shrugged his shoulders he didnt say anything he just sat there staring at her why kaptein larvik judie asked him why did you tell him to say that erik and my father had a row up there on the deck in the fog the night my father disappeared his big hands waved awkwardly like a pair of flippers i do not wish to hurt you more than you have been hurt already he said his voice was kindly as though he were talking to a child or a dog of which he was fond but it is what i believe happens you are accusing my husband of being a murderer she said and larvik winced at the bluntness of her tongue of murdering my father she added why didnt you come to us directly or to captain eide and make this statement yourself to present your suspicions in this roundabout way getting ulvik to make a statement you and he knew to be false is horrible erik didnt see my father at all that night after the evening meal how do you know larviks voice was gruff sudden anger showed in his eyes erik made that statement in evidence before this inquiry then hes lying larvik growled judie stared at him as though shed been silenced with a blow i could see she believed this fat bearded whaler i thought larvik and her father are old friends this man probably played with her as a child she accepts him everything he is and everything he says in the same way that she would accept her father and anything he said i saw her lips tremble her body seemed to sag oh god she breathed she was shaking uncontrollably her eyes quite blank she wasnt crying she was past that how do you know bland is lying i demanded angrily if the man couldnt substantiate his statement then why in gods name had he made it i saw larvik steady himself his eyes were full of sudden pity his hands flapped awkwardly but beneath the beard his lips clamped into a tight line i have nothing more to say he growled and then added that is what i believe happened i wished for the inquiry to know that and act on it but what makes you so sure that erik bland saw nordahl later that night i demanded you say bland is lying ja how do you know that is what i believe he answered stubbornly but good god man i shouted at him you must have some reason for your suspicions but all he replied was ask bland i looked at hide i could see that he thought the same as i did that we should get no further with larvik it was no good asking judie if she had any further questions to ask she was staring at larvik dryeyed with a sort of dawning horror mirrored on her white face all right i said to larvik weve no further questions to put to you i would only like to add that i consider your conduct in this matter disgraceful you have made a very dangerous accusation which you are not prepared to substantiate i trust your attitude will be more helpful and less underhand when the police interview you i glanced at eide who nodded in support of my remarks but i could see that they had had no effect on larvik his eyes were fixed on judie they were full of pain he was snaring the hell that she was going through please return to your ship captain larvik i said he got up then standing awkwardly in front of the table still looking at judie once he cleared his throat as though about to say someting then he turned abruptly on his heel and left the room i looked at eide i think we should have bland back again i whispered he agreed i turned to judie she handt moved i put my hand on hers are you prepared to face you husband now i said or shall we adjourn for a bit she swallowed quickly please now she said she wanted to get it over all right i said and phoned the radio officer on duty to put out a call on the public addres system for erik bland to attend the inquiry again i did it that way to scare him we waited in silence faintly we heard the amplifiers sounding blands name through the ship the silence in the room seemed to cry out when bland came in he was breathing heavily as though hed been hurrying and it was a different bland to the disarmingly helpful young man who had faced us earlier in the day or so it seemed to me his face looked puffy his eyes darted about the room crossing but not meeting our gaze i motioned him to a chair he sat down quickly the tension of the room was enveloping him i let it work on him well he asked unable to bear the silence any longer what do you want to ask me now the abruptness of his tone was startlingly different to his previous ease of manner we have just heard the evidence of one of the men i said i let that sink in for a moment if i handled it right whatever he was scared of would come out do you still persist in your statement that you didnt see nordahl after the evening meal on the night he disappeared his eyes flicked up at me and back to the floor yes he said yes i do then his hands caught hold of the arms of the chair youve had larvik on board youve interviewed him havent you so that was what had got him worried hes trying to fix it on me his voice was uncontrolled something was gnawing at his mind something he was scared of it isnt one of the men whos been talking to you its larvik hes always hated me hes a friend of nordahls hes using nordahls death to get at me hes lying hes lying i tell you hes says youre lying i said its my word against his blands voice was wild hes guessing thats all hes doing i said wait a minute bland were not dealing with larviks evidence were dealing with the evidence of one of the men he says that at about midnight nordahl was standing by one of the boats i knew the mans statement was false i had no right to use it to force elands hand but i had to find out the truth i justified myself on the grounds that if bland were hiding anything it would force him into the open nordahl was smoking a cigar i went on as the man passed him on his way forard again he met you he says you were going towards where nordahl was standing blands face was ashen he seemed to be holding his breath well i said did you go towards nordahl as he stood there by one of the boats smoking a cigar i emphasized the details i emphasized every point of the picture no he cried no the man said he then stopped by one of the ventilators i went on he heard the beginnings of an altercation there was a cry and then silence no it isnt true he said that a moment later you passed him going forard your face was very white you didnt see him because of the fog and the fact that he was hidden behind the ventilator cowl he then went back to the spot where he had seen nordahl i hesitated bland was staring at me fascinated nordahl wasnt there any more bland opened his mouth but nothing came out he seemed to be gasping for breath then he suddenly said all right i was up there i did see nordahl we did have a row but that was all that was all i tell you what was the row about i asked what was the row about he seemed dazed for the moment his eyes shifted quickly round the room as though searching for some way of escape from the three of us sitting there behind the plain deal table he moistened his lips with his tongue and then said he accused my father of ruining him on what grounds i asked he looked at me then and his eyes held my gaze as though he wanted to batter the information he had to give into my brain nordahl wanted control of the company he said he wanted to run it his own way he wanted all the men to be from tonsberg he liked to think of himself as an important figure in tonsberg thats not true judie said the denial seemed to be torn out of her it was so violent bland ignored her he didnt want me on the ship he did everything he could to make it difficult for me he even altered figures in the catchers books so that the tonsberg men should be able to bring complaints he was afraid my father when he died would make me chairman over his head come to the point i said as he paused why did he accuse your father of ruining him he needed money bland answered he was making a desperate bid to get control of the company he badgered my father until he let him in on a deal he was planning in south african mines he put everything hed got into it the crash came two weeks after we left capetown what was the name of the company he invested in i asked was it wyks odensdaal rust development yes he said and his voice sounded surprised the plan foreman in his evidence had suggested that it was from erik bland not his father that nordahl had obtained financial advice i hesitated but there was no point in raising the matter in your opinion nordahl was broke then yes hed mortgaged everything all his holdings in the south antarctic company in a desperate effort to cash in then he was going to buy out the other people interested in the company yes that was his idea when hed done that would he have thrown your father out again bland hesitated i dont know he said what you were really afraid of i said was that hed throw you out isnt that it he ignored the point the case didnt arise he said my father was too smart to be caught like that i tell you nordahl was broke finished and he knew it he cursed me there on the deck why did he cry out i asked quickly again that momentary hesitation he didnt cry out he answered i think pehaps it was i who cried out i dont know all i know is that he hit me i left him then i didnt want to hit back at an older man especially as he was wrought up over his losses do you remember an altercation you had with nordahl in his cabin i asked one of the crew overheard it nordahl demanded your resignation you refused it you said see what my father does when he arrives i looked down at my notes nordahl then said your father can do what he likes im not going to be saddled with a rat like you and ill see that the company isnt either i looked across at blands white face you didnt baulk at striking an older man then i said are you sure it was nordahl who struck you yes he said nordahl struck me and i left him then the man whose evidence has produced all this i said slowly went straight back to the spot where nordahl had been standing nordahl wasnt there i tell you he knew he was ruined blands face was tense he was fighting to make us see it his way he was finished he could never face tonsberg again he took the only way out my father never took an easy way out in his life judies voice was clearcut and distinct it was like a douche of cold water on the heat of erik blands argument well he took it this time there was something almost truculent in the way he said it i looked at eide any more questions i asked he shook his head i turned to judie her lips were compressed she was staring at erik bland with a sort of horror in her eyes all right bland i said thats all he got up slowly as though he didnt want to be released like that he started to say something but then his eyes met judies and he turned quickly and went out i realized then that whatever he had once meant to her it was finished now and i was suddenly unaccountably glad about that as the door closed behind him i said well do we need to call anybody else i was thinking its a matter for the police now either bland killed him or nordahl committed suicide those were the only two possible alternatives judie said he would never commit suicide she ought to know if anyone did she was his daughter but who could possibly tell how a man would react when all hes lived for and worked for is shattered in the wreckage of a wild gamble hed played his hand and lost hed tried his hand at blonds game finance and failed how could she know what he would do in those circumstances it was judie who interrupted my thoughts i would like to call doctor howe she said in a small bleak voice it was drained of all emotion empty toneless i looked at her in surprise doctor howe why i asked he wasnt even on the southern cross he was in capetown waiting for us i think he might be able to tell us something was all she said all right i agreed and nodded to kyrre howe was pale and nervous when he came in it was as though hed been nerving himself for this moment judie said walter we want some information about fathers affairs his adams apple gave a leap but his hands were steady and his gaze was direct as he looked at judie was he involved in wyks odensdaal rust development she asked him howe nodded yes he said and hed mortgaged everything he had all his holdings in the south antarctic company for this gamble yes i see she said quietly and he acted on colonel elands advice i dont know whose advice he was acting on she nodded thank you that perhaps explains it her voice was barely audible i nodded for howe to go he hesitated looking at judies bent head he wanted to help her i saw it in his eyes his face didnt look ugly in that moment then he was gone and i heard myself saying in a matteroffact voice why is it that howe knows so much about your fathers affairs bernt and walter were very close she answered quietly youre satisfied your father was gambling in south african mines i asked she nodded you can call colonel bland himself if you like i said its not necessary walter wouldnt lie to me i glanced at hide you satisfied too captain i asked him ja i am satisifed very well then i said it only remains to agree on our findings i glanced at judie her thoughts were far away judie i said can i have your views i will agree to whatever you think she said her voice was vague she sounded as though she were far away the telephone rang and i picked it up it was bland he wanted to know whether we were through in about five minutes i said were just deciding on our findings good as soon as youre through i want you and eide to come up to the saloon the gunners are all here when i put the receiver back judie had risen you must wait until we have agreed on our findings i said gently i dont want to wait she answered i dont wish to talk about it any more please i will agree with your verdict she went out then and i looked at hide he was massaging the side of his beard bland wants us both up in the saloon i said can i have your views ja i think it is a matter for the police as far as we can discover it is erik bland who sees him last it is either murder or suicide fine i said thats what i think in the circumstances i think we should refuse to reach any conclusions this committee of inquiry has no legal standing we should merely file the evidence and hand it over to assist the police in their investigations eide nodded his gaunt hatchet face was set in the lines beaten into it by years of violent weather bland will not like it he said it is bad for the men that we do not reach some conclusion but we cannot i agree so he pulled himself to his feet we had better go to the conference now i gathered up the sheets of evidence i had so laboriously taken down clipping them together and stuffing them into my pocket up on deck eide paused gazing south towards the ice blink the white mirrored on the undersurface of the low cloud was streaked with wide dark lines see he said there are many wide leads and they all run south that is good it was like looking at a map of the ice below the saloon was full of smoke when we entered bland was sitting in a big chair the skippers of the catchers were grouped round him in a circle charts littered the floor erik bland was also there he was sitting close to his father well captain eide bland said as we sat down the others agree with me that we should go south through the pack the haakon has reached open sea miles south of us she reports plenty of whale then we also must go south eide said there are good leads and the weather is fine good then its settled bland rang for the messboy and ordered drinks then he got up and came over to me a word with you craig he said i followed him out of the saloon and along the corridor to his cabin now he said as i closed the door what are your findings his voice was hard and his small eyes had narrowed i pulled the sheets of evidence out of my pocket and handed them to him he put them down on the desk your findings he repeated come on man he added impatiently as i hesitated you must have reached some conclusion yes i said but i dont think youll like it in our opinion nordahls disappearance is a matter for police investigation he blew his cheeks out like a grampus it was as though hed been holding his breath why he asked sharply there are two possibilities i said either nordahl committed suicide or he was murdered go on as the inquiry has no legal standing we take the view that it would not be right for it to attempt to reach any conclusion the evidence which i have now passed on to you should be handed over to the police on our return to port i see you and captain eide and my daughterinlaw all take the view it is either suicide or murder that is my view and captain eides mrs bland was too upset to consider the findings and is my son involved in any way yes i said he was the last person to see nordahl at all after the evening meal later he admitted that he had had a row with him up on the deck that was shortly after midnight at twelve thirtyfive the fog cleared it was only possible for nordahl to have gone overboard unobserved during the intervening twenty minutes i see bland slowly sank into a chair but it could be suicide his daughter doesnt think so she says he wasnt a quitter that suicide would never enter his head but you think its a possibility why you should know i answered what do you mean by that werent you in on the wyks odensdaal rust development racket i countered bland turned on me with a quick oath how do you know he stopped then well nordahl came to you and asked to be put on to something good in the financial world he mortgaged all his holding in the south antarctic company and invested everything he had in wyks odensdaal rust development if he did then its the first ive heard of it bland barked he never asked me for financial advice in his life and i wouldnt have given it to him if he had he knew nothing about finance and im old enough to know that to give financial advice is the quickest way of making enemies so it was erik bland who had advised nordahl well i said thats what your son says i see he stood by the porthole a moment drumming with his fingers on the top of the toilet cabinet at length he turned and faced me he looked tired and somehow older he didnt say anything but sat down at the desk and began running through the sheets of evidence then for a long time he sat staring at one single page at last he pushed the papers into a drawer and got to his feet very well craig he said heavily i agree it is a matter for the police some changes must be made now he went to the door and i followed him back to the saloon one of the skytters gave me a drink and i knocked it back i needed it badly bland had sat down again something in his manner silenced the room he watched them his heavy brows dragged down his face set in its solid imperturbable rolls i have some changes in command to announce he said nordahls death has left us without an experienced leader as i am here and intend to stay out during the whole season i shall direct operations personally petersen you will take over from my son as manager of the southern cross there was a murmur of surprise and a quickening of interest at this announcement commander craig you are posted to command of hval in petersens place i saw the eldest of the whaling skippers stir in his seat and lean forward excuse me sir i said quickly i dont wish to query your orders but i would like to remind you that ive no experience as a gunner im well aware of that craig he answered but you will take command of hval he rounded on petersen before the old sky tier could begin to argue i know what youre going to say petersen but i wont have a girl in charge of a catcher not down her craig will command the boat your daughter will remain in her present position as mate but in addition she will act as gunner some adjustment will be made financially in her terms of employment does that satisfy you the old skytter relaxed ja hr bland i am satisfied good erik you will take command of tauer iii the ship is without deck officers at the moment you can choose your own mates he turned to petersen again i shall rely on you to see that there is no more trouble between the sandefjord and tonsberg men more than six weeks have passed and weve only just over a hundred whales in the next two months the leeway has got to be but i wasnt listening i was staring at erik bland his face seemed to have crumpled up on hearing his fathers decision but it wasnt his face so much as his eyes that held my gaze there was something violent almost vicious about those small blue slits between the creases of fat i was brought back to the conference again with a jolt it was captain larvik has the inquiry into nordahls death been completed yet hr bland he asked yes replied the chairman and glanced quickly at me can we have the findings of the committee then they have not been typed yet bland answered they will be published tomorrow again i was conscious of a quick glance in my direction and then he was hurrying on into details of organization for the journey through the pack finally he said well gentlemen i think thats all we will start as soon as you have rejoined your ships he was as casual as if he were terminating a rather dull board meeting the skytters got to their feet there was no argument no indication that only just over twentyfour hours before several of them had refused to operate bland sat squat and solid in his chair smiling genially dominating them there was something implacable in the calm assuredness of the man i thought money is power and hes had that all his life hes had it because thats what hes fought for and in doing so hes learned to beat down all opposition they know that they know its no good fighting him so they do what he says i didnt like bland but i couldnt help admiring him out of chaos and a tricky situation he had produced order and obedience the whalers were leaving now bland motioned me over to him his son was still hunched angrily in his chair waiting to speak to his father craig bland said quietly as i approached him i want you to understand that the interests of the expedition must come first i am referring to the committee of inquiry your attitude in the matter is quite correct but the safety of the southern cross and the catcher fleet depend on the morale of the men for the moment that must be my sole consideration but privately i wish you to know that the whole matter of nordahls disappearance together with the evidence you have taken will be handed over to the police at the earliest opportunity in the meantime anything i may do in the matter will be done with captain hides full knowledge do you understand yes sir i said as i turned to go his son rose from his seat does that include posting me to command of a towing ship his tone was pitched a shade high i got the impression that he was scared of his father but something stronger was driving him now bland looked at him it does he said but nordahl committed suicide he must have done it its the only logical explanation he was finished hed ruined himself in that mad gamble thats why he killed himself i tried to make craig understand that hed lost everything he had hed nothing to live for why didnt you tell the sky tiers the truth that nordahl was a ruined man im doing what i think best boy blands voice was a deep angry rumble youre being weak erik bland was trembling his eyes feverbright and his mouth twitching youre discarding me like you do everyone when it suits you talk to me like that again erik and ill send you back to the cape in irons bland took off his glasses and wiped them carefully he was trembling with anger he had calmed down a little by the time hed put his glasses on again he took out his wallet and extracted a piece of paper read that he said passing it across to his son cargo unloaded as per instructions erik bland read aloud and his brow puckered its a copy of a radio message received by nordahl on christmas eve it was sent by howe from capetown whats it mean ill leave you to think about what it means for a moment bland turned to me youll please regard what has passed between erik and myself here as confidential craig you have my assurance that whatever i put out for the benefit of the men in present circumstances all the evidence you have taken at the committee of inquiry will be handed to the police immediately on our return to port now i suggest you join your ship i nodded and turned to go but he stopped me i shall be sending doctor howe over to join you i think it would be better if he didnt remain on the factory ship he is excitable and when drunk he might he shrugged his shoulders bernt nordahl he began and then hesitated he seemed to have difficulty in finding the right words nordahl was his father he finished abruptly his father i echoed in surprise and i saw a shocked almost dazed look on erik blands face yes bland said he is nordahls natural son by a mrs howe of newcastle that is why i think it would be better if he were on one of the catchers he nodded for me to go and then added you will find gerda petersen not very beautiful but a good first mate that he should be capable of this little flash of dry humour at that moment made me wonder whether nordahls death meant anything to him i remember thinking that a man who was involved in the wyks odensdaal rust business might not stop at other things as i walked away from the saloon i heard the door opened and then closed it was as though they had suspected me of listening in the corridor i went straight down to my cabin judie was there sitting on my bunk howe was pacing up and down they both turned to face me as i came in shut the door craig howe said he was agitated almost excited judie sat very tense her eyes dark shadows in the tightness of her face she was beyond tears near the breaking point i shut the door something happened i asked judie nodded tell him walter her voice was barely audible all right howe swung round on me but understand this craig not a word of what im going to tell you must be passed on to anyone understand i nodded promise i promise i said he peered at me quickly i dont know you well enough to be certain you can be trusted he hesitated and then shrugged his shoulders however judie wants me to tell you so he started pacing the cabin again without finishing his sentence there was a sort of incredible violence about the man i sat very still watching him it was like waiting for an animal to make up its mind whether it regards you as a friend at length he stopped his pacing and came and stood right in front of me erik bland said nordahl was ruined didnt he i nodded thats the basis for thinking nordahls death might be suicide again i nodded the only basis yes i said if nordahl werent ruined it would mean that erik bland killed him on the evidence we have at the moment it would be reasonable to suppose that i said cautiously wondering what the hell he was driving at howe nodded excitedly thats what i told judie if nordahl were a rich man then erik bland killed him pushed him overboard in the fog what are you getting at i demanded why do you suppose i was left in capetown i thought youd been ill that was only an excuse i stayed in capetown to look after nordahls interests erik bland was quite right as far as he went nordahl invested everything he had in wyks odensdaal rust development even to mortgaging his interest in the south antarctic company erik bland got the whole of his fathers plan for the boosting of these shares from his mother he passed it on to nordahl as a straight tip forgetting to mention that it was a racket that the mine was to be salted and at a certain moment bland was going to go on the bear tack nordahl had never dabbled much in finance but he was an astute man he saw through the reason for erik bland giving him the tip and he saw in it a chance to prevent erik bland from becoming head of the firm on his fathers death he got an introduction to one of the sharpest brokers in the business and dealt through them and when the southern cross sailed from capetown i stayed behind with his power of attorney on christmas eve i cabled the southern cross that id sold all the shares cargo unloaded as per instructions i said i was beginning to understand howe looked at me sharply how did you know the wording i told him about bland handing the copy of the cable to his son so the old man knows eh he chuckled to himself it must have shaken him reading the evidence and knowing that he caught hold of my arm nordahl was a rich man when he died a very rich man i stared at him i dont think i made any comment i only remember the shock of realizing what must have happened that erik bland had killed him dont you see howe rushed on up there on the boat deck erik bland told nordahl what had happend told him he was a ruined man you can imagine how sympathetically he broke the news and then nordahl told him the truth that hed sold out that he was rich he probably told him that hed see he never again set foot on one of the companys ships and then bland pushed him it could have been a accident judie whispered he may have struck bernt without realizing in the fog her voice trailed away howe laughed it was a derisive sound you dont really believe that he said why didnt you tell this to the committee of inquiry i asked him why because it would have given my hand away and dont forget your promise craig nothing ive told you must be repeated to anyone i dont think the old man knew what his son was up to but he knows now and hes not the sort of man to regard justice as applicable to himself or his he stooped down suddenly i hear he refused to give the findings of the inquiry to the skytters said they werent typed did he by any chance mention something to you about morale and the exigencies of the moment i nodded but he has assured me that all the evidence will be handed to the police on our return to port howe gave that derisive barking laugh again you wait vital witnesses will be sent home in another ship hide and the secretary will be persuaded that its not in the interest of the company to incur unprofitable publicity and the whole thing will quietly fizzle out thats why i wasnt coming out into the open and ive still got something up my sleeve but i wasnt listening to him any longer i was staring at judie i remember thinking my god she knows and realizing what hell it must be for her chapter v half an hour later i was up on deck with my things packed the wind had freshened and ugly whitecaps were beginning to fleck the marching lines of cold grey water howe was waiting for me at the head of the gangway well skipper he said all the problem children being evacuated elands right all the same i said theres two months of the season still to go i see youre one of the reasonable sort he smiled at me crookedly you havent much to do with the blands of this world have you how do you mean in your world right is right and wrong is wrong but theres another world where its a freeforall and devil take the hindermost youre in that other world now blands world why not relax i said up there on the deck my sense of proportion had reasserted itself we were going south into the antarctic and id been given command of one of the catchers that was quite enough without having howe on board behaving like a maniac theres nothing you can do about nordahls death now i added wait until we get back to you fool he hissed dont you understand judies a rich woman she holds the key to the control of the company when erik bland knows that he paused and then added a man whos prepared to commit murder to get what he wants wont stop at that just now hes probably scared but sooner or later he shrugged his shoulders and then in a matteroffact voice he said if we stand here talking all day well get wet going over to the catcher i started down the gangway but then i stopped there were three boats at the bottom of the gangway and one of them was just pushing off in the stern sat judie she was sitting next to larvik and her face was tense whys she going over to larviks catcher i asked did bland send her no howe answered she sent herself bland doesnt know shes gone yet but why because i advised her to shes safer there than on the southern cross but good god i said you dont think anything would happen this is the antarctic he reminded me not suburbia he went down the gangway then as he dumped his kit aboard the boat i caught the chink of bottles he grinned as he saw that id heard always believe in being selfsufficient he said it was incredible how the mans mood could change youve got to be if you want to drink officially all these ships are dry he sent the two seamen up to bring down his instruments whilst we held the boat to the ships side a few minutes later we had pushed off and were bobbing up and down past the yawning cavity of the southern crosss stern the clean icefresh air blew the events of the past twentyfour hours from my brain ahead of me lay hval a battered little toy of a boat with a saucy rake to her uptilted bows the harpoon gun loaded and with the tip of the harpoon pointed downwards was a grim reminder of her job as a killer the knowledge that this was my new command gradually took hold of me as we approached her through the rising anger of the sea and drove every other thought out of my head olaf petersen met us as we clambered aboard he was a big bluff man with sharp eyes and a queer way of looking around him with a swaying motion of the head rather like a polar bear i am happy to welcome you on my ship his english was heavy and solid like the creaking of something little used the grip of his hand was the clutch of a bears paw you haf not meet my daughter his head lunged round gerda here is commander craig i shouldnt have known she was a girl but for the breadth of her hips the bulkiness of her chest and the fact that she was clean shaven she was dressed in a heavy seamans jersey blue serge trousers and wore a fur cap on her head the only spot of colour was a rather dirtylooking yellow silk scarf half hidden under her jacket her hand was rough as it gripped mine i glanced at her quickly she had large very brown eyes her face was tanned and smooth a chubby friendly face with a lot of fat flesh round the eyes and a nose that was almost flattened as though the maker had forgotten about it until the last moment and then as an afterthought slapped on a little button of flesh without any bone there was no resentment as she met my gaze only amusement her eyes twinkled in the creases of fat as though at any moment they would burst out laughing i do not expect you have women as officers in your navy she said only ashore i said with a grin ah yes a womans place is ashore the laughter gurgled up from her throat warm and happy and then you call them wrens eh little birds her fathers big paw slapped my shoulder so that i nearly lost my balance you will haf to get used to gerda he boomed always she make mock of people even me her father i am to be made mock of always since she was so high and learn to speak english she call me landlubber me landlubber his great laugh seemed to rattle round the ship and he slapped me on the back again but i was prepared for it this time and braced myself for the impact come gerda petersen said i show you to your cabin walter you come too whats in that box whisky howe grinned he seemed relaxed for the first time since id met him and when he grinned like that it was strange but he didnt look ugly any more no he said thats my instruments the drinks in the bag here he kicked it and laughed when she scowled at the clinking sound of the bottles that means you have not brought enough clothes and we must raid the slopchest for you she glanced quickly at me and added for you also skipper you look she hesitated her eyes bubbling with laughter you look as though you have borrow your clothes from all the crew of the southern cross gerda petersens tone was half amused half serious you will not get in the good books of your new captain if you make fun of him what must you think commander craig you will think i have brought up my daughter badly and there is no discipline on my ship well by god there is his daughter laughed take no notice of him she whispered he is a big bear and he think he is important now he is to be manager of the factory ship her father shrugged his shoulders in mock despair ill be only too glad to borrow from your slopchest i said fine then come and take a look at your new command i hear you are the devil for spit and polish she grinned at me slyly over her shoulders well i can tell you this ship needs some polishing that dirty man has made a pigsty of her with this parting shot at her father she pulled herself up the ladder that led to the bridge accommodation the catcher was a good deal smaller than tauer iii the captains cabin was directly below the bridge a part of the forard deckhouse i am sorry gerda said but we have not the accommodation of a factory ship you will have to share your cabin with walter howe do you mind thats all right i said provided hes willing to share his scotch with me she laughed do not worry i will see that he is not doginthe manger with his drink i too get thirsty her eyes twinkled you must excuse me for my rotten english it is vair rusty howe staggered in then with his box of instruments walter you will share the skippers cabin and he is to share your whisky okay howes eyebrows lifted hell have to drink fast he said if he is to get the same share of my drink that i get of his cabin they both laughed they seemed to understand each other this ought to be the wireless room gerda said leading me to the next cabin but because i am olaf petersens daughter he make a little adjustment this is my cabin and the wireless is aft in the second mates berth that is the only concession he make she added quickly she took me on a brief tour of the ship then introducing me to the crew do not trouble to remember their names she said as she noticed my concentration youll will soon have sort them out the ship was rather like a small fleet sweeper in appearance with its high bow and high bridge and a long low afterdeck she was narrow in the beam built for speed and power she was capable of about knots and looked a very seaworthy little ship though i guessed shed be extremely lively in heavy weather perched on a platform on the bow was the harpoon gun a deadlylooking weapon with a three and a quarter inch breech and firing harpoon weighing around a hundredweight the gun platform was connected to the bridge by a catwalk aft of the chain locker was a hold containing two fathom coils of inch manila these whale lines ran up the winches on deck each winch had two drums and the line ran three times round each drum and thence up to masthead blocks and so out through a fairlead in the bow the masthead blocks were connected to huge springs accumulators with a pressure of twenty tons the springs performed the same function as the whip in a fishingrod allowing the whale to be played on the winches without the sudden movements of the vessel in a seaway parting the line aft of the hold was the engineroom then came the crews quarters cabins with bunks for two or four and finally the tiller flat below the captains cabin in the bridge accommodation was the galley and the messroom by the time i had completed the round of the ship captain petersen was ready to leave well i hope you will like hval he said gripping my hand as though trying to squeeze the flesh out between the bones ja i hope so i hope also gerda behave herself no there is one good thing about a woman as first mate if she do not behave you can always put her across your knee she has a vair big bottom you cannot miss even if you are drunk eh and he went down the ladder to the deck below roaring with laughter you have only the nerve to say that because you are leaving the girl answered two angry little spots of colour showing on the dark tan of her cheeks because i am leaving eh ja that is good when i am skipper here my life she is not worth living it is olaf this and olaf that all day long i tell you commander craig it is worse than being married to have a daughter on board he turned and looked up at us his fat face creased in laughter one thing i do not haf to worry about my daughter is safe with any man she is a nice girl but ugly as a fat leetle pig eh gerda made a face at him and put out her tongue still laughing he climbed over the side into the boat that had been sent across from the factory ship we watched it bobbing across the waves towards the southern cross mange hval petersen roared across at us and with a final wave of his big hand seated himself in the stern i am afraid all this talk will have made you think this is a play ship gerda said her voice suddenly serious but that is just our fun i like it i said i feel at home already i think the ship must be a very happy one ja i think so too she wrinkled her nose it was a habitual gesture half serious half humorous you are nice she said my father and i have been three seasons together out here we are not bad whalers we work well together last season we are second only to peer larvik in the number of whales we have caught this time we lead all the fleet though that is not much we have twentytwo whale so far i hope we manage to hold the lead i said she patted me on the shoulder it was a gesture copied from her father but i was glad to find it hadnt the same weight behind it i think we get on fine skipper but i am not so good a skytter as olaf and you will have to learn how to control the ship for me she glanced at me quickly i know what you are thinking you are thinking the antarctic is no place for a girl but you must remember one thing we can stand the cold well i have much fat eh and she tapped her bosom and laughed i was thinking of the eskimo women i had met on that greenland expedition they had stood the cold as well as the men looking at gerda petersen i wondered if there wasnt some eskimo or lapland blood in her she had the flattened face and narrow fatcreased eyes of the northern slav later i discovered her mother was a finn from the aaland islands as we stood there on the deck a boat came across from tauer iii it was mcphee bland had agreed to his transfer i watched the chief engineer of hval as he climbed down into the boat it was clear that he didnt want to leave his own ship but id had to have one officer that i knew and mcphee was glad to come with me i could see that in the dour way he said och ye dinna ha to fash yersel aboot me leaving me ane engineroom ahll soon have this ane as smart as the ither at eight thirtyfive there was a series of whoops on the factory ships siren the sea boiled under the ugly cavity of her stern i ordered half ahead and as the engineroom telegraph rang the deck plates began to vibrate to the rising hum of the engine as we swung into position astern of the southern cross the other ships took up station and the whole fleet strung out in a long line behind the mother ship headed south into the ice the sky cleared about eleven that night the sun was almost due south a flaming yellow ball its lower edge just above the horizon a towering iceberg loomed up to starboard catching the sunlight and flashing fire like an enormous pink diamond fragments of ice began to drift past us tiny growlers almost completely submerged and ahead of us the loose pack ice stretched like an unending broken plain of pink straight into the sun it was an incredible sight gerda who was standing between howe and myself on the bridge caught hold of my arm and said it is beautiful yes i bet you do not ever see anything so beautiful as this you are glad we go south i nodded but i was looking at howe i was thinking he doesnt see the beauty of it but hes exultant the ice means something else to him he was standing quite still his long neck thrust out and his hand clenched on the canvas windbreaker his face looked almost ferocious again i had that sense of being afraid of him the feeling that id had on tauer iii when bland had ordered him to prepare that report it was as though the man were part of the destiny of things after all he was bernt nordahls son and i remembered judie saying bernt and walter were very close howe the unconscious peremptoriness of my tone jerked him away from his contemplation of the ice ahead that report you did for bland why did you come to the conclusion that we must go south into the weddell sea he stared at me for a moment and the corners of his mouth lifted in that sly smile of his he didnt attempt to justify his findings with a lot of technicalities he just shrugged his shoulders and said i wanted bland to go south thats all why again the slight shrug why god knows why i just wanted him to go south away from civilization but why i asked again he let go of the windbreaker then and caught hold of my arm in a grip that hurt it was so violent because if hes given enough rope he stopped there and gave a quick laugh just leave it at that and he turned away and went quickly down to the cabin you find walter a little queer perhaps gerda said with a laugh that sounded unnatural poor man he has not had an easy life and he worshipped bernt nordahl and you i said what did you think of nordahl i think he is a big loss to the company to all of us who work with him he was a fine man mcphee came up on to the bridge then to discuss a defect in one of the winches and the conversation was never resumed by midnight with the sun lipping the southern horizon we had entered the ice following a broad lead and steaming south at about ten knots the lead was more than a mile wide and the water in it looked black by comparison with the shimmering iridescence of the ice on either side on our port quarter was a large flattopped berg apart from this we were surrounded by loose pack a flat expanse of ice tinged with pink and crisscrossed with innumerable black lines that marked the division between one floe and another and as the sun climbed and circled northwards towards midday the colours drained out of the scene and the ice became a blinding sheet of white very painful to the eyes even with dark glasses i found it tiring there was nothing dangerous about the ice the weather remained fair and we were able to observe a steady shipboard routine of watch and watch about sometimes the lead was so broad we might have been in the open sea but for the glare at other times it narrowed down to a dark highway winding between occasional icebergs and surrounded by that unending plain of loose pack only once it petered out and then the southern cross thrust into the pack parting the floes in great sheets that layered one on top of the other until we were in a new lead occasionally we sighted whale once a big spermacetti came up to blow almost alongside they were all headed south there were plenty of the smaller killer whales hunting for seals among the icefloes one morning a whole string of these ugly brutes passed across our bows their high triangular fins stood about five feet out of the water and the whole line of them rose and fell as they cut through the water blowing steadily gerda and howe were on the bridge with me at the time and she said ugh those devils orca gladiator howe said thats the official terminology gladiators gerdas voice was almost angry for once your official terminology as you call it is right thats exactly what they are gladiators have you ever seen one close to she asked me i shook my head ive never seen them before well i do not advise it once i see one close to and it is enough i think when he is full grown the killer is perhaps thirty feet long his mouth is about four feet wide and he has ugly eyes and uglier teeth i was hunting for seal with my father it was near grytviken and we had left our boat and were on a small icefloe this killer whale he start snorting and blowing all around us then suddenly he push his nose over the edge of the floe and look straight at us then he start to turn the floe over with his weight fortunately my father have his gun and he shoot but it is a very near thing and it is long time before i go for the seal again later i was to remember this story and wish she had never told it to me she was in fact a mine of information on the antarctic and she would talk for hours about whales and ships and hunting expeditions on the ice in the same matteroffact way that most women would talk about a shopping expedition in oxford street it was she who picked out a sealeopard for me in the glasses so that i was able to watch the great spotted brute rushing across the ice with an undulating snakelike movement as it charged a group of seals she pointed out to me the small adelie penguins clustered on an iceledge where they bowed and chattered to each other with the distant dignity of foreign diplomats at an embassy social on the morning of the fourth day in the ice the sky to the south became very black and louring there was a lot of low cloud and at first i thought a storm was coming up but gerda shook her head it is the open sea it always look dark when you are in the ice blink she was right the lead we were following gradually opened out the floes became looser and more scattered and early on the rd january we were in open sea in s w with the ice blink behind us almost immediately hval and hval ahead of us peeled off gerda had ordered a lookout to the tonne which is the barrel crowsnest and a few minutes later came the cry of blaast blaast hvor er den gerda called up paa styrbord side we picked it up almost immediately i ordered starboard helm and emergency full ahead and we were off on our first whale hunt ive heard people say that theres no longer any excitement in whaling that sven foynds invention of the explosive harpoon took all the adventure out of it dont you believe it whaling is still the biggest of all biggame hunting and only the armchair whalers make statements like that i must admit that as we swung away at full speed on that cry of blaast i was under the impression that the work of a catcher was just the shooting down of the whale i hadnt realized the chase that was involved almost immediately the whale sounded and gerda suggested we reduce to half speed all eyes were scanning the sea ahead waiting for the next sight of the thin plume of vapour as the whale surfaced again to blow i found myself nervous and excited as i stared into the heaving slategrey waste of water gerda plucked at my sleeve you have not done this before so perhaps if you take the wheel and i give directions she hesitated it is very difficult to get so that we can shoot him we must drive him under again and again until he is blown you understand of course i said she didnt want to embarrass me but at the same time she wanted our first whale hunt to be successful i think we were both a little excited and a little awkward at sharing the command i took the wheel and almost immediately one of the hands gave a shout and gerda ordered full speed the whale was wallowing on the surface about two cables length ahead of us we were on top of him almost immediately and the sleek grey back curved as it sounded gerda ordered stop and the vibration of the engine died as we drifted forward when next he broke surface he was away on the port beam and we heeled over as i turned the catcher in pursuit five times we drove the whale under and each time we were closer to him now we were driving him under almost before he had time to blow and all my nervousness was gone in the excitement of the chase now i think we have him gerda shouted to me as it wallowed in the trough of a wave so close that we could hear the snort of the water being expelled from the huge body her eyes were alight with excitement she thrust open the door of the bridge and ran down the catwalk to the gun platform from there she directed me by hand signals which we had rehearsed beforehand we were steaming at slow ahead and turning to port she had taken hold of the slender butt of the gun she signalled for half speed and i saw the whale surface right ahead of us not fifty feet away as i jerked the engineroom telegraph the catcher gathered speed gerda braced her legs apart and swung the harpoon gun we were right on top of the whale now i lost sight of it under the high bows and braced myself for the shock of our bows ripping into it there was a flash the sharp crack of an explosion and i saw the harpoon fly down into the water the light forerunner snaking after it there was another duller explosion a terrible flurry of spray and then the winch drums were screaming and the masthead block dragging down as the heavy twoinch whale line went roaring out through the fairlead in the bow gerda came running back to the bridge my shot is no good she said i tell you i am not so good a skytter as olaf the harpoon he explode outside i do not hit the backbone slow now please the whale had sounded and the line was still roaring out with the block dragged down to the danger mark i watched one two splices run through the black each splice meant fathoms of line gone out altogether there were four lengths three splices just when the third splice was reeling through the block we saw the whale surface half a mile ahead gerda was gripping the windbreaker in a frenzy this was her first whale independent of her father it meant a lot to her the last splice went through the fairlead she ordered full speed and just as i rang the engineroom telegraph i saw the block start to rise up the mast we win she cried we win mcphee at the winch was braking now i could hear the scream of the brake drums above the hum of the engines then suddenly the line was slack gerda ordered stop and the winch began to clatter as mcphee took in line we drifted and the line continued to come in slack then suddenly it was taut again stretched so tight that from a diameter of two inches it was shrunk to half an inch it was like a violin string i thought it must break the block was down the mast again and the whole ship was being dragged through the water at about knots mcphee paid out line on the winches it lasted like that for perhaps a minute maybe only thirty seconds it seemed like years then it was over it was the whales last bid for freedom we began to winch in it was still lashing the water with its huge tail as we hauled up to it and gerda ran down to the gun platform and fired another harpoon into it there was a sudden spout of blood and then the great brute was motionless lying alongside us like a halfsubmerged submarine next time i shoot better i hope gerda said and took me down to the bows to superintend the pumping of air into the whale as one of the hands thrust the lance with the air pipe into it there was a cry of blaast blaast from the tonne the air hissed as it went into the huge carcase the harpoon holes were plugged a long steel rod with a flag was thrust deep into the animal and a moment later we were back on the bridge and off after our next whale two men working furiously to reload the harpoon gun and rig a new forerunner as we went i have given this detailed account of our first whale hunt to show the degree of concentration the work entailed it occupied all our waking thoughts and energies and when we fell into our bunks we were so tired we slept like the dead for whale were plentiful and when we had killed one another was sighted almost immediately the cry of blaast blaast echoed almost unceasingly from the tonne and the crack of the harpoon gun slamming its deadly weight of metal into the whale sounded all day and on through the unending daylight of the night when wed flagged three or four whale wed put through a call on the r t for one of the towing vessels or a buoy boat and go on to the next kill whilst they picked up our catch and towed it back to the factory ship all round us through good weather and bad the rest of the catcher fleet was working in the same frantic haste the only occasions on which we returned to the southern cross were to refuel and take on provisions and a new supply of harpoons straightened out in the blacksmiths shop i had neither the time nor the energy to think about nordahls disappearance and though i wondered sometimes how judie was getting on in larviks catcher my mind was so tired that the image it sketched of her was blurred as though she were a girl id met years ago even the announcement over the r t that the committee of inquiry over which i had presided had found that nordahl had committed suicide whilst the balance of his mind was affected by financial worries made little impression in the fatigue induced by hard and constant work bland had said that he must consider the morale of the men in any announcement he made and i must say i agreed with him whatever howe might say i had no reason to suppose that he would not carry out his promise to hand over the evidence to the police on our return to capetown and if he failed in this i could always notify the police myself howes reaction was of course very different i told you what would happen he shouted at me i told you theyd try to hush it up but i can wait i can wait and sooner or later but i was too tired to listen to his railing too many things demanded my attention for him to be able to corner me for more than a moment at a time and when i wasnt on duty i was asleep and then not all the angels of wrath calling for vengeance could have got an answer out of me in two weeks we chased and killed fortysix whale most of these were shot by gerda for i felt it was unfair on the men to assume the role of gunner except at the end of a good days hunting they had a financial interest in the whale we caught however by the end of that fortnight i was becoming quite a fair sky tier and the men who were a good crowd would ask me to go down and see if i could get one laying small bets against each other as to whether id be successful or not with my first shot they were very proud of their ship and i think they were unwilling to accept the idea of a skipper who wasnt also a skytter towards the end of this period of intense activity an incident occurred which brought the whole question of nordahls disappearance back into my mind wed had a good day and after our fourth kill we radioed for a towing vessel to pick up the catch as it happened it was tauer iii that answered our call we were quartering the sea on the line of her approach and as she neared us she swung off her course and made straight for us her sharp bows cleaving the water at a steady knots she came round in a wide circle and steamed up almost alongside erik bland was on the bridge and he called to me on the loudhailer asking permission to come aboard and have a word with me before i could reply howe came pellmell up the ladder to the bridge he was breathless and his face was working he caught hold of my arm forcing the megaphone away from my lips dont let him come on board his eyes looked wild and the grip of his fingers on my arm was like a vice why i asked why he shook me you ask why his voice was trembling if that bastard sets foot on board this ship ill kill him thats why ill kill him i swear it i stared at him for a second in amazement his violence had taken me by surprise yet the strange thing is i never doubted that he meant it we hadnt seen much of him during the last few days hed kept to the cabin mostly working on what hed told me was a treatise on whaling hed been drinking hardly anything i realized suddenly that what hed been doing was brooding all right i said and raised the megaphone to my lips ahoy there i will come over to you the two vessels were steaming parallel only twenty feet or so apart bland waved his hand to signify hed heard and i ordered the engine stopped and a boat swung out as my men rowed me across the long swell to the waiting corvette i had time to wonder what it was bland wanted to see me about and in those few minutes i thought more about the antagonism between him and nordahl that wed unearthed at the inquiry than id had time to do in the past few days he met me at the head of the ladder theyd thrown over for me and i was astonished at the change in the man his face was almost haggard and there was a nervous twitch at the corner of his mouth the small eyes seemed to have sunk farther into his head he took me straight to his cabin without a word and poured me a drink with hands that shookskaal i didnt say anything but raised my glass and drank well he said dont you want to know why i asked to see you it would help i said youre supposed to be picking up our catch and were supposed to be searching for more whale he toyed with his glass running the yellow liquid round the inside and watching it as though it were crystal suddenly he leaned forward staring at me you think i killed nordahl dont you and when i didnt say anything he repeated dont you his voice was savage ive no views on the matter i said i took evidence at a committee of inquiry the rest is for the police to decide what if there was a row he cried what if it did come to blows and he fell overboard that doesnt make me a murderer does it i didnt know what to say the man seemed to me on the very edge of sanity and i wished i hadnt come on board a court will have to decide that he peered at me measuring my mood his hands clenching and unclenching theres judie he said quietly whats judie got to do with it shes nordahls daughter and shes my wife he hesitated and then said suddenly youre in love with her arent you i stared at him in shocked surprise the unexpectedness of the question put everything else out of my mind put bluntly like that i realized that it was a question id been asking myself he sat back suddenly relaxing his face had a cunning look you wouldnt want her dragged through an ordeal like that her husband accused of murdering her father picture it in the english newspapers the sunday ones and ill swear that she was your mistress here on board tauer iii i went for him then i was so angry but he caught my arm and flung me back into a chair he was a big man and pretty powerful oh no he said oh no you dont this isnt a matter to fight over you just sit there and listen to me im in a jam and im not having a rope put round my neck by you or anyone else do you understand now listen only four people know the whole of the evidence taken by the committee of inquiry over which you presided my father holds that evidence hell die soon anyway but i can handle him and i can handle hide judie cant give evidence against me shes my wife there remains you theres also howe i reminded him after all that cable must have shown him howes part in the business ah yes the illegitimate doctor the sneer in his voice made it clear that he didnt take howe very seriously i can look after him too if you were to keep your mouth shut then the whole thing could be hushed up will you do that the answer is no i said he nodded as though hed expected that all right then ill make a bargain with you keep your mouth shut and ill let judie divorce me you must be mad to think id do such a thing i answered hotly he shrugged his shoulders then id remind you again that judie is my wife if you go through with this ill make her life hell whether im convicted or not ill see she curses the day she was born ill show her up as a common tart ill represent that the row with nordahl was about her oh you neednt worry that sort of dirt sticks and theres always enough evidence if used the right way to sway the minds of a jury and when im acquitted ill still be her husband and ill see she lives with me shell get no grounds for divorce and if she tries to divorce me ill oppose it and cite you for one as corespondent you must be mad i said i got to my feet i didnt want to stay there another minute but he jumped between me and the door and said well which is it do you keep your mouth shut or he left the sentence unfinished look craig he said youve no alternative nordahls dead trying to hang me for what was no more than an accident wont bring him back to life again youve a choice between judie and revenge for something that happened to a man you didnt even know come on now be reasonable his manner was suddenly boyish as though he were asking me to keep quiet about some indiscreet prank i said if you dont mind ill go to my ship now youre lucky that youre a more powerful man than i am or id thrash you within an inch of your life he stood aside and his smile was almost friendly as though id paid him a social call all right he said but think it over and dont forget i can break judie mentally so that in two years you wont even recognize her i stopped then a wave of uncontrollable anger engulfed me but there was nothing i could do watch out somebody doesnt kill you before we get back to capetown i said and then i went quickly past him through the door if id had a gun on me i swear id have shot him outside on the deck the air was cold the sea slategrey and a mile away a flag stood out of the water marking a dead whale the scene was just as it had been when id come on board i could hardly believe the conversation in that cabin had really taken place it seemed so horribly unreal yet when i glanced back there was erik bland watching me with that vicious little smile on his lips i climbed down into the boat and was rowed in silence back to my ship howe was there on the deck waiting for me well what did he say he asked but i brushed by him and went straight to my cabin there i paced up and down my mind a bewildering turmoil of halfformed ideas on only one thing was i really clear it was there in my mind like a flash of light bland was right i was in love with judie and in no circumstances could i let her go through the hell hed planned for her at length there was a tap on the door and gerda came in we have sighted another whale she said i think you should be on the bridge no questions no desire to peer into my mind just think you should be on the bridge i could have hugged her for that it was something practical for my mind to grasp and cling to but with howe it was different when i came down that night to get some sleep he was sitting at the desk his papers spread out in front of him waiting for me i was tired out all i wanted was to lie down on my bunk and sleep but id hardly got my boots off when he said craig suppose you tell me what erik bland said to you his voice was tense its none of your business i told him and rolled over on to the bunk anything to do with bernt nordahl is my business he answered in a flat obstinate voice what did he say about nordahls disappearance he was leaning slightly forward now thats what he wanted to talk to you about wasnt it for gods sake i said wearily get on with your damned book cant you or go to bed im tired im going to sit here and ask you questions until i find out what happened he answered obstinately the conversation was private it was between bland and myself i closed my eyes but it was about nordahls disappearance wasnt it he hesitated and then said you know ive a right to know youll probably be surprised at this but im related to bernt nordahl yes i know i answered but my conversation you know he interrupted on a note of sudden anger how do you know who told you colonel bland he would he sounded bitter he was silent for a moment then he got up and began rummaging in one of his bags and knowing im his son you still wont tell me what bland said no i answered i was thinking that if i told him what bland said i would no longer be a free agent id no longer be able to make a bargain with bland if i wanted to and my mind stopped with a jolt on that thought i realized suddenly that i was in fact seriously considering the proposition hed made my sense of justice wouldnt accept that and yet there was judie i was no longer tired now i was wideawake my mind facing up to the problem thinking of judie and what the future would be for her if bland was brought to trial perhaps this may help you to decide i looked up to find howe standing over me he had a gun in his hand i sat up quickly and he laughed its all right craig im not threatening you he sat down turning the gleaming nickel of the pistol over and over in his hand life doesnt mean very much to me he said quietly and the sudden steadiness of his voice compelled attention ive nothing much to lose you see and this he held up the pistol this could be a way out i know why erik bland wanted to see you its just as i said they think they can hush the whole thing up provided they square you what did he do threaten you through judie how did you guess i asked in surprise because i know the sort of bastard erik bland is the word bastard had a violence on his lips that id never noticed in it before i suppose he offered to trade judie for your silence i didnt answer he laughed suddenly if he knew the whole story nothing would induce him to part with judie how do you mean i asked because judie is the south antarctic whaling company she controls it now not bland my job in capetown wasnt only to sell nordahls south african holdings on a certain day with the profits i was to buy out three of the larger shareholders in the south antarctic company before we left capetown nordahl held per cent of the shares in the company they dont know that yet and he chuckled quietly to himself then suddenly he was silent his eyes searching my face you like judie dont you he didnt put it as bluntly as bland had done but i knew what he meant i think i hesitated but id no longer any doubts on the matter yes i said im very fond of her i stared at him then trying to read his mind he nodded slowly as though it confirmed something that he was already satifsfied about if erik bland were dead would you marry her the situation doesnt arise i said and my voice sounded harsh it could arise he said tapping the gun against the palm of his hand well would you i cant answer that i said but youd want to yes i said he nodded and that was the threat bland held over you wasnt it his head had jerked forward and he was gazing at me intently judies happiness against your silence i didnt answer and he suddenly got up all right he said i just wanted to know what the situation was thank god i persuaded her to go across to hval he stood then looking down at me for a moment then he turned away slipping the gun into his pocket bernt nordahls interest in life was the south antarctic whaling company he walked slowly across to the door hed have liked you craig good night and he was gone closing the door behind him i lit a cigarette and lay there in the half light that filtered in through the porthole trying to understand the mind of the man he wasnt mad of that i was certain there was a cold relentless sanity about him and he wasnt entirely sane either in the next few days he worked steadily at his book he no longer brooded he worked all day and far into the night as though he had not too much time in which to complete it and he was more natural more cheerful than id seen him at any time since id known him occasionally hed come up on to the bridge for a breath of air and stand there cracking jokes with gerda and watching everything with the excited interest of a small boy gerda reacted strangely like a mother given an ugly duckling to rear in a rough goodnatured way she fussed over him i even found her mending a tear in one of his shirts on the day we had to put back to the factory ship to refuel i made some crack about it being unusual for the mate of a catcher to take up darning in her spare time and she flew into a temper and told me to mind my own business it was the only time i ever saw her put out afterwards she was sweetness itself to me but i didnt make the same mistake again when i saw her mending a pair of socks that i knew werent her own it was on the th february that we refuelled whale had suddenly become scarce the catchers were out in a wide sweep some of them as much as miles away from the southern cross hval had just reported a pod miles to the northeast and we were directed to steam in that direction early on the th we got two about miles away from the factory ship and radioed for a towing ship tauer iii answered our call the clouds had come down very low they were dirty ragged wisps driving before a rising souwester the glass was rapidly falling and visibility was reduced to little more than a mile throughout the rest of the day we steamed slowly northeastwards searching but a cold stinging rain was driving across the ship and this combined with the spray driven from the breaking wavetops made it impossible for us to see the spout of a whale even if there were any about the cry of isen came more and more often from the wretched lookout perched in the tonne at the bucking masthead sometimes it was an iceberg more often it was a floe half hidden in the breaking waves gerda ordered a i lookout in the bows as well and her foresight was justified when we narrowly missed a growler a large platform of ice almost submerged i think we must find shelter she shouted to me it is very bad i nodded the movement of the ship was becoming more and more violent as the wind rose to gale force i realized the necessity of having a lookout in the bows but i was i getting concerned for the mans safety he had lashed himself to the end of the catwalk but the bows were buried at times so deep in the waves that he seemed to be up to his waist in water i felt the catwalk itself might be torn out of the ship isen there it came again that frightening cry from the tonne we peered through the murk of a rain squall wailing and then suddenly it emerged out of the storm wrack a great wall of ice with breakers flinging water into the driven clouds the helmsman swung the wheel before my order had even reached him the catcher turned and we ran parallel to the ice wall where it stood out of the raging sea on the edge of visibility i think we find shelter here gerda shrieked to me the berg was a huge one we must have gone nearly two miles before we turned the edge of it but it was quite narrow and in a few minutes we had turned northwestward and were cruising along in comparatively calm water i ordered stop and the sudden cessation of the engine was noticeable only in the absence of vibration we drifted quietly the wall of ice just visible to port the little ship lifting and dropping away again as the long swell of the gale rolled under her it was queer there in the lee of the iceberg an unnatural calm in the midst of chaos there was hardly any wind yet we could hear the gale screaming over our heads and in the intervals between rain squalls we saw the ragged clouds driving pellmell towards the northeast and over and above the howling fury of the wind we could hear a deep rumble like a heavy artillery barrage giant waves battering at the farther side of the iceberg i hope she do not capsize gerda said to me it has been known in a gale if she is top heavy and the wind get hold of her she didnt finish but i could imagine the roaring tidal wave of water that would be set up by that huge mass as large as lundy island rolling over in the sea it was in these conditions an hour later that we received the s o s i climbed out of deep sleep like a drowning man coming to the surface to find gerda shaking me violently you must get up please duncan there is an sos one of the catchers is in difficulties her face looked white and strained i think we are the nearest ship i swung myself off the bunk what catcher is it i asked hval my god i said and pulled on my boots have they given their position ja get the chart then bring it to the wireless room ill be there whats happened to her i asked damaged her rudder possibly her propeller she answered as she hurried out i put on my oilskins and slid down the ladder to the afterdeck i was thinking of judie a catcher with rudder i and screw damaged would be at the mercy of the storm when i reached the second mates cabin i found raadal huddled over the radio the operator on the southern cross tell all vessels east and north of the factory ship they must stand by their radios he said in his thick english it is gerda who hear the sos she is on watch and she listen as always at the hour i glanced at the clock above his bunk it was five past one the door flung back and gerda came in howe was close behind her i have work him out she said spreading the chart across raadals bunk this is their position s w and we are about here we are not more than forty miles distant have you given the southern cross our position ja they have the positions of all the ships in this area i turned to the door my mind suddenly made up raadal when the southern cross comes on the air again tell them that we are going to the assistance of hval he nodded ja hr kaptein i was half out of the door when he called me back the radio was crackling and a voice was saying ulloulloullo syd korset hval fern anroper syd korset i saw howe stiffen and lean forward gerda too was straining forward a set expression on her face what is it i asked whats happened howe silenced me with an impatient movement of his hand a spate of norwegian was pouring out of the radio all of them raadal too were listening intently finally came three quick whistles and the radio went dead as the speaker signed off what was he saying i demanded but no one seeemd to hear me howe was staring at gerda she turned to raadal send kaptein craigs message hans she ordered we must go there immediately i caught hold of her shoulder and spun her round do you mind telling me whats happened i demanded they have been driven on to some ice kaptein larvik is injured they are afraid the ship will not last long i seized the chart from the bunk you stay by the radio raadal i slammed out of the cabin leaving gerda and howe staring at each other and ran on to the bridge half ahead i ordered the helmsman steer northeast i dived down the ladder to my cabin and worked out the course back on the bridge again i ordered n e and sent a lookout to the bow gerda joined me then she still seemed dazed she said something but it was lost in the wind we were moving out of the shelter of the iceberg now and sheets of stinging spray were lashing across the bridge as we ran before the full force of the gale death seemed suddenly very close to us as i stared out into the raindriven murk all i saw was judies face and hval being hammered against a wall of ice and i shouted ugly words into the wind because i didnt dare order more than half speed chapter vi isen isen the cry was from the masthead the lookout at the end of the catwalk signalled to starboard the helmsman swung the wheel the flat surface of a floe slid by glimmering grey in the half light then the messboy came hurrying along the afterdeck clinging like a monkey to the lifeline that had been rigged he reported that hval was still alfoat but in danger of being trapped between two icefloes shortly afterwards howe came up theyre all right so far he shouted to me ive been talking to dahle the first mate he says theyve been holed by the ice but he thinks the pumps can handle it for a time at any rate eide has just been on the radio he confirms your decision to go to hval were the nearest boat tauer iii has been ordered to stand by at her present position but she hasnt acknowledged the order do you think theyre in trouble too i asked he shrugged his shoulders isen isen another change of course another floe gerda tugged at howes sleeve walter do you think we shall reach them in time she screamed the question at him yet her voice barely reached me yes he shouted back but i wasnt so sure it depended on how much ice lay between them and us i was feeling pretty scared id never taken a ship into ice before i cursed bland for putting me in command on a catcher and in the same breath thanked god that id be the one to reach judie first isen isen i reduced speed to slow ahead the ice was all round us now a sudden jar ran through the ship and there were a number of sharp staccato cracks and then the grinding of ice along the sides i stopped the engine peering into the glimmer of white ahead then a squall came it was sleet this time not rain and it blotted out everything we lay there drifting slowly forward ice all round us the sea was much less now as though she read my thoughts gerda said there is much ice i think it is holding down the sea half an hour went by whilst we lay there waiting for the sheet to pass the water froze on our oilskins it was bitterly cold and every now and then there was the horrible grating sound of ice against the steel sides of the catcher but the weight of the wind was lessening the sleet no longer drove horizonal with stinging violence and with the passing of the sleet an immense silence secerned to brood over us as though we had drifted into a vacuum it is getting lighter gerda said and her voice raised against the wind that was no longer there seemed unnaturally loud visibility was increasing and we could see that wed fallen foul of a small huddle of icefloes we watched the black rearguard of the rain sweep northeastward and as it went it showed us more and more ice behind us the low clouds were dark and louring as though heralding another storm but ahead they were a dazzling white their torn bellies mirroring the ice below picking it up in a blinding light i backed the catcher carefully out of the icefloes and headed her at half speed into the ice blink a little group of emperor penguins huddled on a floe watched us go bowing sedately as though to hide the joy they felt at our departure in diplomatic etiquette the ice blink was crisscrossed by dark lines and we scanned it reading it like a map searching for the most suitable lead as we approached the loose pack the ice blink mapped for us a narrow lead like a long tendril that ended at the broad line of a much wider lead running northeast and we headed for this the ice closed round us a flat broken plain of dazzling white that heaved to the swell like ground moving under the impact of an earthquake in the distance a large berg towered like a small mountain another smaller one showed against the dark background of the clouds behind us it looked like a sailing ship hull down and driving under every stitch of canvas i didnt dare move from the bridge now gerda or howe were constantly in raadals cabin and they kept me informed of all radio messages hval reported the propeller shaft cracked and rudder almost ripped from its seating they were attempting to clear it and rig a jury rudder with the passing of the storm they were no longer in imminent danger of being crushed they reported a wide lead running souwest and passing within half a mile of their position i hope to god thats the lead were making for i said to howe who had brought me this piece of information the lead we were following was narrowing rapidly now another mile and it had petered out into a litter of small floes i took the wheel myself and at slow ahead twisted and turned through the narrow channels from the bridge we could no longer see the lead we were making for i had to work on the instructions of the masthead lookout the channels were becoming narrower and narrower sometimes i had to stop the engine altogether the ships sides practically scraping the ice fortunately the edges of the floes were fairly smooth the comparative warmth of the sea at that time of the year had smoothed off the sides except where they had been broken up in the storm at times i had barely steerage way on the ship soon we could see the broad lead from the bridge but between us and it the pack seemed to huddle closer in a protective bank i turned the edge of a floe into a narrow gap and jerked at the engineroom telegraph i had turned into a culdesac the gap just petered out and there not two hundred yards ahead of us was the dark water of the lead as we drifted towards the flat sheet of ice that barred our progress i went to the side of the bridge and leaned out gazing aft along the length of the ship the gap we had come up had almost closed behind us the floes on either side having been sucked together by the movement of the ship there was no question of going astern we should have damaged our rudder possibly sheered the blades off our propeller ram it howe said its not thick only for gods sake shut your engine off before you hit otherwise youll damage it i nodded send word round the ship everyone to lie flat on the deck dont forget the engineroom he clattered down the ladder and i stood there waiting my hands on the wheel the engineroom telegraph at my elbow i stared at the ice that barred our path trying to gauge its thickness it couldnt be more than a foot or two the edge of it was scarcely above water i wondered how strongly built the catchers bows were the sides i knew were like tin when it came to meeting ice but surely theyd have given the bows some strength anyway there was no alternative hval was holed i didnt dare wait in the hopes that a gap would be opened out by the swell it might just as easily start grinding the ice up against us also the glass was still very low and i didnt want to be caught here in a resumption of the gale it was a risk but it had to be taken i sent one of the crew to close the forard bulkheads and then with a lookout aft i rang for slow astern and backed down the cut until we reached the limit of clear water howe came to the bridge and reported that everyone had been warned i waited until the man id sent to close the bulkheads had returned to the bridge then i stretched out my hand to the engineroom telegraph and rang for emergency full ahead the ship shuddered as the screw lashed the water above the hum of the engine i heard the froth of the sea under our stern i braced myself against the wheel the catcher gathered speed the heaving ice raced past sometimes grazing our plates we had nearly a quarter of a mile of clear water and as my hand reached for the handle of the telegraph we must have been doing six or seven knots the unbroken sheet of ice seemed to hurl itself towards us i braced myself against the wheel and slammed the telegraph handle down there was a sudden deathly silence as the sound of the engine dropped and the bridge became dead under my feet there was an awful period of waiting waiting in complete silence save for the soft hum of engines running free and the sound of water thrust back from our bows then there was a crash the ship seemed to stop dead i was flung against the wheel all the breath knocked out of me the bridge swayed forward a sound like rifle fire crackled ahead of us and then was lost in the grinding crunch of ice on steel the whole ship was staggering and the noise of the ice attacking the steel plates was overwhelming then we were driving slowly forward and a great crack was opening up in front of us i rang for slow ahead and with the ice still grinding against our sides we thrust like a wedge into the gap the swell that was running helping us to break through in a matter of moments it seemed we had thrust right through the thin barrier of ice and were in the open water of the lead i gave two whoops on the siren to tell the crew we were through then gerda came running along the deck and up the ladder to the bridge were through i told her i know she said well done isen isen another halfsubmerged floe i sent gerda to sound the well and make certain that we had suffered no damage in ramming our way through the ice howe came and stood at my side we stared silently into the frozen waste of black and white that lay ahead i wonder what blands up to he said suddenly how do you mean i asked tauer iii never acknowledged that order to stand by perhaps she didnt get it i suggested maybe their radios out of action perhaps he was silent for a moment and then he said craig you realize you and i are the only people that have the evidence to convict him what are you getting at i demanded wont know thats the hell of it i dont know but ive got a feeling here we are going into the pack and theres not another boat within a hundred miles except tauer iii youre crazy i said actually i thought he was getting scared it was pretty frightening standing on the bridge there driving into that world of ice it gave one a horrible sense of loneliness i dont think im crazy he said slowly if bland could get you and me out of the way at one blow hed be safe what about judie hide larvik and there are probably others he doesnt think theyre important otherwise he wouldnt have tried to make a bargain with you he began stamping his feet he can handle eide no mans going to risk a new command by trying to incriminate the chairmans son the first season hes out with the company judie cant give evdience anyway and larvik i asked he knows something im certain larvik knows nothing nothing definite he replied i had a talk with him after youd had him up for crossexamination then how could he give such an accurate description of blands last meeting with nordahl i asked bland himself confirmed it it was correct in every detail even to the cigar he couldnt have made it up and got it so accurate he didnt make it up he stopped stamping his feet and turned to me apart from erik bland larvik was the last person to see nordahl alive he was with him up on the deck he left him just after twelve they decided the fog was going to lift and larvik went to arrange for a boat to take him back to hval the fog lifted a quarter of an hour later then why didnt he tell us he was one of the last people to see nordahl alive because he knew his evidence would be regarded as prejudiced howe answered he didnt see it happen he only guessed at what happened but he knew where nordahl was at the time he disapeared if youd told bland the information had come from larvik youd never have got him to admit hed had a row with nordahl up there by the boats peer larvik never made any secret of the fact that he loathed blands guts i see anyway howe added judie and larvik are on hval if we dont reach them for some reason then bland would be ordered to try and if he said conditions were impossible they might never be rescued what the devil are you suggesting then i demanded howe slammed his fist against the windbreaker and a shower of ice tinkled on to the winches below im not suggesting anything he said im just wondering bland would never get an opportunity as good as this thats all i know his voice was agitated and i felt as though he were wound up like a clock somethings driving him something thats bigger than himself bigger than life and judie the little fool hasnt made a will he caught hold of my arm then i know a good deal about psychology it doesnt help me solve my own problems but i can understand other peoples erik bland was brought up by his mother hes always had money anything he wanted it was there hed only got to ask for it boats parties cars girlfriends but power you cant buy that can you all his life hes been dwarfed by his father i think thats whats driving him a sense of impotence an inferiority complex if you like hes no real sense of values or morals hes never given a thought for anyone but himself thats what makes him dangerous his sense of frustration is like a load of dynamite inside him then as though hed revealed too much of himself he added quickly im just guessing forget it he turned towards the bridge ladder and then paused only for gods sake make all the speed you can with that he left me and went below i thought of tauer iii somewhere astern of us suppose howe were right it was fantastic but though i tried to dismiss it the idea kept coming back if erik bland would commit a murder well a murderer doesnt always stop at one crime and certainly howes diagnosis of the mans mental state seemed reasonable enough it fitted his actions but surely the man had shot his bolt i remembered the scene in his cabin on board tauer iii fear had driven him then fear of a rope round his neck hed been badly scared another squall enveloped us and the icy cascade of sleet washed all thought of erik bland out of my mind and with the squall came the wind it seemed to materialize out of nowhere like a howling demon coming up out of the ice this time it was from the northeast and it lashed the sleet in a stinging sheet against our faces visibility was cut in a moment to a few hundred yards i didnt reduce speed i just huddled my chin into my oilskins and kept on peering into the watery murk my face numb with the bite of wind and sleet we were in constant communication with hval now gerda kept me in touch with the reports two miles southwest of the damaged ship there was a large iceberg with a flat top like table mountain except for a tall pinnacle of ice at its southern end this was our mark we reached what i thought was the approximate position of hval shortly after nine that was on the morning of th february visibility was poor there was no possibility of our sighting the ice mark and i hove to waiting for the weather to clear we were then in open water with no ice in sight the wind was rising to gale force and there was a lumpy sea that caused us to pitch a lot above the howl of the wind we could hear the ugly sound of icefloes crashing against each other behind this was a deeper more violent sound which gerda told me was a pressure ridge building up amongst a solid area of pack that wait seemed endless i had a horrible feeling of being trapped i couldnt see it but i knew there was ice all round us and i felt as though it were closing in we could hear it and in that twilight of driven sleet it grew like a barrier between us and safety the only thing that gave me courage was the thought that judie was somewhere quite close and that i was there to bring her out of the ice then gerda came up to say that we were no longer in radio contact with hval it was quite sudden in the middle of a message her face looked scared the loneliness of the antarctic seemed to have moved a step nearer what was the message he said the ice is very thick now we are getting and that was all i thought i heard someone shout i am afraid she didnt finish but stared at me roundeyed get raadal to call them i ordered he is doing that tell him to go on trying she nodded and clattered quickly down the ladder howe came up shortly afterwards when i questioned him he shook his head we keep calling but theres no reply i listened to the grumbling of the ice out there beyond the grey curtain of the sleet and the cold seemed to eat right into me we must do something howe shouted at me start the engine we must find them my hand reached for the telegraph anything rather than this enforced inactivity but the rigid discipline of six years in the navy stopped me i shook my head no good until visibility improves weve the lives of our crew to consider he opened his mouth to argue then stopped and nodded after that he paced up and down the bridge with his awkward crablike shuffle till every turn he made jarred on my nerves and i just stood there staring into the driving murk and praying for the sleet to lift shortly after ten the weather began to show signs of improving the sleet slackened and gradually visibility lengthened out and the atmosphere became full of light gerda came out on to the afterdeck and sniffed at the wind then she hurried to the bridge it is better ja her voice sounded thick and guttural i nodded peering into the light that was beginning to hurt my eyes any news i asked nothing they do not answer a moment later the sleet lifted like a curtain and we could see the dark water of the lead with the ice all round it it was like a black waterway in a dead white plain and as the rain rolled southwestward a mercurial flash of sunlight showed an iceberg on our port quarter flat like table mountain with the pinnacle at its southern end like a spearhead i ordered half ahead and starboard helm as the catcher swung round the flash of sunlight vanished and the world was grey and cold a frozen etching across which torn wisps of cloud scurried before the wind there is more sleet to come maybe snow gerda said gazing at the sky to windward where the clouds were gradually darkening again i nodded every moment was important now the break might last only a few minutes i searched the area just northeast of the berg with my glasses the ice looked a solid mass torn like ground after an earthquake where the floes had been layered by the pressure ridge that had been built up against the massive bulk of the iceberg then suddenly i saw it a black patch in the torn surface of the ice through the galsses it resolved itself into the upper works of a catcher the masts and funnel slanted so sharply that it looked as though it were lying on its side i gave several blasts on the siren then i called the lookout down and climbed to his place in the tonne from the masthead i could see it quite plainly it was not more than a mile away and appeared to be in the grip of two floes which were layering under the pressure of the ice thrusting against the berg i could see tiny figures moving about on the ice and as far as i could tell with the mast swaying and dipping they were unloading stores on to the ice i swept the area between the broad lead we were in and the ship the shortest distance was about half a mile several leads thrust out towards the stricken ship like crooked lines drawn in charcoal the sudden tingle of sleet on my face made me look at the sky the weather was closing in again from the northeast the clouds were black and heavy the wind seemed to be driving the clouds on to the ice i turned my attention back to hval and the lines of open water between the floes trying to memorize them the crew were up on deck leaning over the rail talking excitedly i clambered down on to the bridge and took a bearing i had barely finished before the sleet closed in on us howe clutched my arm isnt that a ship coming up the lead towards us he was pointing away from hval straight over our bows but even as i followed the line of his finger the atmosphere seemed to thicken and congeal into a solid wall of grey that blotted out sight i didnt see anything i said it couldnt have been he hesitated as though about to argue then he shrugged his shoulders i could have sworn i saw the outline of a ship steaming towards us the light plays tricks i said he nodded yes i suppose thats it i was thinking about hval i took over the wheel now and at slow ahead we felt our way down the northern edge of the lead until i saw what i thought was the opening we wanted cautiously i turned into the gap and we began to thrust our way between the flaw on a general course of n w ahead of us we could hear the gunfire sounds of the pressure ridge building up towards the iceberg every seconds i gave three blasts on the siren hoping that hval would still have steam up and be able to reply for perhaps ten minutes we forced our way deeper and deeper into the loose litter of icefloes sounding our siren we strained our ears listening for the answering call but there was no sound except the winds howl in the rigging and the sizzle of the sleet as it lashed the decks beyond i these sounds we could hear the sharp thundercracks of splitting ice the floes gradually thickened packing tighter until at last we could go no farther i stopped the engine and we lay there heaving to the storm waves which were blanketed by miles of ice into a long heavy swell all we could do was keep sounding the siren and continue to listen but there wasnt even an echo its moan went off in a wisp of steam at the funnel top and was instantly whipped away by the wind and lost in the grey void that surrounded us it was like being buried alive i thought of the flying dutchman and all the other mysteries of the sea it was so easy to imagine ourselves lost for ever as we lay there in that waste of ice and storm with the floes grinding against our sides and it was at this moment that howe gripped my arm and shouted pointing over the port quarter a vague shape drifted on the edge of visibility i lost it and rubbed my eyes thinking i must have imagined it but a moment later it was there again a ship i could see the faint outline of funnel as well as bows it was like a ghost ship faint and indistinct one moment visible and the next lost behind that curtain of sleet is it hval howe shouted to me i shook my head i had lost it again but i knew it wasnt hval it was bigger than a catcher and it was headed into the ice just as we were it reminded me of a warship could a vessel have been lost down here in the ice during the war but i could have sworn id seen smoke coming from its stack i pulled myself together and ordered slow astern there was a lead of clear water running towards the spot where wed seen the ship and i decided to investigate i continued sounding our siren and with lookouts fore and aft began to manoeuvre into the lead but id barely ordered slow ahead when there was a sudden shout from the lookout in the bows and gerda screamed for full ahead the telegraph jangled as the curtain of the mist to port seemed thrust aside by the knifeedged bows of a ship bearing straight down on us there was no time to do anything and yet the moment of waiting seemed like eternity i seized the cord of the siren and kept it at full blast but the ship that bore down on us seemed to gather speed i could hear the hum of her engine and see the water creaming up in a cold green wave at her bow howe shouted something and jumped for the catwalk it was only as he ran for the harpoon gun that i realized what hed said just one word bland and immediately i recognized those warship lines that sharp deadlylooking bow it was a corvette and now i could see the name white against her black paint tauer iii i awoke then to full realization of what was going to happen all hands on deck i shouted i rang for the engine to be stopped and seized hold of the engineroom communication pipe and ordered mcphee to get his men up as fast as he could as i dropped the tube i saw howe down on the gun platform swinging the harpoon gun towards the oncoming ship one man stood alone on the corvettes bridge against the grey backcloth of cloud he stood out clear like an etching his oilskins were a dark gleam in the hissing sleet his black norwegian souwester framed his white face his hands were braced on the wheel his whole body hunched over it like a rider driving his horse at a jump it was erik stand then everything seemed to happen at once there was the violent crack of an explosion from our bows as howe fired the harpoon rose in a wide arc passing over blands shoulder and crashing down behind the bridge the thin forerunner snaking after it and in the same instant a man flung himself on to the bridge swept bland aside and swung the wheel over the bows began to turn the ship heeled the engineroom telegraph clanged loud and clear above the wind but it was too late i can see it now as vividly as when it happened its like a strip of film running through my mind yet it all happened in a second or so the bows were no longer driving straight at me they were swinging away towards our stern but they were right on top of us now and as they drove through the last few yards of the gap they seemed to grow bigger and sharper i remember a patch of flaking paint just below the hawserhole and a streak of rust that had almost obliterated the letter e of the name i remember the way our bulwarks buckled in like tin sheet under the impact the shriek of tortured metal she struck us just aft of the engineroom smashing the port boat and ploughing up the deck plates men were coming out on to our afterdeck as the bows broke into our thin sides there was the heavy shock of impact and an awful grinding tearing sound as metal was ripped and torn open men fell sprawling on the deck and in the same instant i was flung sideways and fetched up against the wooden side of the bridge with a jolt that drove all the breath out of me the grinding and ripping of the metal seemed to go on unendingly then suddenly all was still nothing seemed to move the wind howled and beyond its howl was the rumbling gunfire of the ice i gulped air and caught my breath at the pain in my side slowly the scene round me came to life gerda picked herself up from the corner of the bridge where shed been flung men were staggering to their feet on the afterdeck the bows of the corvette stood like a huge wedge in the twisted steel of the afterdeck our funnel was bent over with the impact a plume of steam was escaping from the engineroom somebody moved on the bridge of tauer iii it was the man whod tried to take the wheel bland was cursing him ordering him forard his voice came to me on the wind as an angry scream as the man left the bridge bland turned his teeth were bared and he had a wild look about him his hand reached out towards the engineroom telegraph i yelled at him not to go astern my wits were so dulled by the disaster that i dont think id really grasped that it had been intentional i know he heard me yelling for he raised his hand it was a gesture of farewell and then the engineroom telegraph rang i understood then and i gripped the canvas of the windbreaker in a sort of dazed fascination id never seen a man coolly murdering a ships crew id heard of uboat commanders doing it during the war but id never seen it happen the engine of the corvette began to hum the black water at her stern was churned to an icy green and she began to back away from us our stern swung slowly with her then with a horrible tearing sound the bows wrenched free of us and she began to pull clear of the wreckage of our stern howe was screaming from the gun platform screaming for them to stop the forerunner of the harpoon lifted from the water in a slack loop unwound slowly and as slowly tightened and as it became taut there was a dull muffled explosion from somewhere deep inside the corvette its queer but whilst i have that vivid mental picture of the actual ramming i have only a confused recollection of what followed immediately after i remember standing there for a second watching the corvette draw away and stop seeing bland turn at the sound of the explosion rage darkening his face and hearing a confused medley of shouts and orders and the ugly roar of escaping steam from somewhere in the bowels of the ship then i was down from the bridge running aft shouting orders a quick examination of the damage made it clear we couldnt stay afloat for long the afterbulkhead doors were damaged and water was pouring into the engineroom the crews quarters aft had borne the brunt of the collision raadal was dead crushed beyond recognition another man had been pinned against the bunk by a jagged strip of metal it had gone through his stomach he was unconscious and there was nothing we could do for him two other men were injured one with a broken arm another with broken ribs the radio had been completely wrecked as for the gap in the little vessels side there was no question of patching it up it was a great ragged hole about eight feet wide and as many deep it ran from deck to keel i sent mcphee down to the engineroom to see if he could get way on the ship and i ordered one of the men to the bridge with instructions that if the engine could be got going he was to steer the ship into the ice gerda i ordered to get the remaining boat swung out and to collect all the stores she could in case we had to camp on the ice then i ran up to the bridge and hailed tauer iii through a megaphone the ship was lyingto about twenty yards from us her bows slightly crumpled and steam and smoke pouring out of her engineroom hatches a man came running down to the bows he looked scared can you come alongside and take us off i shouted to him but he shook his head nei nei we have damage in the engineroom and fire my stomach seemed suddenly empty i looked back along the length of the catcher her stern was already badly down you must take us off i shouted we will help you fight the fire the man hesitated uncertainly he glanced behind him as though trying to decide whether his ship was in better case than ours and as he did so a great tongue of flame leapt out from amidships almost instantly there was a heavy roar of steam and the whole ship was enveloped in a white cloud against which her battered bows stood out black and sharp then the white of the steam darkened became black and turned to great billowing clouds of smoke i knew what that meant the oil was alight inside her i turned to howe who was standing there beside me staring with open mouth at the belching column of smoke you bloody fool you bloody silly fool it wasnt any good cursing him i knew that his damned harpoon was fired now but i went on cursing him i went on cursing him because i was scared tauer iii had been our one chance i felt sure the men wouldnt have abandoned us even if that was what bland had intended it was gerda who pulled me out of my senseless mouthings we must begin landing stores she called up mcphee was standing beside her and the expression on his face told me that hed failed to do anything with the engine fortunately the starboard boat was intact clear the boat and start loading i ordered i sent gerda with the first boatload to choose a good stretch of ice i remained on board working to bring up the sort of stores we would need food clothing canvas petrol oil matches instruments charts rifles and ammunition my mind went back to that greenland expedition visualizing the things wed needed then and on the basis of that trying to imagine our requirements now tobacco i remembered that and lighters i could recall how short we had got of matches the food stores i packed in wooden boxes i got up every packing case we could lay our hands on wood was always useful two drums of oil blankets to make into sleepingbags needles and thread cooking utensils nails tools it was the little things that could so easily be overlooked the afterdeck was almost awash now we hadnt much time and once she went there would be no going back for anything that had been forgotten the boat returned was loaded with stores and men and was sent back to the ice mcphee in charge gerda remained on board her womans mind quick to think of things i had forgotten mending things medical supplies tins of fat some personal stores of her fathers including some brandy leather ripped from chairs and seats spare bootlaces the boat came back again and this time we loaded the heavy stuff frozen whalemeat the two oil drums coils of wire steel stanchions cut from the ship for tent supports a roll of canvas packing cases filled with flour axes saws guns a block and tackle with four fathom lengths of forerunner and a whole pile of junk that had been flung down by men acting on their own initiative as to what would be necessary we piled it all in and sent the boat back it was a risk there were still seven of us on the ship and she was very low but i was determined that if we were forced to live on the ice then we should have everything that was necessary to occupy the men i sent them to comb the ship or what was left above water for anything else of use then i went over to the port side and looked at tauer iii i suppose in all about half an hour had passed since i had last looked at her my whole effort had been concentrated in getting the stores together and ferrying them to the ice now i was amazed at the sight that met my eyes the corvette was enveloped in a cloud of black smoke her bows were still clear of it but aft of the bridge she was a roaring inferno with flames licking up to the funnel height a group of men were dragging stores up on to a floe beyond the ship they were just black figures against the white of the ice that disappeared into the grey curtain of the sleet the boat was being pulled back to the ship i watched it come alongside more stores were being lowered and then my eyes went back to the corvettes bridge where something had moved and i realized with a shock that bland was still standing there i picked up my glasses which were lying on a pile of my own personal things and focused them on him he was no longer grinning he seemed dazed his face white and his lips moving as though be were muttering to himself and then gerda tugged at my arm i brought this down duncan she said it was the radio from my cabin it is a portable in case of emergencies my father always say it is good to hear even if you cannot send i cursed myself for having forgotten it and started to rack my brains in case there was anything else i had overlooked i wonder if tauer iii managed to send a message i said she shrugged her shoulders we shall know when we join up on the ice i think they will have radioed the southern cross you see their r t is below the bridge and that is still clear of the fire the catcher gave an ugly little wriggle then i glanced quickly aft we were very low now the bows seemed higher i dived for the rail the boat was on its way back quick i shouted the men bent to their oars just drop everything in i ordered the others then follow quickly we havent much time the boat slid alongside i felt another tremble run through the ship i had a horrible feeling that the bows were rising higher and higher the deck seemed to be slanting away to the stern like a water chute and as the men tumbled over the side the water slid quietly over my ankles the catcher was beginning to sink stern first gerda heaved herself over the rail i dropped the radio into someones lap and flung myself in after her row like the devil i shouted but they didnt need any urging the oars bent under the thrust of the rowers the heavily laden boat thrust away from the catcher and as we pulled away hval gave a violent shudder her tottering stack shook free of its mountings and fell with a crash and as though that were the last straw the little vessel slid quietly stern first into the sea the sharp bows pointing higher and higher as she went and the harpoon gun swinging aimlessly she disappeared with barely a ripple mast tip and gun the last to go and where she had been the icy water swirled in black whorls for a moment and then settled as though there had never been a vessel there it was the first time id lost a ship i had no sense of personal loss she hadnt been my ship in the way my corvette had been but i felt an awful sense of emptiness as though i had been suddenly disarmed in mortal combat it took all the courage out of me i glanced at gerda and saw she was crying her brown eyes were staring almost unbelievingly at the spot where hval had been and big tears rolled down her cheeks for her it was different the catcher had been her home i leant forward to pat her hand then i saw that howe was gripping her arm staring into her face his eyes looking hurt as though he felt the loss through her i looked about me taking stock of my surroundings from the deck of hval even though she had been sinking id felt a sense of security as though the storm and the ice and the black heaving sea were all slightly unreal something apart now the ship had gone and from the slender freeboard of an overloaded boat the scene looked frighteningly real i think in all that followed i never felt lower in spirits than at that moment there was just the group of men huddled round the stores on the ice another group farther away and the burning hulk of the corvette and the icy sleet swept over everything cold and wet and dismal behind it was the wind and beyond that still the staccato cracking of the ice the boat touched the ice crunching into the thin edge of it and we climbed out on to the floe we were up to our ankles in a soft slush of halfmelted ice my first thought was for the stores particularly the flour everything was just heaped there in the rotten ice with the sleet streaming off it the floe was a big one jammed in against other floes it rocked gently to the swell that ran under it and its edges ground against the others a little to the north of us one floe had layered on another so that the ice was higher and slightly sloping i floundered through the slush towards it once i slipped and found myself up to my knees in water for a moment i thought i was falling between two floes but it was only a weak patch that had filled with a morass of halfmelted ice i reached the floe that had layered and climbed up on to it the ice was hard here and clear of slush i found a way back that avoided the hole i had stumbled into and ordered all the stores to be moved up to the new site tarpaulins were laid on the ice and when all the stores were piled on to them others were placed over the top then we set to work to construct tents and i ordered the steward to try and produce some sort of a stew there were fourteen of us on the ice and two of those were injured as soon as there was any sort of shelter gerda and i went to work first on jacobsens broken arm and then on griegs ribs the arm we set in splints and we must have done a pretty fair job on it for it mended fine but though we didnt know it then griegs ribs were not a simple fracture only an xray could have shown us the extent of the damage and it was to be a constant source of worry to us it was whilst we were strapping him up that i became conscious again of the pain in my chest that id felt when i lay against the side of the bridge gasping for breath association of ideas i suppose maybe id strained a muscle possibly i did have a slight fracture of one of the ribs it went off in the end but it gave me a lot of pain during the next few days particulary when i was lifting anything we had just finished strapping grieg up when mcphee called to me that a boat was coming alongside we ducked out of the canvas shelter to find the sleet easing off and tauer ills boat running in towards our floe four men were rowing it and in the stern sat a big bearded man with a flattened nose and sharp close set little eyes whos that i asked gerda it is vaksdal she said he is made first mate on tauer when he is ordered to stand by at his earlier position who say we are to remain in our old position vaksdal demanded and what is all this about murder it is suicide it was murder gerda snapped back at him and it is kaptein hide who ordered you to stand by dont you listen to your radio the man hesitated and she added ask your radio operator he is injured by the fire when he send the s o s well somebody must have listen to the radio it was out of action for a little while so now you think was bland near the radio when it go out of action vaksdal looked surprised yes but and when did the radio work again she cut in not till bland go down to the wireless room i bet she suddenly stepped right up to him was bland alone on the bridge when he rammed us when the accident happen was he alone just tell me that yes then you go back and ask him why he send the helmsman below at that moment you go back and make a few inquiries before you bring your anger over to us i think you find much to be angry about over there now go and see you do not have trouble with your men it is bad to have trouble with men on the ice they are from tonsberg and if you do not make inquiries they will he turned away then a baffled look on his face it was clear he resented being outfaced by a woman but it was clearer still that he was puzzled about something just a minute vaksdal i said have you got your radio ashore he half turned and shook his head the fire has consume everything but we have send a message to the syd korset with our position ja and it was acknowledged ja one more question i said as he turned again is bland still on tauer iii nei the ship she is on fire all over everyone is on the ice kaptein bland is very sad man he feel he is responsible for the accident accident howe screamed it wasnt an accident he rammed us he rammed us deliberately he was moving forward impetuously his skinny neck thrust out his arms sawing the air in his excitement take me across to bland take me to him i said id kill him and by god i will you have done enough i think already vaksdal said enough do you realize what hes done hes murdered us all well never get out of this ice alive nor will larvik or any of the people on hval hes killed us all as surely as if hed mowed us down with a machinegun howes voice had risen to a highpitched cry as he ran forward flailing the air mouthing threats about what hed do to bland vaksdal watched him come up i think you sinnsvak he said im not crazy howe shrieked take me across to bland take me over to him vaksdal flung him back and turned on his heel you will hear some more about this he said over his shoulder howe sprawling in the slush of wet ice watched the big mate step into the boat he was trying to speak but he couldnt his whole body was shuddering in his effort to speak the boat pushed off and the oar blades dipped into the ice green sea beyond it a great tongue of flame licked up from the bowels of the corvette a red glare against the dark water sky to the west gerda ran forward and pulled howe to his feet and they stood there in silhouette against the flames watching the boat row back to the dark huddle of men on the ice about a mile away chapter vii that night the sleet turned to snow it was bitterly cold now that we no longer had the protection of our ship out there on the ice we were exposed to the full force of the wind it seemed to blow right through our makeshift tents our food was cold almost before we had time to swallow the first mouthful even with the whole party huddled together in two small tents the temperature inside was well below freezing and a few hundred yards away the blazing wreck of tauer iii consumed as much storedup heat in an hour as would have kept us warm for a whole year we turned in about eight everyone was very tired and i wanted them to be fresh should the weather improve the boat was moored to the floe by an anchor dug into the ice watches were of two hours duration with two men on duty when i turned in the wind had backed to the souwest and it was sleeting gerda and i had the radio between us and for a while we lay smoking and listening to the monotonous calling of the southern cross her operator would call hval then us then finally tauer iii there would be a fiveminute pause then hed start calling all over again at length i switched off not wishing to waste the battery with my blankets wrapped tightly round me i tried to work up the warmth necessary to sleep but the ground was wet and the wind blew under the canvas in an icy draught the grinding of the floes seemed to run right through my body every tremor of the ice communicated itself to us as we lay in our tents when i did finally get to sleep i was roused almost instantly by loud shouts and the grinding clash of floes i scrambled out of the tent to find myself in a greywhite world of driven snow in which men appeared like ghostly shadows leaning against the bitter wind a voice shouted out of the void her kvikk ill baaten i staggered towards the voice the grinding of the floes was very loud the ice shook under my feet as though it were being battered by a huge steam hammer and then in the half light i saw the reason for the lookouts cry the open water where wed anchored the boat was gone there was only a narrow gap and this was fast closing as another floe swung in on us i got out my whistle and blew on it till the men came stumbling towards me out of the murk of snow we hauled on the painter and lifted the bows of the boat on to the ice one man missed his footing and would have slithered into the sea but for gerda who caught hold of him by his collar as it was he got wet to the waist we dragged the boat clear of the water and right on up to our camp when i went back to see that nothing had been left behind i was just in time to see the gap close with a snap the edges of the two floes grinding like a giant gnashing his teeth i began to realize then how watchful we should have to be if we were to come alive out of this hell of ice as i turned back to the camp the snow slackened the orange glow of the blazing ship showed for an instant in the weird light and was gone again before turning in i gave my whistle to one of the men on watch it was a sharper and more penetrating warning than the human voice i think the exertion in the middle of the night made us all very hungry i know that i felt so ravenous that i could hardly sleep but i also felt warm and i think i soon dozed off i awoke stiff with cold the shrill blast of the whistle sounding urgently in my ears and the floes clashing together like thunderclaps when i went out the snow had stopped and the wind was dropping for a moment i stood there dazed staring at the man blowing frantically on the whistle the floe was covered in a white carpet of snow but it had stopped falling the camp with its tents and the men staggering sleepily out of them looked clearcut and black against the snow i saw no reason for the alarm then there was a splintering crash the ice trembled under my feet and the man with the whistle pointed behind the tents a dark line ran zigzagging through the snow it broadened and then closed with the snap of a shark biting another crash more trembling and the line opened again and this time it stayed open a widening crevasse that wavered right across the floe there was no more rest for us that night the boat was on one side of the crack the camp on the other we got the boat across the gap just in time it widened out under the pressure of the other floes until we could see the sea it became a sort of creek and widened till it was a river with sheer icegreen banks tents and stores were right on the edge of it and everything had to be moved back to the middle of what was now quite a small floe we were being battered by the ice from all sides we huddled in the reerected tents drinking hot tea laced with rum and waited for the floe to crack again gerda said suddenly i wonder what sort of a night it is for the men of tauer iii im more concerned about hval i said i was thinking of judie she put her hand on my shoulder i understand she said but you must not be angry with the men of tauer iii duncan they are from tonsberg i know them all they are good men it is not their fault this happen whats more to the point howe said what is bland up to bland i remembered the dazed look on his face as he stood there alone on the bridge whilst the men worked at unloading i dont think bland will bother us any more his men will have realized the truth by now hes finished whatever happens either he dies out here on the ice or he faces a charge of murder thats what makes him dangerous no i said hes shot his bolt this time you didnt see the dazed look on his face i had a look at him through my glasses when he was alone on the bridge he was numb with the shock of what had happened the numbness will wear off howe said and when it does hell realize hes still got a chance if he can get out alone if hes the sole survivor and all the rest of us die then hes achieved his purpose he still wouldnt control the company i reminded him he doesnt know that howes voice replied out of the darkness and anyway if bernt nordahls estate passes to judie and judie dies the probability is hell inherit it anyway i said the things impossible he couldnt hope to get out on his own that harpoon of yours finished him hes hoist with his own petard and what is petard gerda asked i spent some time trying to explain the quotation to gerda and eventually we drowsed off the shuddering and grinding of the ice had gradually lessened sometime in the night it must have ceased altogether for when i went out at five everything was quite still the air was clear and frosty and the light from the newfallen snow was blinding there wasnt a cloud to be seen the sun had huge circles of light round it with lines of gold radiating from the centre at one part of the circle the light was intensified to produce a mocksun of gold shot with prismatic colours all about us the ice had a faint sheen of colour and towards the south and west columns of black smoke rose frostsmoke caused by warm air from the sea lanes rising into the frozen atmosphere it was breathtakingly beautiful and for a moment i just stood there seeing the scene as a panorama without absorbing the detail then i saw the burntout hulk of tauer iii that had blazed at me so startlingly in the night there were no flames now and only a thin column of smoke rose straight up into the incredible sky mast funnel bridge everything except the hull were gone she was completely gutted her crew were moving about on the ice handling stores several floes had layered near them and it was clear that they too had experienced trouble from the movement of the ice during the night our own situation might have been worse the gap that had opened during the night had closed again there were narrow sea lanes to the south and west of us dividing us from the tauer iii camp but to the northeast the ice seemed solid a jagged broken plain with small lumpy hills like rock outcrops covered with snow and broken edges where floes had been upended the horizon was a trembling blur constantly moving as though i were looking at it through water there were some big icebergs there as far as i could see but they were for ever changing shape in the distorting mirror of the atmosphere on the face of it we looked secure but the snow covered all the flaws and a thing that worried me was the grumbling thunder of ice movement to the east it hadnt been there the previous day and now i got the impression of a tremendous weight of ice thrusting towards us from the heart of the pack my main object was to link up with the survivors of hval amongst the things gerda had brought off the catcher were skis belonging to herself and her father after breakfast i took kalstad one of the hands who was reckoned the best skier and roped together with one of the harpoon forerunners we made for a floeberg that stood up about a quarter of a mile to the north of us the snow was crisp and the going quite good we were glad of the rope however for in several places the ice was so honeycombed by the summer thaw as to be rotten and only our skis saved us from going right down into the water it took us an hour to do that quarter of a mile and with the sun getting stronger every minute it was warm work the floeberg was perhaps twenty feet high i imagined it was originally pack ice that had layered from the top of it we could look across to the black bob of hval it was very difficult to see it clearly through the glasses because of the shimmering of the light off the snow the vessel was lying almost on its side jammed up against a small floeberg by a whole series of layered floes there were figures moving about on the ice and some form of shelter or a dump of stores had been set on a ledge of the berg between us and the ship was nearly a mile of ice thrust up in ridges and giant creases as though it had been compressed even as i stared at the scene through the glasses i saw movement in the ice at first i thought it was a trick of the light that made the white mass beyond the ship heave and writhe then i saw great blocks of ice as big as houses being thrown into the air as they were ejected between the jaws of grinding floes faintly through the still air came the rumble and crack of the pressure ridges building up towards the tabletopped ice berg beyond i got a mirror out of my pocket that i had borrowed from gerda and after experimenting with kalstad managed to focus the sun glare roughly on the ship for about a quarter of an hour i endeavoured to make contact by this primitive heliograph with no result i was just putting the mirror back in my pocket when i caught the glint of an answering flash it was intermittent and i could make nothing of their morse probably neither i nor they had succeeded in focusing the flash accurately for some time we tried ineffectually to get a message across in the end i gave it up before turning back to our camp i made a close examination of the ice between us and hval but without actually reconnoitring it was impossible to decide whether we could link up the return journey took much longer and was much more hazardous the snow was beginning to thaw and the going was sticky more and more often our skis broke through the surface on rotten ice we kept to the ridges as much as possible when not actually on a ridge our field of vision was reduced to a few yards it gave one the sensation of being hemmed in by a forest of ice we made camp in the end wet to the waist and actually sweating with heat gerda met me with a serious face the pressure she is increasing she said also there are several icebergs coming up from the southwest which i do not like i stood by the camp listening to the groaning and rumbling away to the east it certainly seemed louder and there was a faint and almost constant trembling of the ice under us occasionally the low artillery rumble would be broken by a nearer and sharper sound like a signal gun where a section of the pack had suddenly split across she took my arm and pointed to the souwest clouds of white vapour lay along the horizon they had no form but were constantly changing like jets of steam in a gusty wind they would flatten out into layers then plume upwards blossoming like atomic explosions once they looked like castles of ice upside down in the sky icebergs she said i see them this morning now i think they are nearer i nodded and cocked my ear again to the growl of the ice to the east i dont like it i said there is a storm there gerda said it is driving the ice down on us but i think there is an eastward drift and that is what brings the icebergs up suppose the two meet i asked she shrugged her shoulders and grinned with a slight downdragging of the corners of her mouth then i think it is not ver nice we must find stronger ice i looked back to the floeberg from which karlstad and i had tried to signal to hval it looked solid enough but then i thought of the way the ice had heaved and thrown up huge blocks over towards the tabletopped iceberg i felt suddenly as though there was no future in struggling against the giant forces that faced us any news from the southern cross ja she has dispatched tauer i in answer to tauer iiis s o s larsen her kaptein says he is approaching several icebergs about twenty miles from the position given by tauer iii twenty miles i glanced back to the southwest there was no open water visible at all perhaps there were leads and we couldnt see them but the burntout hulk of tauer iii was entirely beset with floes and the ice ran uninterrupted to the horizon a corvette wouldnt have a chance of breaking through if only we had our r t i murmured its useless sending one of the towing vessels peraps gerda shrugged her shoulders again but it is all we will get they will not risk the southern cross why not i asked it is too much too much value too many lives for the sake of even three of the catcher fleet we must be content with a towing boat or at best the tanker a corvette wont get through i said and i doubt whether the tanker could i suddenly made up my mind better start trying to shift camp to that floeberg divide the stores into two equal lots well shift one lot today we knocked up two makeshift sledges out of packing cases then we split into two watches one made the journey to the floeberg i took the starboard watch out on the first run blazing the trail ahead of them on skis it was backbreaking work where i could travel on skis the men very often sank to their waists in rotten ice several times the leading sledge broke through the snow was wet and the going was very heavy it took three hours to reach our goal we had a halfhour rest and then went back following almost the same route the return journey took us an hour and a half gerda who was in charge of the other watch came out to meet us on skis she was excited i could see it in the reckless way she swooped towards us across the treacherous ice she brought up in front of me with a jump christi that sent the wet snow spattering over us southern cross is coming herself she cried coming into the ice i asked she shook her head that i cannot say but just after you have left kaptein larsen come on the radio he say he is held up by the ice and can find no way through hide tell him to try again but he fail he say there is no way colonel bland speak with him then he tell him he damn well got to find a way but an hour later he comes on again to say the pack is too close he had patrolled it for ten miles trying every lead but it is no good so then bland say he come up with the southern cross maybe the southern cross try to break through eh her voice trailed away uncertainly you said yourself theyd never risk the factory ship i reminded her i wanted no false optimism she nodded ja i think perhaps they do not come except to look she stood there fiddling with her skisticks staring out across the ice i knew she had something on her mind so i got the party moving again and slid alongside her on my skis well i said what else did colonel bland say she looked up at me quickly it was not bland it was larsen he say there is a whole line of icebergs five or six some of them big ones and they are drifting into the pack he say already the ice is being built up into pressure ridges along a wide front it is packing the ice in tight and he think it will get worse are these the bergs we thought we saw this morning i asked her she nodded wait till you are at the camp and can stand on the boxes you can see them quite distinctly now you can also hear the ice they are much nearer i think i didnt say anything but pressed on into the camp gerda was quite right the bergs were nearer standing on the packing cases i got a clear view to the west i counted seven of them in a long line and i was no longer looking at their reflections in the atmosphere but at the bergs themselves probably they had calved from the barrier ice somewhere along the caird coast or luitpoed land at roughly the same time and had been kept together by the current that had swept them down into our latitudes they looked like a fleet of sailing ships in line ahead i think there is a very big storm somewhere gerda said the pressure on the ice is increasing the floes are being packed closer together all the time well theres nothing we can do about it i answered sharply and sent her off with the second load of stores there was nothing to do but lie in our tents and smoke and listen to the radio the men were excited full of optimism they talked and laughed and when the southern cross ordered tauer i to stand by and herself turned into the ice i think they felt they were as good as rescued one man produced a bottle of whisky a smuggled piece of personal property and offered drinks all round another produced a pack of cards and four of them settled down to a game of bridge as unconcerned as though we were waiting for a train i sat sucking an empty pipe and wondering what had made colonel bland decide to risk the southern cross in the ice the factory ship was quite capable of crashing through the sort of ice we had come into the previous day her tons and reinforced bows could smash a way through ice feet thick if conditions had been the same as yesterday shed have had no difficulty in reaching us but from where i sat at the entrance of the tent i could see across the smouldering hull of tauer iii to the icebergs on the horizon i could feel the trembling of ice under me it ran like a quiver up my spine and i could hear the distant growl of the floes piling up under the eastward thrust of the distant storm bland knew nothing of this i wished we were in radio contact so that we could warn him but at least he could see the icebergs hed pass quite close to them maybe through them he was in a better position than we were to estimate the danger and i began wondering again what it was that had decided him to risk the lives of over men quite apart from the ship in an attempt to get through to us was it because of his son or was it because of bernt nordahl and what had happened or was it because he knew he was dying and didnt care anyway i tried to picture him sitting there in his big cabin making the decision the man was quite ruthless the lives of others wouldnt enter into his reckonings money yes but money was no longer important to him money couldnt buy him an extra minute of life now he could afford to throw it away in some magnificent gesture hed always had to fight and now he was face to face with the elements hed risk the ship and every man in it if he decided to fight the ice his decision might well be a queer mixture of quixotish bravado and a desire to purchase from his conscience an easy passage through the eye of a needle it was tough on the men of the southern cross that was all shortly after eight the operator on the southern cross began calling us first in norwegian then in english he went on calling for half an hour then there was a pause when he came on again it was with a message at hours we are going to make smoke i repeat at hours we are going to make smoke as soon as you sight our smokemake signals by whatever means possible southern cross to catchers hval and he went on repeating it i had one of our barrels of oil tapped and arranged a drip on to a bundle of clothes we piled packing cases on top of each other until we had a lookout post fully ten feet high and just before nine i sent one of the younger hands up aloft as lookout we were all pretty excited none of us felt like staying in i the tents and i had the radio brought out on to the ice at nine oclock the southern cross operator came through with another message we are now making smoke we are three miles east of a line of icebergs having passed between the second and third berg counting from the north signal to us if you can we were all watching the lookout now his eyes were screwed up against the glare of the sun which was slanting down to the west and south the man blinked and several times rubbed his hand across his eyes i wished we had got sun goggles then suddenly he stiffened and pointed der ern the men cheered two of them began to dance jigging from foot to foot the ice trembled under us as a floe cracked under pressure with a noise like a thunderclap if only tauer iii were still burning i gave the order to light oilsoaked clothes and then stopped the man just as he was about to strike the match the lookout was rubbing his eyes and shaking his head the two men stopped dancing we all looked at him as he peered into the sun then he was pointing again but the direction of his hand seemed farther to the south i climbed up beside him the packing cases wobbling under our combined weight there was smoke there all right but it was too near and in the wrong place even as i watched it broadened out into a great black streak i couldnt see the icebergs now because of the glare but i knew it was to the south of them i think its frostsmoke i said and the men were silent staring westward it was as though the cold hand of death had touched their spirits i screwed up my eyes and tried to pierce the glare in the direction the southern cross must lie but it was impossible to make anything out clearly the whole atmosphere seemed constantly shifting it was as though i were seeing everything through a film of water a delicate iridescent colour tinged the ice prismatic and ephemeral it was like a canvas full of beautiful pastel shades done by an impressionist portraying the coldness of beauty without the detail nothing had substance as well try to see an object in a kaleidoscope as look for the smoke of the southern cross in that shotsilk curtain of blinding light the growl of the ice moved nearer thundering at the floes and shaking our perch so violently that i jumped down on to the ice again somebody shouted and there not a mile away just beyond tauer iii a floe turned on end stood there for a moment and then slid back into the sea a gap was opening out we could see a stretch of water it showed as a dark gash against the white of the surrounding ice the air seemed to thicken and congeal like a gauze curtain the gap widened the air became solid and black the frostsmoke rose like a fog darkening everything screening the sun it wiped out the glare and drained the colour out of the ice the world was suddenly white and cold i felt a chill creep through me i tried to buck the men up by telling them that the frostsmoke was a better marker than any smoke we could make but it didnt comfort them that cold black curtain stood between them and sight of rescue i ordered the steward to brew some coffee the four who had been playing bridge returned to their game i posted two lookouts and took the radio back to my tent the ice shook under us i began to wonder how long the thin layer on which we were camping would stand this battering from the east i felt shut in and depressed the growing pressure of ice and that black curtain of frostsmoke were overwhelming reminders of the forces we were up against the chill of fear was in my stomach and not even the hot coffee warmed me we can see patches of frostsmoke but no signals you must try and signal to us the ice is getting very thick we do not know how long we can go on for half an hour the southern cross went on imploring us to signal our position one olaf petersen came on speaking direct to gerda trying to encourage her and us colonel bland however made no attempt to contact his son the messages became more urgent finally the southern cross operator radioed we are now making very slow progress the icebergs are ploughing into the ice behind us unless we can pick up your signals soon we may have to abandon the attempt to reach you previous messages had been in both english and norwegian but this was broadcast only in english probably with the idea of not disheartening the crews but even those that didnt understand english read the sense of the message in the faces of those that could one of the men began cursing in norwegian if only that frostsmoke hadnt appeared if only we could see at least we should then have been able to occupy ourselves with searching the glare for the factory ships smoke there was a sudden shout from one of the lookouts and i dived out of the tent somebody is coming on skis he said froken petersen i asked net nei fra tauer iii and he pointed toward the black curtain of frostsmoke i followed the direction of his arm but i could see nothing except the cold white shape of the ice der ern derern i caught a glimpse of something black moving on a ridge of ice and then it was hidden again a moment later it reappeared not a hundred yards away it was the figure of a man all right he was covered in snow and ice he waved a ski stick and called to us then staggered and came on thrusting himself forward with his sticks i dont know whom i expected either bland or vaksdal i think i know i debated whether to go back to my tent for a rifle i felt naked and helpless out there on the snow and yet i didnt want to admit i was afraid by going back for my gun so i stood my ground and waited wondering whether i had to deal with a maniac or only a man with a violent temper as the man approached i saw he was too short for vaksdal he suddenly got on to some hard ice and with a flip of his sticks he came towards me in a rush he brought up with a quick christi and a salute capitano and i found myself shaking bonomi by the hand oh it is good to see you craig you have no idea why whats the trouble trouble what is the trouble my god his arms were waving so excitedly i was in danger of being hit by his ski sticks you ask what is the trouble it is that there is no order there the men they will do nothing for bland or the mates vaksdal and keller they do not trust their officers and they are very bitter at first bland is very angry he strike one of them after that the men camp on their own they are sullen and they go their own way there is no order no direction i think there is danger so i take the skis and come ere have they got stores si si when we abandon ship everything go fine the trouble she do not begin till later oh but that journey across the ice it is not more than peraps a kilometre but never have i made such a journey and i am a vair good skier look i show you come on to these cases i will show how i come there is no time but he cut me short and dragged me up to our lookout post there you can see the camp first everything is fine then suddenly the ice is not there and i am to the waist in water look i am very wet am i not then there is much bad ice with many honeycombs also there is a gap filled with how do you say loose pieces of ice brash si si brash that is it i ski across that his little chest was puffed out and his eyes glowed you do not believe me eh but i am here that is the proof yes never am i so afeared but i do it i go very fast and i ski straight over this brash then he spread his hands and laughed but there so many bad places i do not remember them all many times i think i give up and return but then i remember that brash and i cannot face it and i go on and so here i am you shouldnt have done it on your own i said crossing brash is all very well but you should have a companion just in case he was staring at me openmouthed has has anyone crossed this brash before i thought that i would be the first to have dared this thing i almost laughed but instead i patted his arm it has been done before but not often only by experienced polar explorers who were desperate ah si si of course the polar explorers that is different his teeth showed white against the black stubble now tell me what is the news have you a radio over there he nodded to the tauer iii they have no radio weve a portable i said we can receive but we cant send then you will know what is happening yes the southern cross herself has entered the ice and is asking us to signal to her ah that is wonderful he beamed then i can have a bath i am so dirty i think i must smell like a whale i shall lie and wallow for an hour now i will rest a little he was apparently not in the least interested in how we were going to signal to the southern cross through that black fog of frostsmoke in fact i doubt whether he even realized it presented any difficulty the southern cross was coming into the ice to rescue us he would get his bath it was as easy as that i almost envied him his sublime acceptance of the certainty of rescue i was beginning to be worried now about gerda and her party they had been away five hours i waited half an hour and then got my skis out but id hardly gone a hundred yards along the sledge trail when the lookout called to me that they were coming i climbed an ice hillock and watched them winding like a black snake through the sunless white of our frozen world gerda saw me and waved and came on ahead on her skis i told her the news then they must be quick was her comment the ice is getting very bad over to hval it is terrible that tabletop iceberg of theirs is nearer you know whole floes are being tossed about under the pressure the journey was bad too the ice round us is beginning to move i nodded and told her how the gap from which the frostsmoke was rising had suddenly opened out ja soon we have double trouble i think but it is colder now perhaps the sea freeze in the gap then maybe we see the southern cross and can make a signal when we got into the camp i stopped for a minute to look at the stores a whole days work and the pile still looked just as big wed shifted barely a quarter of it bonomi seized on gerda as a fresh audience and throughout the evening meal which the steward served as soon as the whole party were in we had bonomis great trek across the ice id barely finished the last mouthful and was just lighting my pipe when there was a shout from the lookout the frostsmoke was going by the time wed tumbled out it was no more than a faint grey curtain it was gone almost immediately colour came back to relieve the deadness of the eternal white the sun was low to the south slanting rays right across the sky and making the ice gleam with soft colour like the inside of an oyster shell the scene was so soft and satiny that it was difficult not to believe that you could stretch out your hand and stroke it but our eyes were on the lookout standing on the packing cases and gazing westward at length he shook his head no southern cross he said to me but the icebergs they are nearer i think i climbed up beside him and the pair of us stared westward through screwedup eyes but there was nothing not even a column of frostsmoke to mistake for the factory ship the steward called me to the tent his face was serious it is the radio kaptein craig listen there is a message his voice was trembling slightly repeat that in english we have now ceased making smoke if you are try ing to signal us do not continue do not waste your materials we are temporarily held up by the ice which is much thicker here i shall radio again at hours there was a stunned silence when i broke the news to the men it must be bad to hold the southern cross up one man said and he cocked his ear listening to the thunder of the pressure ridges the others too were listening it was as though they were suddenly awake to the fact that the sound might well be the forerunner of death for all of us i do not understand bonomi said suddenly how can the southern cross be held up she is a big ship and the ice is quite thin we came through it yesterday it is only of a thickness when it is an iceberg but they do not have to go through the icebergs they can go round them craig what do you say what is the trouble i shrugged my shoulders how the hell should i know i answered a little abruptly at tenthirty the southern cross operator announced that they were still held up and that he would broadcast at halfhourly intervals i set the watches and ordered the men to turn in but i dont think anyone slept at broadcasting times i turned the radio up so that they could hear it in the other tent even above the noise of the ice the message was always the same nothing further to report i could feel despondency growing in our little camp it wasnt only the broadcasts the thunder of the ice movement to the east seemed to grow and grow the floe trembled under us sometimes so violently that it seemed as though we were being actually shaken it was like trying to rest on top of an earthquake but i was very tired and drowsed occasionally id drowse a bit and then jerk awake numb with cold and look at my watch at the hour and the halfhour id switch on the radio it was comforting just to hear the voice of the operator it gave us a false sense of security to be in touch with the outside world the mans voice was so quiet and natural i felt as though i had only to wait a little and hed walk into the tent to tell us the southern cross had arrived to pick us up i thought of the warmth of the cabin id shared and the good food and the sense of mastery over the elements that the huge ship had given i must have fallen asleep for suddenly gerda was shaking me i think there is something wrong with the radio she whispered it is past three and i can get nothing i sat up and fumbled with the tuning knobs there was a faint crackling but i could pick up nothing on our r t wavelength i switched over to the next waveband and almost immediately picked up music from a shore station nothing wrong with the radio i said sure you didnt alter the tuning knob no i switched on just before three there was nothing then i look at the tuning it is quite okay i think they do not broadcast her voice trembled slightly but they must have done i told her they know how anxiously well be following their broadcasts theyd never just miss out one ill try again at threethirty i glanced at my watch it was ten past three i lit my pipe and sat there waiting for the next broadcasting time and as i sat there listening to the thunder of the pressure ridges and the crunch of the man on watch pacing up and down outside an awful thought crossed my mind suppose the operator were too busy to broadcast to us i tried to put the thought out of my mind but it persisted it persisted and grew with the groaning and crashing of the ice and the sudden deathly periods of silence theyd never forget to broadcast then there must have been a reason and there could be only one reason more important traffic i glanced at my watch it was fourteen minutes past three i looked across at gerda she was lying down breathing quietly twice in the hour for three minutes there is a period of radio silence from minutes to minutes past the hour and from minutes to minutes past the hour every operator in every ship in the world listens on a watch wave of kc for emergency calls i just had to set my mind at rest i leaned quickly forward switched the set on and tuned to the watch wave the radio crackled i gazed at the luminous dial of my wristwatch and as the minute hand touched the quarter i was sweating despite the cold the radio crackled that was all relief flooded through me i told myself id been a fool and then so faint that i could not catch the words the voice of an operator crackled out of the set i leaned forward quickly and fingered the tuning knob the name southern cross was repeated twice then i was on the wavelength and the operators voice was echoing through the tent we are beset by ice in s w southern cross calling all shipping sos sos can you hear me we are beset by ice in s w southern cross calling all ships s o s s o s it went on like that unendingly the operators tone never varied it was unemotional ordinary he might have been making a weather statement but the monotonous repetition of the words drummed at my brain and i sat there quite regardless of the cold seeing nothing hearing nothing beyond that voice completely stunned there was a movement in the tent round me gerda caught at my arm she was thinking of her father nobody spoke but i knew they were all awake and listening sometimes the operator sent in english sometimes in norwegian always the message was the same then a new voice was on the air haakon to southern cross haakon to southern cross repeat your position over the position was repeated there was silence for perhaps five minutes then the norwegian factory ship was back on the air haakon to southern cross proceeding to your assistance our position is now s w we should be with you at about hours report fully on your present circumstances and the operator gave an r t wavelength after i had tuned to him hide himself came on the air we passed between two icebergs in a wide lead at hours yesterday going to the assistance of three of our catcher fleet damaged in the ice at about hours the lead came to an end and we entered the ice which was loose pack and not thick at hours we were held up by a mass of very heavy pack we tried to back out of this but the icebergs we had passed through were piling the pack up across our line of retreat it appears that there is a strong eastward drift here the icebergs are moving with the drift but to the east there is a storm thrusting the ice westward we are being caught between these two forces when you reach the ice you will find there are seven icebergs in a row do not try to proceed beyond this line i repeat do not try to proceed beyond this line we will keep you informed of all developments haakon to southern cross thank you for your warning we will do all we can it is not believable gerda whispered i didnt say anything i felt utterly crushed i think i prayed i dont know my mind was a sort of blank in which i could think of nothing but the fact that i neednt have been here i wasnt a whaler i wasnt a part of this antarctic organization if only i hadnt been so damned foolish about that fiver bridewell had given us as a new year present or if only id had the sense to confirm that kramer could get me a job in capetown it was as though fate had organized it all i felt bitter and lonely capitano bonomis voice trembled in the dark corner of the tent where he lay you will get us out of here yes you can navigate you have been on a polar expedition you can get us it wasnt a polar expedition i snapped at him it was only to greenland what is the difference you understand how to travel on the ice tell me please is it possible to get out of the ice eh in greenland we had dogs yes but we have a boat would you like to drag a boat through twenty miles of the conditions through which you skid this evening no but i must get back when i complete these whaling pictures i am to go to the rand to work for some goldmining companies oh you people you do not understand you are not artists for me my work is everything i must get back i cannot be snuffed out here like any common photographer i have much fine work yet to do oh shut up i said but the way hed talked made me realize that there were fifteen people right here on the ice with me who expected me to save them the responsibility wrapped itself round me and lay like a heavy mantle on my shoulders gerda touched my hand you must not worry you know god will help us bonomi heard her and said god though i couldnt see him i could picture the downdroop of his mouth and the upward roll of his eyes god has done too much for us already i think madonna mia we must do for ourselves now the refrigerator ship south and the tanker josephine were now on the air they were ordered to close but to stand off clear of the ice all night the southern cross issued reports to her own ships and to the haakon but they showed no improvement until shortly after six when our hopes were raised by the news that she had dynamited a patch large enough for her to be warped round i felt then that there was a chance she was facing out of the ice and a powerful ship of that size ought to be able to batter her way clear along the route by which she had entered everybody was cheerful at breakfast but a broadcast shortly after eightthirty shattered our hopes the icebergs were charging into the pack and building it up into huge pressure ridges the way out was blocked though we couldnt see the southern cross because of the glare we could see the icebergs and to do this we no longer had to climb to our lookout they were much nearer and plainly visible from the tents shortly after nine colonel bland himself came on the air instructing the josephine to refuel all catchers and towing vessels and escort them to south georgia this more than anything else brought home to us the seriousness of the situation to give such an order it was clear that the officers on board the southern cross considered there was no chance of their being able to resume operations that season there is no need for me to record here in detail what everyone knows by ten oclock the southern cross was reporting damage due to the pressure of the ice though the pumps were still holding the water but an hour later the whole starboard side of the factory ship was buckling under the constant attack from the ice by eleventhirty she was pierced in several places and the crew were offloading stores and equipment oil was being pumped out to be ignited later as a guiding beacon gerda took me aside then duncan i think we must begin to carry more stores to the floeberg i am not happy here if we get caught between those icebergs and the pack ice to the east we may lose everything i nodded youre right i said and gave the order for my party to get ready the men were reluctant they didnt argue but i could see it in their faces the morbid fascination of listening to the reports from the southern cross had gripped them the sky to the east of us changed as we began to load the sledges the opaque iridescent light faded out of it till it was a dead white glare wisps of cloud drifted across the sun and thickened like a fog the last spark of comparative warmth vanished and the world was a cold etching in black and white then the first flurry of snow scattered like a handful of confetti through the camp with the snow came the wind at first it was just a cold breath of air out of the east but in a moment a gust hit us whipping at the end of one of the tarpaulins it died away again and then suddenly it was blowing hard and the snow had thickened to a driving blanket it was a thick cloud of black specks against the ice but where it settled it produced a carpet of clean white we secured the stores pegging down the ends of the tarpaulins and crawled into our tents from the clear sunlight of the morning it had changed to a world of howling chaos the wind moaned and screamed and the snow drove like a biting shroud across the ice we sat and smoked nobody said anything the only voice was the voice of the operator on the southern cross the blizzard was making it difficult to unload their stores and they could no longer estimate the extent of their danger i shall always remember that morning i think it was the longest i have ever spent it was very dark in the tent the other occupants were vague humps huddled under their blankets for warmth the only thing that was unchanged was the steady voice coming out of the radio i think we all felt that the end was inevitable yet i remembered the profound shock the announcement caused it was at seventeen minutes past two hide was speaking to the haakon which had now sighted the josephine and the rest of the catchers his voice was trembling as he announced the ship is pierced in several places the pumps are no longer holding the water she is sinking and i have given the order to abandon ship at hours the operator on the southern cross announced all the crew safely on the ice together with a reasonable quantity of stores the ship is very low owing to the blizzard our camp is not very satisfactory and the movement of the ice is threatening we are right in the path of the icebergs and unless the westward thrust of the storm eases soon our position will be dangerous captain eide is about to leave the ship and i shall now remove the radio equipment to the ice i will radio again as soon as i have set up the equipment that was the last message we received from the southern cross we sat there for hours in the semidarkness of the tents the crackle of radio barely audible above the sound of the storm but no message came from the southern cross survivors at six oclock in the evening the haakon began calling the southern cross the voice of the haakon operator went on and on a monotonous drone that gradually got on our nerves there was no reply and at length i switched the radio off the voice was too much like someone trying to call the dead we lay there in the shadowy gloom of our tents and wondered what had happened and with each minute that passed the sound of the wind seemed to encroach upon our refuge till it dominated us all with its siren scream of warning we were alone without hope of rescue and i think we felt our smallness and were afraid chapter viii to wake up on an icefloe with a blizzard blowing and realize that you are responsible for the lives of thirteen men a girl and young boy is not pleasant i knew i had to get them out but in the moment of waking i was so dazed that i dont think i realized the full extent of the disaster that had occurred i lay in the shadowed darkness of the tent listening to the blizzard and trying to measure our distance from the main centre of pressure by the trembling of the ice under me and as i lay there it slowly came hack to me how the southern cross was gone and there was no prospect of help from the outside world and how a line of icebergs was driving towards us through the ice at least the floe hadnt split up in the night that was something i climbed out of the tent into a screaming world of wind and stinging snow the two men on watch were white ghosts against the dirty grey backcloth of the storm i got one of them to help me brew some tea and took it to the men myself the only one of them who said anything was mcphee mon yed make a bonnie waitress he grinned as i handed him his mug do you ken if they charge extra for tea in bed at this hotel the teas free i said and sos the weather weel thanks for the tea anyway howe stirred at his side and you can thank god for the weather he sounded bitter yell do no gude blaming the almighty mcphee admonished him better to get doon on your knees and pray to him for guidance tempers were short and the hours passed slowly in that bitter cold it was too dark to read or to play bridge i found a notebook in my pocket tore out all the used pages and started a log the first entry is a queer scribble written more or less blind feb the southern cross was abandoned yesterday still no message from the survivors blizzard blowing outside but party all safe in the tents no prospect of being rescued morale low movement of ice becoming violent as soon as the storm ceases intend to move to nearby floeberg i then listed the names of all the party including bonomi and the names of the two men who were killed in the collision i was sitting there wondering morbidly who would eventually read the log and whether it was worth entering the reasons for the collision when the ice quivered violently under me there was a shout and a report like a pistol shot i felt the tent moving i put out my hand to support myself and fell on my side the floor of the tent was no longer there in the dim light a dark gash was opening under us the canvas of the tent began to rip i flung myself towards the entrance dragging gerda with me bonomi gave a shout howe was slipping but somebody had caught hold of his legs hans the deckboy was in the gap clawing at the edge and screaming he was all tied up in his blankets mcphee pulled him out we got to our feet and fought our way out of the tent the men outside pulling the canvas clear of us the sight that met my gaze as i flung the last fold clear of my face was pretty frightening a crack was opening right across the floe fortunately it missed the stores and the other tent but it had cut our own sleeping quarters clean in half our sleeping positions were moulded in the ice by the warmth of our bodies the shapes of our heads and shoulders were on the far side of the gap our hips and legs on the near side if the floe had split during the night when we were asleep nothing could have saved us even as i stared at it the gap closed with an ugly snap it did this several times opening out to about three or four feet and then closing again with a clash of ice on ice finally it stayed closed and we could hear the broken edges grinding together under the pressure i knew we ought to move to the floeberg but it was impossible in that weather we could not have made it and in any case we had no idea what was happening to the ice along the sledge route we reerected our tent as best we could and crawled inside it was only then that we realized we hadnt got the radio i went outside to look for it the others joined me searching anxiously in the snow but it was gone and then hans said to me he saw it fall into the gap as he was being pulled out questioned by gerda he admitted that he had grabbed at it to hold himself and had pulled it in after that we knew it had gone and we went disconsolately back to the tent you cant imagine what a difference the loss of the radio made whilst wed had it we at least had the illusion of contact with the outside world now we were completely cut off its loss produced temporarily a mood of despair in all of us but it also brought us face to face with reality i dont think the men or even i myself had fully faced up to our position until then as long as there was a voice on the radio telling us every move on the part of the rescue ships bringing right into our tent the voices of men straining every nerve to do what they could to reach us i think we felt unconsciously perhaps that we neednt exert ourselves that we had but to stay put and everything would be all right now we were out of touch wed no means of knowing what the rescue ships were doing or what they planned to do one thing we did know however and that was that our plight was now lost in the far greater disaster of the southern cross there were over four hundred men out there on the ice somewhere and their rescue would be the first objective mcphee put it into words when he said ah dinna think the radio is much o a loss theres nobody will save us noo except ourselves all that day the snow continued and the wind blew like a raging monster out of the east the cold was numbing and we lay huddled in our tents waiting with fear in our hearts for the floe to open up again nobody spoke much and the cards lay forgotten though it became just light enough to see i cut watches to half an hour and that was quite long enough out there in that hell once one of the men on watch went a few yards from the camp to investigate a noise that sounded as though the floe were cracking again we were shouting and blowing on my whistle for threequarters of an hour before he stumbled into the camp again utterly exhausted you had only to go a few yards and the camp was lost to sight under its canopy of snow it was only by luck that hed found it again after that i gave orders for the watch to remain close to the tents and within sight of each other at five the next morning the snow ceased the wind remained but we were no longer hemmed in by the blanket of the snowstorm we could see and the sight that met our eyes was truly terrifying the icebergs were not six miles away and they were bearing down upon us churning the ice up before them like giant bulldozers i gave the order to load the sledges i had biscuit tins broken up and the tin nailed to the outside of the boat round the bows this was to save the woodwork from being pierced or damaged by sharp edges of ice for i was determined to take the boat with me the boat was our only hope of safety without the boat we were doomed whilst these preparations were going on gerda and i went on skis to reconnoitre the route to the floeberg the snow was deep and crisp our skis slid easily along the surface of it it took us only a few minutes to reach the floeberg a journey that had taken kalstad and i over an hour the day before it was incredible it seemed no distance at all but though the snow was all right on skis i wondered how it would be for the men on foot the smooth carpet of white covered everything all the flaws and honeycombs and areas of rotten ice i was afraid the weight of the boat would soon find the bad patches when we got back the steward had breakfast ready it was the best meal we had i told him to use anything he liked from the stores we were leaving behind we were ready to leave shortly after ten bonomi bustled about taking pictures i must have pictures of everything he said the camp of the disaster the trek the boat everything when we are back everyone will say bravo bravo aldo bonomi he has done it again that was how we came to call the place disaster camp the man was unbelievable he had come across to us with a rucksack on his back and his camera slung round his neck do you think that rucksack contained so much as a change of socks not a bit of it it was full of unused film for his camera before we started he insisted on taking a group picture all of us standing in front of the stores we were abandoning it was just as he was taking this photograph that howe seized my arm and pointed towards tauer iii a line of figures was winding slowly through the broken contours of the ice somebody raised a cheer and in an instant the men were all shouting and waving excitedly the fools thought it was a rescue party from the southern cross i counted seventeen men seventeen black dots moving against the dead white of the snow i turned on my crew and shouted at them to be quiet it is the crew of tauer iii the cheering wavered and died i saw the light of hope leave their eyes their faces looked suddenly white and pinched under their beards the deckboy hans began to cry the dry sobs that shook him were audible even above the howl of the wind it was as though the sudden fear in the mens hearts had been translated into sound gerda went to him and put her arms round him comforting him we waited like men frozen by the cold as the crew of tauer iii approached they were dragging improvised sledges piled with stores but they had no boat with them i searched the long straggling line with my glasses vaksdal was leading his big viking figure was unmistakable with only one man to help him he was pulling one of the sledges i searched down along the line peering at each mans face most of them i could recognize from the brief period i had been in command of them but i was searching for one face and i did not find it the full complement of a towing vessel was sixteen men and two deckboys there were only seventeen erik bland was not with them as they reached our camp vaksdal came towards me his eyes avoided mine the men wish to be under your command kaptein craig he said harshly i ordered my steward to get the stove alight and prepare hot food for them then i turned to vaksdal wheres bland i asked him he remain with the stores he answered he was shifting uneasily on his big feet why he did not answer me and i added why have you abandoned him because the men wish it he answered his voice was sullen and angry the men wish to abandon their captain ja also he do not wish to come with the men he wish to stay he ask keller and me to stay too why didnt you because the men wish to leave and you left bland to die in the ice alone the mans face was sullen he would not come he wish to be left youre the first mate are you i asked him ja you assumed command he nodded why because the men refuse to do what bland tell them they say it is blands fault that it is not an accident they are angry and they do not obey orders they are tonsberg men he said it as though that explained everything did you take the view that bland deliberately rammed my boat no he would not do that not here in the ice no whaler would do a thing like that it is true what froken petersen say that he send the helmsman below but it is for some cocoa it is also true that our radio is mysteriously out of order these are things that will have to be cleared up at the inquiry when we get back to the southern cross but i do not the southern cross is gone i interrupted him gone i do not understand she got caught in the ice in an attempt to reach us she is sunk i looked round at the ring of faces listening openmouthed they looked scared and disheartened gerda i said get these men to work i want all the sledges lashed together nose to tail then i turned back to vaksdal so you are in command of these men ja when did you assume command when it is clear to me that the men will not obey kaptein bland then it was your decision to abandon bland that is not true the men wish to leave bland and also bland wish to stay v but you say you were in command ja his voice was sullen and his tongue flicked across his lips who is your second mate keller he nodded to a short stout man with a woollen cap i called him over do you speak english i asked him ja hr kaptein why did you abandon bland the men demand that we damn the men i shouted at him the two of you were in command yet you did exactly what the men wanted you are forthwith relieved of your commands and revert to ordinary seamen both of you vaksdal took a step towards me you cannot do this he growled i can and i will i answered him youre neither of you fit to command vaksdals eyes blazed you dare to say that he shouted you who have not served one season in the antarctic you know nothing and you tell us what we should and should not do i have been eight voyages to the antarctic i know what is right you know what is right do you i said you assume command of a crew cut off in the ice and you abandon your boats how do you think youre going to get to safety without your boats i did not know the southern cross is sunk he was looking at the ground shuffling his feet angrily in the snow did it never occur to you that the southern cross might not be able to reach us were you planning to just sit on your bottoms and wait to be rescued abandoning your captain when you believed him innocent of the mens charges is tantamount to mutiny abandoning your boats shows that youre not fit to command in these circumstances either of you you are now relieved of your commands if you have anything to say hold it for the inquiry when we get back i turned on my heels then and went over to gerda get all the men together i want to talk to them but duncan it is too cold for talk now she said theyll be colder if they die out here i answered and thats what will happen if we dont scotch this trouble right at the start i want another mate one of the hval men who do you suggest kalstad good she paraded the men then and i spoke first to the men of tauer iii i told them what theyd done was equivalent to mutiny that unless they obeyed their officers they would never get out of the ice alive i told them what had happened to the southern cross that we were now entirely on our own i then appointed kalstad a mate in command of the tauer iii crew and announced that i had relieved vaksdal and keller of their commands one of the men interrupted me he was the coxsn of tauer iii and he started on a denunciation of bland that is no reason for abandoning him i answered he will stand trial when we get back you have no right to take the law into your own hands which is what you have done in abandoning him moreover you have abandoned your boats too and without them you have no chance of reaching safety i then asked for volunteers from the hval crew to go back and bring in bland and the two boats every man of them volunteered even the two injured men and the boy hans i was proud of them and i remember that my voice felt choky at this display of confidence in me the coxsn of tauer iii stepped forward a little shamefacedly then and asked if his men might not volunteer but i shook my head youve done one trek today my men are fresh i ordered gerda to get the sledges moving as soon as the tauer iii men had fed when you have set up the new camp and the men are rested come back with a dozen volunteers to help us bring in the boats gerda nodded and began running out ropes from the sledges i felt a tug at my sleeve it was howe bring back the boats craig he said but for gods sake leave bland there i cant do that i said hes a murderer he said you know that bring him back and you give him a second chance let him find his own way out if he can without any boats but i shook my head i cant do that i repeated my god howe said if you bring him back ill have to kill him ive sworn i will ive sworn to avenge my father but i dont want to do it not now you see theres gerda he hesitated awkwardly and then said why not let the ice do it please to bring him back will make so much unhappiness gerda is already frightened for her father and if i kill bland no i said and youre not going to kill bland either when ive brought him back and if these icebergs dont finish us ill try him by a summary court here on the ice and if hes convicted of deliberately ramming us hell be put to work as an ordinary seaman pending trial when we get back to civilization howe stared at me you damned fool he said he was almost crying he was so worked up youre not in the navy now this is the antarctic that mans killed my father hes caused the loss of three ships and endangered the lives of over four hundred men cant you realize that hes better dead if you bring him back hell fight to kill us all and get out alone you heard what vaksdal said he wanted to be left there well if he wants to be left if he wants to be left i said then ill not force him to come there will that satisfy you he opened his mouth to speak but gerda came up then everything is ready for us to go she said fine i replied and dont forget to come back for us its going to be a hard trek with two boats i wont good luck then thank you and be careful duncan she added you are a nice man and it would not be good if we lose you and with that she stretched up and kissed me i collected my volunteers leaving only the two injured men and hans and howe of the hval crew with gerda and we set out west along the sledge tracks that led towards the black hulk of tauer you may think it odd in that setting and amongst a bunch of tough men of whom she was in command that gerda should have kissed me perhaps the feminine element is out of place in the antarctic it certainly seems so as i write and i was tempted to leave it out but i am setting down everything as it happened gerda was a mate in charge of men but that did not mean that she hid the woman in her her method of handling men was quite different from a mans method yet all i can say is that if ever i am in as tough a position again id give my right hand to have gerda as my secondincommand her endurance was a constant spur to the rest shed shame them and coax them all in one and under her leadership they could achieve the impossible as for the kiss it was an open expression of her wish that we should return safely and accepted as such by the men in fact i not only had her kiss on my lips to encourage me but a cheer from the men of tauer iii only vaksdal watched us sullenly as we left the camp and i hoped i had not made a permanent enemy of him for he was a man i thought would prove useful we took with us three of the harpoon forerunners our boat anchor and block and tackle the snow had been packed down by the tauer iii sledges and the going was good with the exception of one bad patch of honeycombed ice round which i managed to find a way with the wind on our backs we made the trip in just over half an hour the camp itself was completely obliterated by snow only the sledge tracks running up to it and ceasing marked its position for us as we neared the camp we could see the ice grinding at the wreck of tauer iii the rusty sides of the ship stood up black and sheer above the floes blotched here and there with white patches of snow the ice was riding up on the farther side and though we could not hear it we could see that the steel plates were being broken under the stress beyond the ship the ice seemed in constant motion it would lie dormant for a while a lumpy plain of white then suddenly a floe would heave up showing jagged green teeth or a great slab of ice would pop out of the snow as though ejected as indigestible by some giant sea monster from an ice hillock i looked beyond tauer iii to the line of icebergs the nearest was not three miles away a huge wedgeshaped cliff of ice ploughing into the pack turning it up on either side like the bow wave of a huge battleship held motionless in the still of a camera picture but it was only motionless if you glanced at it quickly i stood there for a moment staring at it and saw that it was moving all the time thick floes were being crushed and churned back i thought of the survivors of the southern cross the icebergs must have ploughed their way right across the position where the factory ship had foundered there was a chill in my stomach as i slid down into a trough of the ice on my skis glad to have the sight blotted from my view i felt there was no hope strive how we might we were doomed to the same death as the men of the southern cross the advance of the icebergs was slow but inevitable like the day of judgment i tried to grin cheerfully at the men but my lips seemed frozen i made some crack about the ice i dont remember what but it seemed a hollow mockery the men laughed and i thought my god theyve got guts i found myself praying to god to give me strength in that illimitable waste of stormswept ice i felt the smallness of man and he seemed nearer to me then than ever before nearer even than that time when id steamed away from the convoy in my corvette one of a screen of tiny ships thrown out to halt the bismarck as my skis slid along the sledge tracks into the tauer iii camp erik bland emerged from a sailcloth tent pitched in the lee of some packing cases its you craig is it he said as i stopped just short of him his voice was thick and he was swaying slightly what do you want i was well ahead of the men and for the moment we were alone ive come for you i said i think you know why i suppose you think i rammed you deliberately his eyes had a glazed look and his face was white and mean under the dark stubble of his beard he was very drunk well what if i did you cant prove it you cant prove anything if that bloody little bastard howe hadnt fired that harpoon youd be out of the ice by now reporting that there was no way through is that it you think youre clever dont you he sneered well ill beat you yet all of you better get your things together bland i said youre coming back with me to have you rig another little court of inquiry he laughed oh no im staying here youre not taking the easy way out like that i told him youre coming back with me to stand trial if we ever get out of the ice i think youre going to find yourself responsible for a lot of deaths im not responsible for what the ice does he answered you cant prove anything it was an accident and dont imagine im going to die im not taking the easy way he stopped then peering out across the snow hed seen the men so youre so damned scared of me you bring a dozen men with you his eyes were suddenly narrowed he was fighting to sober himself up i didnt bring the men in order to persuade you to come back with me i said i brought them because ive come for the boats vaksdal was fool enough to leave behind the boats you leave the boats alone he stared at me a second and then swung round and lunged into the tent like an idiot it never occurred to me what he was after until he came out carrying a gun you leave the boats alone he screamed at me he was tugging at the bolt which was jammed with frozen snow as long as i have the boats ive got a chance i drove my sticks hard into the snow and charged him on my skis i drove into him head first and we collapsed in a tangled heap he was quicker on to his feet than i was encumbered by my skis but i had the gun and the bolt was free i got up carefully watching him all the time id misjudged his motive in staying behind i could see now that one of the boats had already been partly deckedin with pieces of packing cases it was just as howe had said he wanted to be the only man out of the ice alive only his nerve had failed him when he was alone and hed had to get drunk how the hell do you think youd get away in one of those boats without a crew i demanded angrily ive sailed boats singlehanded all my life he answered sullenly if that berg missed the camp id have got back to the southern cross somehow you damned fool i shouted at him you dont realize the half of what youve done the southern cross came into the ice after us she was beset and smashed he stared at me his mouth hung slackly open i dont believe it he cried it isnt true and then as i didnt say anything he added how do you know your radio went down with your ship we had a portable i said the men were coming into the camp now i ordered them to start breaking the first boat out then i slipped the bolt out of the rifle and threw the weapon into the tent better get to work bland i said youre going to help us run these boats back to the camp he didnt say anything he just stood there it was as though he couldnt realize the truth of what id told him i went over to help the men they were hitching the ropes to the first boat and running them out to block and tackle fixed to the anchor bedded in the ice bland lumbered across to me and caught hold of my arm is she sunk he demanded hoarsely the steam of his breath in the cold air smelt of whisky yes i answered any survivors we dont know yet weve had no message since they abandoned ship he suddenly laughed it was an ugly sound half drunken half menacing nobody will dare come into the ice to rescue us now were alone alone out here in the ice an its a damn good thing too damn good thing doesnt the loss of that ship mean anything to you i demanded angrily why should it the insurance people will pay he was grinning almost happily i fought down a sudden desire to strike him knock him down and kick him till he understood what hed done your father was on that ship i reminded him why should i care about my father i hardly knew him his gaze wandered to the men straining on the rope to break the boat out he lurched towards them and caught hold of the rope come on damn you pull he was like a man suddenly possessed of a devil come on craig he shouted dont stand there gaping lend a hand he was like that for perhaps ten minutes whilst we broke both boats out from where they were frozen in then the drink died in him and he became morose and sullen we ran the two boats out of the camp there were eleven of us with bland but though we could shift them all right it was exhausting work with the aid of my skis i was able to put my full weight on the rope without breaking through the snow but the others went through sometimes up to the waist it was hopeless i spliced the forerunners together ran them out to the anchor with block and tackle and thats how we got the boats back to disaster camp it was slow work but it was the only way we reached the camp just before ten that night utterly exhausted the pain in my side was like the stab of a knife gerda had left one tent still standing we cooked a meal and lay down no watch was set for i knew not one of us could stand even half an hour out here in the biting wind three hours later i woke to find gerda shaking me you must come quickly duncan she said her voice was urgent the icebergs are not more than two miles away and the ice is breaking up i was so tired i did not care if an iceberg crushed the tent with us in it it seemed easier to die than to go on i was weak and numbed with the cold and pain the ice was shuddering under me yet my heavy eyelids closed and the movement of the ice merged into gerda shaking me violently then my face was being slapped and i was dragged out into the freezing wind i staggered to my feet then and stood swaying weakly staring unbelievingly at the cold iceclad scene tauer iii was gone there was no sign of it and along the trail wed dragged the boats the ice was heaving like a frozen sea an iceberg with a tall jagged spire like the pillar rock was driving towards us icy chaos running out ahead of it the others were being pulled out of the tent hurry hurry gerda called to them she had a dozen men with her they began to move out of the camp dragging the men from the tent with them wait i called we must take the boats no gerda shouted at me above the wind we must go quickly or we shall be too late i stared at the iceberg there seemed little hope whether we stayed here or reached the floeberg i pulled myself together get your men on to the boats i ordered her she started to argue but i stopped her with the two crews there are over thirty of us we need all three boats if we do escape destruction and we lose these boats then we are doomed anyway better to die with the boats i called the men together and there in the ice with the wind driving right through us we knelt down and i prayed that we might be delivered from the disaster that threatened after that the men took up the ropes of the first boat without a word i shall never cease to marvel at mans determination to cheat death it wasnt love of life that drove them out there on the ice life wasnt lovely to them then it was days and days of cold and hunger and exertion stretching ahead of them unendingly it was their determination not to die call it fear if you like but whatever it was it gave them strength incredible fantastic strength and courage with all twentytwo of us tugging on the ropes wed take one boat in a rush a hundred yards sometimes two hundred then wed come back and do the same with the other boat the ice was splitting all round us the cracks opening like bursts of machinegun firing yet they never hesitated to go back for the second boat and i never had to drive them twice men were only saved by the ropes from the opening jaws of the ice once we had to rush the second boat across a gap that was half a boats length in width but we did it in the end and as we dragged the second boat to the foot of the floeberg a whole crowd of men came down and took the boats with a rush to the top of the berg i remember a vague impression of new faces of soft hands of another voice taking command in norwegian then i had slipped into oblivion my return to consciousness was like the slow drag to the surface of a drowning man i lay still panting as though id run a race and listened to the deathly stillness that seemed to surround me i was stiff and numb the cold struck through to the very core of me and the pain gripped me every time i breathed there was a sudden grating roar it rose till it filled all the place with sound and terminated in one splitting crash was this death was this what milton had tried to portray the worldshaking sound did not roll on ponderously like thunder it ceased abruptly there was no echo the stillness filled my ears shutting me in upon my own thoughts and yet i wasnt alone there were others near me i could hear their breathing feel their faint stirrings i could smell them too the sour odour of mens sweat i opened my eyes i was in a world of sepia glory with huddled shapes packed close beside me then i suddenly wanted to laugh the sepia glory was the sun slanting through brown sail canvas the men around me were not dead they were sleeping i sat up and then i didnt want to laugh any more i wanted to be sick i crawled out of the tent staggered to my feet in the snow and stood there retching the wind was gone the air was still and all the white incredible snowscape steamed in the sun so that the atmosphere was iridescent impermanent a water mirror in which nothing was real and every changing form of ice writhed and shimmered in mutability the sweat broke cold on my forehead i had nothing to bring up the retching stopped and in that moment the dragons roar of sound that had invaded the stillness of the tent came again terrifyingly loud like a clarion call of the four horsemen galloping through hells gates the crash that followed seemed like an atom split i straightened my aching side and searched the blinding goldtinted ice for the source of the sound and i stared unbelievingly as a block of ice that seemed as big as the crystal palace id known as a kid emerged out of the ice it opened up like a flower and then fell crashing shattered into a million fragments each prismatic each an enormous diamond throwing forth sparks of eyeblinding light the sound of itfall was like the end of the world but no mountain crags sent the sound reverberating round the heavens it was a noise that split the eardrums and then ceased ceased as though there had never been any noise stillness shut down on the ice again and a hand touched my arm feeling better i swung round at the voice the sound of it was as loud as blasphemy in the stillness of a cathedral it was howe who had spoken his face was white and his hand trembled as it held my arm he was scared feeling better he repeated and then as i nodded dumbly he produced a flask take a swig at this he said its brandy do you good i took a pull at the flask you were all pretty exhausted when you got in last night i didnt say anything i was trying to remember what had happened of course wed brought the boats to the floeberg there they were black against the frozen snow four boats and a litter of stores tents and makeshift sledges somebody had stuck a norwegian flag on an upended oar outside one of the tents the triangle of red with the blue cross hung dejectedly a splintering shivered the frosty air and behind it sounded the deep artillery rumble of ice pounded to rubble beyond the floeberg the ice stretched westward in crumpled jagged folds and beyond that ploughedup field of ice was a huge berg it was a fairy crag a gigantic prismatic skyscraper citadel of ice one pinnacle reaching like the torch of the statue of liberty into the goldshot rainbow of the sky at its base the ice was moving turning back on itself splintering and folding as the wedged cutwater ploughed into the floes to the north of it was another and to the south another and another great masses of shimmering ice i shivered and handed howe back his flask thanks i said not much future for us is there ive worked it out that at its present rate of drift that one over there will be ploughing right through the camp at about midday tomorrow his voice was the voice of science quite unemotional there wasnt much point in shifting our camp then i said wearily he shrugged his shoulders if it were just one he began and then again he shrugged his shoulders as though it wasnt any good talking about it he didnt speak for a moment and when he did his voice was bitter why couldnt you leave well alone how do you mean i asked why couldnt you leave him to die in the tauer iii camp i told you not to bring him back and i told you id only abandon him if that was what he wanted i felt very tired he didnt want to be left not when he knew id come for the boats what was he planning to do the fool thought hed got a chance of getting away alone in one of the boats hed got one of them half deckedin before he started drinking what happened did he lose his nerve maybe i said any man would lose his nerve on his own out here watching those icebergs ploughing into the ice towards him why the hell do you waste your sympathy oh him howe demanded im not wasting my sympathy on him i replied wearily im just explaining what happened where is he now over there he nodded towards one of the tents talking to vaksdal and keller his gloved hand caught hold of my arm dont you realize what youve done his voice was hoarse were in a bad enough fix without having bland here hes a murderer he knows it and he knows that we know it too its not only nordahl theres raadal and that other poor devil and all these men here he waved his hand round the camp theyre all going to die were all as good as dead you and me gerda and judie too and why his voice was unsteady almost out of control because of bland but for him wed have got the crew of hval out instead were all locked in the ice and the men of the southern cross as well gerdas beside herself shes scared for her father she loved him and you go and bring bland back and gerda has to be a party to his rescue god i could have throttled you to see you going out like a bloody little sir galahad to rescue a man whos repsonsible for the killing of nearly five hundred men i went for the boats i reminded him what good are the boats to us he stared out across the ice his hands clenching and unclenching were going to die and youve forced on me the choice of killing a man or dying with him without doing what i swore i would do he paused and then said and if we do get clear of this iceberg were going to have trouble with bland hes lost his nerve for the moment but if he can do something to get back his selfconfidence then hell be dangerous im going to have a word with peer larvik larvik i swung round not hearing what he replied seeing four boats where there should only have been three and the norwegian flag drooping from the upended oar i seized hold of him shaking him in my sudden excitement is larvik here have the hval crew joined up with us he nodded and i hesitated steadying myself conscious of the pulsebeat in my body judie is she all right is she here too he stared at me astonished good god dont you remember you collapsed into her arms last night i stood there for a moment cursing the ice that made our time so short cursing myself for bringing her husband back where is she my voice sounded hoarse and unnatural over there in larviks tent i stood there without moving for quite a while i was thinking that perhaps it was as well for both of us that we had only a few hours left of life i bent down and scooped up a handful of snow rubbing it over my face i no longer felt weak i felt strong strong enough to cheat death and to fight my way out of the ice and yet it was better this way i knew that i walked slowly over to the tent where the norwegian flag hung and called to her in a moment she was out there in the glory of that iridescent sunshine holding my hands looking up into my face and smiling and laughing all in one her eyes gleaming like frosted diamonds we just stood and looked at each other and laughed with happiness and then without a word we turned and walked through the powdery snow to the farther edge of the floeberg and stood and watched the towering cliffs of ice tearing up the floes not seeing them as death any more but dominating their terror with our sense of life so that they were just something exciting to watch it was as though our love could exorcize the devil of fear and thats a funny thing we never had to ask each other about our love the truth was there in our eyes but our moment alone together was very short kalstad came up his round rather slavonic face looked worried whats the trouble kalstad i asked as he coughed awkwardly its vaksdal and keller he said the men do not want them in their tents they are sandefjord men both of them good god i exclaimed this is no time to worry about whether a man comes from sandefjord or tonsberg also these two men will not do what i order kalstad added woodenly then make them i have tried but kalstad shrugged his shoulders vaksdal is a big man and it is no time to fight i think also he is very angry because he is no longer mate i see what about keller keller will do what vaksdal do all right bring vaksdal here vaksdal was in an ugly mood i could see that by the morose way he slouched towards me when he stood in front of me he was a good head taller kalstad informs me you refuse to obey his orders i said ja it is not right he should give me orders did you hear me appoint him mate yesterday ja and i reduced you to ordinary seaman for abandoning your boats kaptein bland say you have not the authority to damn bland i shouted bland is i stopped then i was seething with anger you come and talk to captain larvik no judies hand was on my arm you must not worry peer larvik with this duncan its his responsibility i said hes in charge now but she shook her head no youre in command larvik is very ill his ribs are crushed and his legs he got caught between the side of hval and the ice i was just going back to him i dont think she hesitated and there were tears in her eyes i dont think hell live very long you must handle this yourself she turned then and walked towards the tent where the norwegian flag hung i felt suddenly very tired again so the responsibility was still on my shoulders i looked up at vaksdal have you ever thought what its like to die i asked him he looked puzzled no he said i do not think about such things youve never looked death in the face i turned him round so that he faced the slow inevitable advance of the iceberg you are looking at death now i said i dont think we have much hope but so long as were alive theres still a chance so long as were alive and working together this is no time to cause trouble is it i do not begin it he growled it is the men who begin it they are tonsberg men me and keller we are from sandefjord all right i said ill have a word with the men later in the meantime have the sense to accept orders if when this iceberg has passed there are any of us alive then ill discuss the question of my authority to act as i have done he stared down at me for a moment and then i saw his eyes drawn to the towering bulk of the iceberg as though it were a magnet all right he growled and turned quickly and went back to keller who had been standing by the tents watching us i crossed the top of the floeberg where the stores and boats were lashed down and reached the tent with the flag outside the flap was drawn back and judie was bent over a figure lying in a huddle of blankets there was blood on the trodden snow and the mans head that showed in the sunlight over judies shoulder was unrecognizable the blue eyes were sunk deep in their sockets and the lower lip showed red and bloody in the stubble of his beard where the bared teeth had bitten into the flesh with the pain judie looked as my shadow fell across her is he conscious i asked she nodded i was just coming to fetch you she said he wants to speak to you she crawled out of the tent and stood up dont let him talk for long hes very weak i bent down and sat myself in the doorway of the tent judie says you want to see me i said craig the voice was very faint yes i said come nearer please i slithered into the tent and then i knew he was going to die the tent smelt of rotting flesh even with the tent flap pulled back and the cold air circulating it was gangrene you can smell my legs eh there was no fear in his voice and his eyes were quite steady judie has done her best but it will not be long now he said something else but it was lost in a crash of splintering ice so loud that it seemed just outside the tent his hand came out from under the blankets and fastened on my shoulder it was grey and the veins and knotted muscles stood out like cords in the wasted flesh you are in command now you must get them out of the ice there is not much hope but he gnawed at his lip fighting the pain what are you going to do he asked at length we could start trekking i said now the wind has dropped the westward thrust of the ice seems to be lessening if we left now we might be able to keep ahead of this iceberg he shook his head slowly no good he said if you leave here how do you live how do you finally escape without the boats i hear what you do yesterday gerda tell me you know that there is only hope so long as you have the boats for a while he lay still without speaking staring out through the open tent to the scintillating mass of the berg grinding its way towards us if it is only one berg peraps south or north but here it is a line also it is not good to retreat it is not good for morale he turned his head towards me and i saw that his eyes were excited i think you must advance eh that will have better appeal to the men you know i suppose my face must have shown that i was mystified for his grip tightened on my shoulder all morning i am lying here with nothing to do but look out of the tent look he nodded through the open tent flap do you not see something on the berg to the south there is a ledge there it slope up like a ramp i have look at him through the glasses if you can transfer the camp to that ledge but its impossible i said he shrugged his shoulders it is difficult but nothing is impossible as you say the rate of advance of the iceberg is becoming more slow already it is breaking the ice up more gently our camp here is a small berg the icefloes round us will be broken up we shall be thrown about but perhaps we do not break entirely perhaps we are for a little while close to the ledge with gods help we may get there you are a sensible man you think to bring forerunners and tackle i also bring my forerunners i think we have a chance it is a very small chance but it is the only one he looked at me quickly you agree i didnt say anything for a moment i stared at the foot of the iceberg where it ploughed into the floes it was less than a mile away now id once seen lava engulfing a village that was when my corvette was in the bay of naples and vesuvius was in eruption the iceberg was advancing at about the same speed and though it was as cold as the lava had been hot it had the same slow ponderous inevitability of destruction about it it was advancing at the rate of about two hundred yards an hour directly towards us for a mile or more to right and left of it the ice was in a state of chaos the floes being splintered broken up and layered the outer fringe of this area of chaos was the worst for there the chaos of one iceberg met the chaos of the next and all was a confusion of upended floes and great slabs of ice tossed in the air like snowballs nowhere could i see a floeberg as substantial as the one we were on and as the chaos was worse at the sides of the iceberg than in front of it there seemed just the barest chance for we were in the direct path of its advance at least the idea of riding the source of the destruction appealed to me in its daring i nodded at any rate it gives us something to try for something to try for larvik nodded slowly he looked drained of life and i realized that id let him exhaust himself something to try for he said again his voice scarcely audible then he seemed to rally he patted my arm when you are on his back he will be your horse and you can laugh when he charge the ice perhaps he break a way out for you he closed his eyes i stayed there beside him for a little longer then as he still lay motionless with his eyes closed i began to slide out of the tent but his hand moved on my arm is bland there he asked his voice was thick as though his throat were clogged with blood yes i said do you want to speak to him he didnt answer for a moment then he said no i do not think i am strong enough to say what i should wish he coughed and writhed in agony i held his hand till he was quiet again whatever i may think of old bland he is a man this pup of his has gone wrong he is dangerous craig judie is now the biggest shareholder in the company bernt nordahl leave her everything i know because i witness the will look after her my friend and see that erik bland does not get out of the ice alive you understand his sunken eyes stared at me promise you his voice was too faint for me to hear the rest his eyes were gazing urgently into mine i knew what he wanted but i couldnt promise that so i slid quietly out of the tent judie was waiting for me youve been a long time she said is he all right hes very weak i told her her face looked small and unhappy i am afraid he will not last the night she crawled into the tent then and i turned and stared at the giant iceberg searching that ledge it started right at the base of the berg and sloped gently up till it merged into the cliff of ice that formed the side about fifty feet above the surrounding pack there was just a chance i felt just the slightest chance and i prayed that larvik who had given us this chance would live to reach that ledge i got the men together then and told them the plan it appealed to them anything positive would have appealed to them and they threw themselves into the work of preparation with an enthusiasm that was derived as much from a desire to blot out the fear that was in them as from any sense of hope forerunners were thawed of ice and spliced together in long lines anchor stakes were prepared and sliding tackle rigged boat slings were fitted stores were packed and secured in bundles for the idea was that boats and stores should be run out to the ledge on the iceberg on the lifeline and bosns chair principle but as the day wore on and the iceberg came nearer to our camp i noticed the men glancing over their shoulders at it with a scared look in their faces by evening the work was done only the tents and immediate stores were left unpacked after the evening meal there was nothing for the men to do no one felt like sleep and they stood about on the ice in groups gazing with awe at the towering mass of ice it loomed over the camp like death in visible form the noise of the floes being crushed and thrust aside as it advanced was incessant a grinding rumble penetrated by sharp splintering cracks wonderful golden bars radiated from the suns gleaming centre of light low to the south and from a fabulous mock sun much higher in the sky the light glistened on crags of ice a hundred feet and more high in the shadows the naked ice sheer in places like a glass wall was a cold green or colder blue but where the sun bars struck it its surface gleamed like burnished metal mirroring the prismatic and uncertain lights of the sky our camp became as cold as death the mens eyes shied at the blinding scintillation of the sunny side of the berg and turned more and more often to the green and blue of the shadows where glacial jaws gaped black and the spilling wavecrests of ice were cold and remote theyd stand and gaze at the shadowed flank for a moment their mouths agape and their faces awestruck then theyd turn with a shiver of cold and slink into the tents for warmth but no one could sleep and soon theyd be out again to stare fascinated by the inevitability of the end bland kept mostly to his tent vaksdal and keller had erected one against some packing cases and he had moved in with them i suppose i should have discouraged his association with his two mates but there seemed no point on the few occasions i saw him outside the tent he was alone he seemed to have withdrawn into a sullen brooding mood so that he scarcely noticed anyone around him i cant really recall how much the men knew or had been told about his part in the business our own men at any rate must have suspected that hed rammed us deliberately in other circumstances they might have killed him as it was the iceberg and the approach of death dominated everything only once did any incident occur it was in one of the rare moments when judie wasnt looking after larvik we were sitting together on the edge of one of the boats gerda and howe were standing at the edge of the floeberg gazing towards the sun they were holding each others hand as they turned back towards the camp bland came out of his tent howe stopped at the sight of him his face was tense then he let go of gerdas hand and went towards bland he passed right by us he was crying and there was a strange desperate look of longing on his face bland saw his coming and stopped his eyes narrowing and his body stiffening judies hand tightened on my arm howe looked so puny as he faced bland i got up howe might have a gun he might have screwed up his courage to kill him and if he hadnt then i could see him being hurt bland could break him as easily as he could snap a twig but as i rose gerda ran past me she caught howe by the arm and dragged him away from bland as she brought him back leading him by the hand his face was horribly convulsed and there was an air of bitterness and frustration about him that was quite frightening judies hand slipped into mine he is tearing himself apart she whispered oh how i wish they could live i glanced down at her do you think they would be happy i asked yes i think perhaps they might she answered she sighed and gave a little shrug poor gerda its the maternal instinct with her with walter its different hes in love i think hes found happiness for the first time in his life thats what is tearing him apart he wants to live and kill she sighed again and added i think it might have worked out very well why the devil doesnt he enjoy the fact that hes alive and gerda is with him i said she was silent for a moment then she said if we ever reach that ledge duncan you must have a trial at once the men must know the truth i wish you hadnt she stopped short and i said hadnt what no she answered i must not wish that but he frightens me i knew that what she was wishing was that i hadnt brought bland back from the tauer iii camp she wanted her husband dead and i could understand how she felt i remember thinking well well all be dead soon it doesnt matter id no real hope of our getting across that litter of broken ice on to the ledge the mere sight of it appalled me knowing that sooner or later i had got to attempt to cross it but it doesnt matter now judie said suddenly nothing matters now except that we are together for a little judie had all the realism of her sex she was not buoyed up by any preposterous illusion of hope she saw the inevitable and accepted it she made no attempt to bolster up her courage with the idea that we could cheat the death that stared us in the face from those glasshard cliffs of ice her attitude affected me in a strange way instead of being scared i too felt acceptance of the inevitable and i almost welcomed it to go like this loving someone and loved by someone it was sublime in that bitter cold there was no suggestion of passion i cant explain it quite but if we have souls then it was the merging of our two souls in that twilight evening of death our love was out of this world we were two people wanting to pass over into the beyond together i have often wondered since what elands feelings about judie really were the fact that he threatened me through her that time i went across to tauer iii is no indication and anyway love and hate are never far apart but i remember one occasion that evening when the mans feelings blazed through the sullen facade hed erected as a barrier between himself and the people round him it does not answer the question but i think i should record it and the reaction it produced in judie it was towards midnight and she and i were watching the sun sweep low in the eggshell pale sky to the south standing there i was suddenly conscious of being watched judie must have felt it too because she turned as i did bland was standing outside his tent he was standing quite still about twenty yards from us his face was heavy and brooding there was something in his features in the way he stood that reminded me of his father our eyes met and i remember i was shocked to see such a violence of hatred i have never thank god had a man look at me like that before or since it was the look of the lone wolf the rogue male barred from the pack and bitter with the thought of what others enjoyed it was bitterness and frustration turned to hate but whether it indicated a depth of feeling for judie that she was unaware of i do not know but i do know that she saw it and recognized it for her fingers caught at my arm and as we turned back towards the sun her face looked white you must be careful she said and her voice trembled she glanced quickly over her shoulder bland had gone back to his tent erik is dangerous she added and then i must go and see my patient she turned quickly away towards larviks tent the cold became intense that night a very slight breath of air came out of the west and the thermometer fell as it brought into the camp the chill ice temperature of the berg the hours passed vaguely as in a dream the camp was restless and for the first time since wed abandoned ship the men on watch had company there is a strange fascination about death no one likes it to catch him unawares and inside the tents the noise and the quaking of the ice seemed magnified so that one lay in a sort of tense expectancy of fear the berg growing in ones imagination to undreamedof heights and toppling down on the flimsy sepia curtain of canvas it was a relief then to go out and see the real height of the berg and mark how slowly it ground its way towards us but though it might come slowly when we watched it when we ignored it for a moment and looked again wed realize with horror how swift in terms of the future that advance was the ledge on the south side gleamed clear and bright like a ramp leading to heaven in some super colossal colourfilm monstrosity but i dont think any of us had any hope of reaching it between us and that ledge was a slowly closing gap of moving ice there were great crevasses that opened and closed with a snap floes that stood on end all jagged and then sank slowly beneath the heaving mass and huge blocks of ice that were spewed up and fell crashing on to the floes and where the sheer prow of the iceberg crushed its way through the pack there was a moving wave of ice that looked like powdered glass and along the flanks of the berg ran a black line in which water splashed catching the sun on its green crests i wasnt scared at least it didnt seem like fear to me then the scene was so stupendous as to seem remote and unreal i felt like a spectator and i knew i should go on feeling like a spectator until the moment when i had to cross the gap and the ice overwhelmed me chapter ix most of you who read this will have faced death at one time or another youll know how it feels the car coming at you on the wrong side of the road produces the same reaction as high explosive whistling down at you from the sky there is the tensing of the nerves the sudden photographic clarity of vision but no fear that comes later when nerves stretched beyond endurance relax leaving you shivering with the reaction it is the same only more prolonged with the man going into battle he is tensed up ready for it and when it comes he conquers fear and afterwards he is limp exhausted but when death comes slowly and inevitably then the nervous tension cannot be sustained thats when men crack its like battle exhaustion men cant go on facing death indefinitely if the period is too sustained then the nervous reaction sets in before the moment of impact then comes fear naked uncontrolled fear thats what happened at our camp the morning the iceberg reached us just after six judie crawled into my tent her eyes were very large and darkringed she looked exhausted duncan will you come please i think hes gone i followed her to larviks tent there was no sun that morning a grey wrack of cloud drifted up and the wind was rising out of the souwest it was gloomy in the tent and i could hardly see larviks bearded face his body was cold and when i became accustomed to the gloom i saw that his eyes were glazed i pulled a blanket over him outside the tent i saw that many of the men had come out of their tents they were watching us furtively and there was an air of tension over the camp it was as though they had sensed death how shall we bury him judie asked leave him where he is i said but we must have a service for him no i answered harshly she started to argue and i said look at the men theyre scared enough as it is without knowing that larvik is dead she turned and looked round the camp i could see there were tears in her eyes for gods sake dont cry i said sharply they mustnt know do you understand i saw her bite her lip then she looked at me and nodded yes i understand i think he will understand too i turned away then and shouted for the stewards to get a meal ready that meal was the best they could devise but the men were silent and tense as they ate in their tents and when it was finished they were out again in the open staring at the crumbling ice it is frightful to think that you have had your last meal the advance of the berg was as inevitable as the hangmans rope after the final breakfast there was nothing i could give the men to do they stood around in little groups staring at the berg and occasionally their eyes wandered to larviks tent where the norwegian flag still flew the prow of the iceberg was not three hundred yards from us now and behind the prow the ice towered up and up in sheer crags of blue and green cold and still until it lost itself in the clouds losing its top like that in the clouds made it far more terrifying it added to its stature the noise of the shattering ice was so loud that we had to shout if we wanted to make ourselves heard the floeberg was quivering it was like being on a ship battered by giant seas we could actually see the ice shaking the boats rocked and the packing cases tied together rolled over our floe was like an island in the midst of chaos all round us the ice was breaking up now we were right in the thick of what we had been watching for so long and in a little while i should be down in that maelstrom fighting to get a rope across to the ledge i felt fear gripping at me the moment of panic came when a floe between us and the berg split across with an earsplitting crackle the half nearest us reared up turning slowly on to its back for a moment it seemed poised above us forty or fifty feet high then it came crashing down its edge splintered on the forward ledge of our refuge a piece of ice as large as a barn door knocked one of the hval men flying a great chunk was torn off our floeberg for a moment the sea boiled back then the gap closed the floes rushing together grinding and tearing at each other in their effort to get relief from the frightful pressure it was a stampede of ice no one moved for a moment we were stunned by the terrible power of the forces at work then hans suddenly screamed it was a highpitched rabbit scream the boy turned like a hunted hare and began to run the men watched him for a second immobile fascinated then one of them also began to run and in a second half the crews were following the boy i started forward to stop them but vaksdal was before me he caught the first man and knocked him cold with one blow of his huge fist and he got hans scooped the boy up with one hand and turned to face the break the men stopped they were breathing heavily they stood watching him for a moment like cattle that have been headed then they turned and shuffled shamefacedly back towards the camp i met them as they came back i realized that it was now or never if i waited any longer their morale would be too low to make the effort i couldnt talk to them because of the noise of the splintering ice but i gathered them all round me and knelt down on the ice they knelt down all of them and every man as he knelt turned so that he faced the advance of the berg and as we knelt there i felt that comforting sense of oneness develop in us oneness of purpose in adversity i stared at the twohundredyard gap of jagged surging ice that id have to cross and then i looked at judie her eyes met mine and smiled and i felt sure of myself again i could face it whatever it was to be i got up from the ice and called out to the men that the moment for action had come that now we were going to attack the berg itself judie was close beside me and i heard her say who makes the first attempt vaksdal and i i answered i looked at her quickly she nodded as though she had braced herself for that i shouted to kalstad and he brought the ropes i dont know whether bland knelt in prayer with the crews as they pressed round me i remember his eyes were feverishly bright a brightness that seemed a queer mixture of fear and excitement the ropes were coiled down on the ice at the side of the camp nearest the berg i took the two ends and shouted for vaksdal he came forward sullenly i handed him the end of one of the ropes he hesitated his eyes were angry for a moment i thought he was going to refuse because of the boats i shouted at him i dont know whether it was because he recognized the justice of my choice or because he was afraid of being regarded as a coward but he took the rope and began to tie it round his body i took the other rope and we went to the edge of the floe where the ice dropped in a steep slide to the quivering pack judie came up to me and kissed me then she took the rope and began to tie it round my body but as she started to tie it there was a sudden surge in the crowd and she was swept aside the rope was whipped away from me and erik bland slipped over the edge on to the pack ice below he held the rope in his hand and i can see him now as he looked up at me with a sort of crazy grin tying the rope round his waist and calling to vaksdal to come i seized hold of the rope to haul him back whatever relief i automatically might feel was swallowed in my instant realization of the danger of such an indisciplined action but as i reached for the rope howe gripped my arm let him go he shouted let him go i tell you the scream of his voice was loud in a sudden unnerving silence as i hesitated i saw relief and satisfaction in his eyes he was convinced that whoever tried to make the crossing would die in that instant of hesitation i lost my one chance of stopping bland for as i reached for the rope again i saw it uncoiling steadily down on the ice vaksdal and bland were going forward together and then i saw that bland was wearing crampons where hed got them from i dont know but the fact that he was wearing them made it clear that his action wasnt done on the spur of the moment this was what hed planned to do i looked round at the men they were watching him intently and in some of their eyes i caught a glint of admiration mcphee and kalstad were paying out line bonomi was moving excitedly from one position to another taking photographs down on the pack the two men were moving into the broken ice trailing the slender lines they climbed out on to the edge of a floe that was slowly being tilted they dropped from view the floe rose almost vertical hiding them then it broke across and subsided into the ice showing us vaksdal leaping in great bounds from one precarious foothold to another bland was lying flat clinging to the edge of a floe which was slowly being ground to powder i thought for a moment he was injured but he pulled the rope into a coil beside him gathered himself together and leapt for a block of ice no bigger than one of our boats he was up and following vaksdal now from one foothold to another they got within twenty feet or so of the ledge and there they paused facing a gap full of powdered ice in which the sea sometimes showed vaksdal coiled his rope and leapt for a moment i thought hed made it but the ice received his weight like a bog in an instant he was up to his knees then he was floundering full length with only the upper half of his body visible he was within two yards of the ledge but it might have been two miles for all the chance he had of reaching it he was rolled over in the grey stream his mouth was a dark gap in the blond of his beard as he cried out something or screamed with pain we could hear nothing but the splitting and grinding of the ice bland hesitated staring at vaksdal and coiling his rope then he backed away and started to run judies fingers dug into my arm whatever she might think of him now erik bland was after all a part of her life instead of jumping he flung himself full length in a beautiful diving tackle his impetus carried him half across the gap his body sliding on the surface of the ice then he was clawing forward his arms working like a swimmer doing the crawl his body didnt sink and foot by foot his arms dragged him across then at last he was standing on the ledge itself and was hauling vaksdal up after him the men cheered wildly as the two men stood together on the ledge they were symbols of renewed hope they represented life bland looked across at the cheering men my eyes weakened by the constant glare of the past few days couldnt make out the expression of his face but it looked as though he were grinning well hed a right to grin and the men were right to cheer hed done a pretty brave thing but howe was screaming in my ear hes laughing at us hes on his own now thats what he wanted i brushed him aside shouting to dahle first mate of hval whom id put in charge of loading to get tools and anchors across the men tied them to the rope and as they were hauled across the twohundredyard gap howe was pulling at my sleeve and yelling hell abandon us i tell you dont be a fool i snapped he cant do anything without boats and stores well get across yourself with the first batch of men i shook my head angrily the loading plan was all arranged one boat stores then a dozen men the process to be repeated until boats stores and men had all been transported to the ledge and now that bland had done the job of getting the ropes across as leader i was bound to be the last man to leave the camp vaksdal and bland were working like mad to fix the anchors firmly as soon as this was done and the rope set up the first boat was run across owing to the movement of the berg towards us the rope sagged and we had to have men constantly swigging on it about the middle the boat was bumping dangerously on the ice and just before it reached the ledge one of the two anchors broke out fortunately the other anchor held and the boat was got safely to the ledge but this and the constant slackening of the rope made me realize that more men were required on the ledge at once and that it was there that the major difficulties would be experienced as the slings were hauled back i gave the order for the first batch of men to go instead of stores which were next on the loading table gerda came across to me as the men were getting into the slings i think you should be there duncan she shouted it is important nothing go wrong at that end i didnt like the idea of being one of the first across but i had already reached the conclusion that i should be there i ordered dahle to assume command of the rear party and took the place of one of the men in the slings we also hitched on the two remaining anchors it was a strange experience crossing that surging gap of ice supported only by a single sagging rope the lines as i have said could not be kept sufficiently taut and when we reached the centre the sag was so great that our feet were dancing on the moving surface of the ice this would have been all right except that a floe split open as we were crossing it and rose on end so that for a moment it completely overtopped us and looked as though it would carry away the ropes and ourselves with it however it slid back under the ice and we made the ledge with nothing worse than sore buttocks where the rope slings had cut into our flesh with the extra personnel and anchors we soon had both lines set up securely and began to ferry the stores across i had arranged the order of transhipment very carefully so that should the ice split the party at any time each section would have its proper complement of boats and stores it was whilst we were hauling the second boat across that the movement of the old camp on the floe in relation to the iceberg first became really noticeable we were using both ropes for the boats now for greater safety as we started to haul across these ropes instead of sagging seemed to get tauter till they were stretched like slender threads we brought the boat over with a rush and slackened off we were only just in time another minute and the lines would have carried away what had happened was that the floeberg had been caught in a sort of eddying outthrust of ice and was moving steadily outwards away from the berg with the arrival of the next party i hacked a bollard out of a block of ice nearby and had the ends of the rope run through blocks and round this icebollard with men tagging on the ends it meant a delay but i was glad i had done it for when we resumed operations it became clear at once that the floeberg was beginning to show considerable movement it was now no longer on the starboard bow of the iceberg so to speak it was abeam of the ledge and beginning to feel the bowwave effect of the ice being thrown about by the bergs advance one moment the men on the ropes would be right close to the bollard the next they would be hauling back up the slope of the ledge then again theyd be coming down and letting out rope they acted like the accumulators in a catcher moving back and forth along the slope according to the strain on the lines at length we were hauling in the last boat as it came in to the ledge the men on the ropes came down with a run paying out line as fast as they could let it through their hands we swung the boat down on to the ledge somebody shouted to me a ropeend went trailing over the edge i glanced quickly across at the huddle of dark figures in the ice they were standing staring towards us quite motionless all the stores had been cleared there was just the rearguard dahle and five of the hval crew the floe on which they stood was being whirled away from us caught in a gigantic surge of ice we flung our weight on the last remaining rope but it was no good it was dragged from our hands by forces that were far beyond our puny strength the end of it trailed over on to the ice and we could do nothing but stand and watch that little group of figures alone in a heaving chaos i put my arm round judies shoulders she was standing very tense her face quite white and her whole body trembling her lips moved in agitated prayer the floeberg on which dahle and his companions were marooned was turning slowly round and round as though it were at the very centre of a revolving whirlpool in the ice then it seemed to rise up caught between opposing forces a moment later it split the noise was like a battery of heavies firing and was clearly audible above the thunder of sound all round us one or two of the men abandoned their shattered ice island and began floundering towards us across the churning ice but their starting point in relation to the iceberg was very different to what it had been when bland and vaksdal had made the crossing they were right in the broken ice now they hadnt a chance through my glasses i could see only three men standing near where our camp had been one was dahle the remains of the floeberg now a block no bigger than a large house began to roll the three men scrambled and clawed their way across the ice fighting to keep on the uppermost side it was horrible standing there watching them go like that especially as i should have been one of them the hval men had volunteered to be in the rear party but i felt very upset all the same judie must have understood my mood for her hand gripped my arm as i stood staring out across the ice its not your fault she said if wed been quicker i answered if wed started on the job a few minutes earlier three or four minutes more would have seen those six men with us on the ledge i turned away angrily no good brooding over it there was work to be done and i set about the task of organizing the new camp i detailed a dozen men to cut a way through the jagged ice of the ledge and drag the boats up as far as possible then i turned to get the stores secured and the tents pitched and as i turned bland came towards me i hadnt really noticed him since reaching the ledge there had been too much to do but now as he approached me he seemed to have an air of truculence and there was something about his eyes a queer sort of confidence something like a sneer he was somehow different hed lost the dazed look he came right over to me and stopped in front of me i want a word with you craig he said there was a sudden authority in his tone that stopped me in my tracks he had spoken loudly and i saw several of the men stop work to watch us well i asked in future youll keep away from my wife he said thats for her to decide i answered trying to keep the anger i felt out of my voice its an order he said i stared at him the hell it is i said get to work on the boats bland he shook his head grinning i saw the fever of excitement in his eyes you dont give orders here and then in a moment of quiet he said mister craig please understand that now that larvik is dead i am in command he swung round on the men who were all watching us now in the absence of my father i shall of course take command here as his deputy as commander i brought the ropes across craig as secondincommand should have remained with the rear party as i instructed but he shrugged his shoulders as a newcomer to the company he said to me you will realize that you are too inexperienced to have any sort of command in a situation like this he turned abruptly and strode towards the men there was almost a swagger in the way he walked i just stood there for a moment without moving i was too amazed by the absurdity of the thing to make a move i remember thinking howe was right hes got back his confidence nordahls death the ramming hes forgotten it all and i cursed myself for not realizing he was dangerous he began shouting orders at the men i saw the amazement i felt written on their faces but they were overawed by the terror of their surroundings they would follow any leader so long as he led i started forward and as i came up to bland i heard him announce the reinstatement of vaksdal and keller as mates he gave an order the men hesitated their eyes shifted to me bland turned the sneer was gone now but the truculence was still there i ordered him to pick up one of the packing cases his eyes shifted quickly from me to the men another instant and hed believe what he wanted to believe that he was not responsible for the predicament we were in that mad scramble across the ice had almost wiped any sense of guilt from his mind and as he didnt move when i repeated the order i knew there was only one thing to do mcphee kalstad the two hval men moved forward arrest that man i ordered and then turning quickly to bland i said erik bland you are charged with the murder of bernt nordahl and also with the deliberate ramming of hval an action which caused the immediate death of two men and which may be responsible for all our deaths you will be held and committed for trial when and if we ever reach civilization i was watching his eyes all the time as i spoke for a moment they had a wild almost hunted look then he laughed you cant get away with this craig he shouted first you try to steal my wife now you try to get control of the company through her i called to two or three of the hval men and with kalstad and mcphee moved in to get him i new just what he was capable of now and i was taking no more chances i wanted him secured he watched us approach and i thought for a moment he was going to fight his face was very white under his brown beard and his eyes shifted uneasily from side to side then suddenly he turned and slithered down the ice of the ledge a manhunt wasnt going to be good for morale but i was determined to get him i sent kalstad and the rest after him he had stopped at one of the packing cases that had apparently been burst open with a pick i thought wed mastered him without the sordid business of a fight i had turned back to speak with the men when howe gave a shout of warning as i swung round bland was lifting a rifle out of the broken packing case kalstad started to run towards him then he and the men behind him checked suddenly bland had the gun cocked and levelled straight at them he was laughing at them a shot rang out close behind me i turned to find vaksdal struggling with howe vaksdal had hold of his arm and as he twisted it back the gloved fingers released the weapon it fell to the ice for a moment there was a glint of nickelplating slithering down the ramp then it disappeared over the edge bland was coming up the ledge now and he was driving the hval men back at the point of his gun he was immensely pleased with himself you could see it by the gleam in his eyes and the way he walked he bunched all the survivors together none of us hesitated to obey his eyes were narrowed and cold and his manner and the way he held the rifle made it clear that he would not hesitate to use it he called vaksdal and keller over to him they hesitated uncertainly bland as the son of the chairman of the company was one thing bland with a gun another but they went down to him all the same he spoke in norwegian they looked at me and then began muttering amongst themselves he tell them it is safe to have only one leader gerda translated for me that he is in command and that it is mutiny if they do not obey him the thing had got to be stopped at once i called out to the men and then judies hands were tugging at my arm bland was yelling at me to shut up he had the gun to his shoulder and was aiming straight at me keep quiet duncan judie pleaded he will shoot there is plenty of time howe just behind me said weve got to get his gun as we hesitated one or two of the men moved down the slope of the ledge towards bland in an instant they would all go they needed a leader bland had a gun and the will to use it it seems incredible now but out there on that ledge in that chaotic wilderness of ice it didnt seem so incredible the law of the wild holds good when it comes to pitting your puny strength against the violence of nature if we could stop the men isolate bland and his two mates then the sheer threat of our numbers would wear him down i started forward if i got killed well it was just too bad in the moment of horror the men might rush him then but just as i moved out to stop what had begun to look like a general movement towards bland gerda rushed past me she stopped facing the men with her back to bland her small bulky figure blocked their way down the ledge and she poured a flood of norwegian at them her eyes bright her face flushed the men stopped she was telling them the truth now and the men growled angrily i glanced at bland he had lowered the gun he was sane enough to realize that if he shot her the men would kill him but he was coming up the slope his face white and convulsed with rage i called to gerda to look out but she kept on speaking bland struck her from behind stunning her with one blow of his hand across the nape of her neck howe gave an inarticulate cry and ran forward judie clutched him but too late he flung himself shrieking on bland who met him with a jab of the rifle barrel to his stomach and as howe folded up he brought his knee up sharply so that his head jerked back bland caught him as he slipped to the ice i heard him shout something about wanting to do it for a long time and he smashed his fist into the wretched mans face howes face looked dazed and a gush of blood shone very crimson against the white of the snow his knees gave and suddenly he was a crumpled bundle of clothing lying on the ice bland kicked him viciously his gun ready waiting for the first man to break and rush at him he was grinning all the time i felt judie stiffen beside me this was the real bland this was the bland she knew the man who admired the nazis and their methods and seeing him kicking at howes senseless body i knew that none of us would get out of the ice alive not unless we killed bland first god how i wished id never gone back to the tauer iii camp for the boats for a moment he was lost to everything but the pleasure of taking it out of howe we might have rushed him then but i think we were all too astonished at the sudden display of violence and by the time we had started to move in on him the moment was gone he checked us with the gun and then he began talking to the men and as he talked to them i realized how he had been able to pull the wool over hides eyes it was impossible to believe that a moment before hed been kicking a senseless man with the gun in his hand and the memory of that dash across the ice to the ledge he had complete confidence in himself his manner was a queer mixture of the arrogance of the leader and the almost boyish excitement of the adventurerhes trying to persuade the men to desert us judie said id already realized that you must do something she added they may follow him if we dont do something to stop them but it was no good my talking to them the weakness of my position was that i was an outsider and though i didnt understand what bland was saying i knew from the contemptuous way in which he mentioned my name that he was using that fact to sway the men you talk to them i said theyre all of them tonsberg men talk to them about your father she stared at me in surprise and then very reluctantly as she saw i wouldnt move she stepped forward her face was very white it was hard for her the man was her husband and she had to tell the men that hed murdered her father she began to speak her voice clear even above the growl and thunder of the ice for a moment she and bland were talking at the same time then the attention of the men became riveted on her bland hesitated and then stopped speaking the boyish arrogance gradually slipped from his manner his eyes shifted uneasily from the men to judie and back again to the men his grip on his gun tightened as an angry murmur rose from them then suddenly he shouted an order his voice was crisp and hard he was calling on the men to follow him they talked uncertainly among themselves for a moment then they were silent he called to them again but no one moved all right he shouted at them in english have it your own way then stay with craig and see where it lands you he turned to me theyre your responsibility now craig he drew a line with the heel of his boot across the ice of the ledge youll camp above this line any mutineer that crosses this line will be shot understand youll be issued with tents and stores once a day at midday youll send two men to collect rations bonomi the little italian started si signore can you cook a leetle but i am not youll cook for the officers then go down and report to vaksdal the rest of you get back up the ledge go on get moving he made a threatening gesture with the gun go an go an i could almost hear the nazi raus raus echoing the violence of his voice what about the boats i asked bland looked at me he was breathing heavily and his eyes were bright he no longer looked in the least boyish he had the mean look of something thats been cornered the boats will remain with me ill look after them for you he turned to judie and said youd better stay with your boyfriend judie turned without answering him he watched her and there was a strange look in his eyes it wasnt remorse i think perhaps it was regret a sudden sense of sadness for what might have been gerda had recovered consciousness and was staggering to her feet i got two of the men and we picked howe up he was just beginning to come round his upper lip was swollen and pulpy and his right arm was bruised otherwise he seemed all right the rest of the crews had already moved up the slope of the ice ledge we followed bland took no chances with the men he got right on with the issuing of tents and stores i imagine he picked the best of everything for himself and his companions but there was still plenty for us i set the men to levelling platforms for the tents and cutting into the ice wall at the back of the ledge to provide extra shelter for when it began to blow again it would be terribly exposed up there on that ledge as the day wore on judies attitude began to worry me only once did she speak to me and then it was to upbraid me for not doing something about bland when hed faced us with his gun when i tried to explain to her that there was nothing i could have done she turned away angrily her face was pale and tense she seemed bitter and resentful it was almost as though she were blaming me for what had happened she and gerda were given a tent to themselves as soon as it was erected judie crawled into it and that was the last i saw of her that day once when i passed i heard the sound of sobbing i hesitated wondering whether to go in and try to comfort her but someone called to me and i passed on setting up camp on that ledge was a job that occupied all my attention i had no time to worry about her that night after the evening meal as i lay in my tent talking to howe and mcphee and kalstad who shared it gerda crawled in what are you going to do duncan she asked nothing i said but you must do something not yet i answered she was sitting close to howe and i saw her hand was holding his it made me think of judie i asked gerda whether she were all right ja i think so but she is not very happy she peered at me uncertainly in the half light it is not very nice her position i think also she feel you must do something you make her speak to the men she have to bare her soul in front of them all so that they will follow you and not bland now she think you must she stopped uncertainly must what i asked please do not be offended duncan it is so difficult not in my own language but she feel that you must justify the mens faith that you must take control it it is not that she do not believe in you i am sure of that but but you must try to understand it is terrible for her this position what does she expect me to do i asked harshly i was very tired i do not know she is not clear in her mind i think you see it is all a terrible muddle for her bland is her husband she know he murder her father she is in love with you and bland whom you save from dying alone now controls everything gerdas right howe said his words blurred through his thickened lips theyre both right weve got to do something that was what he had been saying before she came in yes but what i demanded irritably weve no weapons altogether bland has three rifles and about a thousand rounds of ammunition also hes not afraid to use them theres no period of darkness in which we can surprise him as for the men theyre well fed and for the first time for days they feel secure when supplies get short and they get desperate then we can rush bland perhaps it is too late then gerda said this berg may break out of the pack in the next storm then bland will get away in one of the boats and stove in the rest his one chance is to be the sole survivor it was almost as though howe were speaking through her but he remained huddled in his blankets sucking at his swollen lips well just have to wait i answered stubbornly dont worry time and the ice will wear him down anyway im not risking anyones life my own included in some premature attempt to regain control of the stores i suggest you all get some sleep now and i rolled over in my blankets gerda stayed talking to howe for some time then she left and there was silence in the tent a silence that was dominated all the time by the grinding and crashing of the bergs advance through the pack a violent pandemonium of sound that was paralleled by a constant quivering of the berg itself a quivering that was felt through the whole body as one lay on the ice floor of the ledge and then howe produced an iron stanchion and with a file began working away at the tip of it the rasp of the file and the grinding of the ice seemed to tear at my nerves as i fell asleep i wont attempt to give a daytoday account of our sojourn on the iceberg one day was very much like another varying only in the intensity of cold and the strength and direction of the wind for myself it was a period of loneliness and waiting technically i was in command but it was not an easy command the men of hval were all right i held them through gerda but with the others it was different even to the tauer iii men whom i had commanded on the run out from capetown i was an outsider only the fact that they were tonsberg men and believed what judie had told them about her fathers death kept them with us tempering every decision was the fear that some of these men might break away and join bland this became increasingly a source of worry as elands ration issue became less and the monotony of our existence grew bland had the boats and stores they represented hope and a full belly the men knew from bonomi that in blands camp food and tobacco were plentiful and once the men started to break away it would become a stampede orders became little more than requests and all the time judie kept to her tent and refused to speak to me i worried about judie a lot i worried about howe too he took no interest in the work of the camp and made no effort to help he hardly stirred from the tent he was morose and silent seemingly occupied with his own thoughts and all the time he whittled away at the iron working the end to a point with a double edge like a spear the grating of the file seemed to rasp at my nerves till i could stand it no longer for gods sake i snapped at him stop it do you hear he stared at me sullenly and went on working at the tip of it mcphee rolled over in his blankets snatched the stanchion from him and flung it out of the tent noo will ye let us get some sleep ye crazy loon howe said nothing but later that night i woke to the rasp of the file i cursed him then spending all my pentup anger on him he let me go on shouting at him and when i had finished he said quietly what would you do if bland had killed your father and then as though hed been bottling it all up inside him he started to tell me about nordahl how hed come to see him at newcastle how hed bought him a boat when he was twenyone how hed taken him out to grytviken for a season if id been his legitimate son he couldnt have done more for me and then after the war he gave me this job do you think i dont know what i have to do and id have done it too id have done it by now if it hadnt been for vaksdal id have shot him dead here on this ledge but vaksdal had to interfere damn his bloody hide why did he have to stop me why didnt he let me do it then his voice had risen now i had him id only to pull the trigger bland would have been dead by now if it hadnt been for vaksdal vaksdal deserves to die if i cant kill bland without vaksdal then ill there was a muttered curse and mcphee sat up will ye shut up for christs sake i tell you ill kill them both if i have to ill kill them all if they shut up do ye hear but howes voice went on and on talking about killing eternally talking about killing i fell asleep to the drone of his voice and woke in the morning to the rasp of the file it was enough to drive a man crazy i told gerda what he was up to but whenever she came into the tent he hid the stanchion under his blankets when she asked about it his face puckered up like a kid about to cry he hadnt wanted her to know i saw that at once saw the struggle going on inside him between his love of her and the need to justify his existence by avenging the one man hed loved he wasnt really sane every flicker of emotion was mirrored instantly in his features and when gerda took the wretched thing away from him he behaved like a kid whose favourite toy has been confiscated he had it back by evening and was filing at it with desperate energy till the rasp of it drove us nearly crazy and mcphee tore the iron out of his hands and flung it out over the ledge on to the ice below howe burst into tears then but by next day he was at work on another stanchion by then we were too tired to care and the rasp of the file seemed to merge with the grinding of the ice as we fell asleep in a coma of exhaustion it was on the th february that we established ourselves on the iceberg a period of fairly good weather followed and to keep the men constructively occupied and to give them some constant glimmer of hope however slight i set them to work cutting steps in the side of the berg we maintained a constant watch and each day this lookout was posted higher and higher as we laboriously cut our way upwards until at last our lookout post was on the flat top of the berg this was at about feet above the pack we did not attempt to climb the pinnacle which rose another fifty feet it would have been of little use to us had we done so for we experienced almost constant low cloud and more often than not the pinnacle was lost in a swirling mist on rd february shortly before midday i was dragged from my tent by an excited lookout there is smoke hr kaptein he said where i asked vestover was his reply i climbed the hundred and fortyseven steps to the lookout and there just to the south of west was a great column of smoke it could have been frostsmoke but the sea was freezing over now wherever it was exposed to the atmosphere for any length of time and all day the column of smoke continued to rise from the same spot and that night when the sun dipped just below the horizon we could see a red glow under the smoke the whole camp was in an uproar of excitement the sudden thought of rescue was in everyones mind it was a hard thing for me to have to tell them that the only thing it could possibly be was the crew of the southern cross igniting the oil they had pumped out of the ship as a guiding beacon to the rescue ships but even that didnt damp their spirits if the survivors of the southern cross had decided to make a signal then it must surely mean that there were rescue ships in the vicinity for two days everyone was cheerful and the talk was all of rescue then the gale hit us it came up out of the southwest and flung itself on us with a banshee howl that drowned the constant thunder of the breaking ice seeming to pin us by its very weight to the ice walls of the berg when the storm broke our ledge was facing straight into it our situation would have been bad enough down on the ice but up there on an exposed ledge we got the full force of the wind and with the wind came sleet and snow it was terrifying the bitter cold and the constant noise the inability to breathe outside our tents and the lack of hot food it sapped our strength and damped our spirits no one spoke of rescue any more in fact we hardly spoke at all we were glued to the face of the berg by the weight of the wind like flies on a flypaper and the snow piled up round us and froze so that there was no longer a ledge drawing rations from bland each day became a major expedition we lost a man during this storm he went out with two others and never returned they were tauer iii men all of them and though i questioned them later i never really got to the bottom of it they admitted to going down to the lower camp to scrounge extra rations from bland but they wouldnt say any more i think what really happened was that they went down there with the intention of deserting our camp for elands only to find that bland didnt want them that one of them disappeared over the edge was i believe an accident it was easy enough to slip over in those conditions and whenever a party went down to draw rations i insisted on them being roped at any rate the two who came back suddenly became violently antibland and infected their whole tent for six days we lay in a coma of cold and hunger hardly daring to go out the tents overcrowded insanitary and wholly covered by a mixture of snow and ice on the sixth day all was suddenly quiet the wind had gone and on that day the men led by the two survivors of that trip to the lower camp complained to me about the amount of rations bland had issued they were getting desperate bonomi had told them that food was still plentiful in the lower camp i said id go down and talk to bland himself howe dragged me aside then this is what weve been waiting for he said but i knew what that would mean if we led them amok like that i said theyd pillage the stores three men eating well doesnt make much of a hole in rations being doled out for over forty its the chance weve been waiting for he insisted his eyes were sunk deep in their sockets and feverishly bright no i said i went down the ledge before he could argue further bonomi was standing by the barricade of frozen snow that marked the boundary between the two camps i called to him i want to speak to bland i said he put his finger to his lips i wish to speak with you well what is it i asked i didnt want to talk to him i felt he was a toady and he looked sleek and well fed by comparison with the wraithlike figures who had crowded round me a moment ago demanding more food i wish you to know that bland is becoming frightened he said all the time i am telling him the men are getting desperate and how they believe he killed nordahl and rammed your ship at first he would tell me to shut up once he strike me in anger now he sits morose and uneasy and all the time i am telling him how desperate the men are become i do not think he sleep well any more is this true bonomi i demanded madonna mia do i trouble to tell it to you if it is not true i tell you he is becoming desperate he is hoping all the time that the iceberg break out of the pack the storm makes him hopeful but now he no longer have any hope of that i think he abandon the camp soon there is only twentyfive more days of food left and he does not dare to reduce the rations any more go and tell him i want a word with him i ordered he hesitated looking a little crestfallen i think he had expected me to congratulate him on his machiavellian campaign perhaps i should have for when bland came up the slope towards me i saw his confidence was broken he looked well fed but his eyes were sunk into their sockets and his body seemed slack his gaze did not easily meet mine well he said with an attempt at selfassurance the men are complaining about the rations i said let them complain he said theres no rationing i believe down in your camp i accused him angrily why should there be he answered they made the choice theyre getting desperate i told him if youre not careful theyll rush the stores you know what that means dont you bland he passed his tongue quickly over his chapped lips ill shoot anyone who attempts to rush us tell them that craig and tell them also that its not my fault were short of food theyll believe that when they know that youre on the same scale of rations as they are i answered how many days supply is left bonomi says only twentyfive damn that little bastard he muttered he talks too much is that correct bland yes theyll get the present scale of rations for twentyfive more days thats all tell them that i made a quick mental calculation of the quantity of food four men unrationed would consume in that period i want thirty days rations for my men three boats together with our full share of stores and navigating equipment by nightfall i said he stared at me and i saw he was scared at my tone if youre not careful craig ill cut off rations completely if what ive asked for isnt ready at this barrier by hours tonight i wont answer for the consequences thats an ultimatum i added and left him to think over what id said if bonomi had told the truth and it certainly looked like it from blands manner then hed do as id demanded i told the men what id done for the first time in days i saw them grinning but it doesnt mean the end of rationing i warned them it just means that we shall control our own rationing the men gathered in hungry groups at the snow barrier i saw bland watching them uneasily just after midday the men cheered down in the lower camp blands two mates and bonomi had started humping stores bland himself kept guard with his rifle we broke down the snow barrier and boats and stores were run into the upper camp i put mcphee in charge of stores and gerda in charge of food without gerda i think the men would have broken into the food in one glorious orgy we were all desperately hungry the end of the month came and went with only the entries in my log to mark the passage of time there was a period of darkness at night now and each day this period lengthened with amazing rapidity but though the weather was calmer in ten days i only managed to shoot the sun once my calculations gave me a position of s w just about miles nornoreast of the position at which we had abandoned hval it gives some idea of the rate of drift all this time howe had been working away at his stanchion working secretly for fear that mcphee would send it flying over the edge after the other one every time either of us or gerda came into the tent he hid it from us and lay there feeling it with his hand watching us with a guilty smile on his face apart from this and our general situation judie was a source of worry her attitude was an additional weight on my mind so that i found it very hard to shake off the increasing periods of depression she hadnt spoken to me since the day we had reached the ledge she seemed to have withdrawn into herself into a state of more or less blank misery gerda told me that she sometimes wake up in the night to find her crying and murmuring her fathers name you must do something gerda said to me one day if you do not i think she will just fade away that was on th march i went to judies tent and tried to speak to her she looked very pale and thin and her eyes were huge in their sunken sockets she stared at me without a word as though she didnt recognize me i told gerda to feed her some of the precious meat extract that had been included amongst the rations bland had handed over to us i left the tent in a mood of utter despair that was the day the aircraft flew over us it was an american plane the star markings plainly visible as it passed over at about feet we had nothing to signal with and half blanketed in snow on the sheer flank of the iceberg it was hardly surprising that they did not see us we piled inflammable stores together and kept constant watch in a fever of excitement and renewed hope two days later we saw another plane away to the south i picked it up in the glasses but it was too far for our smoke to be visible and i would not give the order to ignite our precious reserves of fuel sleet and snow followed and we never saw another glimpse of the search planes the monotony of hunger cold and dying hope settled on the camp once in the middle of the night i was woken by one of the lookouts who told me howe had passed him without a word making for the lower camp we found him halfway down the ledge standing quite still the spearsharp stanchion gripped in his hand he didnt move as i came up to him he seemed lost in his own thoughts and in the cold light of the stars i saw the conflict inside him written on his face he must have been standing there for some time for he was so stiff with cold that he could hardly move he let me take the weapon from him and as i led him back he was crying he would have done no good anyway for i saw a movement down in the lower camp and knew that a guard was posted i called gerda and left him with her there were no storms now just the everlasting glare of low cloud and the nights lengthening with the increasing cold the steadily falling temperature was magnified by lack of food and our decreasing resistance life became a monotony of waiting for the end without hope the men no longer looked hungrily at the lower camp for through bonomi we knew that their ration scale was as low as ours daily i checked the stores and watched our meagre reserves of food dwindle the lookout no longer searched the sky for planes but peered at the ice through eyes inflamed by the constant glare searching for some sign of life seal or penguin anything that would do for food the movement of the berg through the ice gradually slowed everything was much quieter the silence of death seemed to be settling over us no pressure ridges sent their roaring battle challenge thundering over our precarious perch all round us stretched a silent lifeless waste our fuel was almost finished soon we should have nothing hot without any hot drinks life would quickly desert us the th march carries the following entry in my log reduced rations still further grieg dead broken rib probably pierced lung has been weakening for a long time slipped his body over the edge as though burying at sea none of us having the strength to cut a grave in the snow which is hard like ice very cold wind has dropped and iceberg now stationary in pack no hope now of breaking out to open sea i knew it was time for the last desperate effort i had been planning gerda apparently had the same thought she came to my tent next morning as she sat there in the dim light i was surprised to see how much weight she had lost she was almost slim howe was with her thin as a wraith under the bulk of his clothes his ugliness lost in the aesthetic sunken appearance of his features he reminded me somehow of a modern artists impression of christ on the cross duncan it is time we do something gerda said we cannot just stay here waiting for death i nodded ive been thinking the same thing i said anything is better than to die without effort i think soon i go to join my father she paused and then said it is quiet now we can go down on to the ice the southern cross was peraps fifteen not more than twenty miles from us when she sink peraps my father is alive i do not know but i must go and see you realize weve drifted nearly miles from the place where the southern cross went down ja ja but they also will have drifted i think perhaps we do not find them but i must try dont forget weve been on this iceberg i said weve been moving steadily through the pack for days suppose there are some survivors theyll be a lot more than twenty miles away youd never make it youre too weak she shrugged her shoulders i also think they will be a long way away also we cannot be sure in what direction they now are but i must go peraps i am too weak as you say but it is the spirit that is important my spirit is strong i shall go to search for my father there was no point in arguing i could see she had made up her mind and howe i asked her face betrayed no emotion she knew it meant his death he would die first and she would have to watch him die but she never flinched she just said walter comes with me i could see they had been over this together their minds were made up in their faces was a sort of glow of exaltation i almost loved howes ugliness in that moment for he wasnt ugly he was beautiful his spirit purged of all bitterness and cynicism by gerdas love shone through his features and transformed them i lay back not saying anything but going over in my mind something that had been there for a long time at length i sat up i was looking at howe wondering how hed take it hating myself for having to do it walter i said using his christian name for the first time youre not strongphysically whatever your strength of will you know you will die before you reach the position where the southern cross survivors might be you know that dont you his eyes clouded the glow died out of him he knew the drift of my words he nodded slowly and there was a queer resignation in his face it was as though id killed his spirit you think i should say goodbye to gerda here are you prepared to if it would give her a chance of reaching her father and give us all just a chance of preserving life a little longer yes he said his voice scarcely audible i got up then and crawled out of the tent gerda clutching frantically at me pleading to know what i intended to do i think she was a little scared at the thought of making the journey without howe he was now the source of her strength i said wait and called the men together those that could still crawl out of the tents the air was cold and still as they assembled round me you know there is food for only a few days more i said they nodded i checked the stores this morning i went on on your present rations there is food for seventeen more days that is all after that there is nothing we have seen no sign of any living thing in all this time unless we get food and fuel we shall die they stood there dumb stunned by having what they all knew put bluntly to them in words gerda petersen wishes to try and reach the position of the southern cross i went on she wishes to know whether her father is alive she has the right to go if anyone does they growled agreement waiting for me to continue i then told them what i planned to do the southern cross unloaded stores on the ice before she went down i said she had a big cargo of whalemeat this and blubber would have been transferred to the ice if there are any survivors then they will have meat and fuel i intend to try and reach them it is a desperate chance and you must decide whether you agree to my going we have no hope of reaching them in our present condition the party which should consist of three must be properly fed for at least two days that and the rations they will have to take with them will cut your own food supplies by about three days it is up to you to decide whether you wish to take this chance the men nodded and began to talk amongst themselves gerda stepped forward and said whatever you decide i must go i do not need your food the men stared at her then one old man from her fathers ship said we will not let you go without food hval will give you part of their rations the men of her own crew nodded agreement their eyes kindled not by hope but by their sacrifice for something they thought right and good mcphee stepped forward and said will ye tell us sir who yell be taking with ye yes i said kalstad if he agrees to come and then i added before you decide let me warn you that there is little hope in this and we shall almost certainly die on the way but it is a chance and we should take that chance however slight before we are too weak to attempt it i will kom said kalstad good i said and asked the men for their decision they didnt say anything but i saw one of the stewards had gone to prepare a meal they were all grinning excitedly like children they made of their sacrifice a sort of festival they crowded round the cookpot advising offering more food gerda was crying her eyes starry and she went amongst them thanking them kissing them in her excitement and her sense of their innate kindness she thought that they were doing it for her and not for any desperate hope of relief and im not at all sure she wasnt right rough men have a way of showing their love with inordinate sacrifice and there wasnt a man who hadnt gained strength and courage from her indomitable cheerfulness so it was arranged and for two days the three of us fed like fighting cocks i could literally feel the strength flowing back into me it coursed with the blood through my veins depression was thrown off i even had some hope and the cold receded kalstad grew taller and more cheerful and as we were fed up the rest of the men seemed to shrink into sunkeneyed ghosts by comparison the air of cheerfulness was kept up at a forced and artificial level as the men crowded round us to watch us eat trying desperately to hide the hunger fever in their eyes and the saliva that drooled from their lips at the sight of so much food on the evening of the first day on full rations something happened which should have warned me what bland was planning bonomi came into our camp and asked to speak to me he looked shrunken and cold and very frightened he pleaded to come and join our camp they eat everything he cried wildly he was almost in tears of selfpity they will give me nothing and they eat and eat soon there is nothing left i am ungry and i do not wish to be cook to them no more thats a matter for you to sort out with bland i said youve done pretty well out of being their cook so far si si but now they will give me nothing nothing i tell you better go and talk to bland he holds your rations but he will give me nothing its a matter between you and bland i repeated go and sort it out with him i am afraid i was rather brusque my mind was on more vital things than bonomis rations that morning we completed the building of a really good light sledge we turned in at midday and the evening meal was served to us in our blanket sleepingbags one more day at iceberg camp then we should be out on our own trekking across illimitable wastes of ice searching for the southern cross camp we didnt know where it was we didnt even know whether it existed we should just have to go on and on until the end came it was a frightening thought more frightening now that our bellies were full and we had the energy to hope the three of us were together now in my tent and we talked interminably of the best possible route little knowing that the route would be chosen for us i was wakened very early the following morning by somebody shaking me and calling my name for a moment i thought it was time for us to leave but then i realized that it was not until the next day the nd that we were starting out i opened my eyes to find bonomi bending over me capitano capitano they ave gone they ave gone and they ave leave me nothing nothing at all he was excited and scared i sat up whos gone what are you talking about i demanded bland he cried bland is gone and he take all the rations everything he is down on the ice he and vaksdal and keller come and see if you do not believe i crawled out of my tent and stood in the cold stillness of the ledge shielding my eyes from the glare and trying to see what bonomi was pointing to it was an incredible morning the sun was a bloodred orange away to the northeast the sky a sort of greeny blue and all the ice was tinged with silken pink like a damask quilt there do you see i followed bonomis pointing finger and saw three figures moving across the ice three tiny figures dragging a sledge they had their back to the sun and they were headed towards the position where the southern cross might be expected to be i ought to have realized what it had meant when bonomi had said that bland and the two mates were eating full rations bland had finally despaired of the iceberg breaking through to the sea and had started westward in search of the southern cross camp or the rescue ships which might still be searching on the edge of the pack bonomis excitement had roused the camp one by one the men stumbled out into the satinpink morning and stared at the three figures moving slowly across the ice below i remember one man said i think perhaps you do not go now kaptein they have more food those three if anyone reach the southern cross camp they will there is good hope now howe heard him and he said if bland reaches the southern cross camp no rescue party will come here hes gambling on being a sole survivor thats the only way he can save himself from being hanged for murder he turned to me craig he said youve just got to get there dont let him beat you on the last stretch you and gerda have got to reach the southern cross camp it meant that we should have to follow elands tracks i had no illusions about the man somewhere along the route he would abandon vaksdal and keller and if he did reach the southern cross camp and we didnt then thered be no rescue party for the survivors on the iceberg the three of us remained in the tent all day conserving our energies and eating enormously wed talk over our prospects possible routes what would happen if we caught up with bland then wed drowse only to start talking about the same things as soon as we woke lying there warm and well fed the iceberg assumed the friendliness of a home in contrast the trek that was to begin next day seemed more and more frightening that night shortly after our evening meal the flap of the tent was pulled back and judies voice very low almost scared said can i come in a moment duncan she crawled in caught hold of my hand and fell sobbing into my arms her cold cheek against mine her body trembling at length she said i have been so stupid all this time i have wasted it lying in my tent being miserable and now she kissed me and lay close against me quietly crying it was as though elands departure had freed her from the thing that had lain so heavy on her mind at length she said you must sleep now i shant watch you leave tomorrow ill say goodbye here she kissed me her fingers caressing my beard then she said i dont think we shall meet again duncan not in this world will you please remember that i love you always and ill be with you out there if it helps she stretched her hand across to gerda goodbye gerda she said i wish i were coming with you to find my father she kissed gerda the she kissed me again the flap of the tent dropped back she was gone and id only the salt of her tears on my face to remind me she had been in the tent gerda touched my hand you must get through duncan for her you must go on whatever happens you understand i didnt say anything i understood what she meant decisions like that couldnt be taken in the comfort of a full stomach and a warm tent that was for the next day and the days and days of weary ice that lay ahead chapter x next morning as soon as it was light we started out we carried food for six days a little tobacco a pair of skis one length of rope a small primus with a little fuel tent blanket sleepingbags and a change of clothes all this was piled on one sledge the morning was very still and our breath hung round us like a cloud of steam the sun came up as we went down the ledge and the world turned gold with an orange band along the horizon most of the men turned out to see us off they came with us as far as the bottom of the ledge and a ragged cheer went up as we lowered ourselves on to the broken surface of the pack ice our sledge was lowered after us and then mcphee who had climbed down with us to help get the sledge on to the ice gripped my hand good luck sir he said well be back with whalemeat within a fortnight i said i spoke loudly and with confidence i did not feel in order to encourage the men if were not back by then i said to him privately do the best you can poor devil it was a rotten job id given him gerda said i should have put mueller the second mate of hval in charge but i didnt know mueller i did know mcphee he was an engineer not a whaler but he had all the tenacity of the scot and i knew he could be relied on to the bitter end och yell find em he said dinna worry aboot us maybe the berg will break out into the open sea yet i clapped him on the shoulder and picked up the sledge ropes gerda was saying a last farewell to howe whod scrambled down beside us kalstad and i started out with the sledge along the track that bland and his party had blazed howe called after me craig youve got to get through if bland gets through alone he didnt finish but i knew what was in his mind i waved my hand in acknowledgement and kalstad and i began to wind our way through the hummocks of snowcovered ice gerda caught us up and in a moment the three of us were swallowed into a strange world of ice an iridescent fairyland of golden silence as we wound our way through the great humps of ice we caught occasional glimpses of the iceberg with dark figures moving back up to the ledge to the tents that showed black against the green of the ice as yet untouched by the sun once i saw a figure i thought was judie waving to me i waved back and then turned my face resolutely to the west it was surprising how quickly the iceberg was lost to view in that broken plain i am familiar as ive no doubt you are with the great ice treks of polar exploration pearys sledge run to the north pole scott and shackletons desperate struggles and amundsens great dash to the south in execution and design our trek across the ice was in no way comparable i realize that but in fairness to my companions both of whom are dead i must make it clear that what we suffered was little short of what the great explorers suffered in the most desperate of their journeys we had no dogs no special equipment no finely designed sledges or proper clothing not even real tents and we were weakened by exposure and starvation before we started we werent explorers and therefore we had no great goal to lift our morale and keep us struggling forward we were shipwrecked sailors with shipboard clothes and sledges made out of bits of packing cases an old piece of canvas for a tent and short rations our only goal was to save our own lives and those of the men wed left behind on the iceberg we were going to try and find the survivors of a ship we werent sure whether there were any survivors and we werent sure of the position in which it had gone down in fact we were on a forlorn hope a last desperate bid for life in which i dont think any of us really believed finally there were none of the smooth miles of snow to be found on the ross barrier or the high land in towards the south pole true it was not so cold and the blizzards not so severe but winter was coming on and it was cold enough in our weakened condition and the area across which we were trekking was the area through which our own iceberg had smashed its way leaving chaos in its wake an area of jumbled broken jagged ice in which every step forward was a struggle the skis were useless we trekked on foot one of the party pathfinding the two others following dragging the sledge but though we had soon lost sight of the iceberg owing to the broken nature of the pack i remember the bitter disappointment i felt when on pitching camp that night i climbed to the top of an ice hummock and saw berg and ledge picked out clearly in the pink of the setting sun it was like a fairy castle and seemed so near that i had only to stretch out my hand to touch it i could even see the camp and figures moving about it gerda had some sort of a hot stew ready by the time i returned to my tent we ate it hurriedly and turned in taking our boots into our sleepingbags with us to prevent them from becoming frozen in four days trekking fourteen hours a day we made about thirty miles it doesnt sound much but though the weather was good the going was incredibly bad we were trekking back over the pack through which the icebergs had ploughed their way it was as though an earthquake had thrown the floes in all directions in addition the snow which half covered this fantastic litter of ice was partly thawed particularly at midday and time and again the pathfinder was only saved by the rope also of course we were weak after our long period of malnutrition exposure and inactivity i doubt whether we would have made thirty miles in four days if we hadnt been following the tracks of elands sledge it was strange those sledge tracks at first we had regarded bland as the enemy something to be beaten in addition to the ice we followed the sledge tracks for convenience knowing we could leave them when it suited us or when our planned route lay away from his but as we trekked on and on those tracks gradually ceased to be hostile wed no gun if we caught up with bland he could kill us if he wanted to and if there was any chance of reaching the southern cross survivors or being rescued by the search ships i knew that that was what he would do just as he would have to get rid of his two companions and yet though we never actually mentioned it im certain none of us after the first few days would have thought of turning aside from the tracks and striking out on our own with hard frosts and clear skies the tracks remained as sharp and clear as when they were made and as exhaustion gripped us they became our only friends in that white wilderness those two lines ran out endlessly ahead of us our only contact with other human beings soon we were following them blindly not caring where they led buoyed up by the constant hope that somewhere ahead of us round the next ice hillock over the next limit of our horizon they would connect us with the outside world on the fourth day gerda began to show signs of weakening kalstad was limping from a swollen ankle and i was beginning to feel the stabbing pain in my chest again we made little more than two miles that day the snow having softened with the result that we sank through the honeycombed ice we nearly lost the sledge in a crevasse in a strange land of cold green caverns draped with almost golden icicles we pitched camp up to that time i think we had been going faster than bland for early that morning we had passed his fourth camp site it makes a lot of difference in the conditions we were experiencing if someone has blazed the trail for you but we were pretty depressed that night the only thing that encouraged us was that from the top of an upturned floe we had seen a dark line along the western horizon that looked as though it might be a watersky indicating open sea ahead but how far ahead it might be forty miles and we knew we could not do very much more next day gerda was weaker she showed signs of dysentery kalstad and i were also suffering from diarrhoea and beginning to weaken also the constant glare without sun goggles was inflaming our eyes so that it was difficult to see the snow held crisp that day and we pressed on fast using up in savage effort the last reserves of energy it was the first day of good going and we had to take advantage of it by midday i think we had made as much as ten or eleven miles i know that when i climbed to the top of a hillock of snowcovered ice and looked back i could only just see the tips of the icebergs on the horizon to the east of us they were all ships sailing in a line on the horizons glare insubstantial mirages that came and went now expanding now contracting only by taking a bearing could i decide which was our own berg after eating a biscuit and two pieces of sugar each we pushed on the sun became a pale disc shining wanly through a curtain of mist the air became colder and the world we moved through lost its colour it was less painful to the eyes but it was also less friendly i think we must have gone on to the limit of endurance and then suddenly we knew we could go no farther and we pitched camp in the stillness of early evening i thought i heard voices imagination plays hellish tricks that night as we lay in the tent gerda whispered duncan it is no good you must leave me behind i remember experiencing a terrible sense of shock i hadnt realized how near the limit of endurance the days trek had brought her i remember i shook my head angrily well go on together i said she caught hold of my arm please she whispered her voice though weak was urgent it was selfish of me to come i should have known i have not a mans strength it is your duty to go on without me i shall hinder you and always you must think of all those peoples on the iceberg well talk about it in the morning i said and i got close against her so that if she moved i should know i was afraid she might walk out into the snow for a long time i lay half awake thinking over what she had said arguing against what i knew was inevitable and at length i shifted my body away from hers and went to sleep it was horrible but i knew she was right too many lives depended on us the fittest must always push on until the very end some time in the night the wind rose and by morning it was blowing a blizzard i looked out of a corner of the tent into a grey swirling void then i turned quickly to see if gerda were still there she was thank god for we could not move and the enforced rest might enable her to make another days march for three days the blizzard continued and in those three days we finished all our food with the exception of five biscuits and fifteen lumps of sugar the tent was in perpetual darkness it was like being buried alive we used an old biscuit tin as a bedpan and just lay listlessly in our sleepingbags never stirring except to turn over to relieve the aching stiffness of our limbs the night it stopped we smoked our last cigarette in the grey light of morning i wrote in my log there is now no hope and no reason to go on the others i think realize this now i shall not abandon gerda there is no point we made an early start wishing to take full advantage of what little energy we had been able to store up by lying still for the first time there were no sledge tracks running out ahead of us the snow was feet deep i made gerda put on the skis the snow was crisp and fairly firm and we moved off with a feeling almost of cheerfulness and round the first snow hillock we came upon the trampled snow of a camp it had been evacuated that morning for beyond the camp sledge and ski tracks marked the new snow stretching out ahead of us again and disappearing round the cornice of blue snowfree ice bland gerda asked as she stopped beside me i nodded so i really had heard voices that night the blizzard started it was incredible for three days wed been camped within a hundred yards of bland and his party and not known it theyre probably not more than an hour ahead of us i said what will happen when we catch them up i dont know i answered her i dont think it matters much i didnt think there was much chance of our catching up with them there were three of them to pull the sledge and both bland and vaksdal were big men perhaps we should strike away from their tracks she suggested but i shook my head theyre travelling roughly in the direction we decided on the going is easier for us if we follow their tracks so we went on following the sledge marks through the fresh snow kalstad and i pulled the sledge and gerda kept up with us easily on the skis for two or three hours we made good progress but about midday the sun came through the glare was frightful and soon the snow began to soften and the going became harder as our boots broke through the surface crust in some of the drifts we struggled forward through sifting snow that was well over our knees and had the consistency of rice grain it took too much of our small reserve of energy and i made camp when darkness fell the stars came out in a clear frozen night it was terribly cold and none of us slept very well the cold seemed to eat our undernourished bodies gerda suffered agonies of pain in her stomach and kalstad complained of frostbite due to the fact that his boots worn by the ice were no longer watertight the next morning was cold and cheerless with low cloud and a biting wind out of the south we were late in starting gerda had no energy no desire to move also she had left her boots outside her sleepingbag and they were frozen stiff so that she could not put them on until we had softened the leather over the primus when we did start we made good progress for the cold wind had frozen the thawed snow of the previous day into an icehard crust ahead of us elands sledge tracks unwound steadily like a snaking line meandering through the snow hills of the churnedup pack soon we kom to their camp i think ja kalstad was right the snow hills gradually flattened out until finally we emerged into an almost flat desert of white where the pack had had time to settle before becoming frozen solid and in this dead plain we saw the sledge tracks running straight like parallel lines drawn by a ruler to a black patch that is their camp kalstad shouted to me and they are still there i see some peoples moving i screwed up my eyes trying to concentrate sufficiently on my vision to produce a clear picture but the throbbing pain at the back of my eyeballs obscured my sight ah i could see was a dark patch in the virgin white of the snow a patch that danced and wavered i dont know why we pressed on so hard then we didnt really want to join up with bland it wouldnt help us and yet the mere thought of contact with other human beings in that grim waste of frozen snow spurred us forward your eyes are better than mine kalstad i said are they striking camp i think so he replied ja there is no tent and a moment later he said in a puzzled tone i do not see more than two people only two i screwed up my eyes in an agony of concentration the dark patch in the snow wavered and separated into two figures there seemed to be nothing else but those two men we threw ourselves on the sledge ropes i think we were both in a panic that it would prove to be a mirage that the two dots that looked so like human beings would vanish and the snow demons would laugh at us in the howl of the wind and then faint across the frozen waste came a hail in norwegian we could see the two figures waving to us now we shouted back and ran slithering on the icehard snow towards them kalstad was limping badly yet for a brief spell we must have been going forward at a good three miles an hour it is vaksdal and keller kalstad gasped no sign of bland i asked him nei nei only vaksdal and keller they came out to meet us shouting and cheering and waving their arms but when they were about a hundred yards from us they stopped and were suddenly silent we dragged the sledge up to them exhausted gasping for breath they made no move to help us they just stood and stared at us dumbly vaksdal looked thinner and gaunter and he had no boots on keller also had no boots he had a knife and a piece of leather in his hand wheres bland i gasped dropping the sledge rope and staggering slightly now that the impetus of moving forward no longer held me in a straight line bland vaksdals eyes suddenly blazed from their deep sockets he is gone on we thought you were a rescue party who have found our sledge tracks how much food do you have none i said a few pieces of sugar and a biscuit or two i sat down on the sledge now that id stopped exhaustion was taking hold of me i just wanted to lie down and sleep god how sleepy i was and the cold drove right through me what did you say about bland i asked trying to concentrate my mind hes gone vaksdals voice was angry you are right hr kaptein you are all right and keller and i are fools he is left us this morning we wake to find the wind blowing on us and bland pulling the sledge out of the camp with the tent thrown on top of it we shout to him and he just laugh at us we start to follow but he has take our boots my gun is gone but keller has his inside his blankets he try to shoot then but bland is too far we have nothing no tent no food no boots nothing the bastard have left us to die so it had happened just as howe said it would hed used them as pack mules and when they were nearly fifty miles from the iceberg and there was a chance of reaching open water and rescue hed abandoned them hed chosen a lone death just as he had when hed stayed behind at the tauer iii camp in order to have the faint chance of coming out alive as the sole survivor how much food had he i asked vaksdal for one man perhaps three of four days but very little you understand and hes weak ja too weak to pull the sledge alone for very far all right i said start pitching camp kalstad the skis that was the answer i turned to speak to gerda but she wasnt there i looked back along the line of the sledge track gerda was lying in the snow several hundred yards behind us i unstrapped our gear and cleared it from the sledge then kalstad and i started back i dont think i knew how exhausted we were until i turned back for gerda it was only about three hundred yards but it seemed miles that we dragged this empty sledge before we reached her crumpled figure lying face down in the snow she was alive i could see that by the way her breath had thawed the snow around her nostrils but she was quite unconscious it was as much as the two of us could manage to lift her body on to the sledge her weight made a vast difference and i thought wed never reach the spot where id offloaded our gear i dont think wed have got her there but for the fact that vaksdal and keller came out to help us we set up camp then and got some water boiling and made some beef tea gerdas return to consciousness was slow the beef tea she retched up but i managed to get a little of our precious brandy down her throat and when she could speak she kept on saying you must leave me now duncan you must go on her voice was so urgent that she exhausted herself to keep her quiet i told her how bland had abandoned his two companions and gone on alone with all their stores she didnt say anything when id finished but just lay with her eyes closed her face grey and puffy i thought she hadnt heard then her hand touched my arm one of you must go on she whispered faintly take the skis and go on he must not get out alone there are all those men on the iceberg i said dont worry one of us will go on she seemed to relax then and i think she went to sleep kalstad pulled at my arm her spirit has outrun her body i think he said she is like a horse who is too willing he was telling me she was going to die i felt the tears at the back of my eyes i should have known how terribly driven she had been to keep up with us and not be a burden and still she had had energy to think of us and of those others back on that ledge i crawled out of the tent one of us must go after bland i thought immediately of vaksdal he was the strongest and he could be trusted now that he knew the sort of man bland was anger at being abandoned to die like that would spur him on but when i began to organize the thing i soon discovered that in removing their boots bland had as effectually stopped them following him as if hed shot them down as they lay in the snow whoever went after bland must go on ski and that meant wellfitting boots kalstads feet and mine were much smaller than vaksdals or kellers to loan them our boots was therefore out of the question the choice lay then between kalstad and myself and kalstad was suffering from frostbite there was nothing for it i should have to take what little rations remained and go on myself get your rifle keller i said and some ammunition i packed a rucksack and when i was all ready to go i crawled into the tent i dont know whether gerda was asleep or unconscious she was quite still and her eyes were closed i bent and kissed her she moved slightly perhaps she knew id kissed her at any rate im glad i did and i hope she knew knew that i was saluting a very brave woman i went out into the biting cold of the wind then kalstad helped me to fix the skis i slung kellers rifle over my shoulder then kalstad lifted the rucksack on to my shoulders the rucksack that contained for him all that was left of life i was leaving them nothing but the remains of the beef extract and the primus with the last of the fuel he clapped me on the back and said good luck hr kaptein i gripped his hand vaksdal and keller looked on sullen and morose since the discovery that we were not a rescue party and had virtually no food they had been in a state of miserable despair not even the fact that i was going out after bland had stirred them you are in command now kalstad i said look after gerda petersen i turned then and set out along the track of blands sledge i didnt look back i didnt want to be reminded of the pathetic loneliness of that last camp gerda and the rest would die there and somewhere out along the sledge track i was following i too should die i kept my eyes on those rulerstraight tracks and concentrated on the thought of vengeance christian teaching would say it is a bad thing to go out to your death with only the thought of vengeance in your mind i can only say this that it was through that thought of vengeance that i achieved the strength to go on it gave me a purpose i no longer had any hope of finding the southern cross camp or even any hope that there was such a camp i was gong out to kill the man who had brought about all our deaths who had killed judies father rammed my ship and abandoned his two companions i didnt stop to think that if there was no chance of him being rescued then the ice and snow would do the job for me i just knew i had to kill bland with my own hands that alone in my mind would justify my existence in that moment and that alone gave me strength it was surprising how much easier and quicker i found it travelling on skis the surface of the snow was crisp and firm the skis slid forward with a crunching hiss and only the constant driving of arms on sticks was tiring and the going was over flat snowcovered ice in places it was ridged like the sea and here i had difficulty until i learnt to control my legs for its extraordinary how in the unending white of limitless snow it is impossible for the eyes to differentiate between an undulating and a flat surface bland had i reckoned a threehour start of me i had left the others shortly after midday presuming that i could travel twice as fast as a man dragging a sledge i should be up with him about three in the afternoon i had therefore only a few hours margin of daylight if i wasnt in possession of elands tent by nightfall then i should never see another day a night in the open would kill me i dont think i really thought about this but it was there at the back of my mind a spur to my body for i knew that if i were to achieve my purpose it must be done before nightfall ahead of me the sky was dark like the beginning of night in contrast the low cloud behind me seemed dazzlingly white the world was flat flat like the western desert but white blindingly eyesearingly white and as i slid through this unending world of snow the surface began to change there were crevasses under the surface without the skis i could not have gone a mile the snow bridged innumerable gaps and i heard it crumble as i slid across then i was in an area of open fissures gaps too wide for the snow to bridge the sledge tracks began to wind between these crevasses and in one place i saw bland had had trouble getting his sledge across where the snow had crumbled into a gap it was shortly after two that i saw the first open water in weeks it was like a black lake and clotted thick with brash ice i pressed on faster now drawing on my last reserves of energy darkness was not far off and the patches of open water that were beginning to appear suggested we were nearing the edge of the pack bland had food for four days there was still just a chance and this ray of hope seemed to revitalize me i wasnt far out in my reckonings for it was just after three when i sighted a small black dot moving ahead of me for some time the sledge tracks had been winding amongst black pools of halffrozen brash towards a small berg caught in the pack and it was against the sheer green slope of this berg that the figure showed like a small dot dancing in the white void it was painful to try and keep my eyes on it and dangerous because it tended to make me lose my balance after id had one fall through not watching my skis and had got up again with great difficulty i ceased to worry about the mark ahead and concentrated on skiing as fast as possible when i looked again the berg was much nearer but there was no sign of bland presumably hed passed behind it or had he seen me was he lying in wait i left his tracks and circled away to the north of the berg i soon caught sight of him then not half a mile away and moving along the flank of the berg which was a long one between us the snow lay flat like a sheet of white i drove my sticks into it thrusting forward on a line that would converge with bland he had almost reached the end of the berg when he saw me he stopped and then his voice reached me on the cold wind he was shouting to me and waving his sticks just as his companions had done he thought i was part of a rescue party i unslung my rifle then cocked it and slithered forward with the ski sticks looped over one wrist now that the moment had come i found my heart hammering wildly i fought to steady myself as i went forward something in the way i moved towards him must have warned him for he suddenly stopped shouting and stood quite still staring at me as i advanced on him i was getting close now and though the snowglare made it difficult for me to see he was outlined against the final shoulder of the berg and a good target but i was taking no chances i closed him steadily just as i would have done an enemy ship who are you his hail came to me quite clearly and i realized i was getting into the shelter of the berg craig i yelled back and there was an exultant feeling inside me and i saw him stare at me for a moment and then dive for the sledge and his gun but he didnt get up again and a moment later the thin crack of a shot sounded across the snow he was firing from the shelter of the sledge i turned then and circled to the west of him cutting off his line of advance and reaching the shelter of the western end of the berg he fired at me several times before i was out of sight but i was a moving target and his bullets vanished into space the snow was heaped in fantastic shapes round the berg and i moved steadily through the sheltering hummocks towards the final shoulder and here round the corner of a hollowed cliff that gaped with green jaws filled with the white teeth of icicles i saw blands sledge deserted in the snow he was in the cover of the broken ice close in to the bergs flank i crept slowly forward there was the crack of a shot and a puff of ice in my face i felt blood flowing from a cut i brushed it away and raised my gun i could see him now peering from behind a fluted column of ice his gun raised i was just about to fire when i saw something moving behind him it was travelling fast across the snow with a strange undulating movement like a wellsprung sleigh it was a big ungainly animal tawnycoloured with brown spots and although id never seen one before i knew what it was it was a sealeopard after the killer whale the most dangerous inhabitant of the antarctic bland must have seen it at the same time for his gun swung away from me and i heard the sharp crackcrack as he fired the huge beast did not check he fired once more at pointblank range and then it was on him he staggered as he was borne back and then he fell with the beast on top of him i went towards him as quickly as i could over the uneven surface blood was staining the snow crimson at his side i saw the beast move jerking as though injured from a range of a few yards i pumped a whole magazine into it i went forward then the beast was quite still lying across blands legs i saw bland move trying to free himself he still had his rifle gripped in his hands and he was trying to work the bolt i tore it from his grasp and threw it clear of us then i saw that the huge brutes jaws were dripping blood and there was a terrible wound in blands side he started to say something then he lost consciousness looking down at him with the big carcase of the sealeopard stretched across his legs i suddenly realized what this meant it was the end of bland and for us new hope here stretched dead at my feet was thousands of pounds of fresh meat and blubber here was life for gerda and hope for the future somehow id got to go back go back along those weary miles loaded with meat and fat i got blands sledge and dragged it up close to his body as soon as i had erected the tent i dug blands legs out from under the sealeopard and got him onto it then when i had bandaged him as best i could i got to work with my knife and soon i had a blubber stove warming the tent and big steaks of jucy meat grilling in the smoke bland couldnt eat but i managed to feed him some of the hot blood meantime i ate more in a few minutes than id eaten in as many days the blood seemed to give bland strength for once he shifted his position and asked who had left the iceberg with me when i told him he grinned and said now we can all die in the snow together he seemed to relapse into unconsciousness then and i lay wrapped in a blanket unable to sleep for the gripping pains in my stomach caused by unaccustomed food in the darkness of the night i awoke suddenly with a feeling of being choked i sat up gasping for breath and racked by violent coughing i didnt know what had happened for a moment then i realized that the tent was filled with smoke i turned towards bland and found he wasnt there through streaming eyes i saw an orange glow against the canvas of the tent i crawled out flames were leaping up out of the snow licking over the body of the sealeopard reaching out with windfanned fingers towards the fabric of the tent which was already blackened and charred at one side bland lay in the middle of the flames his face buried in the smouldering carcase the snow steaming and beginning to form in crimson pools i pulled bland clear and scooped up armfuls of snow throwing it over the flames till they were completely smothered under a white drift at first i thought bland had tried to stop the fire but as i was smothering it i saw an empty kerosene container and the primus with the stopper of its tank unscrewed lying in the snow i knew then that hed started the fire started it in order to burn the carcase burn the tent with me in it both pairs of skis had been thrust well into the blaze and had been badly charred when the fire was out at last i crawled exhausted back into the tent to this day i dont know whether bland was dead when i dragged him clear of the fire hed made all i know is that he was dead and frozen stiff when i went outside the tent in the morning for all i know i killed him by leaving him out there but i dont care i only know i was glad to find him dead fortunately id saved the skis in time they were charred but they were still usable i cooked myself a meal then i covered bland with some snow and leaving the tent all standing set out on the journey back carrying blands skis and enough meat and blubber to give the rest of the party a good meal the wind had swung round to the west and was blowing hard and as i started out i was conscious of a slight movement of the ice under me however the going remained good and though a fine drift of snow had sifted across the sledge tracks they were still visible and i reached the other camp without mishap just after midday it was then that i received the most bitter blow of all that ghastly period gerda was dead she had died in the night never having regained consciousness since my departure kalstad showed me the mound of snow where they had buried her and i stood there in the wind and cried like a child lying there three hours journey away was the means of giving her strength her death seemed so unnecessary why is it always the nicest people that go she look very happy when we burry her kalstad said i think peraps she find her father if he is also dead then it is peraps best she love her father very much kalstad had trekked out along the sledge route the previous day and found where bland had buried his companions boots in the snow we were able therefore to start out for the new camp as soon as we had had a meal we all suffered from terrible pains at the unaccustomed food kalstad was sick and weakened rapidly we were trekking straight into the wind which was rising to gale force and gradually obliterating the tracks it was a nightmare journey the ice was heaving under us breaking into fissures and growling as the broken edges of floes ground together under their covering of snow but for the iceberg i dont think we should ever have found the sealeopard again for by three oclock we were struggling across a plain of virgin white all traces of my ski tracks made only that morning having vanished i saw the iceberg black against the pale circle of the westering sun and within an hour we were snug in two tents with a blubber stove going and meat cooking at the time i blamed fate for what happened but it was really my own fault i should have remembered that there had been stretches of open water the previous day and realized how thin the ice was we should have camped on the berg but i dont know that any of us had the strength to drag tent and stores and sledges up on to the higher ground all that night the wind howled with demoniac force i slept fitfully racked with pain and conscious all the time of the increasing movement of the ice and the rising sound of the grinding floes towards morning i must have fallen into a heavy sleep for i was woken by the ice splitting with the crackle of rifle fire i crawled to the entrance of the tent but it was dark and i could see nothing i lay back and dozed off again to the sound of lapping water in the grey light of early dawn i was horrified to see water slopping in at the tent entrance my feet were numb and the bottom of my sleepingbag was frozen stiff it was as though i were lying with my feet in a block of ice i put my head out of the tent the scene had changed completely in place of the flat white expanse of snowcovered ice i found myself looking across a black expanse of brashfilled water all round us the ice had broken up into separate floes which drove against each other under the lash of the wind as i leaned forward on my hands and knees the ice tipped slowly under me i gazed with fascination as the water lapped the edge and slopped over my hands when i drew back into the tent the water receded i fought down a feeling of panic and pulled back the canvas at the other end of the tent i knew why the water had lapped over the edge as id leaned forward of course but it wasnt nice to have that knowledge confirmed the two tents were floating on a raft of ice not more than forty feet across and we were in the middle of the open channel of water the jagged edge of our floe fitted like a piece of a jigsaw puzzle to the main floe from which it had calved the spot was marked by our sledge and the carcase of the sealeopard it was hard to see us drifting slowly away from all that meat we had three or four pounds of the meat in the tent which we were keeping thawed but it wouldnt last long we were drifting away from the only source of life and strength we had i was just putting back the canvas to exclude the cold when i saw something a fin moving slowly through the water slipping along like a black dhow sail making scarcely a ripple it was a killer whale as though attracted by my gaze it turned quickly and came straight towards our floe the high dorsal fin passed out of my view and a moment later i heard the great beast snorting on the other side of the canvas it was an ugly piglike sound and deadly sinister i waited scarcely daring to breathe the floe trembled as the monster skimmed beneath it more snorting i put back the canvas and lay down rigid and trembling waiting tense for the moment when the whale would see us and tip the floe over that was what gerda had said they did peered over the edge of a floe and then tipped it up with their weight how long ago that seemed now i remembered how shed teased her father that day i had come aboard hval i remembered other things shed done and said her indomitable cheerfulness her guts the way she handled the men and i was comforted by the thought that at least shed been spared an end like this the snorting was close beside me now i lay still not waking the others better that they should not know till it happened it would be over quicker for them that way the snorting went on for what seemed eternity once the floe tilted rocked violently and i tensed waiting for the sudden flurry of water the cold and the snapping jaws but the snorting died away the floe rocked gently to the movement of the water i relaxed slowly and with relaxation came sleep a queer half coma of things remembered and things imagined i woke suddenly to the soft grinding of ice on ice and a knocking juddering under the floe for a moment i thought it was the killer whale back again then the soft grinding of the ice told its tale and i peered out praying that wed fetched up the same side of the channel as our meat but fortune was against us about a quarter of a mile of water separated us from the sledge and the sealeopard still at least we had fetched up against a big solidlooking floe i woke the others and got them on to firm ice then we repitched the tents and cooked a meal and whilst we ate i racked my brains for a means of getting across the water to the sealeopard meat but it was impossible the wind had swung to the south and the gap between us and our old camp was widening all the time i didnt know whether to push on or wait in the hope that the gap would freeze over or the wind change the breakup of the ice might mean we were nearing the edge of the pack but when i mentioned this to the others vaksdal shook his head gloomily and pointed to the west the iceblink he said i think there are many miles of pack yet it was true there was no longer a watersky to the west of us ice and cloud were merged together in a void of blinding white anyway kalstad was delirious and seemed too weak to move and i decided to remain in the hope of being able to reach the carcase of the sealeopard the following morning at some point during that timeless day kalstad woke me his eyes were very big and his face was quite white he wasnt delirious any more but he was shaking slightly and seemed possessed of some sort of a fever you must go on hr kaptein he said his voice was very faint i shook my head i knew what he meant his voice was merged with the memory of gerdas there is no point i said the others he whispered i shall die here you must leave me and go on youre not going to die i told him but i didnt believe it i knew we were all going to die as night came on we made a blubber fire and though we practically choked ourselves with the acrid fumes we managed to cook the rest of the meat kalstad refused to have any shortly after that i went to sleep for the first time for days i slept like a log without dreams or any disturbance it was more a coma than sleep for i was numb all over with no feeling at all in my feet when i woke it was clear and sunny a channel two miles wide separated us from the iceberg where the sealeopard lay to the north and west the pack seemed to have closed again in a solid mass when i crawled back into the tent again i saw that kalstad was dead the skin of his forehead was waxen under the dirt his mouth was slightly open in the stiff mat of his beard and his eyes stared at me sightlessly i felt his hands they were rigid and quite cold i roused the others and we buried him there in the snow for him the struggle was over now we go on ja vaksdal had seen the wide channel of water he accepted the loss of the sealeopard and the inevitability of going forward until we dropped his eyes were running and horribly inflamed so that they seemed rimmed by raw flesh his long beard looked dirty against the transparent pallor of his gaunt face both he and keller were suffering from the beginnings of frostbite due to walking in the snow after bland had taken their boots yet they were willing to go on they were tougher than i was i just wanted to crawl into my tent and die as kalstad had died but somewhere there is always a last flicker of energy we took one tent our sleepingbags and the rifle everything had to be carried before leaving we ate the blubber off the stove over which wed cooked the last of the meat the night before then i got out the compass set our course and we started off leaving kalstad to his lonely vigil in the ice just as we had left gerda we were all very weak we took it in turns to use the skis but soon we had to discard them for we hadnt the strength to hold our balance and the extra weight on our legs when we had to lift them over broken outcrops of clear ice was too much the food wed had caused us great pain so did our feet we were all suffering from frostbite now keller weakened rapidly and only the fact that i refused to give in until the two norwegians were beaten kept me going our progress was painfully slow constant detours had to be made round patches of open water but the ice was fairly flat by midday we had made something like two miles but by then keller had to be supported between the two of us the glare was like a redhot needle against my eyeballs i began to see things that werent there at times the landscape vanished into a blur of blinding white it was the beginning of snow blindness if wed only had some definite goal it would have given an impetus to our struggle but there was no goal only a vague hope that none of us believed in there was no point in going on i found myself dogged by an overwhelming desire to drop in the snow and let the relief of death steal over me the longing for death became an obsession that completely replaced any hope of finding survivors from the southern cross or the store of whalemeat the crew had landed it was a thing that had to be fought together with exhaustion the griping pains of hunger and the aching stab of my eyes that night keller wanted to be left behind he said he was too weak to go on but we couldnt leave him there was only the one tent we had to go on together or stop and die together vaksdal told him he was a coward he didnt deserve to be called that but it had its effect and he came on with us there is an entry in my log made that morning which reads th day we are going on but this is the last day we can hope to move those on the iceberg will run out of food today god help them barely able to stand up for weakness we made about a mile that morning my eyes had become so bad that i could hardly see to lay a course keller was barely conscious as he stumbled on with his arms about our necks at times he was actually delirious as he walked babbling incoherently in norwegian vaksdal and i were in little better case shortly after midday we pitched our tent for the last time it was whilst we were doing this that vaksdal seized my arm and pointed into the snowglare pingvin he croaked penguins that meant food i followed the line of his arm screwing up my eyes against the glare several dark dots hovered in the mirage of ice waving their flippers i picked up the rifle god give me strength to shoot straight the gun was incredibly heavy the barrel wavered i could not get the sights to stay for a second on the target i told vaksdal to kneel in the snow and i rested the barrel on his shoulder the penguins were waving their flippers over their heads and vaguely like sounds in a dream i heard shouts the trigger was heavy i couldnt see the sights properly and the shouts kept ringing in my ears then suddenly i knew they werent penguins penguins didnt wave their flippers over their heads those shouts were real i dropped the gun and started forward the figures melted lost in a mirage of light that wavered uncontrollably it was all a dream there was no substance in those dark dots against the snow i was delirious and imagining things i knew this was the end even as i stumbled forward at a ridiculous wobbly run i heard hoarse raven croaks coming from my throat then i stumbled and pitched forward the snow was soft a wonderful lethargy stole through me i knew i must struggle to my feet but i hadnt the strength and i didnt want to i didnt want to struggle any more i remember i thought for a moment of judie dying of starvation up there on the ledge of the iceberg but there was nothing i could do about it nothing i was finished and slowly luxuriously unconsciousness came like a blanket to cover me i woke to the warmth and the smell of food a spoon was pushed between my cracked lips my gorge rose as i tried to swallow the hot liquid i opened my eyes pain flamed at the back of my eyeballs captain eide was bending over me i couldnt believe it at first i was convinced that i was dead but then he was forcing hot liquid between my teeth again and i knew that i was alive and that id linked up with the survivors of the southern cross his face came and went in front of me and i heard a croaking sound that was my own voice there were things i had to tell him but i kept losing the drift of what i wanted to say as i slipped back into unconsciousness im told i slept for sixteen hours when i finally got my eyes open i found kyrre the second officer of the southern cross in the tent beside me the things id been trying to tell them rushed to the forefront of my mind they have no food i croaked kyrre put out his hand to steady me the violent urgency of my voice must have shaken him it is all right craig he soothed me lie down and rest kaptein eide left yesterday you know with nine men we are to follow but he doesnt realize the urgency i cried excitedly hes doesnt know they are he smiled and patted my arm as though i were a child he knows everything you have been delirious for hours you say nothing else but they have no food and will die soon if no one reaches them you are still telling us that long after eide has left he has two sledges and a weeks meat for them and he is making forced marches he tell me to say do not worry he will get there but the gap i cried he does not know there is a channel of water a quarter of a mile wide only a few miles to the east of us you tell us that also many times kyrres hand pressed me back you must rest for soon we must start we have sledges piled with whale meat and soon we must start i thought of the long trek back over that frightful road to the iceberg i knew i couldnt make it give us one man as guide and some food we will go on to the southern cross camp we shall only hinder you but he shook his head you did not hear what hide tell you last night the southern cross camp is abandoned you see though we have an enormous quantity of meat and blubber we have no boats they were destroyed so we go where the boats are each day we make a journey with half the sledges and then return for the other half when we are too weak for this we make a dump of half the sledges and go on with the others how many men have you i asked as i lay back forty six including those who have gone forward with kaptein eide the boats will not hold them i said and added even supposing we ever find open water to launch them in that is so but we are agreed that everyone must be together while the ice holds we shall continue to make journeys until all the meat is with the boats so we may perhaps survive the winter if we must sometime the iceberg must drift out of the pack then the fittest will try to reach south georgia as shackleton did and bring relief it is our only hope is colonel bland with him i asked but he shook his head colonel bland is dead it was his heart he died soon after dahle reach us dahle i stared at him do you mean the mate of hval he nodded he is gone on with eide now to the iceberg he and two other men reach us early last month but how it seems they were swept away from you in the ice they are on a floeberg when it is quiet they find the tauer iii camp then you mean the tauer iii camp was still there i interupted him he nodded so erik bland had been right the icebergs would have missed him there if hed stayed hed have had a chance of getting out alone go on i said there is not much to tell they get food and shelter there and survive the storm then when the weather clear they see the oil smoke with which we try to signal to aircraft and they join us they are five days without food and the journey is terrible i think but they are all right what about you what happened after the southern cross went down we lose our radio so we cannot talk with the rescue ships then we were caught by one of the icebergs as you were only a few survive olaf petersen and the others are dead then dahle tell us how you are on a ledge on an iceberg with four boats and hide start out with volunteers to reach you but they are caught in a blizzard and have to turn back we were beginning a second attempt with all the men when we are lucky enough to find you i was beginning to feel tired again behind kyrre i could just make out the grotesque emaciated features of weiner as i went off to sleep again i remember thinking hes just like all dps you cant kill them theyre indestructible its always someone else that saves them always someone else that dies and i thought how gerda had gone and peer larvik and olaf petersen the good ones the fighters theyre always the ones that are sacrificed i thought of dunkirk and salerno and anzio and the ships that had gone down in convoys id escorted it was always the fighters next morning after an early meal all the tents but the one in which vaksdal keller and i lay were struck and kyrre set out with his men and the first convoy of sledges loaded with whalemeat one man was left behind to help us we were to lie in for a bit and then come on in our own time we should have nothing to carry and only a single journey to make to the new camp whilst the rest made three journeys over the same ground the trek east back along the trail we had come was painfully slow for the first three days we just made the single journey from camp to camp we carried nothing and could take our time for kyrres men when theyd pitched the next camp had to go back for the second lot of sledges the open water where wed been parted from the sealeopard couldnt have been very extensive we made a slight detour to the south and saw no sign of it for all i know the ice may have closed up again or perhaps it had frozen over for the air was very still and there would have been little movement of the water to break up new ice on the fourth day vaksdal and i were sufficiently recovered to pull our weight on the single journey keller was still weak but next day he too was pulling the single journey whilst we had progressed to the full three trips between camps with an abundance of regular food my strength quickly returned only the deadness in my feet and the pain in my side remained slowly the line of icebergs came up over the horizon i began to dread their approach for when we reached them i should have to tell howe about gerdas death and i didnt want to do that hide would have broken it to him but he would still want to hear how it happened from my own lips the thought of that meeting weighed on my spirits like the depression one gets after flu it was going to knock him for six i remembered how embittered hed been as he soaked up the liquor like a sponge on the trip out from capetown and then the change that had come over him whilst he was with gerda what could i possibly say to him i remembered that scene on the ledge when hed renounced his right to accompany gerda hed committed her to my charge i was responsible for her not only to him but to myself the fact that we were without hope certain we were going to die did not help now only one thing consoled me that was that she died without knowing that her father had been killed but that wouldnt help me with howe i could see his features quite distinctly as i trudged through the ice leaning my weight on the sledge ropes i could see the bitter look coming back into his face and when we got back if we got back hed start drinking again drink was all that was left to him it would kill him in the end and somehow i didnt want him to go like that at last we could see the whole of our own iceberg the sky was black behind it a watersky and against the backcloth the berg stood out white like a giant pillar of salt the pinnacle of ice on the top stood up free of cloud with all the sublime upthrust of hope that belongs to a church spire in a flat plain with my inflamed eyes i looked through kyrres glasses and saw the ledge on which our camp should be perhaps we were too far away but my heart sank as i saw no sign of life no dark smudge that could be the boats and stores but at midday the following day that is on th april we saw figures coming towards us across the snow i thought my god its eide coming back theyre all dead i wasnt worrying about howe then i was thinking of judie and there was an awful ache in my heart then the figures were waving to us and shouting my stabbing eyeballs couldnt recognize them i dropped the sledge ropes and broke into a stumbling run towards them there were about half a dozen of them and the first one i recognized was eide i was sure then that the others were dead he caught hold of my arm grinning and slapping me on the shoulder then he pulled one of the others forward and the next instant judie was sobbing and laughing in my arms and when i looked at her she was no longer thin and emaciated she looked well fed and fit except for the tears that ran down her cheeks i thought you were dead she said through sobs of laughter then captain hide came and told us you were all right oh duncan i didnt want to go on without you i couldnt have faced it without you i had my arms tight round her she was trembling the cold air seemed suddenly warmer and i no longer felt tired the others i asked are they all right yes she said yes everyones fine except walter except walter i stared at her what do you mean two days after you left she said only two days and thousands of penguins appeared on the ice round the berg migrating or something we killed over two hundred in one day and more the next we were rolling in food we tried to make signals but you didnt see then walter went after you he went in the night without telling anyone in the morning we could see him going out along the trail of your sledge eide says he didnt find you no i said a great weight seemed to have been taken off my mind howe was dead he was safe from the bitterness of life he was dead and i didnt have to tell him about gerda theres open sea within five miles of us i was thinking about howe and i didnt take that in until she repeated it were drifting north and the ice is breaking up if theres a gale the iceberg may break though the pack in a matter of days i turned to eide is this true i asked incredulously is there a chance of the iceberg breaking out not only a chance eide answered its a certainty well be able to launch the boats inside a week and then i said glancing round at the southern cross survivors he caught the drift of my thoughts and then we split up we have four boats four chances of getting help the rest must camp on the iceberg one of the boats will surely get through i turned and stared at the iceberg it looked solid enough but the open sea was different to the pack it wasnt going to be pleasant marooned on an island of ice swept by gales and the piled up waves of the south atlantic and those tiny boats winter was closing in thered be gale after gale this area was noted for them an almost constant holocaust of wind what chance had they the thought made me shudder i thought again of the trip id just made the futility of it we had gone in the wild hope of bringing back meat and two days after wed left theyd had meat in abundance gerda and howe need never have died and eide would have joined up with us anyway but we hadnt known that just as now we didnt know whether or not a rescue boat would sight us on the iceberg if we stayed there and because we didnt know wed have to attempt the impossible and sail those flimsy lifeboats to south georgia i put my arm round judies shoulders and pressed her to me it was worth it for her sake but i hope to god fate doesnt play us any more dirty tricks she looked up at me quickly and i realized id spoken aloud then she said youre thinking of gerda arent you i nodded she was a lovely person but you know she wouldnt have been happy without her father walter couldnt fill his place in her life and then she looked up and smiled i think we are all right now everything is going to work out the sledges were moving forward again and we turned our faces towards the great castle of ice ahead of us and the future behind the ice was the black cloudscape that marked the open sea and beyond was south georgia one of the men began to sing it was a norwegian song id heard them singing on board ship something about going home in an instant it was taken up by the rest of the men and the sledges slid forward to the swelling of mens voices breaking the eternal silence of the ice with their challenge of hope and longing the sound was thin in the limitless plain of pack ice but it was indomitable and it sent a thrill of pride and courage through me judie was singing too singing for me with her grey eyes laughing and her young body flung forward straining on the ropes and her word echoed in my ears think we are all right now everything is going to work out the survivors on the st april a radio message from south georgia put the name of the southern cross back in the headlines of the worlds newspapers it was from jan eriksen manager of the whaling station at grytviken to the offices of his company in oslo and read two boats containing survivors of the southern cross arrived grytviken two hours later a further message was received containing the first news that there were survivors marooned on an iceberg in the antarctic this read two boats each carried six survivors commanders hans eide einar vaksdal list of crews to follow two further boats not yet arrived sixtyseven persons including mrs judie bland marooned on iceberg in open water position s w four catchers dispatched to search for missing boats on arrival station relief ship pingvin i will attempt to rescue survivors marooned on iceberg winter was closing in on the icecapped island of south georgia in two days the whaling station would have been closed and the place deserted eide had made it with just two days to spare it was an incredible story the iceberg had broken out of the pack in a gale on april the ledge on which their camp was situated then faced straight into the wind swept by icy spray from the waves that thundered against the berg they clung precariously to life for twentyfour hours then the berg swung round so that their ledge was sheltered from the wind they had already deckedin the boats with pieces of packing cases and canvas they now recut the ledge and on the afternoon of the th when the gale had begun to subside they ran the boats down the ice slipway with the crews in them letting them take the water like lifeboats being launched from a shore station in the mountainous waves and the almost continual gloom the four boats were soon swept apart and separated for ten days they drove northwards towards south georgia their scraps of sail driving them pellmell through the water on the crests of the waves and hanging slack for lack of wind in the troughs hide in his radioed report of the boat journey said i have never experienced such hardship during my thirtytwo years at sea there was a crew of six to each boat there was no place to sleep we were constantly bailing for our lives and chipping away the ice that coated the boat and threatened to sink her only once was i able to shoot the sun and check my navigation it was so cold that men froze stiff as boards at the tiller and could not move their limbs until they had been well rubbed to restore the circulation by the fifth day we were suffering badly from exposure and there were cases of frostbite the fear that i should make an error in navigation miss south georgia and drive on into the atlantic was constantly with me they experienced one bad gale and then late on the tenth day they sighted the southeastern tip of south georgia and in the morning as they sailed up the northern side of the island they saw vaksdals boat following about a mile behind them these were in fact the only two boats to get through what happened to the others we shall never know maybe they missed south georgia and drove on into the atlantic maybe they were swamped or the men became too weakened to chip the ice off and they just capsized the catchers sent out from grytviken to search for them reported nothing not even wreckage meanwhile messages were pouring in to the nord hvalstasjon the attention of the whole world had sud denly become focused on this lonely whaling outpost hide found himself with offers of assistance from a dozen different countries but they were all useless within a few weeks the pack ice would have moved north with the winter and the iceberg would be beset again there would be no hope of rescue then until next summer and he knew that those on the iceberg could not survive the winter his only hope was the pingvin this little vessel arrived at grytviken on the nd and began refuelling at once it left in the early hours of the rd with hide and eriksen on board before he left hide had radioed a full account of the disaster and the names of the survivors marooned on the iceberg this was the first intimation we had that a scot duncan craig was in command of the survivors there followed an anxious period of waiting the catchers searching for the two missing boats were forced by heavy storms to return to grytviken no messages were received from the pingvin the ship was held up by loose pack and heavy seas and though we didnt know it at the time jacobsen the captain insisted on turning back early on the th only the pleading of hide and eriksen persuaded him to risk his ship and his men a few more hours in those terrible seas on the evening of that same day came the first piece of good news a radio message from grytviken reported pingvin has sighted iceberg pack ice heavy and weather conditions bad after that nothing for over twentyfour hours grytviken had nothing to report newspapers began running gloomy accounts of conditions in the antarctic in late april and as the hours of waiting passed and still there was no news fears grew that the rescue attempt would fail then just after midday on the th the teleprinters began clacking out the news for which the public had been waiting iceberg survivors rescued oslo april reuter message received from station relief ship pingvin states all survivors of southern cross marooned on iceberg now safe pack ice and heavy seas delayed rescue operations survivors say conditions very bad on iceberg in open water owing to heavy seas breaking over ledge camp and freezing reuter well that is the end of the story of the southern cross disaster there is little more to add except that now just over a year after it all happened a new southern cross is building at belfast it is to cost over ј and is expected to be ready for next season the south antarctic whaling company still has its offices in fenchurch street only the list of directors has changed sir frederick sands wellknown financier is the new chairman and duncan craig is on the board judie bland is now judie craig they were married in capetown on their way back from south georgia and according to craig most of south africa turned out for the wedding besides being a director of the company duncan craig sails as master of southern cross ii when the south antarctics next expedition leaves in october hide who was cleared of all blame for the disaster is already in the antarctic as master of another factory ship it is unlikely that judie craig will make another trip to the white south already she is a mother and they have a charming house looking out over the falmouth estuary where they spend the summer months sailing there is nothing to remind them of the terrible hardships they suffered except for a series of beautiful ice studies presented to them by aldo bonomi and most treasured of all a picture of gerda petersen taken just before the start of the trek across the ice it faces you in the wide entrance hall as you go in so that no one can enter their house without meeting her the end
