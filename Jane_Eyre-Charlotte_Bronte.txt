chapter one the red room we could not go for a walk that afternoon there was such a freezing cold wind and such heavy rain that we all stayed indoors i was glad of it i never liked long walks especially in winter i used to hate coming home when it was almost dark with icecold fingers and toes feeling miserable because bessie the nursemaid was always scolding me all the time i knew i was different from my cousins eliza john and georgiana reed they were taller and stronger than me and they were loved these three usually spent their time crying and quarrelling but today they were sitting quietly around their mother in the sittingroom i wanted to join the family circle but mrs reed my aunt refused bessie had complained about me no im sorry jane until i hear from bessie or see for myself that you are really trying to behave better you cannot be treated as a good happy child like my children what does bessie say i have done i asked jane it is not polite to question me in that way if you cannot speak pleasantly be quiet i crept out of the sittingroom and into the small room next door where i chose a book full of pictures from the bookcase i climbed on to the windowseat and drew the curtains so that i was completely hidden i sat there for a while sometimes i looked out of the window at the grey november afternoon and saw the rain pouring down on the leafless garden but most of the time i studied the book and stared fascinated at the pictures lost in the world of imagination i forgot my sad lonely existence for a while and was happy i was only afraid that my secret hidingplace might be discovered suddenly the door of the room opened john reed rushed in where are you rat he shouted he did not see me behind the curtain eliza georgy jane isnt here tell mamma shes run out into the rain what a bad animal she is how lucky i drew the curtain i thought he would never have found me because he was not very intelligent but eliza guessed at once where i was shes in the windowseat john she called from the sittingroom so i came out immediately as i did not want him to pull me out what do you want i asked him say what do you want master reed he answered sitting in an armchair i want you to come here john reed was fourteen and i was only ten he was large and rather fat he usually ate too much at meals which made him ill he should have been at boarding school but his mother who loved him very much had brought him home for a month or two because she thought his health was delicate john did not love his mother or his sisters and he hated me he bullied and punished me not two or three times a week not once or twice a day but all the time my whole body trembled when he came near sometimes he hit me sometimes he just threatened me and i lived in terrible fear of him i had no idea how to stop him the servants did not want to offend their young master and mrs reed could see no fault in her dear boy so i obeyed johns order and approached his armchair thinking how very ugly his face was perhaps he understood what i was thinking for he hit me hard on the face that is for your rudeness to mamma just now he said and for your wickedness in hiding and for looking at me like that you rat i was so used to his bullying that i never thought of hitting him back what were you doing behind that curtain he asked i was reading i answered show me the book i gave it to him you have no right to take our books he continued you have no money and your father left you none you ought to beg in the streets not live here in comfort with a gentlemans family anyway all these books are mine and so is the whole house or will be in a few years time ill teach you not to borrow my books again he lifted the heavy book and threw it hard at me it hit me and i fell cutting my head on the door i was in great pain and suddenly for the first time in my life i forgot my fear of john reed you wicked cruel boy i cried you are a bully you are as bad as a murderer what what he cried did she say that to me did you hear eliza and georgiana ill tell mamma but first he rushed to attack me but now he was fighting with a desperate girl i really saw him as a wicked murderer i felt the blood running down my face and the pain gave me strength i fought back as hard as i could my resistance surprised him and he shouted for help his sisters ran for mrs reed who called her maid miss abbott and bessie they pulled us apart and i heard them say what a wicked girl she attacked master john mrs reed said calmly take her away to the red room and lock her in there and so i was carried upstairs arms waving and legs kicking as soon as we arrived in the red room i became quiet again and the two servants both started scolding me really miss eyre said miss abbott how could you hit him hes your young master how can he be my master i am not a servant i cried no miss eyre you are less than a servant because you do not work replied miss abbott they both looked at me as if they strongly disapproved of me you should remember miss said bessie that your aunt pays for your food and clothes and you should be grateful you have no other relations or friends all my short life i had been told this and i had no answer to it i stayed silent listening to these painful reminders and if you are angry and rude mrs reed may send you away added bessie anyway said miss abbott god will punish you jane eyre for your wicked heart pray to god and say youre sorry they left the room locking the door carefully behind them the red room was a cold silent room hardly ever used although it was one of the largest bedrooms in the house nine years ago my uncle mr reed had died in this room and since then nobody had wanted to sleep in it now that i was alone i thought bitterly of the people i lived with john reed his sisters his mother the servants they all accused me scolded me hated me why could i never please them eliza was selfish but was respected georgiana had a bad temper but she was popular with everybody because she was beautiful john was rude cruel and violent but nobody punished him i tried to make no mistakes but they called me naughty every moment of the day now that i had turned against john to protect myself everybody blamed me and so i spent that whole long afternoon in the red room asking myself why i had to suffer and why life was so unfair perhaps i would run away or starve myself to death gradually it became dark outside the rain was still beating on the windows and i could hear the wind in the trees now i was no longer angry and i began to think the reeds might be right perhaps i was wicked did i deserve to die and be buried in the churchyard like my uncle reed i could not remember him but knew he was my mothers brother who had taken me to his house when my parents both died on his death bed he had made his wife aunt reed promise to look after me like her own children i supposed she now regretted her promise a strange idea came to me i felt sure that if mr reed had lived he would have treated me kindly and now as i looked round at the dark furniture and the walls in shadow i began to fear that his ghost might come back to punish his wife for not keeping her promise he might rise from the grave in the churchyard and appear in this room i was so frightened by this thought that i hardly dared to breathe suddenly in the darkness i saw a light moving on the ceiling it may have been from a lamp outside but in my nervous state i did not think of that i felt sure it must be a ghost a visitor from another world my head was hot my heart beat fast was that the sound of wings in my ears was that something moving near me screaming wildly i rushed to the door and shook it miss abbott and bessie came running to open it miss eyre are you ill asked bessie take me out of here i screamed why whats the matter she asked i saw a light and i thought it was a ghost i cried holding tightly on to bessies hand shes not even hurt said miss abbott in disgust she screamed just to bring us here i know all her little tricks what is all this demanded an angry voice mrs reed appeared at the door of the room abbott and bessie i think i told you to leave jane eyre in this room till i came she screamed so loudly maam said bessie softly let go of her hands bessie was mrs reeds only answer jane eyre you need not think you can succeed in getting out of the room like this your naughty tricks will not work with me you will stay here an hour longer as a punishment for trying to deceive us oh aunt please forgive me i cant bear it i shall die if you keep me here i screamed and kicked as she held me silence control yourself she pushed me resisting wildly back into the red room and locked me in there i was in the darkness again with the silence and the ghosts i must have fainted i cannot remember anything more chapter two leaving gateshead i woke up to find the doctor lifting me very carefully into my own bed it was good to be back in my familiar bedroom with a warm fire and candlelight it was also a great relief to recognize dr lloyd who mrs reed called in for her servants she always called a specialist for herself and the children he was looking after me so kindly i felt he would protect me from mrs reed he talked to me a little then gave bessie orders to take good care of me when he left i felt very lonely again but i was surprised to find that bessie did not scold me at all in fact she was so kind to me that i became brave enough to ask a question bessie whats happened am i ill yes you became ill in the red room but youll get better dont worry miss jane she answered then she went next door to fetch another servant i could hear her whispers sarah come in here and sleep with me and that poor child tonight i darent stay alone with her she might die she was so ill last night do you think she saw a ghost mrs reed was too hard on her i think so the two servants slept in my room while i lay awake all night trembling with fear and eyes wide open in horror imagining ghosts in every corner fortunately i suffered no serious illness as a result of my terrible experience in the red room although i shall never forget that night but the shock left me nervous and depressed for the next few days i cried all day long and although bessie tried hard to tempt me with nice things to eat or my favourite books i took no pleasure in eating or even in reading i knew i had no one to love me and nothing to look forward to when the doctor came again he seemed a little surprised to find me looking so miserable perhaps shes crying because she couldnt go out with mrs reed in the carriage this morning suggested bessie surely shes more sensible than that said the doctor smiling at me shes a big girl now im not crying about that i hate going out in the carriage i said quickly im crying because im miserable oh really miss said bessie the doctor looked at me thoughtfully he had small grey intelligent eyes just then a bell rang for the servants dinner you can go bessie he said ill stay here talking to miss jane till you come back after bessie had left he asked what really made you ill i was locked up in a room with a ghost in the dark afraid of ghosts are you he smiled of mr reeds ghost yes he died in that room you know nobody even goes in there any more it was cruel to lock me in there alone without a candle i shall never forget it but you arent afraid now there must be another reason why you are so sad he said looking kindly at me how could i tell him all the reasons for my unhappiness i have no father or mother brothers or sisters i began but you have a kind aunt and cousins but john reed knocked me down and my aunt locked me in the red room i cried there was a pause dont you like living at gateshead in such a beautiful house he asked i would be glad to leave it but i have nowhere else to go you have no relations apart from mrs reed i think i may have some who are very poor but i know nothing about them i answered would you like to go to school he asked finally i thought for a moment i knew very little about school but at least it would be a change the start of a new life yes i would like to go i replied in the end well well said the doctor to himself as he got up well see the child is delicate she ought to have a change of air i heard later from the servants that he had spoken to mrs reed about me and that she had agreed immediately to send me to school abbott said mrs reed would be glad to get rid of me in this conversation i also learned for the first time that my father had been a poor vicar when he married my mother miss jane reed of gateshead the reed family were so angry that they disinherited her i also heard that my parents both died of an illness only a year after their wedding but days and weeks passed and mrs reed still said nothing about sending me to school one day as she was scolding me i suddenly threw a question at her the words just came out without my planning to say them what would uncle reed say to you if he were alive i asked what cried mrs reed her cold grey eyes full of fear staring at me as if i were a ghost i had to continue my uncle reed is now in heaven and can see all you think and do and so can my parents they know how you hate me and are cruel to me mrs reed smacked my face and left me without a word i was scolded for an hour by bessie as the most ungrateful child in the world and indeed with so much hate in my heart i did feel wicked christmas passed by with no presents or new clothes for me every evening i watched eliza and georgiana putting on their new dresses and going out to parties sometimes bessie would come up to me in my lonely bedroom bringing a piece of cake sometimes she would tell me a story and sometimes she would kiss me good night when she was kind to me i thought she was the best person in the world but she did not always have time for me on the morning of the fifteenth of january bessie rushed up to my room to tell me a visitor wanted to see me who could it be i knew mrs reed would be there too and i was frightened of seeing her again when i nervously entered the breakfastroom i looked up at a black column at least that is what he looked like to me he was a tall thin man dressed all in black with a cold stony face at the top of the column this is the little girl i wrote to you about said mrs reed to the stony stranger well jane eyre said the stranger heavily and are you a good child it was impossible to say yes with mrs reed sitting there so i was silent perhaps the less said about that the better mr brocklehurst said mrs reed shaking her head im sorry to hear it he answered come here jane eyre and answer my questions where do the wicked go after death they go to hell i answered and what must you do to avoid going there he asked i thought for a moment but could not find the right answer i must keep in good health and not die i replied wrong children younger than you die all the time another question do you enjoy reading the bible yes sometimes i replied hesitating that is not enough your answers show me you have a wicked heart you must pray to god to change it if you ever want to go to heaven mr brocklehurst interrupted mrs reed i mentioned to you in my letter that this little girl has in fact a very bad character if you accept her at lowood school please make sure that the headmistress and teachers know how dishonest she is she will try to lie to them of course you see jane you cannot try your tricks on mr brocklehurst however hard i had tried to please mrs reed in the past she always thought the worst of me it was not surprising that i had come to hate her now she was accusing me in front of a stranger my hopes of starting a new life at school began to fade do not worry madam mr brocklehurst said the teachers will watch her carefully life at lowood will do her good we believe in hard work plain food simple clothes and no luxury of any kind i will send her as soon as possible then mr brocklehurst i hope she will be taught according to her low position in life indeed she will madam i hope she will be grateful for this opportunity to improve her character little girl read this book it tells the story of the sudden death of a young girl who was a liar read and pray after mr brocklehurst had given me the book and left i felt i had to speak anger was boiling up inside me i walked up to mrs reed and looked straight into her eyes i do not deceive people if i told lies i would say i loved you but i dont i hate you i will never call you aunt again as long as i live if anyone asks how you treated me i will tell them the truth that you were very cruel to me people think you are a good woman but you are lying to them even before i had finished i began to experience a great feeling of freedom and relief at last i had said what i felt mrs reed looked frightened and unhappy jane i want to be your friend you dont know what youre saying you are too excited go to your room and lie down i wont lie down im quite calm send me to school soon mrs reed i hate living here i will indeed send her soon murmured mrs reed to herself chapter three my first impressions of school mrs reed arranged for me to leave on the nineteenth of january i had to get up very early to catch the coach but bessie helped me to get ready will you say goodbye to mrs reed jane she asked no she said i shouldnt disturb her so early anyway i dont want to say anything to her shes always hated me oh miss jane dont say that goodbye to gateshead i shouted wildly as we walked together out of the front door to wait for the coach in the road it arrived pulled by four horses and full of passengers the coachman took my luggage and called me to hurry up bessie kissed me for the last time as i held tightly to her she shouted up to the coachman make sure you take care of her fifty miles is a long way for a young child to go alone i will he answered the door was closed and the coach rolled off what a strange feeling to be leaving gateshead my home for the whole of my childhood although i was sad to say goodbye to bessie i was both excited and nervous about the new places i would see and the new people i would meet i do not remember much about the journey except that it seemed far too long we stopped for lunch to change the horses then in the afternoon i realized we were driving through countryside i slept for a short time but was woken when the coach stopped the door opened and a servant called in is there a little girl called jane eyre here yes i answered and was helped out of the coach with my luggage tired and confused after the journey i followed the servant into a large building where she left me in a sittingroom in came a tall lady with dark hair and eyes and a large pale forehead i discovered that she was miss temple the headmistress of lowood school she looked at me carefully you are very young to be sent alone you look tired are you she asked putting her hand kindly on my shoulder a little maam i replied how old are you and what is your name im jane eyre maam and im ten years old well i hope you will be a good child at school she said touching my cheek gently with her finger i was taken by a teacher miss miller through the silent corridors of the large school to the long wide schoolroom there about eighty girls aged from nine to twenty sat doing their homework i sat on a bench near the door with my slate put away the lessonbooks and fetch the suppertrays called miss miller four tall girls removed all the books then went out and returned with trays which were handed round each child could have a drink of water out of the shared cup and could take a small piece of biscuit then we all went quietly upstairs to the long crowded bedroom where two children shared every bed i had to share miss millers but i was so tired that i fell asleep immediately in the morning the ringing of a bell woke me although it was still dark i got dressed quickly in the bitter cold of the room and washed when i could there was only one basin for six girls when the bell rang again we all went downstairs two by two and silently entered the cold badly lit schoolroom for prayers as the bell rang a third time to indicate the beginning of lessons the girls moved into four groups around four tables and the teachers came into the room to start the bible class i was put in the bottom class how glad i was when it was time for breakfast i had hardly eaten anything the day before but the only food served to us was porridge which was burnt it was so disgusting that we could not eat it so we left the diningroom with empty stomachs after breakfast came the one happy moment of the day when the pupils could play and talk freely we all complained bitterly about the uneatable breakfast lessons started again at nine oclock and finished at twelve when miss temple stood up to speak to the whole school girls this morning you had a breakfast which you couldnt eat you must be hungry so i have ordered a lunch of bread and cheese for you all the teachers looked at her in surprise dont worry i take responsibility for it she told them we were delighted and all rushed out into the garden to eat our lunch nobody had taken any notice of me so far but i did not mind that i stood alone outside watching some of the stronger girls playing trying to forget the bitter cold and thinking about my life gateshead and the reed family seemed a long way away i was not yet used to school life and what sort of future could i look forward to as i wondered i saw a girl near me reading a book i felt brave enough to speak to her since i too liked reading is your book interesting what is it about i asked well i like it she said after a pause looking at me here have a look at it i glanced quickly at it but found it too difficult to understand so i gave it back what sort of school is this i asked its called lowood school its a charity school were all charity children you see i expect your parents are dead arent they all the girls here have lost either one or both parents dont we pay anything is the school free i asked we pay or our relations pay a year for each of us that isnt enough so some kind ladies and gentlemen in london pay the rest thats why its called a charity school who is mr brocklehurst was my next question his mother built this part of the school hes the manager and looks after all financial matters he lives in a large house near here i did not see her again until during the afternoon lessons when i noticed that she had been sent to stand alone in the middle of the schoolroom i could not imagine what she had done to deserve such a punishment but she did not look ashamed or unhappy she was lost in thought and did not seem to notice that everyone was looking at her if that happened to me i thought i would be so embarrassed after lessons we had a small cup of coffee and half a piece of brown bread then half an hours play then homework finally after the evening biscuit and drink of water we said prayers and went to bed that was my first day at lowood chapter four making a friend the next morning we got up in the dark as before but the water was frozen so we could not wash it was freezing cold in all the rooms this time the porridge was not burnt but i still felt hungry as the quantity was so small i stayed in the bottom class but noticed the girl that i had been talking to was in another class her surname seemed to be burns teachers called girls by their surnames in this school her class were studying history and her teacher miss scatcherd appeared constantly annoyed by her burns hold your head up cant you burns dont stand like that the history questions asked by miss scatcherd sounded very difficult but burns knew all the answers i kept expecting the teacher to praise her but instead she suddenly cried out you dirty girl you havent washed your hands this morning i was surprised that burns did not explain that none of us could wash our faces or hands because the water had been frozen miss scatcherd gave an order burns left the room and returned carrying a stick the teacher took it and hit burns several times with it the girl did not cry or change her expression wicked girl said miss scatcherd nothing will change your dirty habits later that day during the playhour i found burns alone by the fireside reading the same book as before and i started talking to her what is the rest of your name i asked helen she replied do you want to leave lowood no why should i i was sent to school here so i must learn as much as i can but miss scatcherd is so cruel to you i burst out cruel not at all she is strict and she sees my faults if i were you id hate her i cried if she hit me with a stick id seize it and break it under her nose i dont think you would answered helen quietly and if you did mr brocklehurst would send you away from school and your relations would be upset anyway the bible tells us to do good even if other people hurt us sometimes you have to put up with some hard things in life i could not understand her ideas but i had a feeling she might be right i looked at her in wonder you say you have faults helen what are they to me you seem very good you are wrong she answered im untidy and careless and i forget the rules i read when i should be doing my homework you see miss scatcherd is right to scold me is miss temple as strict as that i asked a soft smile passed over helens normally serious face miss temple is full of goodness she gently tells me of my mistakes and praises me if i do well but even with her help i dont concentrate properly in class i just dream away the time and then i cant answer the teachers questions but today in history you knew all the answers i said i just happened to be interested thats all she replied i expect you are always interested in miss temples lessons because you like her and she is good to you im like that i love those who love me and i hate those who punish me unfairly you should read the bible and do what christ says people who believe in god should love their enemies said helen then i should love mrs reed and her son john which is impossible i cried helen asked me to explain what i meant and listened carefully to the long story of what i had suffered at gateshead well i asked impatiently at the end isnt mrs reed a bad woman dont you agree with me its true she has been unkind to you because she dislikes your faults as miss scatcherd dislikes mine but look how bitterly you remember every angry word wouldnt you be happier if you tried to forget her scolding life is too short to continue hating anyone for a long time we all have faults but the time will come soon when we die when our wickedness will pass away with our bodies leaving only the pure flame of the spirit thats why i never think of revenge i never consider life unfair i live in calm looking forward to the end for a moment we both stayed silent then one of the big girls came up calling helen burns go and put away your work and tidy your drawer immediately or ill tell miss scatcherd helen sighed and getting up silently obeyed chapter five mr brocklehursts visit and its results it was difficult for me to get used to the school rules at lowood and to the hard physical conditions in january february and march there was deep snow but we still had to spend an hour outside every day we had no boots or gloves and my hands and feet ached badly we were growing children and needed more food than was provided sometimes the big girls bullied us little ones and made us hand over our teatime bread or evening biscuit one afternoon when i had been at lowood for three weeks a visitor arrived all the teachers and pupils stood respectfully as he entered the schoolroom i looked up there next to miss temple stood the same black column which had frowned on me in the breakfastroom at gateshead i had been afraid he would come i remembered only too well mrs reeds description of my character and the promise he had given her to warn teachers at lowood about my wickedness now they would consider me a bad child for ever at first mr brocklehurst spoke in a murmur to miss temple i could just hear because i was at the front of the class tell the housekeeper she must count the needles and only give out one at a time to the girls they lose them so easily and miss temple please make sure the girls stockings are mended more carefully some of them have a lot of holes i shall follow your instructions sir said miss temple and another thing which surprises me i find that a lunch of bread and cheese has been served to the girls recently why is this there is nothing about it in the rules who is responsible i myself sir answered miss temple the breakfast was so badly cooked that the girls couldnt possibly eat it so they were hungry madam listen to me for a moment you know that i am trying to bring up these girls to be strong patient and unselfish if some little luxury is not available do not replace it with something else but tell them to be brave and suffer like christ himself remember what the bible says man shall not live by bread alone but by the word of god madam when you put bread into these childrens mouths you feed their bodies but you starve their souls miss temple did not reply she looked straight in front of her and her face was as cold and hard as marble mr brocklehurst on the other hand now looked round at the girls and almost jumped in surprise who what is that girl with red hair with curls madam with curls everywhere that is julia severn said miss temple quietly her hair curls naturally you see naturally yes but it is god we obey not nature miss temple that girls hair must be cut off i have said again and again that hair must be arranged modestly and plainly i see other girls here with too much hair yes i shall send someone tomorrow to cut all the girls hair mr brocklehurst began miss temple no miss temple i insist to please god these girls must have short straight hair and plain simple clothes he was interrupted by the arrival of three ladies who had unfortunately not heard his comments on dress and hair they all wore the most expensive clothes and had beautiful long curly hair i heard miss temple greet them as the wife and daughters of mr brocklehurst i had hoped to hide my face behind my slate while mr brocklehurst was talking so that he would not recognize me but suddenly the slate fell from my hand and broke in two on the hard floor i knew only too well what would happen next a careless girl said mr brocklehurst quietly almost to himself the new girl i see i must not forget to say something to the whole school about her and then to me aloud come here child i was too frightened to move but two big girls pushed me towards him miss temple whispered kindly in my ear dont be afraid jane i saw it was an accident her kindness touched me but i knew that soon she would hear the lies about me and then she would hate me put the child on that chair said mr brocklehurst someone lifted me up on to a high chair so that i was close to his nose frightened and shaking i felt everyones eyes on me you see this girl began the black marble column she is young she looks like an ordinary child nothing about her tells you she is evil but she is all wickedness children dont talk to her stay away from her teachers watch her punish her body to save her soul if indeed she has a soul because this child i can hardly say it this child is a liar how shocking said the two brocklehurst daughters each wiping a tear or two from their eyes i learned this fact continued the great man from mrs reed the kind lady who took care of her after her parents death and brought her up as a member of the family in the end mrs reed was so afraid of this childs evil influence on her own children that she had to send her here teachers watch her carefully the brocklehurst family stood up and moved slowly out of the schoolroom at the door my judge turned and said she must stand half an hour longer on that chair and nobody may speak to her for the rest of the day so there i was high up on the chair publicly displayed as an ugly example of evil feelings of shame and anger boiled up inside me but just as i felt i could not bear it any longer helen burns walked past me and lifted her eyes to mine her look calmed me what a smile she had it was an intelligent brave smile lighting up her thin face and her tired grey eyes when all the girls left the schoolroom at five oclock i climbed down from the chair and sat on the floor i no longer felt strong or calm and i began to cry bitterly i had wanted so much to make friends at lowood to be good to deserve praise now nobody would believe me or perhaps even speak to me could i ever start a new life after this never i cried i wish i were dead just then helen arrived bringing my coffee and bread i was too upset to eat or drink but she sat with me for some time talking gently to me wiping away my tears and helping me to recover when miss temple came to look for me she found us sitting quietly together come up to my room both of you she said we went to her warm comfortable room upstairs now tell me the truth jane she said you have been accused and you must have the chance to defend yourself and so i told her the whole story of my lonely childhood with the reed family and of my terrible experience in the red room i know dr lloyd who saw you when you were ill she said ill write to him and see if he agrees with what you say if he does i shall publicly tell the school you are not a liar i believe you now jane and she kissed me she turned to helen how are you tonight helen have you coughed a lot today not very much maam and the pain in your chest its a little better i think miss temple examined helen carefully and sighed a little then she gave us some tea and toast for a while i felt i was in heaven eating and drinking in the warm pretty room with kind miss temple and helen but when we reached our bedroom miss scatcherd was checking the drawers burns she said yours is far too untidy tomorrow all day you will wear a notice on your forehead saying untidy helen said miss scatcherd was quite right and wore the notice all the next day but i was furious and at the end of the afternoon tore it off her head and threw it in the fire when miss temple received a letter from dr lloyd agreeing that what i had said was true she told the whole school that i had been wrongly accused and was not a liar from that moment i felt i was accepted and set to work to learn as much as i could and make as many friends as possible chapter six learning to like school life at lowood no longer seemed so hard as spring approached we enjoyed walking and playing in the surrounding countryside but with fog lying constantly in the valley it was not a healthy place for a school and by may more than half the girls were seriously ill with typhus fever as a result of poor food and bad living conditions many girls died while there was fear and death inside the school the sun shone on the flowers outside and on the flowing streams in the valleys so i and the few who had escaped illness enjoyed the beautiful summer weather with no lessons or discipline at all helen burns could not come walking with me because she was ill not with typhus but with tuberculosis at first i had thought she would recover but when i learned her illness was serious i decided to visit her at night for what might be the last time i found her lying in bed looking pale and weak youve come to say goodbye she whispered coughing you are just in time im going soon where helen are you going home i asked yes to my long home my last home no no helen i was crying at the thought of losing her jane your feet are cold lie down with me and cover them with my blanket i did so i am happy jane she continued you mustnt cry by dying young ill avoid suffering i am going to heaven does heaven really exist i asked yes im sure of it im sure our souls go there when we die she answered firmly will i see you again helen when i die yes you will go to heaven too jane i could not quite believe that heaven existed and i held tightly to helen i did not want to let her go we kissed goodnight and fell asleep in the morning miss temple found me asleep with helen burns dead in my arms she was buried in the local churchyard gradually the typhus fever left lowood but the number of deaths made the public aware of the poor conditions in which the pupils lived money was raised to build a new school in a better position many improvements were made and mr brocklehurst lost his position as manager so it became a really useful place of education i stayed for eight more years for the last two as a teacher i was busy and happy all that time relying greatly on the help and encouragement of my dear friend miss temple but when she married and moved to a distant part of the country i decided it was the moment for me to change my life too i realized i had never known any other world apart from lowood or gateshead suddenly i wanted freedom or at least a new master to serve so i advertised in a newspaper for a job as a governess when i received an answer from a mrs fairfax who wanted a governess for a girl under ten years old i accepted with the permission of the new headmistress of lowood chapter seven thornfield and mr rochester thornfield hall was a large gentlemans house in the country near a town called millcote there after my sixteenhour journey i was welcomed by mrs fairfax she was a little old lady dressed in black who seemed glad to have someone else to talk to apart from the servants although the house was dark and frightening with its big rooms full of heavy furniture i was excited at being in a new place and looked forward to my new life there working for kind mrs fairfax but i was surprised to discover on my first full day at thornfield that mrs fairfax was not in fact the owner as i had assumed but the housekeeper and that my new master was a mr rochester who was often away from home my pupil was a girl called adele seven or eight years old who was born in france and could hardly speak english luckily i had learnt french very well at lowood and had no difficulty in communicating with young adele a pretty cheerful child it appeared that mr rochester who had known adele and her mother very well had brought adele back to england to live with him after her mother had died i taught her for several hours every day in the library although it was not easy to make her concentrate on anything for long as she was clearly not used to the discipline of lessons one day i took the opportunity of asking mrs fairfax a few questions about mr rochester as i was curious about him and the little housekeeper seemed happy to talk is he liked by most people was my first question oh yes his family have always been respected here theyve owned the land round here for years she replied but do you like him what is his character like i have always liked him and i think hes a fair master to his servants hes a little peculiar perhaps hes travelled a lot you know i expect hes clever but i cant tell really what do you mean peculiar i asked interested its not easy to describe youre never sure whether hes serious or joking you dont really understand him at least i dont but that doesnt matter hes a very good master i could get no further information from mrs fairfax about mr rochester but instead she offered to show me round the whole house we went through many large impressive rooms finally reaching the top floor where there was a narrow corridor with several small black doors all shut i stopped to look at them and thought for a moment they looked like prison doors hiding evil secrets no sooner had i turned away to go downstairs than i heard a strange ghostly laugh mrs fairfax i called out as the housekeeper was already on her way downstairs did you hear that laugh who is it it may be grace poole she answered calmly she is paid to help the housemaid in her work and always sews in one of those rooms i heard the laugh again it did not sound human to me grace called mrs fairfax i did not expect anyone to answer but in fact a door opened and a middleaged woman appeared she looked too plain and sensible to be a ghost too much noise grace said mrs fairfax remember your instructions grace nodded and went back into the room several times in the next few months i went up to the top floor again where i could look out of the high windows in the roof to see the surrounding countryside and be alone with my thoughts i was very happy teaching pretty little adele in the daytime and talking to kind old mrs fairfax in the evening but i felt that something was missing from my life i had dreams of a greater and better life and above all i wanted to do more people are not always satisfied with a quiet life and women as well as men need action while on the top floor i often heard grace pooles strange laugh and sometimes i saw her too she used to go silently in and out of the room with a plate of food or a glass of beer one day in january i had a free afternoon as adele was ill so i decided to walk to hay a village two miles away to post a letter for the housekeeper it was a bright frosty day and i was enjoying the fresh air and the exercise stopping on the lonely road i watched the sun go down in the trees behind thornfield and then in the silence i heard a horse approaching suddenly there was a crash as the horse slipped and fell on the ice bringing down its rider i ran to see if i could help the traveller who was swearing furiously as he pulled himself free of his horse are you hurt sir can i do anything i asked just stand back he growled as he lifted himself painfully to his feet obviously his leg hurt him and he sat down quickly if you need help sir i can fetch someone either from thornfield hall or from hay i offered thank you but i dont need anyone i havent broken any bones he replied crossly i could see him clearly in the moonlight he was of medium height with wide shoulders and a strong chest he had a dark face with angrylooking eyes and was about thirtyfive if he had been a young attractive gentleman i would have been too shy to offer help but as he was not handsome and even quite rough i felt i wanted to help him i cant leave you sir so late on this lonely road till i see you are fit enough to get on your horse i insisted he looked at me for the first time when i said this i think you ought to be at home yourself he answered do you live near here in that house over there i said and im not at all afraid of being out at night im just going to hay to post a letter and ill be happy to take a message for you you live in in that house he asked surprised pointing to thornfield hall which was lit up in the moonlight yes sir i replied whose house is it he asked mr rochesters do you know mr rochester was his next question no ive never seen him i answered you arent a servant at thornfield hall of course you must behe hesitated looking at my plain black dress he seemed puzzled to know who i was so i helped him i am the governess ah the governess i had forgotten he tried to get up but his leg was still hurting him badly i dont want you to fetch help but you could help me yourself if you like of course sir i said and so he leaned his weight on my shoulder and i helped him walk to his horse in a moment he had jumped on to the horses back thank you now take your letter to hay then hurry home he called as he rode off into the distance i walked on glad to have helped someone to have done something active for once in my mind i saw that dark strong face and i still felt excited by our meeting even when i arrived back at thornfield i did not go in for a while i did not want to go into the dark house where i would spend the evening quietly with old mrs fairfax so i stayed outside staring up at the moon and the stars with a beating heart wishing and dreaming of a different more exciting life when i entered the servants told me that mr rochester had arrived and that he had hurt his leg when his horse slipped on ice on the road to hay chapter eight getting to know mr rochester thornfield hall became quite busy the next day now that the master had returned people kept coming to visit him on business i enjoyed the new cheerful atmosphere but i could not make adele concentrate on her lessons because she was constantly talking about the presents mr rochester had promised to bring her that evening we were invited to have tea with him i immediately recognized the traveller i had helped with his dark hair and skin his square forehead and his stern look his leg was supported on a chair but he made no effort to greet me when i entered in fact he neither spoke nor moved have you brought a present for miss eyre with you as well adele asked him a present who wants a present he said angrily did you expect a present miss eyre do you like presents i havent much experience of them sir i answered anyway i have no right to expect a present as i havent done anything to deserve one dont be so modest ive been talking to adele shes not very clever but youve taught her well sir that is my present thats what a teacher wants most praise of her pupils progress mr rochester drank his tea in silence after tea he called me closer to the fire while adele played with mrs fairfax where were you before you came here he asked i was at lowood school sir for eight years ah yes a charity school eight years im surprised you lasted so long in such a place there is something like magic in your face when i met you on the road to hay last night i almost thought you had put a spell on my horse i still wonder if you did what about your parents theyre dead i dont remember them and your relations i have none who recommended you to come here i advertised and mrs fairfax answered the advertisement yes said the old housekeeper and i thank god she did shes a good teacher for adele and a kind friend to me dont try to give her a good character mrs fairfax said mr rochester sternly she and her magic made my horse slip on the ice last night mrs fairfax looked puzzled and clearly did not understand miss eyre continued mr rochester how old were you when you started at lowood about ten and you stayed there eight years so you are now eighteen i nodded i would never have been able to guess your age he went on now what did you learn there can you play the piano a little of course thats what all young women say go and play a tune on the piano in the library i did as he asked thats enough he called after a few minutes yes you do indeed play a little just like any schoolgirl better than some perhaps now bring me your sketches i fetched them from my room having looked carefully at them he chose three these are interesting he said you have only expressed the shadow of your ideas because you arent good enough at drawing or painting but the ideas where did they come from who taught you to draw wind and space and feeling but put them away now miss eyre do you realize its nine oclock adele should be in bed by now good night to you all mr rochesters mood had suddenly changed and he clearly wished to be alone later that evening i talked to mrs fairfax you said mr rochester was a little peculiar i said well what do you think miss eyre i think he is very peculiar and quite rude he may seem like that to a stranger im so used to him that i never notice it and he has had family troubles you know but he has no family i answered not now thats true but he did have an older brother who died nine years ago nine years is a long time surely he has recovered from losing his brother by now well there was a lot of bad feeling in the family the father was very fond of money and wanted to keep the family property together so the elder brother inherited most of it i dont know what happened but i do know mr edward thats the master quarrelled with his family thats why hes travelled so much when his brother died he inherited thornfield but im not surprised he doesnt come here often why should he stay away i asked surprised perhaps he thinks its a sad place i really dont know it was clear that mrs fairfax would not tell me any more one evening a few days later i was invited to talk to mr rochester after dinner at the far end of the room adele was delightedly telling mrs fairfax about the presents she had received mr rochester called me closer to the fire i dont like the conversation of children or old ladies he murmured to me but they are entertaining each other at the moment so i can amuse myself tonight he did not look so stern and there was a softness in his fine dark eyes as i was looking at him he suddenly turned and caught my look do you think im handsome miss eyre he asked normally i would have taken time to think and said something polite but somehow i answered at once no sir ah you really are unusual you are a quiet serious little person but you can be almost rude sir im sorry i should have said that beauty doesnt matter or something like that no you shouldnt i see you criticize my appearance and then you stab me in the back all right tell me what is wrong with my appearance mr rochester i didnt intend to criticize you well now you can look at my head do you think i am intelligent he pointed to his huge square forehead i do sir is it rude to ask if you are also good stabbing me again just because i said i didnt like talking to old ladies and children well young lady i wanted to be good when i was younger but life has been a struggle for me and ive become as hard and tough as a rubber ball i only have a little goodness left inside he was speaking rather excitedly and i thought perhaps he had been drinking miss eyre you look puzzled tonight i want conversation its your turn speak i said nothing but smiled coldly im sorry if im rude miss eyre but im twenty years older and more experienced than you dont you think i have the right to command you no sir not just because youre older and more experienced than me you would have the right only if youd made good use of your experience of life i dont accept that as ive made very bad use of my experience but will you agree to obey my orders anyway i thought he is peculiar hes forgotten that hes paying me a year to obey his orders and i said not many masters bother to ask if their servants are offended by their orders of course id forgotten that i pay you a salary so will you agree because of the salary no sir not because of that but because you forgot about it and because you care whether a servant of yours is comfortable or not i gladly agree you have honesty and feeling there are not many girls like you but perhaps i go too fast perhaps you have awful faults to counterbalance your few good points and perhaps you have too i thought he seemed to read my mind and said quickly yes youre right i have plenty of faults i went the wrong way when i was twentyone and have never found the right path again i might have been very different i might have been as good as you and perhaps wiser i am not a bad man take my word for it but i have done wrong it wasnt my character but circumstances which were to blame why do i tell you all this because youre the sort of person people tell their problems and secrets to because youre sympathetic and give them hope do you think so sir i do you see when life was difficult i became desperate and now all i have is regret asking forgiveness might cure it sir no it wont what i really should do is change my character and i still could but its difficult and if i cant have happiness i want pleasure even if its wrong pleasure may taste bitter sir how do you know a pure young thing like you you have no experience of life and its problems but i will try to lead a better life i stood up the conversation was becoming hard to follow i must put adele to bed now i said dont be afraid of me miss eyre you dont relax or laugh very much perhaps because of the effect lowood school has had on you but in time you will be more natural with me and laugh and speak freely youre like a restless bird in a cage when you get out of the cage youll fly very high good night chapter nine mr rochesters past soon i discovered what mr rochester meant when he said he had done wrong one afternoon while walking in the gardens of thornfield he told me the story of his loveaffair in paris with a french dancer celine yes miss eyre i was young and foolish then i was so in love with her that i rented a house and hired servants for her i gave her a carriage and jewels in fact i threw away a fortune on her just like any fool in love one evening i visited her but found she was out so i waited on her balcony smoking a cigar i heard her carriage arriving imagine my horror at seeing her step out followed by a man youre so young youve never felt love or jealousy have you miss eyre you are floating along a quiet river now you dont see the water boiling at the foot of the great rocks but one day youll come to a point in lifes stream where the wild force of the waves may destroy you where the noisy rushing water may drown you i am calm enough now calm enough to like living here at thornfield i like it because its old and grey and dark and yet i hate he did not finish what he was saying staring angrily up at the windows on the top floor of his house it was a look of disgust pain and shame i could not understand what he meant and wanted to hear more about celine so i encouraged him to finish the story what happened when she entered the house sir oh id forgotten celine by the way its strange my telling you all this but i know my secrets safe with you and i know too that it cant have an evil influence on you your minds too strong for that yes i listened to her conversation with her lover an elegant young fool and i knew i was no longer in love with her so i walked into the room told her our relationship was over and challenged her lover to fight me next day i shot him in the arm during our fight thought that was the end of the whole thing and left france but a few months before celine had had a baby girl adele and she claimed that adele was my child she may be although i doubt it so when a few years later celine abandoned adele and ran away to italy with a singer i went to paris and brought adele back to grow up in england i felt proud that mr rochester had trusted me with the story of his past life i thought a lot about his character and although i was aware of his faults i also saw his goodness and kindness to me from now on my happiest moments were spent with him i could not have imagined a better companion one night i was woken by a slight noise i felt sure someone was outside my bedroom door as i hurried to lock it i called whos there there was a strange inhuman sound then i heard a door shut upstairs on the top floor was that grace poole i wondered trembling my curiosity made me open the door and i found the corridor full of smoke i saw it was coming from mr rochesters door which was slightly open i completely forgot my fears and rushed into his room he lay fast asleep surrounded by flames and smoke even his sheets were on fire wake up wake up i shouted desperately throwing water over him to put out the flames not until the fire was almost out did he wake up swearing to find himself so wet is there a flood he cried no sir i answered but theres been a fire jane eyre is it you and your magic he asked have you put a spell on me again did you intend to drown me this time please get up sir someone has plotted to kill you and i explained what i had heard and how i had put out the fire he looked very serious and thought for a few seconds shall i fetch mrs fairfax sir or the servants i asked no why bother them just stay here for a moment im going up to the top floor dont call anyone ill be back soon i waited cold and tired in his room for what seemed a very long time then i saw the light of his candle approaching through the darkness and he appeared looking pale and depressed did you see anything when you opened your bedroom door he asked glancing sharply at me no sir only a candle on the floor but you heard a strange laugh did you say yes ive heard it before grace poole laughs like that thats it it must have been grace poole youve guessed it i shall consider what to do about it but meanwhile im glad youre the only person who knows anything about all this say nothing to anybody else and now go back to your own room good night then sir i said moving towards the door what are you leaving me already he said seeming surprised although he had just told me to go and so coldly you said i should go sir but not without saying goodbye not without a kind word or two why youve saved my life i hate being in debt to anyone but with you its different jane im happy to owe you my life his voice was trembling as he took both my hands in his i knew when i first saw you that you would do me good i saw it in your eyes when i met you i was right to like your smile and the magic in your face there was energy in his voice and a strange light in his eyes im glad i happened to be awake i said but i must go now im cold i knew i could not control my feelings much longer and i needed time to think but he still held on to my hands then i thought of a way of escaping i think i hear the servants moving sir i said well leave me he said and let me go that night or what was left of it i could not sleep my mind was full of confusing pictures and disturbed emotions chapter ten the mystery of grace poole after this sleepless night i was eager to see mr rochester in the morning but there was no sign of him he had obviously told the servants that he had accidentally set fire to his room by knocking over a lighted candle as i passed his bedroom i saw grace poole sitting inside calmly mending the curtains she certainly did not look desperate or mad enough to have tried to murder her master but i decided to investigate good morning grace i said entering the room tell me what happened last night the servants are talking about it good morning miss she replied looking up innocently well master was reading in bed and fell asleep so he must have knocked the candle over it set fire to the sheets but luckily he managed to put the flames out with some water how strange i said quietly didnt anybody hear what was happening at this she seemed to examine me carefully mrs fairfax and you sleep nearest this room miss mrs fairfax is a heavy sleeper like most old people and didnt hear anything but youre young miss perhaps you heard a noise i did i whispered im sure i heard a strange laugh she went on sewing calmly i dont think master would have laughed when he was in such danger she said you must have been dreaming no i wasnt dreaming i replied sharply you didnt think of opening your door and looking out into the corridor she asked i suddenly realized that if she suspected i knew of her guilt she might attack me no in fact i locked my door i answered and i shall lock it every night from now on thats wise of you miss we might have burglars at thornfield one day you never know i was amazed by her selfcontrol and could not understand why mr rochester had not asked the police to arrest her or at least dismissed her from his service why had he asked me to keep the attack a secret how could such a proud gentleman be so much in the power of one of his servants that he could not even punish her for trying to kill him did she know a terrible secret from his past which she had threatened to tell could he ever have been in love with her no i thought he could never love anyone as plain and coarse as she is but then im not beautiful either and i sometimes think he loves me last night his words his look his voice and my cheeks were red as i thought of those precious moments i was now even more impatient to see mr rochester but when i was having tea with mrs fairfax in the afternoon the first thing she said was its fine weather for the masters journey journey i cried i didnt know hed gone anywhere oh yes he went off just after breakfast to visit a family in a big house about sixteen miles away i know theyve invited a lot of guests wholl be staying in the house mr rochester is always very popular with the ladies at these parties so he may not come back for a week or so who are the ladies at this houseparty three sisters very elegant young ladies and their friends blanche and mary ingram but blanche is the most beautiful of all i saw her when she came to a christmas party at thornfield six or seven years ago what does she look like she was eighteen then a lovely girl with beautiful skin long curling black hair and fine black eyes which shone as brightly as her jewels she looked like a queen all the gentlemen admired her not only for her beauty but also for her musical skills when she and mr rochester sang together it was a delight to hear mr rochester i didnt know he could sing oh yes he has a very fine voice and then she played the piano later the master said she played extremely well and this beautiful lady isnt married yet no i dont think she or her sister has much money but im surprised some rich gentleman hasnt fallen in love with her mr rochester for example hes rich isnt he oh yes but you see theres a considerable difference in age hes nearly forty and shes only twentyfive well marriages like that happen every day do you think but i was interrupted by adele who came to join us and the subject was changed that night in my room i was stern with myself you jane eyre i accused my reflection in the mirror you are the biggest fool in the world how could you imagine that a gentleman of family and wealth would love you a plain little governess just look at yourself and i decided that next day i would draw an honest sketch of myself and then one of blanche ingram painting the most lovely face i could imagine according to mrs fairfaxs description in the future if ever my old feelings about mr rochester began to return i would only have to glance at the two pictures to see the great difference between us and in this way common sense would destroy my foolish dreams chapter eleven the thornfield houseparty two disappointing weeks passed before we heard from mr rochester again during this time i tried hard to forget my feeling for him i reminded myself that he paid me to teach adele nothing more and that no other relationship could exist between us when his letter finally came mrs fairfax announced with great excitement that he was planning a houseparty at thornfield he was going to return in three days time and had invited a large number of ladies and gentlemen to stay for several days we all worked extremely hard in the next few days cleaning all the rooms and preparing the food the only person in the house who did not appear excited was grace poole who stayed in her room upstairs coming down once a day for food and drink none of the servants seemed at all curious about her but i once heard two of the maids talking and i listened when i caught her name does grace poole earn a lot then asked one oh yes five times what you and i earn answered the other but shes good at the work i expect said the first ah she understands what she has to do thats true answered the second and not everyone would want to do her job not even for all that money quite right i wonder whether the master suddenly they saw me and broke off their conversation doesnt she know i heard one of them whisper no said the other and they were silent so i realized there was a secret at thornfield which nobody wanted to tell me at last the great day came everything was ready for the master and his guests adele and i watched from an upstairs window as the carriages arrived in front rode mr rochester on his black horse and with him rode a beautiful lady her black curls streaming in the wind blanche ingram i thought we listened to the laughing and talking in the hall as the guests were welcomed by their host and his housekeeper from a dark corner of the stairs we admired the ladies as they went up to their rooms and then again as they descended to dinner in their elegant evening dresses adele was hoping mr rochester would call her down to meet the guests but in the end she was so tired with all the excitement that she and i both went to bed early next morning after breakfast the whole group went out for the day again i saw mr rochester and blanche ingram riding together i pointed this out to mrs fairfax you see mr rochester clearly prefers her to any of the other ladies yes he does seem to admire her admitted the housekeeper and she admires him notice how she looks at him but i havent really seen her face yet id like to youll see her tonight answered mrs fairfax i mentioned to the master that adele wanted to be introduced to the ladies and he asked you to bring her down to meet them this evening well ill go if he wants me to but i dont like meeting strangers im not used to it i understand how you feel said the old lady kindly but the guests wont notice you much and you can easily escape after a short time so adele and i dressed in our best were waiting as the ladies came into the sittingroom after dinner i was most impressed by the beauty and elegance of all of them but was especially fascinated by the ingram family lady ingram although between forty and fifty was still a fine woman her hair still looked black by candle light at least and her teeth still seemed perfect but she had fierce proud eyes that reminded me of aunt reeds and a hard powerful voice her daughter mary was rather quiet but her other daughter blanche was very different as soon as the gentlemen came into the room and coffee was served she became the centre of attention she played the piano excellently she sang sweetly she discussed intelligently and all the time her flashing eyes rich black curls and fine figure attracted glances from every gentleman in the room but i was looking for someone else the last time i had seen him on the night of the fire he had held my hands told me i had saved his life and looked at me as if he loved me how close we had been then but now he entered the room without even looking at me and took a seat with the ladies i could not stop looking at him rather like a thirsty man who knows the water is poisoned but cannot resist drinking i had never intended to love him i had tried hard to destroy all feelings of love for him but now that i saw him again i could not stop myself loving him i compared him to the other gentlemen present they were all fine handsome men but they did not have his power his character his strength or indeed his deep laugh or his gentle smile i felt that he and i were the same sort of person that there was something in my brain and heart in my blood and bone that connected me to him for ever and although i knew i must hide my feelings must never allow myself to hope i also knew that while there was breath in my body i would always love him just then i heard blanche ingram say to him mr rochester you should have sent that little girl adele is that her name to school but i see you have a governess for her i saw a strange little person with her just now has she gone oh no there she is on the windowseat its very foolish of you you know governesses arent worth their salary are they mamma my dear dont mention governesses to me cried lady ingram holding a white hand to her forehead how i have suffered with them one of the older ladies whispered to her pointing in my direction oh i dont care if she hears me said lady ingram all governesses are useless they never teach children anything what fun we used to have playing tricks on them didnt we mary laughed blanche but governesses are boring lets change the subject mr rochester will you sing with me with pleasure he answered bowing and the group moved towards the piano this was the moment for me to escape but i had only just left the sittingroom and reached the hall when mr rochester appeared through another door come back youre leaving too early he said to me im tired sir he looked at me for a minute and a little depressed why tell me nothing its nothing sir im not depressed but i think you are youre almost crying but i havent got time now to discover the reason well tonight you may leave early but i want to see you with my guests every evening good night my he stopped bit his lip and turned quickly away those were cheerful busy days at thornfield the old house had never seen so much life and activity when it was fine the host and his guests went riding visited places of interest and walked in the gardens and when it was wet they played games indoors mr rochester and blanche ingram were always together observing them closely i felt very sure that he would soon marry this fine lady but i did not feel jealous because i knew he did not love her she had made every effort to attract him but he had not given her his heart i saw her faults very clearly she was intelligent but had no opinions of her own she was beautiful but not good she spoke of feelings but she knew nothing of sympathy or pity and above all she had her mothers pride and hardness other eyes apart from mine saw all these faults mr rochester himself knew she was not perfect but he was clearly preparing to marry her perhaps because she was of good family perhaps for some other reason one day when mr rochester was out alone on business a stranger arrived in a carriage and introduced himself as an old friend of the masters his name was mason and he had just returned from the west indies where mr rochester had once lived chapter twelve the gipsy woman no sooner had mr mason joined the group of guests than a servant entered to announce the arrival of an old gipsy woman who was supposed to be a skilled fortuneteller the ladies were very excited and decided to ask her to tell their fortunes miss ingram as usual was first and spent fifteen minutes alone with the old woman in the library she came back looking cross its just childish nonsense how can you all believe in that sort of thing she said picking up a book and pretending to read it but as she frowned more and more and did not turn a page i assumed that the gipsys words were more important to her than she wanted us to think next three young ladies went in together and came back full of praise for the gipsys skill shes old and dirty and ugly they cried shocked but she knows everything about us everything while the gentlemen were calming them down the servant entered the room again excuse me miss he said to me the gipsy says theres another young single lady in the room she refuses to leave the house until she has seen all the young ladies it must be you oh ill go i said gladly i was curious to see the gipsy she was sitting in an armchair in the library murmuring words over a little black book her large black hat covered most of her face but when she lifted her head i saw her dark eyes so you want me to tell your fortune she asked well i must warn you i dont believe in your skill i expected that why dont you tremble im not cold why dont you turn pale im not ill why dont you ask me to tell your fortune im not a fool the old woman laughed and started smoking a short black pipe i can prove that youre cold and ill and a fool she said listen youre cold because youre alone youre ill because you lack love and youre a fool because love is near you and you wont take one step to reach it thats true of many people i said interested yes but especially true of you i can see that happiness is waiting for you if you really want it tell me in that room of fine people isnt there one face you look at one person youre interested in i hardly know the ladies and gentlemen here i answered well you surely know the master of the house what do you think of his relationship with his guests and with one particular guest asked the gipsy smiling wickedly theyre all very friendly with each other i replied cautiously the gipsy seemed to know a lot about thornfield friendly id say more than that in fact id go so far as to mention the name of blanche ingram and the word marriage they will obviously be an extremely happy couple although i told miss ingram something about the rochester property which made her look quite depressed if a wealthier gentleman comes along mr rochester might lose his beautiful bride but i came to hear about my future not mr rochesters it depends on whether youre going to stretch out your hand for happiness let me look at your face your eyes and your mouth show me that feelings are important to you but your forehead shows me that common sense is your main guide in life you will never do anything wrong or shameful well i respect that i dont want sacrifice or sorrow in my life i want but that will do id like to stay here looking at you for ever but i must stop acting now was i dreaming what was happening the old womans voice had changed and become as familiar to me as my own well jane do you know me asked the familiar voice and struggling with the old clothes mr rochester stepped out of his disguise sir youve been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense its hardly fair do you forgive me jane i shall try to sir but you shouldnt have done it what are my guests doing jane discussing the gipsy i imagine oh and did you know that a stranger has arrived to see you a stranger i wasnt expecting anyone who can it be his names mason sir and he comes from the west indies the smile froze on mr rochesters lips and his face went white mason the west indies he repeated three times do you feel ill sir i asked worried jane help me he murmured almost falling i helped him to sit down and sat with him he took my hand and rubbed it gently i wish i were on an island with you and nobody else with no trouble or danger or terrible memories to make me suffer how can i help you sir id give my life to help you jane if i need help ill ask you i promise get me a glass of wine now i fetched one from the diningroom and gave it to him he looked less pale but very stern jane if all those fine guests of mine came and spat at me what would you do he asked turn them out of the house sir if i could but if they only looked at me coldly and whispered behind their hands about me and then left me one by one id stay with you sir to comfort you and if the whole world disapproved of me would you still stay with me if you deserved my friendship as im sure you do i wouldnt care about other peoples disapproval thank you jane now go and ask mr mason to come and see me so i did and leaving the two men in the library went to bed much later i heard him showing mr mason to his bedroom and was glad that mr rochester sounded so cheerful chapter thirteen the stranger is attacked i was woken by the full moon shining in on me as i had forgotten to draw my curtains suddenly a wild terrible cry broke the silence echoing throughout the house my heart missed a beat what could it mean it came from the top floor then i heard the sounds of a desperate struggle just above my room help help help wont anyone help me rochester rochester for gods sake come shouted a voice from upstairs bedroom doors were opened as the guests woke up whats happening fetch a candle is it a fire are there burglars wheres rochester he isnt in his room here i am called the master of the house descending with a candle from the top floor its all right dont be afraid ladies a servants had a bad dream thats all and started screaming nothing to worry about please go back to your rooms youll catch cold otherwise and so he calmed his guests and persuaded them to return to their rooms but i knew that the sounds i had heard could have nothing to do with a servants dream so i dressed and waited in my room in case i was needed after about an hour when thornfield hall was completely silent again there was a cautious knock on my door are you awake jane asked the voice i had been expecting yes sir and dressed good i need you come and help me bring a clean cloth with you we went quietly up to the top floor where he unlocked one of the small black doors do you feel faint at the sight of blood he asked i dont think so i replied we entered a room with curtains hung on the walls one of the curtains was tied back to reveal a secret door into another small room from there came an angry growling sound almost like a dog wait here said mr rochester and went into the secret room where a shout of laughter greeted him ah so grace poole was there he came out quickly and closed the secret door then he showed me why he needed me in an armchair lay mr mason his clothes and his arm covered in blood as we bent over him he opened his eyes and groaned am i going to die he murmured weakly no man dont be foolish its just a scratch answered mr rochester now jane turning to me ill have to leave you in this room with mason while i fetch the doctor you must wipe away the blood with the damp cloth like this and help him to drink a little water but on no account must you speak to him is that understood i nodded and nervously watched him leave the room i could hear him turning the key in the lock so here i was in the middle of the night locked in with a bleeding dying man and a wild murdering woman only the other side of a door it seemed a long night interrupted only by masons groans and by occasional animallike noises from the secret room i had plenty of time to wonder why these violent attacks happened first the fire in mr rochesters room and now a physical attack on a stranger and how was mr mason involved why was he here on the top floor i had heard his host showing him to a bedroom near mine on the second floor and why was mr rochester so frightened when mr mason came to thornfield at last mr rochester arrived with the doctor who cleaned and bandaged masons wounds strange remarked the doctor the skin on the shoulder has been torn by teeth as well as a knife she bit me murmured mason when rochester managed to get the knife from her well i warned you not to see her alone said rochester you should have waited till the morning then we could have seen her together dont worry man when you get back to the west indies you can forget her think of her as dead and buried now doctor is mason ready to be moved i have a carriage waiting outside youll take him home with you to avoid gossip and then in a few days hell be fit enough to leave the country although it was now early morning the house was still in total silence and so there were no witnesses to see mason being helped downstairs and put in the carriage look after him doctor said rochester goodbye dick edward make sure shes taken care of make sure shes treated well mason could not continue but burst into tears ill do my best dick as i always have done replied rochester shutting the door of the carriage which rolled away but i wish there was an end to it he murmured to himself as we were walking back through the garden to the house he said to me jane youve had a strange night you look pale were you afraid when i left you alone with mason not of mason sir but of grace poole in the secret room but id locked her door i would never leave you in danger will she go on living here sir i asked oh yes dont think about her but im sure your life is in danger while shes here dont worry i can take care of myself im in more danger while masons in england i live in constant fear of a disaster but mr masons weak you have great influence with him yes he wouldnt knowingly hurt me but by one careless word he could destroy if not my life at least my chance of happiness sit down with me on this bench jane i want to ask you something the early sun warmed the bench and the birds were singing now jane suppose a boy in a foreign country makes a mistake not a crime mind you the results of this mistake have a terrible effect on his whole life he comes home after years of suffering and meets someone who is fresh and good and pure now can he ignore society can he forget the past and live the rest of his life with her in peace it was a difficult question to answer in the end i said you cant rely on a human being to cure you of evil and give you peace you must ask gods help but i think ive found the cure its he paused i held my breath i almost thought the birds would stop singing to hear the name he was going to say yes he said in quite a different hard voice youve noticed my love for miss ingram havent you dont you think shell cure me of my wickedness jane oh i can hear some of the guests in the garden go into the house by the back door as i went one way and he another i heard him say cheerfully to the gentlemen masons already left i got up early to say goodbye to him chapter fourteen trouble at gateshead when i was a child at gateshead bessie the nursemaid used to say that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble to come for a whole week now i had dreamed of a small child every night and perhaps bessie was right as a message came from gateshead it appeared that my cousin john reed who had spent and wasted all his money and some of his mothers and been in debt or in prison most of his life had killed himself a week before and then mrs reed whose health had been badly affected by worrying about her son had suddenly fallen ill when she heard of his death although she could hardly speak she had recently managed to express a wish to see me and so my cousins eliza and georgiana had sent their coachman robert to bring me back to gateshead i felt i could not refuse to see my aunt perhaps for the last time so i went to ask mr rochesters permission to leave thornfield for a while i found him talking to miss ingram who looked at me in disgust when i interrupted their conversation well jane what is it he asked when we had left the room full of guests and gone into the library please sir i would like permission to visit my aunt who is ill for a week or two your aunt you told me you had no relations i have none who love me sir shes mrs reed my uncles wife her son has died recently i really cant neglect her now that she is dying what nonsense jane rushing off to visit an old lady who has never loved you but i see youve decided to go where does she live and how long will you stay she lives at gateshead sir a hundred miles away ill stay as short a time as i can promise me only to stay a week i cant promise sir i might have to stay longer and you certainly cant travel a hundred miles alone theyve sent the coachman for me sir ill leave tomorrow mr rochester thought for a while well youll need some money i havent paid you any salary yet how much have you in the world jane he asked smiling i showed him my tiny purse he took it and laughed as he counted the few coins then he took out his wallet here is he said offering me a note but you only owe me sir i cried on second thoughts give me that back if you had perhaps you would stay away for three months here is is that enough now you owe me sir i pointed out youll have to come back for it then he said laughing theres something else sir youve told me youre going to marry soon in that case adele should go to boarding school to get her out of my lovely brides way a very sensible suggestion but what about you i must find another job somewhere ill advertise dont you dare he growled promise me jane not to look for another job ill take care of that ill promise sir if you promise that adele and i will be out of your house before your bride enters it very well and now we must say goodbye goodbye mr rochester i set out early the next morning and travelled all day as i approached gateshead hall i realized it was nine years since i had left it in that time i had made some friends gained much selfconfidence and finally lost my hatred of the reeds i was delighted to see my old friend bessie again she had married robert the coachman and was very busy with her three young children the house itself had not changed at all but my cousins certainly had eliza was now very tall and thin with a rather sour face dressed in very plain clothes and with a cross hanging round her neck georgiana on the other hand was still pretty but very fat and wore extremely fashionable clothes they did not seem pleased to see me in fact they more or less ignored me but i hardly noticed their rudeness i told the housekeeper that i would be staying for several days and then went straight to my aunts room i remembered it well from my childhood i had often been called there to be punished bending over her bed i kissed her how are you dear aunt i asked i had sworn never to call her aunt again but i did not regret breaking that promise to myself i held her hand are you jane eyre she asked her face although deathly pale was as stern as ever and she removed her hand from mine that child was more trouble to me than anyone would believe i was glad to send her to lowood and john poor john he needs so much money where can i get more money from what will happen she seemed very confused and excited so i left her to sleep her illness got worse in the next few days i spent some time every day looking after her and the rest of the time with my cousins listening to their plans for the future eliza was planning to join a religious community after her mothers death but georgiana was hoping to stay in london with relations to see the new fashions and go to all the parties it was quite clear they had no real feeling for their mother and were almost looking forward to her death one dark stormy night i visited the dying woman she lay there asleep in her room neglected by her daughters and servants as i looked out of the window into the black emptiness i wondered about the great mystery of death and thought of helen burns who was so sure her spirit would go to heaven would my aunts spirit go there too who are you i heard the sick woman murmuring i wanted to see jane eyre i must tell her something i am jane eyre aunt i told her gently i know im very ill she said weakly before i die i must confess what ive done wrong first i broke my promise to my husband about you and second she broke off after all perhaps i dont need to tell her she said to herself and then no its no good i know im dying i must tell her and quickly jane eyre take the letter from the top drawer of my desk and read it i did so it said madeira dear mrs reed please inform me of the address of my niece jane eyre as i am unmarried with no children and fairly wealthy i would like her to come to madeira to live with me and to inherit all my property when i die john eyre why did i never hear of this i asked amazed i hated you so much that i wrote back to him telling him you had died of typhus fever at lowood that was my revenge on you for causing me so much trouble she cried angrily dear aunt i said dont think about that any more i was only a child its not surprising i was a nuisance you were always so angry and violent such a wicked child not as wicked as you think i would have loved you if youd let me forget it all and kiss me now aunt but it was too late for her to break the habit of dislike and she turned away from me poor woman she died soon afterwards keeping her hatred of me alive in her heart and no one at gateshead cried for her chapter fifteen the future mrs rochester so i set out on the long journey back to thornfield mrs fairfax had written to me while i was at gateshead telling me that the guests had all gone and mr rochester had gone to london to buy a carriage for his wedding it was clear that he would be getting married very soon after a long day sitting in the coach i decided to get out at millcote leave my luggage at the hotel and walk across the fields to thornfield it was a warm june evening and i felt glad to be going home i had to remind myself sternly that thornfield was not my permanent home and that the person i was so looking forward to seeing was perhaps not even thinking of me and then i saw him he was sitting on the gate ahead of me writing in a notebook he noticed me at once hallo he cried i was trembling at the unexpected sight of him and could not control my voice so i approached in silence so its jane eyre he continued why didnt you send for a carriage its just like you to come on foot from millcote now what have you been doing for a whole month ive been looking after my aunt sir whos just died you come from another world jane from the world of the dead i think you must be a spirit and absent for a whole month im sure youve quite forgotten me even though i knew i would soon lose him he had such power to make me happy that i was in heaven listening to him did mrs fairfax tell you ive been to london he asked oh yes sir she did and i expect she told you why i went there well you must see the carriage ive bought jane it will suit mrs rochester perfectly i only wish i were more handsome as shes so beautiful cant you put one of your spells on me to make me more attractive for her thats beyond the power of magic sir i replied while thinking to someone who loves you you are handsome enough mr rochester was sometimes able to read my thoughts but this time he just smiled warmly at me and opened the gate pass friend he said and welcome home i could have just walked past him in silence but something made me turn and say quickly before i could stop myself thank you mr rochester for your great kindness im glad to come back to you and wherever you are is my home my only home i ran across the field and into the house before he had time to answer two weeks passed after my return with no news of the wedding there were no preparations at thornfield and no visits to the ingram family who lived only a few miles away i almost began to hope it was the middle of summer and every day the sun shone on the green fields the white baked roads and the cool dark woods one evening after adele had gone to sleep i went into the garden i discovered a quiet place where i thought nobody would find me but then i noticed mr rochester had come into the garden too hoping to escape back to the house i crept quietly behind him while he was bending over to admire an insect but jane he said suddenly come and look at this beautiful insect oh now hes flown away no dont go back to the house jane on such a lovely night come and walk with me i could not find a reason for leaving him so i accompanied him in silence jane he began you like thornfield dont you and you even like little adele and old mrs fairfax dont you i do sir i really dont want to leave them what a pity he sighed thats what happens in life no sooner have you got used to a place than you have to move on do i have to move on sir leave thornfield im afraid you must jane then you are going to be married sir exactly jane and as you have pointed out when i take the lovely miss ingram as my bride you and adele must leave the house so im looking for a new job for you im sorry to cause you trouble i said miserably no trouble at all in fact ive already heard of a very good job which would be just right for you teaching the five daughters of an irish family youll like ireland i think theyre such friendly people he said cheerfully its such a long way away sir i was fighting to keep my tears back there was an icy coldness in my heart away from what jane from england and from thornfield and well from you sir i could not stop myself and burst into tears immediately it certainly is very far away he said calmly lets sit on this bench jane like old friends saying goodbye you know i sometimes feel as if you and i were connected by a string tying our two hearts together and if you went to ireland i think that string might break and i might bleed to death i wish i wish id never been born i cried i wish id never come to thornfield no longer able to control my feelings i poured out what was in my heart i cant bear to leave because here ive been treated kindly and because ive met you mr rochester and i cant bear never to see you again now i have to leave i feel as if im dying why do you have to leave he asked innocently why i repeated amazed because youre marrying miss ingram shes your bride my bride i have no bride he answered but i will have one and you must stay i cant stay i cried furiously do you think i can watch another woman become your bride do you think im a machine without feelings do you think because im small and poor and plain that i have no soul and no heart well youre wrong i have as much soul and heart as you it is my spirit that speaks to your spirit we are equal in the sight of god we are repeated mr rochester taking me in his arms and kissing me dont struggle jane like a wild restless bird let me go mr rochester i am no bird but a free human being and i managed to break away yes jane you are free to decide i ask you to walk through life with me to be my constant companion youre laughing at me youve already chosen your companion for life i was crying quietly while mr rochester looked gently and seriously at me jane he said i ask you to be my wife you are my equal jane will you marry me dont you believe me not at all i answered ill convince you listen i dont love miss ingram and she doesnt love me she only liked me for my wealth and when i disguised as the gipsy woman told her that i had only a little money she and her mother lost interest in me you strange magical spirit i love you you small and poor and plain i ask you to marry me you want to marry me i cried almost beginning to believe him but i have no friends no money no family i dont care jane say yes quickly its cruel to make me suffer like this give me my name say edward ill marry you he cried his face very pale in the moonlight are you serious do you really love me do you honestly want me to be your wife i asked i swear it then edward i will marry you my little wife he held me in his arms for a long time kissing me gently once he murmured no family thats good no family to interfere and then i dont care what people think and again and again are you happy jane i thought of nothing except the great happiness of being with him for ever but while we were talking the weather had changed a strong wind was now blowing and there was a loud crack of thunder suddenly rain poured down and although we hurried back to the house we were quite wet when we arrived in the hall we did not notice mrs fairfax standing in the shadows good night my darling he said kissing me repeatedly as i ran upstairs i caught sight of the old ladys shocked face tomorrow ill explain to her i thought just then i was too happy to think about anything except our bright future outside the storm continued furiously all night and in the morning we discovered that the great tree at the bottom of the garden which had stood for hundreds of years had been hit by lightning and torn in half chapter sixteen preparing for the wedding i was a little nervous before seeing mr rochester next morning was i really going to marry him or was it all a dream but i soon felt calmer when he came to meet me and kissed me jane you look well and smiling and pretty he said you will be jane rochester in four weeks time not a day more ill send for my family jewels which are kept in a london bank they are for my bride whether shes a great lady or a governess oh no sir i cried im too plain for jewels im not used to wearing them i insist jane today im taking you in the carriage to millcote to buy you some elegant clothes in a months time well have a quiet wedding in the local church and after a few days in london well travel through all the countries of europe well sir you seem very eager to please me but i wonder if you will agree to a request of mine ask me anything jane anything indeed i will this is my request i ask you not to give me jewels and fine clothes if thats really your wish i agree but cant you think of anything i can give you well id like you to give me the answer to a question he looked worried and turned away from me curiosity is dangerous he said i may not be able to agree to this particular request well what is it how stern you look i suppose thats how you will look when we are married this is what i want to know why did you take such trouble to make me believe you wished to marry miss ingram he stopped frowning at once and smiled down at me is that all what a relief all right i shall have to confess although you may be angry with me jane as angry as you were last night when you told me we were equal well i pretended to love miss ingram to make you madly jealous i wanted you to be as much in love with me as i was with you and i suppose you didnt care at all about poor miss ingrams feelings she only has one feeling pride were you jealous jane never mind mr rochester one more request please explain everything to mrs fairfax she looked so shocked last night when i visited the old housekeeper later that day i found she was amazed by the news that i was going to marry the master i would never have thought it she kept repeating mr rochester so proud and such a gentleman to marry his governess she examined me closely as if to discover the reason for this strange event and shook her head still puzzled hes twenty years older than you he could be your father no indeed mrs fairfax i replied crossly he looks much younger than that is he really going to marry you for love she asked i was so hurt by her amazement that tears came to my eyes why i asked do you think he couldnt possibly love me no no miss eyre but you must realize that this is a very unusual situation you must be careful of your reputation i advise you to keep him at a distance until you are married although i was upset by the old ladys words i followed her advice and in the weeks before the wedding i went on teaching adele as usual only in the evenings did i spend some time with mr rochester and i was careful not to allow him to hold me in his arms or kiss me sometimes he was angry with me and called me a hard little thing or a cruel spirit but i preferred that to being called my darling i saw that mrs fairfax approved of my correct behaviour and i knew that he respected me for it but it was not easy for me i would rather have shown him my love my future husband was becoming my whole world and more than that my hope of heaven at last the night before the wedding arrived my clothes were packed and i was ready but i was anxious to see mr rochester who had been away on business so i ran out of the quiet house to meet him on the road a wild stormy wind was blowing and in the garden i passed the wreck of the great tree then suddenly i saw him riding towards me you see he shouted you cant do without me jump up on to my horse together we rode back to thornfield while he ate dinner i sat quietly beside him he looked closely at me you look sad jane he said is anything wrong are you nervous about your new life no i replied firmly im not worried about that because i love you but last night i had a strange dream a terrible dream it was dark and windy outside and before i went to sleep i could hear a dog growling in the distance in my dream i was carrying a small child in my arms down a long road i was trying to catch up with you but i couldnt and you still worry about a foolish dream when im close to you but say you love me again jane i do love you edward but i havent finished my story is there more well go on i dreamed that thornfield was totally destroyed just a heap of stones i was still carrying the child but now i could see you riding away into the distance i knew you would never come back then i woke up thats all then jane nothing to worry about no wait there was candlelight in my room and a strange shape examining the wedding dress hanging in my cupboard my blood ran cold it wasnt mrs fairfax or any of the servants it wasnt even grace poole it was a horrible sight describe the shape jane it looked like a tall woman with long thick dark hair hanging down she took up the beautiful veil you bought me put it on her own head then turned to admire herself in the mirror it was then that i saw her wild inhuman face she removed the veil tore it in two and threw it on the floor and then mr rochester seemed almost nervous she came to my bedside put her candle close to my face and stared fiercely at me i must have fainted and i suppose she left now can you tell me who or what that woman was jane you are too sensitive that was just a dream dont think about it any more he answered comfortingly thats just what i said to myself when i woke up this morning but when i looked on the floor there was the veil torn in two halves i felt mr rochester suddenly tremble to think what might have happened he cried throwing his arms around me thank god it was only the veil after a few moments he said calmly now jane be sensible that woman must have been grace poole there is no other explanation perhaps youre right i admitted slowly one day ill explain to you why i keep her in my house but tonight go and sleep in adeles room youll be quite safe there just dream about our future chapter seventeen the wedding day we had no friends or family to accompany us to the church i had not told my reed cousins about our wedding but i had written to my uncle john eyre in madeira mr rochester was in such a hurry that he only allowed me a short time to put on my wedding dress and veil jane you look lovely he said but you can only have ten minutes for breakfast we almost ran up the road to the church his strong hand holding mine his dark face looked stern and he did not speak i did not notice the weather or my surroundings at all i only wanted to know why he looked so fierce suddenly he noticed how pale i was and stopped for a moment to let me get my breath back then we walked more slowly into the church the priest and the clerk were waiting for us there was nobody else except two strangers who were standing at the back of the church the ceremony began and soon i heard the priest come to the point in the wedding where he had to ask is there any reason why these two people should not be married the priest paused for a second as was the custom but before he could continue a voice from the back of the church said clearly there is a reason the priest looked up from his book and stood silent mr rochester said in his deep voice without turning his head continue with the ceremony silence fell again then the priest shook his head i must investigate this first he said one of the strangers from the back of the church came forward and said calmly and quietly this wedding cannot continue because mr rochester is already married i felt as if i had been hit mr rochesters whole face was like colourless marble without speaking or smiling he was holding me tightly round the waist as if he would never let go who are you he growled at the stranger and tell me what you know of this supposed wife of mine im a lawyer sir i have a certificate here proving that you married bertha mason in the west indies fifteen years ago that may prove ive been married but it doesnt prove that shes still alive i can produce a witness said the lawyer who has seen her alive recently produce him or go to hell said mr rochester here he is mr mason called the lawyer and the second stranger slowly approached from the shadows his pale face looking frightened mr rochester staring furiously at him raised his strong right arm to knock him down no cried mason trembling mr rochester dropped his arm and turned away in disgust sir said the priest frowning dont forget we are in the house of god mr mason please tell us if this gentlemans wife is still alive shes at thornfield hall replied mason in a weak voice im her brother and ive seen her there thornfield hall cried the priest ive lived here for years and ive never heard of a mrs rochester i was careful to keep her a secret murmured mr rochester frowning after a few minutes thought he announced i must reveal the truth i suppose there will be no wedding today no doubt god will punish me for this what this lawyer says is true ive been married and my wife still lives i was tricked into marrying her when i was young in the west indies madness runs in her family but they didnt tell me that now shes more of an animal than a woman i keep her locked away guarded by my old servant grace poole i invite you all to come to my house to see her and to judge whether i had the right to ask this innocent young girl to marry me follow me still holding me firmly he left the church followed by the others at the door of thornfield hall mrs fairfax adele and the servants rushed forward smiling to congratulate us too late cried the master waving them away your congratulations are fifteen years too late we all went up to the top floor and entered the room where mason had been attacked mr rochester lifted the curtain opened the secret door and showed us the little room grace poole was making soup over a fire and behind her a shape crawled on the floor it was hard to say whether it was animal or human it growled like a wild animal but it wore clothes and had long thick dark hair how are you mrs poole asked the master and how is your patient today not bad sir answered grace but be careful shell try and bite you if she sees you sir just then the shape turned and with a fierce cry attacked mr rochester violently i recognized her dark ugly face they struggled for a moment and then he held her down and with mrs pooles help tied her to a chair he turned to the others with a bitter smile you see gentlemen this is my wife this is the partner i have to live with for ever and instead i wished to have this laying his hand on my shoulder this young girl can you honestly blame me compare the two and then judge me we all left the room silently as we went downstairs the lawyer said to me i know you werent aware of this miss eyre nobody will blame you and mr mason will tell your uncle so when he goes back to madeira my uncle do you know him i asked surprised im his lawyer mr mason and he have often done business together on his way back to the west indies mr mason stopped in madeira and stayed with mr eyre who mentioned that his niece was going to marry a mr rochester yes i wrote to tell him i was getting married i said well when mr mason explained that mr rochester was already married your uncle sent him straight back to england to prevent you from marrying and making a terrible mistake im afraid your uncle is very ill and will probably die soon so i think you had better stay in england until you receive further news of him after the gentlemen had left i entered my room and locked the door slowly i took off my wedding dress and veil i was weak and exhausted and only just beginning to realize what had happened could i ever again trust the being i had turned into a sort of god i would not think of him as evil but he could not have felt real love for me how foolish i had been to believe him and love him so much my hopes were all dead and my future was empty i lay on my bed faint and wishing for death while darkness swam around me chapter eighteen mr rochesters explanation sometime in the afternoon i recovered a little but i felt faint as i stood up and realized i had not eaten anything all day so i opened my bedroom door and almost fell over mr rochester who was sitting in a chair just outside ive been waiting for you all this time jane he said and i havent heard you scream or shout or cry arent you angry with me i never meant to hurt you will you ever forgive me he sounded so sincere that i forgave him at once in my heart scold me jane tell me how wicked i am he said sir i cant i feel tired and weak i want some water he took me in his arms and carried me downstairs to the library where he put me in front of the fire and gave me a glass of wine i began to feel better he bent to kiss me but i turned my face determinedly away what he cried you refuse to kiss me because im bertha masons husband is that it yes sir i know you very well jane i know how firm you are when youve decided something youre planning to destroy my hope of happiness you intend to be a stranger to me from now on and if im friendly towards you in future youll remind yourself that man nearly made me his mistress i must be icecold to him and icecold is what youll be its true sir i said trying to stop my voice from trembling that everything around me has changed so i must change too adele must have a new governess oh adele will go to boarding school ive already decided that and you and i will both leave this house this narrow stone hell this house of living death we can never be happy here under the same roof as that woman oh i hate her you shouldnt hate her sir i said its not her fault shes mad poor thing jane my darling its not because shes mad that i hate her if you were mad i wouldnt hate you id look after you lovingly but why talk of madness we are all ready to travel everything is packed tomorrow well leave i have a place to go to where nobody will find us or talk about us and take adele with you sir shell be a companion for you i interrupted i knew i had to tell him soon adele what do you mean jane shes going to school i dont want her i want you with me do you understand i did but i slowly shook my head he was becoming angry and was staring fiercely at me he looked as if he was about to lose control i was not at all afraid because i knew i still had the power to calm him so i took his hand and stroked it saying sit down sir ill talk or listen to you as long as you like i had been struggling with tears for some time and now i let them flow freely it was a great relief dont cry jane please be calm he begged how can i be calm when youre so angry im not angry but i love you so much and your pale little face looked so stern and decided he tried to put his arm round me but i would not let him jane he said sadly you dont love me then i do love you i answered more than ever but this is the last time i can say it there is only one thing for me to do but youll be furious if i mention it oh mention it if im angry you can always burst into tears he said with a halfsmile mr rochester i must leave you i must start a new life among strangers of course i told you we would leave ill ignore that nonsense about you leaving me youll be mrs rochester and ill be your husband until i die well live happily and innocently together in a little white house i have in the south of france jane dont shake your head or ill get angry sir your wife is alive i dared to say although he was looking aggressively at me and if i lived with you like that id be your mistress im a fool he said suddenly i havent told you the whole story oh im sure youll agree when you know everything listen jane you know that my father loved money very much i heard someone say that yes sir well he hated the idea of dividing the family property so he left it all to my elder brother but that meant i would be poor unless i married a rich wife so he decided i should marry bertha mason the daughter of his wealthy friend jonas mason i was young and easily impressed so when i saw her in the west indies beautiful and elegantly dressed i thought i loved her what a fool i was then after the wedding i learned that my brides mother and younger brother were both mad dick mason will probably be in the same state one day my father knew all this but did not tell me i soon found that bertha and i had nothing in common not only was she coarse and stupid her madness also made her violent i lived with her for four years by now my father and brother were dead so i was rich but i considered myself poor because i was tied to a mad wife until death i pity you sir i do pity you pity jane is an insult from some people but from you i accept it as the mother of love well i had moments of despair when i intended to shoot myself but in the end i decided to bring the mad woman back to thornfield hall where nobody knew that we were married she has lived here ever since even mrs fairfax and the servants dont know the whole truth about her but although i pay grace poole well and trust her absolutely she sometimes drinks too much and allows the creature to escape twice she has got out of her room at night as you know the first time she nearly burnt me in my bed and the second time she visited you and must have been reminded of her own wedding day by seeing your wedding dress and what did you do sir when you had brought her here i travelled all over europe jane i was looking for a good and intelligent woman to love but you couldnt marry sir i interrupted i believed i could i thought i might find some reasonable woman who would understand my case and accept me well sir did you not in europe jane where i spent ten long years looking for an ideal i tried taking mistresses like celine the french dancer but finally bitter and disappointed with my wasted life i returned to thornfield on a frosty winter afternoon and when my horse slipped and fell on the ice a little figure appeared and insisted on helping me in the weeks that followed i began to depend on that birdlike little figure for my happiness and new interest in life dont talk any more of the past sir i said wiping a secret tear from my eye no jane youre right the future is much brighter you understand now dont you ive wasted half my life in misery and loneliness but now ive found you you are at the centre of my heart it was stupid of me to try to marry you like that without explaining i should have confessed everything as i do now and appealed to your great generosity of spirit i promise to love you and stay with you for ever jane promise me the same a pause why are you silent jane this was a terrible moment for me in the struggle and confusion that was going on in my heart i knew that he loved me and i loved him but i also knew that i must leave him jane just promise me i will be yours mr rochester i will not be yours another pause jane he said with a gentleness that cut into my soul jane do you intend us to live apart for ever i do jane bending towards me and kissing me is that still your intention it is i replied pulling away from him oh jane this is a bitter shock it would not be wicked to love me it would be wicked to do what you want jane just imagine my horrible life when you have gone i shall be alone with that mad woman upstairs where shall i find friendship and hope you can only trust in god and yourself live without doing wrong and die hoping to go to heaven thats impossible without you and and you have no family to offend by living with me he was beginning to sound desperate i knew that what he said was true however in my heart i also knew i was right to leave he seemed to read my thoughts rushing furiously across the room he seized me violently and stared fiercely into my eyes he could have broken me in two with one hand but he could not break my spirit small and weak as i was i stared firmly back at him your eyes jane he said are the eyes of a bird a free wild being even if i break your cage i cant reach you beautiful creature youll fly away from me but you could choose to fly to me come jane come he let me go and only looked at me how hard it was to resist that look i am going i said does my deep love mean nothing to you oh jane my hope my love my life and he threw himself despairingly on the sofa i had reached the door but i could not leave i walked back bent over him and kissed his cheek goodbye my dear master i said may god protect you without your love jane my heart is broken he said but perhaps you will so generously give me your love after all he jumped up with hope in his eyes holding out his arms to me but i turned and ran out of the room that night i only slept a little dreaming of the red room at gateshead the moonlight shone into my bedroom as it did then and i saw a vision on the ceiling a white figure looking down on me it seemed to whisper to my spirit daughter leave now before you are tempted to stay mother i will i answered and when i woke up although it was still dark outside i wrapped up some spare clothes in a parcel and put a little money in a purse as i crept downstairs i could hear mr rochester in his room walking up and down and sighing i could find heaven in this room if i wanted i just had to enter and say i will love you and live with you through life until death my hand moved towards the handle but i stopped myself and went miserably downstairs and out of the house setting out on the road i could not help thinking of mr rochesters despair when he found himself abandoned i hated myself for wounding him and for perhaps driving him to a life of wickedness or even death i wanted desperately to be with him to comfort him but somehow i made myself keep walking and when a coach passed i arranged to travel on it as far as my money would pay for inside the coach i cried the bitterest tears of my life chapter nineteen finding shelter i was put down at whitcross a crossroads on the moor after travelling for two days in the coach as it rolled away i realized i had left my parcel inside and given the coachman all the coins in my purse i was alone on the open moor with no money or possessions lonely white roads stretched across the great wide moors as far as the hills i was glad to see there were no towns here because i did not want people to question me or pity me so i walked across the moor until i found a dry place to sleep in the shelter of a small hill luckily it was a warm night with no rain the next day was hot and sunny but i needed food and water so i could not stay on the moor taking one of the white roads i eventually found a small village i needed all my courage to knock on some of the doors asking if there was any paid work i could do none of the village people could help me and i could not bring myself to beg for food although by now i felt weak and faint at the bakers i offered to exchange my leather gloves for a small cake but the bakers wife looked at my dirty clothes and said im sorry but how do i know you havent stolen them all i ate that day was a piece of bread which i begged from a farmer eating his supper i spent another night on the moor but this time the air was cold and the ground was damp next day i walked from house to house again looking in vain for work i was now very weak from lack of food and i began to wonder why i should struggle to stay alive when i did not want to live it was getting dark again and i was alone on the moor in the distance i could see a faint light and i decided to try to reach it the wind and rain beat down on me and i fell down several times but finally i arrived at a long low house standing rather isolated in the middle of the moor hiding near the door i could just see into the kitchen through a small uncurtained window there was an elderly woman who might be the housekeeper mending clothes and two young ladies who seemed to be learning a language with dictionaries the kitchen looked so clean and bright and the ladies so kind and sensible that i dared to knock at the door the elderly woman opened it but she must have thought i was a thief or a beggar because she refused to let me speak to the young ladies the door closed firmly shutting me out from the warmth inside i dropped on to the wet doorstep worn out and hopeless prepared to die there the young ladies brother found me when he returned home a few minutes later and he insisted much against the housekeepers wishes on bringing me into the house they gave me bread and milk and asked my name jane elliott i replied i did not want anybody to know where i had come from to their further questions i answered that i was too tired to speak finally they helped me upstairs to a bedroom and i sank gratefully into a warm dry bed for three days and nights i lay in bed exhausted by my experiences and hardly conscious of my surroundings as i was recovering hannah the housekeeper came to sit with me and told me all about the family she had known them since they were babies their mother had been dead for years and their father had died only three weeks before the girls diana and mary rivers had to work as governesses as their father had lost a lot of money in business st john their brother was the vicar in the nearest village morton they only used this house called moor house in the holidays when i felt strong enough to get dressed and go downstairs diana and mary looked after me very kindly and made me feel welcome in their pleasant home their brother however seemed stern and cold he was between twentyeight and thirty fairhaired and extremely handsome diana and mary were curious about my past but sensitive enough to avoid asking questions which would hurt me st john on the other hand made determined efforts to discover who i was but i just as firmly refused to explain more than necessary i told them only that after attending lowood school i became a governess in a wealthy family where an unfortunate event not in any way my fault caused me to run away that was all i was prepared to say i offered to do any kind of work teaching sewing cleaning so that i could become independent again st john approved of my keenness to work and promised to find me some paid employment chapter twenty a new home i spent a month at moor house in an atmosphere of warm friendship i learned to love what diana and mary loved the little old grey house the wild open moors around it and the lonely hills and valleys where we walked for hours i read the books they read and we discussed them eagerly diana started teaching me german and i helped mary to improve her drawing we three shared the same interests and opinions and spent the days and evenings very happily together however st john hardly ever joined in our activities he was often away from home visiting the poor and the sick in morton his strong sense of duty made him insist on going even if the weather was very bad but despite his hard work i thought he lacked true happiness and peace of mind he often stopped reading or writing to stare into the distance dreaming perhaps of some ambitious plan once i heard him speak at a church service in morton and although he was an excellent speaker there was a certain bitterness and disappointment in his words he was clearly not satisfied with his present life the holiday was coming to an end soon diana and mary would leave moor house to return to the wealthy families in the south where they were both governesses and st john would go back to the vicars house in morton with hannah his housekeeper although his cold manner made it difficult for me to talk to him i had to ask him whether he had found any employment for me i have he answered slowly but remember i am only a poor country vicar and cant offer you a job with a high salary so you may not wish to accept it theres already a school for boys in morton and now i want to open one for girls so ive rented a building for it with a small cottage for the schoolteacher miss oliver who lives in the area and is the only daughter of a rich factoryowner has kindly paid for the furniture will you be the schoolteacher you would live in the cottage rentfree and receive thirty dollars a year no more i thought about it for a moment it was not as good as being a governess in an important family but at least i would have no master i would be free and independent thank you mr rivers i accept gladly i replied but you do understand he asked a little worried it will only be a village school the girls will be poor and uneducated youll be teaching reading writing counting sewing thats all therell be no music or languages or painting i understand and ill be happy to do it i answered he smiled well satisfied with me and ill open the school tomorrow if you like i added very good he agreed then looking at me he said but i dont think youll stay long in the village why not im not ambitious although i think you are he looked surprised i know i am but how did you discover that no i think you wont be satisfied by living alone you need people to make you happy he said no more diana and mary lost their usual cheerfulness as the moment for leaving their home and their brother came closer you see jane diana explained st john is planning to become a missionary very soon he feels his purpose in life is to spread the christian religion in unexplored places where the people have never heard the word of god so we wont see him for many years perhaps never again he looks quiet jane but hes very determined i know hes doing gods work but it will break my heart to see him leave and she broke down in tears mary wiped her own tears away as she said weve lost our father soon well lose our brother too just then st john himself entered reading a letter our uncle john is dead he announced the sisters did not look shocked or sad but seemed to be waiting for more information st john gave them the letter to read and then they all looked at each other smiling rather tiredly well said diana at least we have enough money to live on we dont really need any more yes said st john but unfortunately we can imagine how different our lives might have been he went out there was a silence for a few minutes then diana turned to me jane you must be surprised that we dont show any sadness at our uncles death i must explain weve never met him he was my mothers brother and he and my father quarrelled years ago about a business deal thats when my father lost most of his money my uncle on the other hand made a fortune of twenty thousand dollars as he never married and had no relations apart from us and one other person my father always hoped we would inherit uncle johns money but it seems this other relation has inherited his whole fortune of course we shouldnt have expected anything but mary and i would have felt rich with only a thousand dollars each and st john would have been able to help so many more poor people she said no more and none of us referred to the subject again that evening the next day the rivers family returned to their separate places of work and i moved to the cottage in morton chpater twenty one mr rivers sacrifice i had twenty village girls to teach some of them with such a strong country accent that i could hardly communicate with them only three could read and none could write so at the end of my first day i felt quite depressed at the thought of the hard work ahead of me but i reminded myself that i was fortunate to have any sort of job and that i would certainly get used to teaching these girls who although they were very poor might be as good and as intelligent as children from the greatest families in england ever since i ran away from thornfield mr rochester had remained in my thoughts and now as i stood at my cottage door that first evening looking at the quiet fields i allowed myself to imagine again the life i could have had with him in his little white house in the south of france he would have loved me oh yes he would have loved me very much for a while he did love me i thought nobody will ever love me like that again but then i told myself that i would only have been his mistress in a foreign country and for a short time until he grew tired of me i should be much happier here as a schoolteacher free and honest in the healthy heart of england but strangely enough st john rivers found me crying as he approached the cottage frowning at the sight of the tears on my cheeks he asked me do you regret accepting this job then oh no i replied quickly im sure ill get used to it soon and im really very grateful to have a home and work to do after all i had nothing a few weeks ago but you feel lonely perhaps he asked still puzzled i havent had time to feel lonely yet well i advise you to work hard and not to look back into your past if something which we know is wrong tempts us then we must make every effort to avoid it by putting our energy to better use a year ago i too was very miserable because i was bored by the routine life of a country vicar and i was tempted to change my profession but suddenly there was light in my darkness and god called me to be a missionary no profession could be greater than that since that moment of truth i have been perfectly happy making my preparations for leaving england and going abroad in the service of god happy that is except for one little human weakness which i have sworn to overcome his eyes shone as he spoke of his great purpose in life and i was listening fascinated so neither of us heard the light footsteps approaching the cottage along the grassy path good evening mr rivers said a charming voice as sweet as a bell st john jumped as if hit between the shoulders then turned slowly and stiffly to face the speaker a vision in white with a young girlish figure was standing beside him when she threw back her veil she revealed a face of perfect beauty st john glanced quickly at her but dared not look at her for long he kept his eyes on the ground as he answered a lovely evening but its late for you to be out alone oh father told me youd opened the new girls school so i simply had to come to meet the new schoolteacher that must be you she said to me smiling do you like morton and your pupils and your cottage i realized this must be the rich miss oliver who had generously furnished my cottage yes indeed miss oliver i replied im sure ill enjoy teaching here and i like my cottage very much ill come and help you teach sometimes i get so bored at home mr rivers ive been away visiting friends you know ive had such fun i was dancing with the officers until two oclock this morning theyre all so charming st johns face looked sterner than usual and his lip curled in disapproval as he lifted his handsome head and looked straight into miss olivers laughing eyes he breathed deeply and his chest rose as if his heart wanted to fly out of its cage but he said nothing and after a pause miss oliver continued do come and visit my father mr rivers why dont you ever come i cant come miss rosamund it seemed clear to me that st john had to struggle with himself to refuse this smiling invitation well if you dont want to i must go home then goodbye she held out her hand he just touched it his hand trembling goodbye he said in a low hollow voice his face as white as a sheet they walked away in different directions she turned back twice to look at him but he did not turn round at all the sight of another persons suffering and sacrifice stopped me thinking so much about my own problems i had plenty of opportunities to observe st john and miss oliver together every day st john taught one bible lesson at the school and miss oliver who knew her power over him always chose that particular moment to arrive at the school door in her most attractive riding dress she used to walk past the rows of admiring pupils towards the young vicar smiling openly at him he just stared at her as if he wanted to say i love you and i know you love me if i offered you my heart i think youd accept but my heart is already promised as a sacrifice to god but he never said anything and she always turned sadly away like a disappointed child no doubt he would have given the world to call her back but he would not give his chance of heaven when i discovered that miss olivers father greatly admired the rivers family and would have no objection to her marrying a vicar i decided to try to persuade st john to marry her i thought he could do more good with miss olivers money in england than as a missionary under the baking sun in the east my chance came some weeks later when he visited me one november evening in my little cottage he noticed a sketch i had been doing of miss oliver and could not take his eyes off it i could paint you an exact copy i said gently if you admit that you would like it shes so beautiful he murmured still looking at it i would certainly like to have it she likes you im sure i said greatly daring and her father respects you you ought to marry her its very pleasant to hear this he said not at all shocked by my honesty i shall allow myself fifteen minutes to think about her and he actually put his watch on the table and sat back in his chair closing his eyes married to the lovely rosamund oliver let me just imagine it my heart is full of delight and there was silence for a quarter of an hour until he picked up his watch and put the sketch back on the table temptation has a bitter taste he said shaking his head i cant marry her you see although i love her so deeply i know that rosamund would not make a good wife for a missionary but you neednt be a missionary i cried indeed i must its the great work god has chosen me to do i shall carry with me into the darkest corners of the world knowledge peace freedom religion the hope of heaven that is what i live for and what i shall die for what about miss oliver i asked after a moment she may be very disappointed if you dont marry her miss oliver will forget me in a month and will probably marry someone wholl make her far happier than i ever could you speak calmly but i know youre suffering you are original he said looking surprised he had clearly not imagined that men and women could discuss such deep feelings together but believe me i have overcome this weakness of mine and become as hard as a rock my only ambition now is to serve god as he picked up his hat before leaving something on a piece of paper on the table caught his eye he glanced at me then tore off a tiny piece very quickly and with a rapid goodbye rushed out of the cottage i could not imagine what he had found to interest him so much chapter twenty two sudden wealth when st john left it was beginning to snow and it continued snowing all night and all the next day in the evening i sat by my fire listening to the wind blowing outside and had just started reading when i heard a noise the wind i thought was shaking the door but no it was st john who came in out of the frozen darkness his coat covered in snow whats happened i cried amazed i thought nobody would be out in weather like this whats the matter theres nothing wrong he answered calmly hanging up his coat and stamping the snow from his boots i just came to have a little talk to you besides since yesterday ive been eager to hear the other half of your story he sat down i had no idea what he was referring to and remembering his strange behaviour with the piece of paper i began to fear that he might be going mad he looked quite normal however and we made conversation for a while although he seemed to be thinking of something else suddenly he said when i arrived i said i wanted to hear the rest of your story but perhaps its better if i tell the story im afraid youve heard it before but listen anyway twenty years ago a poor vicar fell in love with a rich mans daughter she also fell in love with him and married him against the advice of all her family sadly less than two years later the couple were both dead ive seen their grave their baby daughter was brought up by an aunt a mrs reed of gateshead you jumped did you hear a noise ill continue i dont know whether the child was happy with mrs reed but she stayed there ten years until she went to lowood school where you were yourself in fact it seems her life was quite similar to yours she became a teacher at lowood as you did and then became a governess in the house of a certain mr rochester mr rivers i interrupted unable to keep silent i can imagine how you feel he replied but wait till ive finished i dont know anything about mr rochesters character but i do know that he offered to marry this young girl who only discovered during the wedding ceremony that he was in fact already married to a mad woman the governess disappeared soon after this and although investigations have been carried out and advertisements placed in newspapers and every effort made to find her nobody knows where shes gone but she must be found mr briggs a lawyer has something very important to tell her just tell me one thing i said urgently what about mr rochester how and where is he whats he doing is he well i know nothing about mr rochester why dont you ask the name of the governess and why everybody is looking for her did mr briggs write to mr rochester i asked he did but he received an answer not from him but from the housekeeper a mrs fairfax i felt cold and unhappy no doubt mr rochester had left england for a life of wild pleasure in the cities of europe that was what i had been afraid of oh my poor master once almost my husband who i had often called my dear edward as you wont ask the governesss name ill tell you myself continued st john ive got it written down its always better to have facts in black and white and he took out of his wallet a tiny piece of paper which i recognized as part of my sketch book and showed it to me on it i read in my own writing jane eyre which i must have written without thinking the advertisements and briggs spoke of a jane eyre but i only knew a jane elliott said st john are you jane eyre yes yes but doesnt mr briggs know anything about mr rochester i asked desperately i dont think briggs is at all interested in mr rochester youre forgetting the really important thing dont you want to know why hes been looking for you well what did he want i asked almost rudely only to tell you that your uncle mr eyre of madeira is dead that he has left you all his property and that youre now rich only that nothing more rich one moment i was poor the next moment i was wealthy it was hard to realize my new situation a fortune brings serious worries and responsibilities with it which i could hardly imagine i was sorry to hear that my uncle my only surviving relation was dead however the inheritance would give me independence for life and i was glad of that perhaps you would like to know how much youve inherited offered st john politely its nothing much really just twenty thousand dollars i think twenty thousand dollars the news took my breath away st john who i had never heard laugh before actually laughed out loud at my shocked face perhaps perhaps youve made a mistake i asked him nervously no theres no mistake now i must be leaving good night he was about to open the door when suddenly i called stop why did mr briggs write to you in order to find me oh im a vicar i have ways of discovering things no that doesnt satisfy me tell me the truth i insisted putting myself between him and the door well id rather not tell you just now but i suppose youll discover it sooner or later did you know that my full name is st john eyre rivers no i didnt but then what and i stopped as light flooded my mind and i saw clearly the chain of circumstances which connected us but st john continued his explanation my mothers name was eyre he said she had two brothers one a vicar who married miss jane reed of gateshead and the other john eyre of madeira mr briggs mr eyres lawyer wrote to us telling us that our uncle had died and left all his property not to us because of his quarrel with our father but to his brothers daughter then mr briggs wrote again later saying this girl could not be found well ive found her he moved towards the door his hat in his hand wait a moment just let me think i said so you diana and mary are my cousins we are your cousins yes he said waiting patiently as i looked at him it seemed i had found a brother and sisters to love and be proud of for the rest of my life the people who had saved my life were my close relations this was wealth indeed to a lonely heart brighter and more lifegiving than the heavy responsibility of coins and gold oh im glad im so glad i cried laughing st john smiled you were serious when i told you had inherited a fortune now youre excited about something very unimportant what can you mean it may mean nothing to you you already have sisters and dont need any more family but i had nobody and now i suddenly have three relations in my world or two if you dont want to be counted i walked rapidly round the room my thoughts rising so fast i could hardly understand them the family i now had the people who had saved me from starvation i could now help them there were four of us cousins twenty thousand dollars shared equally would be five thousand dollars each more than enough for each one of us it would be a fair and just arrangement and we would all be happy i would no longer have the worry of controlling a large amount of money and they would never have to work again we would all be able to spend more time together at moor house naturally when i made this suggestion to st john and his sisters they protested strongly and it was with great difficulty that i finally managed to convince them of my firm intention to carry out this plan in the end they agreed that it was a fair way of sharing the inheritance and so the legal steps were taken to transfer equal shares to all of us chapter twenty three a voice from the past i promised to stay at morton school until christmas when st john would be able to find another teacher he was there when i closed the school for the christmas holidays i was quite sorry to have to say goodbye to some of my pupils you see what progress they have made and youve only worked here a few months he said imagine how much more good you could do if you gave your whole life to teaching yes i answered but i couldnt do it for ever dont mention school im on holiday now he looked serious what are your plans i want you to let me have hannah for a few days she and i are going to clean moor house from top to bottom and make all the christmas preparations that you know nothing about being only a man everything must be ready for diana and mary when they come home next week for a really wonderful holiday st john smiled but he was still not satisfied with me thats all right for the moment but i hope jane that youll look higher than domestic activity and think about a better way of using your energy and intelligence in the service of god st john i have so many reasons for happiness i am determined to be happy despite your scolding that week hannah and i worked harder than we had ever worked in our lives before but at last all was ready it was a delight to see dianas and marys faces when they arrived cold and stiff from their long journey and saw the warm fires and polished furniture and smelt the cakes and meat dishes cooking we three spent the whole of christmas week in perfect happiness the air of the moors the freedom of home and the beginning of independence made diana and mary happier than i had ever seen them only st john remained apart from our conversations and laughter he continued his serious studies and spent much time visiting the sick as usual do you still intend to be a missionary diana asked him once a little sadly nothing has changed or will change my plans he answered i shall leave england in a few months time and rosamund oliver asked mary gently rosamund oliver is engaged to a mr granby a very suitable young man according to her father his face was calm i realized he had managed to overcome what he called his weakness gradually our life at moor house lost its holiday feeling and as we took up our usual habits and regular studies again st john sat with us more often sometimes i had the impression he was observing us one day when diana and mary were out and i was learning german he suddenly said to me i want you to learn hindustani instead of german ill need it for my missionary work in india and you could help me to learn it by studying with me ive chosen you because ive noticed you have better powers of concentration than either of my sisters it seemed so important to him that i could not refuse and when his sisters returned they were surprised to find me learning hindustani with st john from now on we spent a lot of time together studying i had to work very hard to satisfy him under his influence however i felt i was losing my freedom to be myself i could no longer talk or laugh freely as i knew he only approved of serious moods and studies i fell under his freezing spell obeying all his commands without thinking one evening at bedtime as he kissed his sisters good night and was holding out his hand to shake mine as usual diana said laughing st john you arent treating jane like one of the family you should kiss her too i was rather embarrassed but st john calmly kissed me and did so every evening after that i had not forgotten mr rochester in all these changes of home and fortune his name was written on my heart and would stay there as long as i lived not only had i written to ask mr briggs more about him i had also written twice to mrs fairfax but after i had waited in vain for six months i lost hope and felt low indeed diana said i looked ill and needed a holiday at the seaside but st john thought i ought to concentrate on more serious work and gave me even more hindustani exercises to do one day while he and i were walking on the moors he announced jane ill be leaving in six weeks youre doing gods work hell protect you i replied yes it seems strange to me that all my friends dont want to join me god offers a place in heaven to all who serve him what does your heart say to that jane my heart is silent my heart is silent i murmured then i must speak for it said the deep stern voice jane come with me to india as a missionary was it a call from god i felt as if i was under a terrible spell and i trembled afraid that i might not be able to escape oh st john dont choose me i begged but it was useless appealing to a man who always did what he believed to be his duty however unpleasant it was god intended you to be a missionarys wife he continued trust in him jane marry me for the service of god i cant do it st john im not strong enough i cried the iron bars of a cage seemed to be closing in around me ive seen how hard you can work jane you will be a great help to me with indian women and in indian schools i thought yes i could do that but i know that he doesnt love me and despite that he asks me to marry him so i said im ready to go with you to india but as a sister not as a wife he shook his head you must see thats impossible no a sister could marry at any time and leave me i need a wife who will obey me in life and who will stay with me until death i trembled as i felt his power over me already ill give my heart to god i said you dont want it as i looked at his stern face i knew i could go anywhere in the world with him as a colleague but i could never lose my freedom by marrying him ill ask you again in a few days time he said and remember it isnt me youre refusing but god from then on his manner towards me was as cold as ice which caused me great pain i began to understand how if i were his wife this good religious man could soon kill me without feeling any guilt at all when he asked me again we were alone in the sittingroom he put his hand on my head and spoke quietly in his deep sincere voice remember jane god calls us to work for him and will reward us for it say you will marry me and earn your place in heaven i admired and respected him and under his touch my mind was changing i was tempted to stop struggling against him as i had been tempted before in a different way by mr rochester the missionary gently held my hand i could resist his anger but not his gentleness i desperately wanted to do what was right if i felt certain i answered finally that god really wanted me to marry you i would agree my prayers are heard cried st john close together we stood waiting for a sign from heaven i was more excited than i had ever been before there was a total silence in the house and the room was full of moonlight suddenly my heart stopped beating and i heard a distant voice cry jane jane jane nothing more where did it come from it was the voice of edward rochester and it spoke in sadness and in pain im coming i cried wait for me i ran into the garden calling where are you only the hills sent a faint echo back i broke away from st john who had followed asking me questions it was my time to give orders now i told him to leave me and he obeyed in my room i fell to my knees to thank god for the sign he had sent me and waited eagerly for daylight chapter twenty four returning to thornfield in the morning i explained to diana and mary that i had to go on a journey and would be away for several days although they did not know the reason for my journey they were far too sensitive to my feelings to bother me with questions and so i walked to whitcross the lonely crossroads on the moor where i had arrived a year ago with no money or luggage i took the coach and after thirtysix hours of travelling i got down at thornfield village and almost ran across the fields in my hurry to see the wellknown house again and its owner i decided to approach from the front to get the best view of the house from there i would be able to see my masters window he might even be walking in the gardens i thought and i could run to him touch him surely that wouldnt hurt anybody but when i reached the great stone columns of the main gate i stood still in horror there where i had hoped to see a fine impressive house was nothing but a blackened heap of stones with the silence of death about it no wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer there must have been a great fire how had it started had any lives been lost i ran back to the village to find answers to my questions well maam the hotelowner told me i was one of mr rochesters servants at the time and i can tell you it was his mad wife who started the fire in the governesss room the master had been wildly in love with the governess you see maam although she was just a plain little thing and when she disappeared he almost went mad his wife must have understood enough to be jealous of the girl anyway in the fire the master risked his life helping all the servants out of the house then bravely went back to save the mad woman we saw her jump from the roof and fall to her death but because he went back to help her he was badly injured in the fire losing a hand and the sight of both eyes very sad maam where is he now i asked urgently at another house of his ferndean manor thirty miles away i hired a carriage to drive there at once chapter twenty five finding mr rochester again ferndean manor was a large old house in the middle of a wood it looked dark and lonely surrounded by trees as i approached the narrow front door opened and out came a figure i could not fail to recognize edward rochester i held my breath as i watched feeling a mixture of happiness and sadness he looked as strong as before and his hair was still black but in his face i saw a bitter desperate look that i had never seen there before he walked slowly and hesitatingly along the path although he kept looking up eagerly at the sky it was obvious that he could see nothing after a while he stopped and stood quietly there the rain falling fast on his bent uncovered head finally he found his way painfully back to the house and closed the door when i knocked at the door mr rochesters old servant john opened it and recognized me he and his wife mary were the only servants their master had wanted to keep when he moved from thornfield although they were surprised to see me i had no difficulty in arranging to stay at ferndean that night but he may not want to see you warned mary as we sat together in the kitchen he refuses to see anybody except us she was lighting some candles he always wants candles in the sittingroom when its dark even though hes blind give them to me mary i said ill take them to him the blind man was sitting near the neglected fire in the dark room put down the candles mary he sighed here they are sir i said that is mary isnt it he asked listening carefully marys in the kitchen i answered what sweet madness has seized me he cried suddenly where is the speaker i cant see but i must feel or my heart will stop and my brain will burst let me touch you or i cant live i held his wandering hand with both of mine is it jane this is her shape he released his hand and seized my arm shoulder neck waist and held me close to him she is here i said and her heart too i am jane eyre ive found you and come back to you my living darling so you arent lying dead in a ditch somewhere is it a dream ive dreamed so often of you only to wake in the morning abandoned my life dark my soul thirsty im alive and im not a dream in fact im an independent woman now ive inherited five thousand dollars from my uncle ah that sounds real i couldnt dream that but perhaps you have friends now and dont want to spend much time in a lonely house with a blind man like me i can do what i like and i intend to stay with you unless you object ill be your neighbour your nurse your housekeeper your companion you will never be sad or lonely as long as i live he did not reply immediately and i was a little embarrassed by his silence i had assumed he would still want me to be his wife and wondered why he did not ask me jane he said sadly you cannot always be my nurse its kind and generous of you but youre young and one day you will want to marry if i could only see id try to make you love me again but and he sighed deeply i was very relieved to discover that was all he was worrying about because i knew that his blindness made no difference at all to my love for him however i thought too much excitement was not good for him so i talked of other things and made him laugh a little as we separated at bedtime he asked me just one thing jane were there only ladies in the house where youve been i laughed and escaped upstairs still laughing a good idea i thought a little jealousy will stop him feeling so sorry for himself next day i took him outside for a long walk in the fresh air i described the beauty of the fields and sky to him as we sat close together in the shade of a tree tell me jane what happened to you when you so cruelly abandoned me he asked holding me tightly in his arms and so i told him my story naturally he was interested in st john rivers my cousin this st john do you like him hes a very good man i couldnt help liking him hes perhaps a man of fifty or so st john is only twentynine sir rather stupid i think you said not at all intelligent he has an excellent brain sir did you say he was rather plain ugly in fact st john is a handsome man tall and fair with blue eyes mr rochester frowned and swore loudly in fact sir i continued he asked me to marry him well jane leave me and go oh until now i thought you would never love another man but go and marry rivers i can never marry him sir he doesnt love me and i dont love him hes good and great but as cold as ice you neednt be jealous sir all my heart is yours he kissed me im no better than the great tree hit by lightning at thornfield he said i cant expect to have a fresh young plant like you by my side all my life you are still strong sir and young plants need the strength and safety of a tree to support them jane will you marry me a poor blind man with one hand twenty years older than you yes sir my darling well be married in three days time jane thank god you know i never thought much of religion well lately ive begun to understand that god has been punishing me for my pride and my past wickedness last monday night in a mood of deep depression i was sitting by an open window praying for a little peace and happiness in my dark life in my heart and soul i wanted you i cried out jane three times last monday night about midnight i asked wondering yes but that doesnt matter this is whats really strange i heard a voice calling im coming wait for me and where are you and then i heard an echo sent back by hills but theres no echo here in the middle of the wood jane you must have been asleep your spirit and mine must have met to comfort each other it was your voice i heard i did not tell him i had actually spoken those words many miles away at that exact moment on that night because i could hardly understand how it happened myself i thank god said edward rochester and ask him to help me live a better life in future together we returned slowly to ferndean manor edward leaning on my shoulder we had a quiet wedding i wrote to tell the rivers the news diana and mary wrote back with delighted congratulations but st john did not reply now i have been married for ten years i know what it is like to love and be loved no woman has ever been closer to her husband than i am to edward i am my husbands life and he is mine we are always together and have never had enough of each others company after two years his sight began to return in one eye now he can see a little and when our first child was born and put into his arms he was able to see that the boy had inherited his fine large black eyes mrs fairfax is retired and adele has grown into a charming young woman diana and mary are both married and we visit them once a year st john achieved his ambition by going to india as planned and is still there he writes to me regularly he is unmarried and will never marry now he knows that the end of his life is near but he has no fear of death and looks forward to gaining his place in heaven the end
