jack higgins the savage day between two groups of men that want to make inconsistent kinds of worlds i see no remedy except force it seems to me that every society rests on the death of men oliver wendell holmes one execution day they were getting ready to shoot somebody in the inner courtyard which meant it was monday because monday was execution day although my own cell was on the other side of the building i recognized the signs a disturbance from those cells in the vicinity from which some prisoners could actually witness the whole proceeding and then the drums rolling the commandant liked that there was silence a shouted command a volley of rifle fire after a while the drums started again a steady beat accompanying the cortege as the dead man was wheeled away for the commandant liked to preserve the niceties even on skarthos one of the most unlovely places i have visited in my life a bare rock in the aegean with an old iothe savage tay turkish fort on top of it containing three thousand political detainees four hundred troops to guard them and me id had a month of it which was exactly four weeks too long and the situation wasnt improved by the knowledge that some of the others had spent up to two years there without any kind of trial a prisoner told me on exercise one day that the name of the place was derived from some classical greek root meaning barren which didnt surprise me in the slightest through the bars of my cell you could see the mainland a smudge on the horizon in the heat haze occasionally there was a ship but too far away to be interesting for the greek navy ensured that most craft gave the place a wide berth if i craned my head to the left when i peered out there was rock thorn bushes to the right otherwise there was nothing and nothing to do except lie on the straw mattress on the floor which was exactly what i was doing on that may morning when everything changed there was the grate of the key in the lock quite unexpectedly as the midday meal wasnt served for another three hours then the door opened and one of the sergeants moved in he stirred me with his foot better get up my friend someone to see you hope springing eternal i scrambled to my feet as my visitor was ushered in he was about fifty or so at a guess medium height good shoulders a snowwhite moustache beautifully clipped and trimmed very blue eyes he wore a panama lightweight cream suit an academy tie and carried a cane he was or had been a high ranking officer in the army i was never more certain of anything in my life after all it takes an old soldier to know one i almost brought my heels together and he smiled broadly at ease major at ease he looked about the cell with some distaste poked at the bucket in the corner with his cane and grimaced you really have got yourself into one hell of a bloody mess havent you are you from the british embassy in athens i asked he pulled the only stool forward dusted it and sat down they cant do a thing for you in athens vaughan youre going to rot here till the colonels decide to try you ive spoken to the people concerned in their opinion youll get fifteen years if youre lucky possibly twenty thanks very much i said most comforting he took a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and threw them across what do you expect guns for the rebels midnight landings on lonely beaches he shook his head what are you anyway the last of the romantics id love to thinkso i said but as it happens there would have been five thousand pounds waiting for me in nicosia if id pulled it off he nodded so i understand i leaned against the wall by the window and looked him over who are you anyway names ferguson he said brigadier harry ferguson royal corps of transport which i doubted or at least the corps of transport bit for with all due deference to that essential and important branch of the british army he just didnt look the type simon vaughan i said of course youll know that thats true he said but then i probably know you better than you know yourself i couldnt let that one pass try me fair enough he clasped both hands over the knob of his cane fine record at the academy second lieutenant in korea with the dukes you earned a good mc on the hook then got knocked off on patrol and spent just over a year in a chinese prison camp very good according to your file you successfully withstood the usual brainwashing techniques to which all prisoners were subjected it was noted however that it had left you with a slight tendency to the use of marxist dialectic in argument well as the old master put it i said lifeis the actions of men in pursuit of their ends you cant deny that i liked that book you wrote for the war house after korea he saida new concept of revolutionary warfare aroused a lot of talk at the time of course the way you kept quoting from mao tse tung worried a lot of people but you were right i nearly always am i said its rather depressing so few other people seem to realize the fact he carried straight on as if i hadnt spoken that book got you a transfer to military intelligence where you specialized in handling subversives revolutionary movements generally and so on the communists in malaya six months chasing mau mau in kenya then cyprus and the eoka the dso at the end of that little lot plus a bullet in the back that nearly finished things pitcher to the well i said you know how it is and then borneo and the row with the indonesians you commanded a company of native irregulars there and enjoyed great success naturally i said because wie fought the guerrillas on exactly their own terms the only way quite right and now the climax of the tragedy march to be precise the area around kota baru was rotten with communist terrorists the powers that be told you to go in and clear them out once and for all and no one can say i failed to do that i said with some bitterness what was it the papers called you the beast of selengar a man who ordered the shooting of many prisoners who interrogated and tortured captives in custody i suppose it was your medals that saved you and that year in prison camp must have been useful the psychiatrists managed to do a lot with that at least you werent cashiered previous gallant conduct i said must remember his father do what we can and since then what have we a mercenary in trucial oman and the yemen three months doing the same thing in the sudan and lucky to get out with your life since youve worked as an agent for several arms dealers mostly legitimate thwaite and simpson franz baumann mackenzie brown and julius meyer amongst others nothing wrong with that the british government makes several hundred million pounds a year out of the manufacture and sale of arms only they dont try to run them into someone elses country by night to give aid and succour to the enemies of the official government come off it i said thats exactly what theyve been doing for years he laughed and slapped his knee with one hand damn it all vaughan but i like you i really do what the beast of selengar good god boy do you think i was born yesterday i know what happened out there what really happened you were told to clear the kst terrorist out of kota baru and you did just that a little ruthlessly perhaps but you did it your superiors heaved a sigh of relief then threw you to the wolves leaving me with the satisfaction of knowing that i did my duty he smiled i can see were going to get along just fine did i tell you i knew your father tm sure you did i said but just now id much rather know what in the hell youre after brigadier i want you to come and work for me in exchange ill get you out of here the skte wiped clean just like that quite reasonable people to deal with the greeks if one knows how and what would i have to do in return oh thats simple he said id like you to take on the ira in northern ireland for us which was the kind of remark calculated to take the wind out of anyones sails and i stared at him incredulously youve got to be joking i cant think of anyone better qualified look at it this way you spent years in intelligence working against urban guerrillas marxists anarchists revolutionaries of every sort the whole bagshoot you know how their minds work youre perfectly at home fighting the kind of war where the battlefield is back alleys and rooftops youre tough resourceful and quite ruthless which youll need to be if youre to survive five minutes with this lot believe me nothing like making it sound attractive and then you do have one or two special qualifications you must admit that you speak irish i understand thanks to your mother which is more than most irishmen do and then there was that uncle of yours the one who commanded a flying column for the ira in the old days michael fitzgerald i said the schoolmaster of stradballa he raised his eyebrows at that one my god but they do like their legends dont they on the other hand the fact that youre a halfandhalf must surely be some advantage you mean it might help me to understand what goes on in those rather simple peasant minds he wasnt in the least put out i must say im damned if i can sometimes which is exactly why theyve been trying to kick us out for the past seven hundred years he raised his eyebrows at that and there was a touch of frost in his voice an interesting remark vaughan one which certainly makes me wonder exactly where you stand on this question i dont take sides i said not any more just tell me what you expect if i can justify it to myself ill take it on and if you cant youll sit here for another fifteen years he shook his head oh i doubt that major i doubt that very much indeed and there was the rub for i did myself i took another of his cigarettes and said wearily all right brigadier whats it all about the army is at war with the ira its as simple as that or as complicated exactly when we first moved troops in during it was to protect a catholic minority who had certain just grievances one must admit that and since then the worst kind of escalation palestine aden cyprus exactly the same only worse increasing violence planned assassinations the kind of mad bombing incidents that usually harm innocent civilians more than the army the purpose of terrorism is to terrorize i said the only way a small country can take on an empire and win that was one of michael collinss favourite sayings tm not surprised to make things even more difficult at the moment the ira itself is split down the middle one half call themselves official and seem to have swung rather to the left politically how far as far as you like the other lot the pure nationalists provisionals proves bradyites call them what you like are the ones who are supposed to be responsible for all the physical action and arent they not at all the official ira is just as much in favour of violence when it suits them and then there are the splinter groups fanatical fringe elements who want to shoot everyone in sight the worst of that little lot is a group called the sons of erin led by a man called frank barry and what about the other side asked the ulster volunteer force dont even mention them he said feelingly if they ever decide to take a hand it will be civil war and the kind of bloodbath that would be simply too hideous to contemplate no the immediate task is to defeat terror ism thats the armys job its up to the politicians to sort things out afterwards and what am i supposed to be able to achieve that the whole of military intelligence cant everything or nothing it all depends the ira needs money if its to be in a position to buy arms on anything like a large enough scale they got their hands on some in rather a big way about five weeks ago what happened the night mail boat from belfast to glasgow was hijacked by halfadozen men who were they proves no they were led by a man weve been after for years a real oldtimer must be sixty if hes a day michael cork the small man they call him another of those irish jokes as hes reputed to be over six feet in height reputed except for a twoyear sentence when he was seventeen or eighteen he hasnt been in custody since he did spend a considerable period in america but the simple truth is we havent the slightest idea what he looks like so what happened on the mail boat cork and his men forced the captain to rendezvous off the coast with a fiftyfoot diesel motor yacht they offloaded just over half a million pounds worth of gold bullion and slipped quietly away into the night not quite they clashed with a royal navy mtb early the following morning near rathlin island but managed to get away under cover of fog though the officer in command thinks they were in a sinking condition were they sighted anywhere else a rubber dinghy was found on a beach near stramore which is a fishing port on the mainland coast south of rathlin and several bodies were washed up during the week that followed and you think michael cork survived we know he did in fact thanks to that grand old irish institution the informer we know exactly what happened cork was the only survivor he sank the boat in a place of his own choosing landed near stramore in that rubber dinghy and promptly disappeared with his usual sleight of hand i moved to the window and looked out over the blue aegean and thought of that boat lying on the bottom up there in those cold grey northern waters he could do a lot with that kind of money an approach has already been made in his name to a londonbased arms dealer who had the sense to contact the proper authorities at once who was it anyone i know julius meyer youve acted for him on several occasions in the past i believe old meyer i laughed out loud now theres a slippery customer if you like i wonder why they chose him oh i should have thought he had just the right kind of shady reputation the brigadier said hes been in trouble often enough god knows there was all that fuss with the spanish government last year when it came out that hed been selling guns to the free basque movement he was on every front page in the country for a day or two the kind of thing interested parties would remember which made sense i said and where do i fit in you simply do exactly what youve done in the past act as meyers agent in this matter they should find you perfectly acceptable after all your past stinks to high heaven very satisfactorily tsjice of you to say so and what if im asked to act in a mercenary capacity to give instruction in the handling of certain weapons that can sometimes happen you know i hope it does i want you in there up to your ears as close to the heart of things as possible because we want that gold vaughan we cant allow them to hang on to a bank like that so thats your primary task to find out exactly where it is anything else any information you can glean about the organization faces names places all that goes without saying and it would be rather nice if you could get michael cork for us if the opportunity arises or indeed anyone else of similar persuasion that you meet along the way i said slowly and what exactly do you mean by get dont fool about with me boy he said and there was iron in his voice you know exactly what i mean if cork and his friends want to play these kind of games then they must accept the consequences i see and where does meyer fit into all this hell cooperate in full go to northern ireland when necessary assist you in any way he can and how did you achieve that small miracle as i remember meyer he was always for the quiet life a simple question of the annual renewal of his licence to trade in arms the brigadier said there is one thing i must stress by the way although you will be paid the remuneration plus allowances suitable to your rank there can be no question of your being restored to the active list officially in other words if i land up in the gutter with a bullet through the head im just another corpse exactly he stood up briskly and adjusted his panama but ive really talked for quite long enough and the governors laid on an mtb to run me back to athens in half an hour so whats it to be a little action and passion or another fifteen years of this he gestured around the cell with his cane i said do i really have a choice sensible lad he smiled broadly and rapped on the door wed better get moving then what now i brought a signed release paper with me from athens you were that certain he shrugged lets say it seemed more than likely that youd see things my way the key turned in the lock and the door opened the sergeant saluted formally and stood to one side the brigadier started forward and i said just one thing whats that you did say royal corps of transport he smiled beautifully a most essential part of the service my dear simon i should have thought you would have recognized that now come along we really are going to cut it most awfully fine for the raf plane ive laid on from athens so it was simon now he moved out into the corridor and the sergeant stood waiting patiently as i glanced around the cell the prospect was not exactly bright but after all anything was better than this he called my name impatiently once more from halfway up the stairs i moved out and the door clanged shut behind me two meyer i first met julius meyer in one of the smaller of the trucial oman states in june a place called rubat which boasted a sultan one port town and around forty thousand square miles of very unattractive desert which was inhabited by what are usually referred to in military circles as dissident tribesmen the whole place had little to commend it except its oil which did mean that besides the sultans three rollsroyces two mercedes and one cadillac our american friends not being so popular in the area that year he could also afford a chief of police and i was glad of the work however temporary the political situation made it look i was called up to the palace in a hurry one afternoon by the sultans chief minister hamal who also happened to be his nephew the whole thing was something of a surprise as it was the sort of piace where nobody made a move during the heat of the day when i went into his office i found him seated at his desk opposite meyer i never did know meyers age for he was one of those men who looked a permanent sixty hamal said ah major vaughan this is mr julius meyer mr meyer i said politely you will arrest him immediately and hold him in close confinement at central police headquarters until you hear from me meyer peered shortsightedly at me through steelrimmed spectacles with his shock of untidy grey hair the fraying collar the shabby linen suit he looked more like an unsuccessful musician than anything else it was much later when i discovered that all these things were supposed to make him look poor which he certainly was not whats the charge i asked import of arms without a licence ill give you the details later now get him out of here ive got work to do on the way to town in the jeep meyer wiped sweat from his face ceaselessly a terrible terrible thing all this deceit in life my friend he said at one point i mean its really getting to the stage where one cant trust anybody would you by any chance be referring to our respected chief minister i asked him he became extremely agitated flapping his arms up and down like some great shabby white bird i came in from djibouti this morning with five thousand mi carbines all in excellent condition perfect goods fifty bren guns twenty thousand rounds of ammunition all tohis order what happened you know what happened he refuses to pay has me arrested he glanced at me furtively tried to smile and failed miserably this charge what happens if he can make it stick whats the penalty this was a british colony for years so they favour hanging the sultan likes to put on a public show in the main square just to encourage the others my god he groaned in anguish from now on i use an agent i swear it which in other circumstances would have made me laugh out loud i had meyer locked up as per instructions then went to my office and gave the whole business very careful thought which knowing my hamal took all of five minutes having reached the inescapable conclusion that there was something very rotten indeed in the state of rubat i left the office and drove down to the waterfront where i checked that our brand new fiftyfoot diesel police launch was ready for sea tanks full the bank unfortunately was closed so i went immediately to my rather pleasant little house on the edge of town and recovered from the corner of the garden by the cistern the steel cash box containing five thousand dollars mad money put by for a rainy day as i started back to town there was a rattle of machinegun fire from the general direction of the palace which was comforting if only because it proved that my judgement was still unimpaired rubat the heat and the atmosphere of general decay notwithstanding i called in at police headquarters on my way down to the harbour and discovered without any particular sense of surprise that there wasnt a man left in the place except meyer whom i found standing at the window of his cell listening to the sound of small arms fire when i unlocked the door he turned immediately and there was a certain relief on his face when he saw who it was hamal he enquired he never was one to let the grass grow under his feet i said comes of having been a prefect at winchester you dont look too good i suggest a long sea voyage he almost fell over himself in his eagerness to get past me through the door as we moved out of harbour a column of black smoke ascended into the hot afternoon air from the palace standing beside me in the wheelhouse meyer shook his head and sighed we live in an uncertain world my friend and then dismissing rubat and its affairs completely he went on how good is this boat can we reach djibouti easily excellent i have first class contacts there we can even sell the boat some slight recompense for my loss and ive a little matter of business coming up in the somali republic that you might be able to help me with what sort of business the two thousand pounds a month kind he replied calmly which was enough to shut anyone up he produced a small cassette taperecorder from one of his pockets put it on the chart table and turned it on the band which started playing had the unmistakably nostalgic sound of the thirties and so did the singer who joined in a few minutes later assuring me thatevery days a lucky day there was complete repose on meyers face as he listened i said who in the hell is that al bowlly he said simply the best there ever was the start of a beautiful friendship in more ways than one i was reminded of that first meeting when i went down to meyers wapping warehouse on the morning following my arrival back in england from greece courtesy of ferguson and raf transport command and for the most obvious of reasons when i opened the little judas gate in the main entrance and stepped inside al bowllys voice drifted like some ghostly echo out of the halfdarkness to tell me thateverything i have is yours it was strangely appropriate considering the setting for in that one warehouse meyer really did have just about every possible thing you could think of in the arms line in fact it had always been a source of mystery to me how he managed to cope with the fire department inspectors for on occasion he had enough explosives in there to blow up a sizeable part of london meyer are you there i called puzzled by the lack of staff i moved through the gloom between two rows of shelving crammed with boxes of ammunition and rifle grenades there was a flight of steel steps leading up to a landing above more shelves rows and rows of old enfields al bowlly faded and meyer appeared at the rail who is it zthe savage day he had that usual rather hunted look about him as if he expected the gestapo to descend at any moment which at one time in his youth had been a distinct possibility he wore the same steelrimmed spectacles hed had on at our first meeting and the crumpled blue suit was well up to his usual standard of shabbiness simon he said is that you he started down the steps i said where is everyone i gave them the day off thought it best when ferguson telephoned where is he by the way hell be along he took off his glasses polished them put them back on and inspected me thoroughly they didnt lean on you too hard in that place skarthos i shook my head just being there was enough hows business he spread his hands in an inimitable gesture and led the way towards his office at the other end of the warehouse how can i complain the world gets more violent day by day we went into the tiny cluttered office and he produced a bottle of the cheapest possible british sherry and poured the ritual couple of drinks it tasted like sweet varnish but i got it down manfully this man ferguson he said as he finished a devil a coldblooded calculating devil he certainly knows what he wants he blackmailed me simon me a citizen all these years i pay my taxes dont i i behave myself when these irish nutcases approach me to do a deal i go to the authorities straight away highly commendable i said and poured myself another glass of that dreadful sherry and what thanks do i get this ferguson walks io here and gives me the business either i play the game the way he wants it or i lose my licence to trade is that fair is that british justice sounds like a pretty recognizable facsimile of it to me i told him he was almost angry but not quite why is everything such a big joke to you simon is our present situation funny is death funny the sensible mans way of staying sane in a world gone mad i said he considered the point and managed one of those funny little smiles of his maybe youve got something there ill try it ill definitely try it but what about ferguson hell be along youll know the worst soon enough i sat on the edge of his desk and helped myself to one of the turkish cigarettes he kept in a sandalwood box for special customers what have you got that works with a silencer really works he was all business now handgun or what and submachinegun well go downstairs he said i think i can fix you up the mk iis sten submachinegun was especially developed during the war for use with commando units and resistance groups it was also used with considerable success by british troops on night patrol work during the korean war it was indeed still is a remarkable weapon its silencing unit absorbing the noise of the bullet explosions to an amazing degree the only sound when firing is the clicking of the bolt as it goes backwards and forwards and this can seldom be heard beyond a range of twenty yards or so many more were manufactured than is generally realized and as they were quite unique in their field the reason for the kck of production over the years has always been something of a mystery to me the one i held in my hands in meyers basement firing range was a mint specimen there was a row of targets at the far end lifesize replicas of charging soldiers of indeterminate nationality all wearing camouflaged uniforms i emptied a thirtytwo round magazine into the first five working from left to right it was an uncomfortably eerie experience to see the bullets shredding the target and to hear only the clicking of the bolt meyer said remember full automatic only in a real emergency they tend to overheat otherwise a superfluous piece of information as id used the things in action in korea but i contented myself with laying the sten down and saying mildly what about a handgun i thought he looked pleased with himself and i saw why a moment later when he produced a tin box opened it and took out what appeared to be a normal automatic pistol except that the barrel was of a rather strange design i could get a packet from any collector for this little item he said chinese communist silenced pistol mm it was certainly new to me how does it work it was ingenious enough used as a semiautomatic there was only the sound of the slide reciprocating and the cartridge cases ejecting but it could also be used to fire a single shot with complete silence i tried a couple of rounds meyer said you like it before we could take it any further there was a foot on the stairs and ferguson moved out of the darkness he was wearing a dark grey doublebreasted suit academy tie bowler hat and carried a briefcase so there you are he said whats all this he came forward and put his briefcase down on the table then he took the pistol from me sighted casually and fired the result was as i might have expected no fancy shooting through the shoulder or hand just a bullet dead centre in the belly painful but certain he put the gun down on the table and glanced at his watch ive got exactly ten minutes then i must be on my way to the war house so lets get down to business meyer have you rilled him in on your end yet you told me to wait im here now okay meyer shrugged and turned to me i had a final meeting with the london agent for these people yesterday ive told him it would be possible to run the stuff over from oban possible i said that must be the understatement of this or any other year meyer carried straight on as if i hadnt interrupted ive arranged for you to act as my agent in the matter theres to be a preliminary meeting in belfast on monday night theyre expecting both of us who are tm not certain possibly this official ira leader himself michael cork i glanced at the brigadier your small man perhaps he said but we dont really know all we can say for certain is that you should get some sort of direct lead to him whatever happens and what do i do between now and monday go to oban and get hold of the right kind of boat he jothe savage day opened the briefcase and took out an envelope which he pushed across the table youll find a thousand pounds in there lets call it working capital he turned to meyer tm aware that such an amount is small beer to a man of your assets mr meyer but we wanted to be fair meyers hand fastened on the envelope money is important brigadier let nobody fool you i never turned down a grand in my life ferguson turned back to meit seemed to me that the most obvious pkce for your landing when you make the run will be the north antrim coast so meyer will rent a house in the area hell act as a link man between us once youve arrived and are in the thick of it you intend to be there yourself somewhere at hand just in case im needed but one thing must be stressed on no account are you to approach the military or police authorities in the area no matter what happens youre on your own simon he said tbetter get used to the idea ill help all i can at the right moment but until then i think i get the drift i said this is one of those jolly little operations that will have everybody from cabinet level down clapping their hands with glee if it works and howling for your blood if it doesnt he said and patted me on the shoulder but i have every confidence in you simon its going to work youll see at the moment i cant think of a single reason why it should but thanks for the vote of confidence he closed his briefcase and picked it up just remember one thing michael cork may be what some people would term an oldfashioned revolutionary and i think theyre probably right in other words he and bis kind dont approve of the indiscriminate slaughter of the innocent for political ends but hell kill me if he has to is that what youre trying to say without a seconds hesitation he put a hand on my shoulder must rush now but do promise me one thing whats that getyourself a decent gun he picked up the silenced pistol weighed it in his hand and dropped it on the table load of hong kong rubbish this one is by way of pekingi told him all the bloody same he said cheerfully and faded into the darkness we heard him on the stair for a moment and then he was gone meyer walked up and down flapping his arms again extremely agitated he makes me feel so uncomfortable why does he make me feel this way he went to what some people would term the right school you didnt rubbish he said you went to the right schools and with youi feel fine my mother was irish i said youre forgetting my one saving grace i tried another couple of shots with the chinese pistol and shook my head ferguson is right put this back in the christmas cracker where you found it and get me a real gun such as what about a mauser mm model with the bulbous silencer the kind they manufactured for german counterintelligence during the second war there must still be one or two around why not ask me for the gold from my teeth while youre about it its impossible where will i find such a thing these days oh youll manage i said you always do i held out my hand if youll give me my share of the loot ill be on my way oban is not just another station on the brighton line you know its on the northwest coast of scotland do i need a geography lesson he counted out five hundred pounds grumbling sweat on his face as there always was when he handled money i stowed it away in my inside breast pocket when will you be back he asked til try for the day after tomorrow he followed me up the stairs and we paused at the door of his office he said awkwardly look after yourself then it was as near as he could get to any demonstration of affection i said dont i always as i walked away he went into his office and a moment kter al bowlly was giving me a musical farewell all the way to the door three night sounds they started shooting again as i turned the corner the rattle of small arms fire drifting across the water through the fog from somewhere in the heart of the city it was echoed almost immediately by a heavy machinegun probably an armoured car opening up with its browning in reply belfast night soundscommon enough these days god knows but over here on this part of the docks it was as quiet as the grave only the gurgle of water amongst the wharf pilings to accompany me as i moved along the cobbled street past a row of warehouses i didnt see a soul which was hardly surprising for it was the sort of place to be hurried through if it had to be visited at all and theyd obviously had their troubles most of the streetlamps were smashed a warehouse a little further on had been burnt to the ground and at one point rubble and broken gkss carpeted the street i picked my way through and found what i was looking for on the next corner a large victorian public house the light in its windows the first sign of life id seen in the whole area the name was etched in acid on the frosted glass panel by the entrance cohans select bar an arguable point from the look of the place but i pushed open the door and went in anyway i found myself in a long narrow room the far end shrouded in shadow there was a small coal fire on the left two or three tables and some chairs and not much else except the old marbletopped bar with a mirror behind it that must have been quite something when clipper ships still used belfast docks now it was cracked in a dozen places the gold leaf on the ornate frame flaking away to reveal cheap plaster as used by life as the man who leaned against die beer pumps reading a newspaper he looked older than he probably was but that would be the drink if the breath on him was anything to go by the neck above the collarless shirt was seamed with dirt and he scratched the stubble on his chin nervously as he watched me approach he managed a smile when i was close enough good night to you sir and whats it to be oh a jameson i think i said a krge one the kind of night for it he went very still staring at me mouth gaping a little and he was no longer smiling english is it he whispered thats right another of those fascist beasts from across the water although i suppose that depends upon which side youre on i put a cigarette in my mouth and he produced a box of matches hastily and gave me a light his hands shaking i held his wrist to steady the flame youre quiet enough in here in all conscience where is everybody there was a movement behind me the softest of footfalls wind over grass in a forest at nightfall no more than that someone said quietly and who but a fool would be abroad at night in times like these when he could be safe home major he had emerged from the shadows at the end of the room hands deep in the pockets of a dark blue doublebreasted melton overcoat of a kind much favoured by undertakers the collar turned up about his neck five foot two or three at the most i took him for little more than a boy in years at least although the white devils face on him beneath the peak of the tweed cap the dark eyes that seemed perpetually fixed on eternity hinted at something more a soul in torment if ever id seen one youre a long way from kerry i said and how would you be knowing that i mind the accent isnt that what they say my mother god rest her was from stradballa something moved in his eyes then surprise i suppose although i was to learn that he seldom responded with any kind of emotion to anything in any event before he could reply a voice called softly from the shadows bring the major down here binnie there was a row of wooden booths each with its own frosted glass door to ensure privacy another relic of victorian times a young woman sat at a table in the end one she wore an old trenchcoat and headscarf but it was difficult to see much more than that binnie ran his hands over me from behind presumably looking for some sort of concealed weapon giving me no more than three opportunities of jumping him had i been so disposed satisfied i demanded he moved back and i turned to the girl simon vaughan i know who you are well enough and there you have the advantage of me norah murphy more american than irish to judge from the voice an evening for surprises i said and are you for the oban boat miss murphy and back again which disposed of the formalities satisfactorily and i pulled a chair back from the table and sat down i offered her a cigarette and when i gave her a light the match flaring in my cupped hands pulled her face out of the shadows for a moment dark empty eyes high cheekbones a wide rather sensual mouth as the match died she said you seem surprised i suppose i expected a man your sort would she said with a trace of bitterness ah the arrogant englishman you mean the toe of his boot for a dog and a whip for a woman isnt that the saying i would have thought it had possibilities she surprised me by laughing although i suspect it was in spite of herself give the man his whiskey binnie and make sure its a jameson the major always drinks jameson he moved to the bar i said whos your friend his name is gallagher major vaughan binnie gallagher young for his trade but old for his age he put the bottle and single glass on the table and leaned against the partition at one side arms folded i poured a drink and said well now miss murphy you seem to know all about me simon vaughan born delhi father a colonel in the indian army mother irish more shame to her i put in she ignored the remark and carried on winchester sandhurst military cross with the duke of wellingtons regiment in korea they must have been proud of you at the academy officer gentleman murderer the american accent was more noticeable now along with the anger in her voice there was a rather obvious pause as they both waited for some sort of reaction when i moved it was only to reach for the whiskey bottle but it was enough for binnie whose hand was inside his coat on the instant watch yourself he said i can handle this one she replied i couldnt be certain that the whole thing wasnt some prearranged ploy intended simply to test me but the fact that theyd spoken in irish was interesting and it occurred to rne that if the murphy girl knew as much about me as she seemed to she would be well aware that i spoke the language rather well myself thanks to my mother i poured another drink and said to binnie in irish how old are you boy he answered in a kind of reflex nineteen if youre faced with a search you can always dump a gun fast but a shoulder holster i shook my head get rid of it or you wont see twenty there was something in his eyes again but it was the girl who answered for him in english this time you should listen to the major binnie hes had a lot of practice at that kind of thing you said something about rny being a murderer i said borneo a place called selengar you had fourteen guerrillas executed whose only crime was fighting for the freedom of their country a debatable point considering the fact that they were all communist chinese i said she ignored me completely then there was a mr hui li whom you had tortured and beaten for several hours shot while trying to escape the newspapers called you the beast of selengar but the war office didnt want a stink so they put the lid on tight i actually managed a smile poor simon vaughan never did really recover from the eighteen months he spent in that chinese prison camp in korea so they didnt actually cashier you they eased you out only the mud stuck and now you sell guns to people like you i raised my glass and said gaily up the republic exactly she said then what are we complaining about i took the rest of my whiskey down carefully mr meyer is waiting to see you not far from here he simply wanted me to meet you first as a a precautionary measure we know exactly where mr meyer is staying in a hotel in lurgan street you have room fiftythree at the grand central only the best i said its that public school education you see now poor old meyer on the other hand can never forget getting out of germany in what he stood up in back in so he saves his money behind us the outside door burst open and a group of young men entered the bar there were four of them all dressed exactly alike in leather boots jeans and donkey jackets some sort of uniform i suppose a sign that you belonged that it was everyone else who was the outsider the faces and the manner of them as they swaggered in told all vicious young animals of a type to be found in any large city in the world from belfast to delhi and back again they were trouble and the barman knew it his face sagging as they paused inside the door to look round then started towards the bar a redhaired lad of seventeen or eighteen leading the way a smile on his face of entirely the wrong sort quiet tonight he said cheerfully when he got close the barman nodded nervously what can i get you the redhaired boy stood hands on the bar his friends ranged behind him were collecting for the new church hall at st michaels everyone else in the districts chipping in and we knew you wouldnt like to be left out he glanced around the bar again we were going to ask for fifty but i can see things arent so good so well make it twentyfive quid and leave it at that one of his friends reached over the bar helped himself to a pint pot and pumped out a beer the barman said slowly they arent building any church hall at st micks the redhaired boy glanced at his friends enquiringly then nodded gravely fair enough he said the truth then were from the ira were collecting for the organization more guns to fight the bloody british army with we need every penny we can get god save us the barman said but there isnt three quid in the till ive never known trade as bad the redhaired boy slapped him solidly across the face sending him back against the shelves three or four glasses bouncing to the floor twentyfive quid he said or we smash the place up take your choice binnie gallagher brushed past me like a wraitli he moved in behind them without a word he stood there waiting shoulders hunched the hands thrust deep into the pockets of the dark overcoat the redhaired boy saw him first and turned slowly and who the hell might you be little man binnie looked up and i saw him clearly in the mirror dark eyes burning in that white face the four of them eased round a little ready to move in on him and i reached for the bottle of jameson norah murphy put a hand on my arm he doesnt need you she said quietly my dear girl i only wanted a drink i murmured and poured myself another the ira is it binnie said the redhaired boy glanced at his friends for the first time slightly uncertain whats it to you im a lieutenant in the north tyrone brigade myself binnie said who are you lads one of them made a break for the door on the instant and incredibly a gun was in binnies left hand a mm browning automatic that looked like british army issue to me with that gun in his hand he became another person entirely a man to frighten the devil himself a natural born killer if ever id seen one the four of them cowered against the bar utterly terrified binnie said coldly lads are out in the streets tonight spilling their blood for ireland and bastards like you spit on their good name for christs sake the redhaired boy said we didnt mean no harm binnie kicked him in the crutch the boy sagged at the knees turned and clutched at the bar with one hand to stop himself from falling binnie reversed his grip on the browning the butt rose and fell like a hammer on the back of that outstretched hand and i heard the bones crack the boy gave a terrible groan and slipped to the floor halffainting at the feet of his horrified companions binnies right foot swung back as if to finish him off with a kick in the side of the head and norah murphy called sharply thats enough he stepped back instantly like a welltrained dog and stood watching the browning flat against his left thigh norah murphy moved past me and went to join them and i noticed that she was carrying in her right hand a square flat case which she placed on the bar pick him up she said the injured boys companions did as they were told holding him between them while she examined the hand i poured myself another jameson and joined the group as she opened the case the most interesting item on display was a stethoscope and she rummaged around and finally produced a large triangular sling which she tied about the boys neck to support the injured hand take him into casualty at the infirmary she said hell need a plaster cast and keep your mouth shut binnie put in they went out on the run the injured boys feet dragging between them the door closed and there was only the silence as norah murphy reached for the case i said is that just a front or the real thing would harvard medical school be good enough for you she demanded fascinating i said our friend here breaks them up and you put them together again thats what i call teamwork she didnt like that for she turned very pale and snapped the fastener of her case together angrily but i think she had determined not to lose her temper all right major vaughan she said i dont like you either shall we go she moved towards the door i turned and pkced my glass on the counter in front of the barman who was standing there wailing for god knows what axe to fell binnie said youve seen nothing heard nothing all right there was no need to threaten and the poor wretch nodded dumbly his lip trembling and then quite suddenly he collapsed across the bar and started to cry binnie surprised me then by patting him on the shoulder and saying with astonishing gentleness better times coming da just you see but if the barman believed that then i was the only sane man in a world gone mad it had started to rain and fog rolled in across the docks as we moved along the waterfront norah murphy at my side binnie bringing up the rear rather obviously neither of them said a word until we were perhaps half way to our destination when norah murphy paused at the end of a mean street of terrace houses and turned to binnie ive a patient i must see here i promised to drop a prescription in this evening five minutes she ignored me and walked away down the street pausing at the third or fourth door to knock briskly she was admitted almost at once and binnie and i moved into the shelter of an arched passageway between two houses i offered him a cigarette which he refused i lit one myself and leaned against the wall after a while he said your mother what was her maiden name fitzgerald i told him nuala fitzgerald he turned his face a pale shadow in the darkness there was a man of the same name schoolmaster at stradballa during the troubles her elder brother i said he leaned closer as if trying to see my face you a bloody englishman are the nephew of michael fitzgerald the schoolmaster of stradballa i suppose i must be why should that be so hard to take but he was a great hero binnie said he commanded the stradballa flying column when the tans came to take him he was teaching at the school because of the children he went outside and shot it out in the open one against fifteen and got clean away i know i said a real hero of the revolution all for the cause only he never wanted it to end binnie that was his trouble executed during the civil war by the free state government i always found that part of the story rather ironic myself or had you forgotten that after theyd got rid of the english the irish set about knocking each other off with even greater enthusiasm i could not see the expression on his face yet the tension in him was something tangible between us i said dont try it boy as the americans would say youre out of your league compared to me youre just a bloody amateur is that a fact now major he said softly another thing i said dr murphy wouldnt like it and we cant have that now can we she settled the matter for us by reappearing at that precise moment she sensed that something was wrong at once and paused what is it a slight difference of opinion thats all i told her binnies just discovered im related to a piece of grand old irish history and it sticks in his throat or didnt you know i knew she said coldly i thought you would i said the interesting thing is why didnt you tell him i didnt give her a chance to reply and cut the whole business short by moving off into the fog briskly in the general direction of lurgan street the hotel didnt have a great deal to commend it but then neither did lurgan street a row of decaying terrace houses a shop or two and a couple of pubs making as unattractive a sight as i have ever seen the hotel itself was little more than a lodginghouse of a type to be found near the docks of any large port catering mainly for sailors or prostitutes in need of a room for an hour or two it had been constructed by simply joining three terrace houses together and sticking a sign above the door of one of them a merchant navy officer came out as we approached and clutched at the railings for support a girl of eighteen or so in a black plastic mac emerged behind him straightened his cap and got a hand under his elbow to help him down the steps she looked us over without the slightest sense of shame and i smiled and nodded good nighta colleen god save the good work the laughter bubbled out of her god save you kindly they went off down the street together the sailor breaking into a reasonably unprintable song and i shook my head oh the pity of it a fine catholic girl to come to that binnie looked as if he would have liked to put a bullet into me but norah murphy showed no reaction at all except to say could we possibly get on with it major vaughan my time is limited we went up the steps and into die narrow hallway there was a desk of sorts to one side at the bottom of the stairs and an old whitehaired man in a faded alpaca jacket dozed behind it his chin in one hand there seemed little point in waking him and i led the way up to the first landing meyer had room seven at the end of the corridor and when i paused to knock we could hear music clearly from inside strangely plaintive something of the night in it norah murphy frowned шwhat on earth is it al bowlly i said simply alwho you mean youve never heard of al bowlly doctor why hes indisputably number one in the hit parade to any person of taste and judgement or he would be if he hadnt been killed in the london blitz in meyer listens to nothing else carries a cassette taperecorder with him everywhere youve got to be kidding she said i shook my head youre now listening tomoonlight on the highway probably the best thing he ever did recorded with the joe loss orchestra on the zist march you see ive become something of an expert myself the door opened and meyer appeared ah simon dr murphy i said and mr gallagher this is mr meyer i closed the door and meyer who could speak impeccable english when it suited him started to act the bewildered middleeuropean but i dont understand i was expecting to meet a mr cork commanding the official ira forces in northern ireland i walked to the window and lit a cigarette aware of binnie leaning against the door hands in his pockets it was raining harder than ever outside bouncing from the cobblestones norah murphy said i am empowered to act for michael cork you were to provide five thousand pounds in cash as an evidence of good faith where is it please she opened her case took out an envelope and threw it on the bed count it please simon meyer said al bowlly was working his way throughi double dare you as i reached for the envelope and norah murphy said quickly dont waste your time major theres only a thousand there there was a moment of distinct tension as meyer reached for the taperecorder and cut al bowlly dead and the other four we wanted to be absolutely certain thats all its ready and waiting no more than ten minutes walk from here he thought about it for a moment then nodded briefly all right to business please sit down he offered her the only chair and sat on the edge of the bed himself will you have any difficulty in meeting our requirements she asked the rifles will be no trouble at all i am in the happy position of being able to offer you five hundred chinese ak s probably the finest assault rifle in the world today extensively used by the viet cong in vietnam im aware of that she said a trifle impatiently and the other items grenades are no problem and we can offer you an excellent range of submachineguns the early thompsons still make a great deal of noise but i would personally recommend you to try the israeli uzi a remarkably efficient weapon absolutely first class dont you agree simon oh the best i said cheerfully theres a grip safety which stops it firing if dropped so we find it goes particularly well with the peasant trade theyre usually inclined to be rather clumsy she didnt even bother to look at me and armourpiercing weapons she said we asked for those most particularly rather more difficult im afraid meyer told her but we must have them she clenched her right hand and hammered it against her knee the knuckles white they are absolutely essential if we are to win the battle in the streets petrol bombs make a spectacular show on colour television mr meyer but they seldom do more than blister the paint of a saracen armoured car meyer sighed heavily i can deliver between eighty and one hundred and twenty lahti mm semiautomatic antitank cannons its a finnish gun not used by any western powers as far as i know is it efficient will it do the job ask the major hes the expert she turned to me and i shrugged any gun is only as good as the man using it but as a matter of interest someone broke into a bank in new york back in using a lahti blasted a hole through twenty inches of concrete and steel one round in the right pkce will open up a saracen like a tin can she nodded that hand still clenched a strange wild gleam in her eye youve used them youve had experience of them in action i mean in one of the trucial oman states and the yemen she turned to meyer you must guarantee competent instruction in their use agreed she didnt look at me there was no need meyer nodded major vaughan will be happy to oblige but for one week only and our fee will be an additional two thousand pounds on that agreed for the first consignment making twentyseven thousand in all she said meyer took off his glasses and started to polish them with a soiled handkerchief good then we can proceed as provisionally agreed with your representative in london i have hired a thirtyfoot motor cruiser berthed at oban at the present time rigged for deepsea fishing major vaughan will leave next thursday afternoon at high tide and will attempt the run with the first consignment and where is it to be landed she asked which was my department i said theres a small fishing port called stramore on the coast directly south from rathlin island theres a secluded inlet with a good beach about five miles east our informant has been running whiskey in there from the republic for the past five years without being caught so we should be all right your end is to make sure you have reliable people and transport on the spot to pick the stuff up and get the hell out of it fast and what do you do comply with my sailing instructions and call in at stramore ill contact you there she frowned as if thinking about it and meyer said calmly is it to your satisfaction oh yes i think so she nodded slowly except for one thing binnie and i go with him meyer looked at me in beautifully simulated bewilderment and spread his hand in another of those middleeuropean gestures but my dear young lady it simply is not on why not because this is an extremely hazardous undertaking because of an institution known as the british royal navy which patrols the ulster coast regularly these days with its mtbs if challenged major vaughan still stands some sort of a chance of getting away he is an expert at underwater work he carries frogmans equipment an aqualung he can take his chances over the side with you along the whole situation would be different oh im sure we can rely on major vaughan to see that the royal navy dont catch us she stood up and held out her hand well see you next thursday in oban then mr meyer meyer sighed waved his arms about helplessly then took her hand youre a very determined young woman you will not forget however that you owe me four thousand pounds how could i she turned to me when youre ready major binnie opened the door for us and i followed her out and as we went down the corridor al bowlly launched intogoodnight but not goodbye four in harms way as we went down the steps to the street a landrover swept out of the fog followed by another very close behind they had been stripped to the bare essentials so that the driver and the three soldiers who crouched in the rear of each vehicle behind him were completely exposed they were paratroopers efficient toughlooking young men in red berets and flak jackets their submachineguns held ready for instant action they disappeared into the fog and binnie spat into the gutter in disgust would you look at that now just asking to be chopped down the dumb bastards what wouldnt i give for a thompson gun and one crack at them it would be yourlast said they know exactly what j the savage day theyre doing believe me they perfected that open display technique in aden the crew of each vehicle looks after the other and without armour plating to get in their way they can return fire instantly if attacked bloody ss he said i shook my head no theyre not binnie most of them are lads around your own age trying to do a dirty job the best way they know how he frowned and for some reason my remark seemed to shut him up norah murphy didnt say a word but led the way briskly turning from one street into another without hesitation within a few minutes we came to a main road there was a church on the other side the sacred heart according to the board a victorian monstrosity in yellow brick which squatted in the rain behind a fringe of iron railings there were lights in the windows the sound of an organ and people emerged from the open door in one and twos to pause for a moment before plunging into the heavy rain as we crossed the road a priest came out of the porch and stood on the top step trying to open his umbrella he was a tall rather fraillooking man in a cassock and black raincoat and wore a broadbrimmed shovel hat that made it difficult to see his face he got the umbrella up started down the steps and paused suddenly dr murphy he called is that you norah murphy turned quickly hello father mac she said and then added in a low voice til only be a moment the woman i saw earlier is one of his parishioners binnie and i moved into the shelter of a doorway and she went under the shelter of the priests umbrella he glanced towards us once and nodded a gentle kindly man of sixty or so norah murphy held his umbrella and talked to him while he took off his hornrimmed spectacles and wiped rain from them with a handkerchief finally he replaced the spectacles and nodded tine my dear just fine he said and took a package from his raincoat pocket give her that when you next see her and tell her ill be along in the morning he touched his hat and walked away into the fog norah murphy watched him go then turned and tossed the package to me so unexpectedly that i barely caught it tour thousand pounds major vaughan i weighed the package in my two hands i didnt think the church was taking sides these days it isnt then who in the hell was that binnie laughed out loud and norah murphy smiled why that was michael cork major vaughan she said sweetly and walked away which was certainly one for the bookthe package was too bulky to fit in any pocket so i pushed it inside the front of my trenchcoat and buttoned the flap as i followed her binnie keeping pace with me she waited for us on the corner of a reasonably busy intersection four roads meeting to form a small square there were lots of people about most of them emerging from a large supermarket on our left which was ablaze with light to catch the evening trade soft music of the kind which is reputed to induce the right mood to buy drifting out through the entrance there was a certain amount of traffic about private cars mostly nosing out of the fog pausing at the pedestrian crossing then passing on j the savage day it was a typical street scene of the kind youd expect to find in any large industrial city except for one thing there was a police station on the other side of the square a modern building in concrete and glass and the entrance was protected by a sandbagged machinegun post manned by highlanders in glengarry bonnets and flak jackets norah murphy leaned against the railings clutching her case in both hands occupied belfast major how do you like it ive seen worse i said two men came round the corner in a hurry one of them bumping into binnie who fended him off angrily would you look where youre going now he demanded holding the man by the arm he was not much older than binnie with a thin narrowjawed face and wild eyes and he wore an old trilby hat he carried an attache case in his right hand and tried to pull away his companion was a different proposition altogether a tall heavily built man in a raincoat and cloth cap he was at least forty and had a craggy pugnacious face leave him be he snarled pulling binnie round by the shoulder and then his mouth gaped jesus binnie you couldnt have picked a worse spot get the hell out of it he pulled at ms companion they turned and hurried across the square through the traffic trouble norah murphy demanded binnie grabbed her by the arm and nodded the big fellas gerry lucas i dont know the other theyre bradys which being the belfast nickname for members of the provisional branch of the ira was enough to make anyone move fast we were already too kte a couple of cars had halted at the pedestrian crossing and a woman in a headscarf was halfway across pushing a pram in front of her a little girl of five or six trotting beside her a young couple shared an umbrella behind lucas and his friend reached the opposite pavement and paused behind a parked car where lucas produced a schmeisser machine pistol from beneath his raincoat and sprayed the machinegun post in the same moment his friend ran out into the open and tossed the attach case in an arc through the rain and muffed things disastrously for instead of dropping inside the machinegun post the case bounced from the sandbags to the gutter the two of them ran like hell for the shelter of the nearest side street and made it the highlanders being unable to open up with their machinegun for the simple reason that the square seemed to be suddenly filled with panicstricken people running everywhere the case exploded a split second later taking out half of the front of the machinegun post dissolving every window in the square in a snowstorm of flying glass people were running screaming some on their hands and knees faces streaming with blood cut by the flying glass one of the cars at the pedestrian crossing had been blown on to its side the crossing itself had been swept clean norah murphy ran out into the square in what i believe was a purely reflex action and binnie and i followed her towards the car which had turned over a man was trying to climb out through the shattered side window his face streaked with blood i hauled him through and he slipped to the ground and rolled over on his back the woman who had been pushing the pram on the jthe savage day pedestrian crossing was sprawled across the bonnet of the second car half the clothes torn off her from the condition of the rest of her she couldnt be anything else but dead the young couple who had been behind her were in the gutter on the far side of the road people clustering round the pram was miraculously intact lying against the wall but when i righted it the condition of the baby still strapped inside was beyond description the only good thing one could say was that death must have been instantaneous norah murphy was on her knees in the gutter beside the little girl who only a few moments before had gaily trotted beside her sisters pram she was badly injured smeared with blood and dust but still alive norah opened her case and took out a hypodermic as troops emerged cautiously from the police station she gave the child an injection and said calmly get out of it binnie before they cordon off the whole area get to kellys if you can take the major with you hes too valuable to lose now ill see you there later binnie gazed down at the child those dark eyes blazing and then he did a strange thing he reached for one of the limp hands and held it tightly for a moment the bastards he said softly a saracen swept into the square on the far side and braked to a halt effectively blocking the street will you get out of it binnie she said i jerked him to his feet he stood looking down for a moment not at her but at the child then turned and moved across the square away from the saracen without a word i went after him quickly and he turned into a narrow alley and started to run i followed at his heels and we twisted and turned through a dark rabbit warren of mean streets the sounds from the square growing fainter although never actually fading away altogether we finally came to the banks of a narrow canal of some description moved along the towpath past an old iron footbridge and turned into an entry there was a high wooden gate at the end with a lamp bracketed to the wall above it a faded sign readkellys for scrap binnie opened the judas and i followed him through there was a small yard inside another lamp high on the wall of the house giving plenty of illumination which made sense for all sorts of reasons if this was a place of refuge as i suspected binnie knocked on the back door after a while steps approached and he said in a low voice its me binnie a bolt was withdrawn the door opened an old woman stood revealed very old with milkwhite blind eyes and a shawl across her shoulders its me mrs kelly binnie said with a friend she reached for his face cupped it in her hands for a moment then smiled without a word turned and led the way inside when she opened the door at the end of the passage into the kitchen lucas and the bombthrower were standing shoulder to shoulder on the other side of the table lucas holding the schmeisser at the ready his friend clutching an old webley revolver that looked too big for him well would you look at this now binnie said rats will find a hole so they say he spat on the floor you did a fine job on the women and children back there the youth with the webley turned wildly i told you he said and lucas struck him across the mouth his eyes never leaving binnie shut your mouth riley and you just watch it binnie or you might get some of the same whos your friend none of your affair and what if i decide to make it mine dont mind me i put in for the first time lucas lost some of that iron composure of his he stared at me in astonishment a bloody englishman is it or as much an irishman as de valera i said it depends on your point of view hes here on business for the small man binnie said for cork himself so keep your nose out of it they confronted each other for another tense moment then the old lady slipped in between them without a word and placed a pot of tea in the centre of the table lucas turned away angrily and i sat down against the wall and lit a cigarette i offered binnie one but he refused the old lady brought us a cup of tea each then moved to the others she doesnt have much to say for herself i observed she wouldnt binnie replied being dumb as well as blind he stared into space something close to pain in his eyes thinking of that child whose hand he had held i suspect i said remember what you were saying about my uncle coming out of the schoolhouse so the children wouldnt be harmed to shoot it out with the tans like a man he turned to me with a frown so what i said gently times have changed havent they binnie he stood up walked over to the other side of the room and sat down with his back to me i suppose it must have been all of two hours before there was a knock at the door they all had a gun out on the instant including binnie and waited while the old lady went to the door norah murphy came into the kitchen she paused her eyes narrowing as she recognized lucas then she placed her case on the table td love a cup of tea ma she said in irish as mrs kelly followed her in she was as crisp and incisive as she had been at our first meeting it was as if nothing had happened in between at all and yet the skirts of her trenchcoat were stained with blood i wondered if anything would ever really touch her binnie said what happened i helped out till the ambulances arrived how many were killed lucas demanded five she said and turned to me tu have that cigarette now major and soldiers young riley leaned on the table with both hands his eyes wilder than ever how many soldiers norah murphy turned from the match i held for her and blew out a long column of smoke and who might you be she enquired tdennis riley maam he said in a low voice well then dennis riley you really will have to put in some practice before your next free show the score this time was a mother and her two children and a couple of eighteenyearolds whod just got engaged no soldiers im afraid riley colkpsed into a chair and binnie said quietly the little girl she died then im afraid so he turned to lucas and riley and the look on his face was the same look i had seen in the pub earlier when he had confronted the hooligans women and kids now is it he kicked the table over the browning was in his hand by a kind of magic you bloody bastards heres for the two of you norah murphy had his arm up as he fired a bullet ploughing through the ceiling she slapped him across the cheek he turned a strange dazed look on his face and she grabbed him by the shoulders and shook him as one might shake a recalcitrant child whats done is done binnie quarrelling like this amongst ourselves wont help now lucas stood with his back against the wall the schmeisser ready no more than a hairsbreadth away from cutting loose with it riley scrabbled on the floor at his feet for the webley which he had lost when the table went over better to move on from here norah murphy said all of us and the sooner the better someone might have heard that shot she turned to mrs kelly tm sorry ma the old woman smiled and touched her face i said how are we going to work it she shrugged well have to split up naturally better to take your chances on your own major did you notice a footbridge over the canal on your way here i did cross over take the towpath for a couple of hundred yards and a narrow passageway brings you into delph lane half a mile along that and youll be in the centre of the city why in the hell should he go first lucas demanded she totally ignored him and said to binnie we ought to leave separately it would be the sensible thing and how would i explain the loss of his niece to michael cork if anything happened to you which was an interesting disclosureshe actually smiled for him then turned to meos you go then major the old woman went out ahead of me i turned in the doorway up the republic i said right up then i closed the door gently and moved along the passage mrs kelly had the door open and beyond in the yard rain fell in a silver curtain through the lamplight i turned up my collar thanks for everything there was a strangely uncertain look to her a slight frown on her face as if there was something here she did not understand the milkwhite eyes stared past me vacantly and her fingers reached to touch my cheeks to trace the line of my mouth and they found what they were searching for those fingers and fear blossomed on her face the kind that a child might feel standing at the top of the stairs aware of some nameless horror some presence in the darkness below i said gently in irish this is not on you old woman none of it she pushed me out into the rain and closed the door i found a dark corner of shadows near the footbridge with some bushes reaching over the wall above to give me some sort of shelter i couldnt smoke the smell would have been too distinctive on the damp air so i waited as i had waited in other places than this different lands hotter climates but always the same situation there was the sound of cautious footsteps and a moment later two figures emerged from the alley binnie and norah i saw them clearly in the light of the lamp as they went up the steps to the bridge their footsteps boomed hollowly for a moment then faded as they passed along the other side i returned to my waiting strange the tricks memory plays the heavy rain i suppose reminding me of the monsoon borneo kota baru the ruins of the village the stench of burning flesh acrid smoke heavy on the rain the dead schoolchildren they too had been butchered for a cause just like the little girl and her sister in the square tonight the same story in so many places a stone rattled in the alleyway and they emerged a moment later lucas was well out in front he stood under the lamp then went up the steps to the footbridge alone probably to test the ground eiley paused in the shadows and waited no more than a couple of yards from me i took him from behind with the simplest of headlocks snapping his neck so quickly that he had no chance to make even the slightest cry i lowered him gently to the ground found the webley in his coat pocket picked up his old trilby and pulled it on then i moved towards the bridge lucas was halfway across will you get your bloody finger out dennis he called softly i went up the steps head down so that it was only at the last moment instinct told him something was wrong and he swung to face me i said youre a big man with women and kids lucas how do you feel now he was trying to get the schmeisser out from underneath his coat when i shot him in the right shoulder the heavy bullet turning him round in a circle the other two shots shattered his spine driving him across the handrail of the bridge to hang headdown his raincoat started to smoulders there was a tiny tongue of flame i leaned down got him by the ankles with one hand and tipped him over then i tossed the webley and the trilby after him and continued across the bridge five storm warning most of oban seemed to be enveloped in a damp clinging mist when i went out on deck and there was rain on the wind which was hardly surprising for it had been threatening ever since my arrival two days previously beyond kerrera the waters of the firth of lome when one could see them at all seemed reasonably troubled and things generally looked as if they might get worse before they got better hardly the most comforting of thoughts with the prospect of the kind of passage by night i had in front of me for the moment i was snug enough anchored fifty yards from the main jetty i made a quick check to make certain that all my lines were secure and was just going to go below when a taxi pulled up on the jetty and meyer got out he didnt bother to wave simply descended a flight of stone steps to the waters edge and stood waiting so i dropped over the side into the rubber dinghy started the outboard motor and went to get him he looked distinctly out of place in his black homburg and old burberry raincoat a parcel under one arm a briefcase in his other hand and he obviously felt it is it safe this thing he demanded peering anxiously through his spectacles at the dinghy as houses said taking the briefcase he passed to me he hung on to the parcel stepped gingerly into the dinghy and sat down in the prow as we moved towards the motor cruiser he turned to have a look at her are you satisfied couldnt be better thekathleen isnt that what they call her i must say she doesnt look much which is exactly why i chose her i said we bumped against the hull i went up the short ladder and over the rail with the line as i turned to help meyer a curtain of rain drifted across the harbour he darted for the shelter of the companionway and i followed him down to the saloon what about some breakfast i said as he took off his coat and hat breakfast he looked at me blankly but its almost noon so i got up late i shrugged all right tea then i went into the galley and as i put on the kettle al bowlly broke intoits all forgotten now when i went back into the saloon meyer was sitting at the table lighting one of the fat dutch cigars he favoured the little cassette taperecorder in front of him when are our friends due i glanced at my watch about an hour youre late what kept you the brigadier came to see me before i left so i had to get a later plane what did he want a final briefing thats all hes flying to northern ireland himself this afternoon to be on hand in case hes needed the kettle started to whistle in the galley so i went in to make the tea meyer followed and leaned in the doorway watching me perhaps im tired or maybe its just that im getting old and i didnt sleep so good kst night and thats always a bad sign with me i poured milk and tea into two enamel mugs topped them up with a krgish measure of jameson and handed him one what are you trying to say meyer i dont feel so good about this simon like you said youre tired thats all he shook his head violently you know me i get an instinct for these things and im never wrong the first time i felt like this was when i was seventeen years of age back in i know i said youve told me often enough you got out of munich half an hour before the gestapo came to arrest you your uncle and aunt wouldnt listen and died in dachau he made a violent gesture tea slopping out of his mug tont mock me simon what about that time in casablanca if you hadnt listened to me then and left on the next plane theyd have arrested both of us right so youve got second sight i moved past him into the saloonhave you tried telling the brigadier you dont feel so good about things he shrugged helplessly and sat down at the table opposite me how do we get into such situations simon its crazy because we didnt have any choice i said its as simple as that did you bring what i asked in the parcel i started to unwrap it and he added wheres the cargo the lahtis are in the aft cabin youre sitting on the uzis i removed the last of the brown paper and opened the flat cardboard box it contained inside there was several pounds of what looked like childrens plasticine but was in fact a new and rather effective plastic explosive called aki there was a box of chemical fuses to go with it there was also a cloth bundle tied with string which when i opened it contained several clips of ammunition and a mauser automatic pistol with a rather strange bulbous barrel that damn things almost a museum piece meyer observed as i hefted it on one hand youve no idea the trouble i had finding one i know i said but its still the only really effective silenced handgun ever made i picked up the box and stood lets go up top i want to show you something it was raining harder than ever when we went out on deck i led the way into the wheelhouse put the box down on the chart table reached underneath and pressed a spring catch a flap fell down which held a mark iis sten there were several other spring clips and a shelf behind aslight improvement said this is what kept me up so late last night i put the ari on the back shelf with the fuses and spare ammunition clips loaded the mauser and fitted it into place then pushed the flap up out of sight very neat meyer observed nothing like being prepared he glanced at his watch ill have to be away soon ive got a hire car laid on by a local garage theyre going to run me down to abbotsinch ill catch the evening plane to belfast from there then what he shrugged ill get straight to the house ive rented and wait to hear from you youd better show me where it is i got out the right map for him and he found it soon enough here we are about ten miles out of stramore on this road randall cottage its right at the end of a farm track beside a small wood a bit tumbledown but rather nice the sort of pkce they rent to holidaymakers in the season heres the telephone number it was easy enough to remember i rolled the slip of paper into a ball and flipped it out through the side window what did you tell the agent i said i was a writer belfast was beginning to get me down and i felt in urgent need of a little peace and quiet i used the name berger by the way just in case i nodded it all sounds pretty neat to me he looked out across the firth a trifle dubiously as rain drummed against the roof of the cabin with renewed vigour do you really think youll get across tonight it doesnt look too good according to the met forecast things should ease up considerably during the early evening and even if they dont well still make it this boat was built to stand most things there was a sudden hail across the waterkathleen ahoy norah murphy and binnie gallagher were standing on the jetty beside a taxi meyer said take me across with you and ill be on my way i dont want to talk to her any more than i can help he went below to get his hat and coat and when he returned he was stowing al bowlly away in his briefcase i helped him over the rail slipped the line and joined him his face was very pale as i started the outboard i said look its going to be all right i promise you is that so he demanded then tell me why i feel like im lying in my grave listening to earth rattling against the lid of my coffin i couldnt think of a single thing to say that would have done any good in any case we were already coming in to the steps at the bottom of the jetty i stayed to tie up the dinghy and meyer went up ahead of me to where norah murphy and binnie waited beside the taxi the boy was dressed exactly as he had been on that rather memorable night in belfast but norah murphy herself was all togged up for cowes week in a yellow oilskin underneath she wore a navy blue guernsey sweater slacks and rubber boots meyer turned to me as i arrived tm just making my excuses to dr murphy simon but i really must get moving now or ill miss my plane ill be seeing you soon i said and shook hands he got into the taxi quickly the driver passed out a suitcase to binnie then drove away norah murphy said coolly so here we are again major so it would appear i led the way down the steps to the dinghy and binnie followed with the case he didnt look too happy but he got in after a moments hesitation and sat in the prow norah murphy perched herself in the stern beside me as we pulled away she said casually its going to be a dirty night is the boat up to it have you done much sailing one of my aunts was married to a retired sea captain they had a house near cape cod then you should have learned by now not to be taken in by top show take thekafbeen underneath that rather drab coat of grey paint theres a steel hull by akerboon only the best she looked suitably impressed how is she powered tenta petrol engine twin screws shell do about twentyfive knots at full stretch depth sounder radar automatic steering shes got the lot i cut the motor and we coasted in norah murphy took the line and went over the rail nimbly enough binnie was nothing like so agile and from the look on his face it was obvious that he was going to have a bad night of it whatever happened he was like a fish out of water in fact i doubt if he had ever been on a boat certainly a small boat of that type in his life before when he took off that sinister black overcoat of his he looked younger than ever and the clothes he wore didnt help a stiff white collar a size too krge for him a knitted tie and an illfitting doublebreasted suit of clerical grey norah murphy opened one of the saloon cupboards to hang the coat up for him and found a neopryne wet suit flippers and mask and an aqualung inside she turned one eybrow raised dont tell me you still intend to go over the rail if the situation arises til take you with me if i do i promise she put the suitcase on the table opened it and took out binnies browning automatic she held it in her right hand for a moment looking at me eyes narrowed slightly then she tossed it to binnie who was sitting down on one of the bench seats tamn you vaughan she said rather petulantly never know which way to take you you smile all the time it isnt natural well youve got to admit the worlds a funny old place love i said definitely a laugh a minute i went into the galley got the bottle of jameson and three mugs when i returned she was sitting on the opposite side of the table from binnie smoking a cigarette whiskey i said its all ive got im afraid she nodded but binnie shook hfs head admittedly we were dancing about a bit for quite a ground swell was building up inside the harbour but he already looked ghastly god knows what it was going to do to him when we ventured into the open sea norah murphy said wheres the cargo i told her and she nodded what are we carrying fifty lahti antitank cannon and fifty submachineguns she sat up straight frowning deeply what goes on here i expected more a great deal more impossible in a boat this sizei said those lahtis are seven feet long have a look in the aft cabin and see for yourself it will take a couple of trips to get all your first order across she went into the aft cabin after a while she came back and sat down picking up her mug again jzthe savage day another thing i said if were challenged if this boat is searched we dont stand a cat in hells chance you realize that as im not one of those captains who relishes the idea of going down with the ship id appreciate it if youd make it clear to billy the kid here that we dont want any heroics poor binnie couldnt even manage a scowl he got up suddenly and made for the companionway norah murphy said im afraid he isnt much of a sailor what time do we leave ive decided to make it a little later than id intended five oclock or even six give this weather a chance to clear a little youre the captain what about your friend meyer will we be seeing him again i should imagine so when the right time comes binnie stumbled down the companionway and clutched at the wall to keep his balance i said never mind binnie they say nelson was sick every time ne went to sea still i dont suppose thats much comfort your lot didnt have much time for him either did they he ignored me completely and disappeared into the aft cabin i started for the companionway and norah murphy moved round the table to block my way she seemed genuinely angry were you born a thoroughgoing bastard vaughan of do you just work at it the boat rocked hard throwing her against me so i did the obvious thing and kissed her it was hardly all systems go but id known worse when i finally released her she shrugged that strangely cruel mouth of hers twisted scornfully only fair major she observed now whos being a bastard i said and went up the companionway fast we left just before six that evening and although the weather hadnt improved all that much at least it hadnt got any worse as i pressed the starter and the engines rattled into life the wheelhouse door opened a flurry of wind lifting the chart like a sail and norah murphy came in she stood at my elbow peering into the gloom of evening whats the forecast nothing to get worked up about three to four winds with rain squalls a light sea fog in the rathlin island area just before dawn that should be useful she said can i take the wheel later hows binnie flat on his back id better go and make sure hes all right ill see you later the door closed behind her and i tookkathleen out through the harbour entrance in a long sweeping curve into the firth the masthead light began to swing rhythmically from side to side as the swell started to roll beneath us and spray scattered across the window a couple of points to starboard i could see the outline of a steamer against the slate grey evening sky and her red and green navigation lights were clearly visible i reduced speed to twelve knots and we plunged forward into the gathering darkness the sound of the engines a muted throbbing on the night air it must have been close to eleven oclock when she returned the door opened softly and she came in with a tray i could smell the coffee and something more the delicious scent of fried bacon tm sorry vaughan she said t fell asleep ive brought you some coffee and a bacon sandwich where are we well on the way i said theres islay over there to the east of us you can see a light occasionally between rain squalls ill spell you if you like no need i can put her on automatic pilot i checked the course altered it a point to starboard then locked the steering when i turned and reached for my sandwich i found her watching me a slight frown on her face you know i cant figure you vaughan not for one single minute in what way she lit a cigarette and turned to peer out into the darkness oh the beast of selengar bit my finest hour i said believe me mgm couldnt have improved on the part and i had made her angry again for gods sake cant you ever be serious all right keep your shirt on what do you want to know the gory details only if its the truth no matter how unpleasant and whats that i demanded and found that for no accountable reason my throat had gone dry i swallowed some of the coffee quickly burning my mouth and put the mug down on the chart table all right you asked for it i sat down on the swivel chair unlocked the automatic steering mechanism and took the wheel again there was an area in borneo around kota baru that was absolutely controlled by terrorists back in and most of them were chinese cbmmunist infiltrators not locals they terrorized the whole area burned villages wholesale coerced the dyaks into helping them by butchering every second man and woman in some of the villages they took just to encourage the others and they put you in to do something about it i was supposed to be an expert on that kind of thing so they gave me command of a company of irregulars dyak scouts and told me to clean out the stable and not come back till id done it a direct order not on paper not in those terms we didnt have much luck at first they burned two or three more villages in one case after herding over fifty men women and children into a longhouse beforehand finally they burned the mission at kota baru raped and murdered four nuns and eighteen young girls that was it as far as i was concerned what did you do got lucky an informer tipped me off that a chinese merchant in selengar named hui li was a communist agent i arrested him and when he refused to talk i handed him over to the dyaks there was no horror on her face and her voice was quite calm as she said to torture him dyaks can be very persuasive he only lasted a couple of hours then he told me where the group id been chasing were holed up and did you get them jthe savage day eventually theyd split into two which didnt help but we managed it they said you shot your prisoners only during the final pursuit when i was hard on the heels of the second group prisoners would have delayed me i see she nodded with a kind of clinical detachment on her face and mr hui li shottrying to escape you expect me to believe that i laughed and without the slightest bitterness absolutely true and thats the most ironic part of it i was quite prepared to take him down to the coast and let him stand trial but he tried to make a break for it the night before we left there was silence for a while i opened a window and took a deep breath of fresh sea air look what i did to him he would have done to me the purpose of terrorism is to terrorise a favourite tag of michael collins but lenin said it first and its on page one of every communist handbook on revolutionary warfare you can only fight that kind of fire with fire you ruined yourself she said and there was a strange savage concerned note in her voice you fool you threw everything away career reputation everything and for what i did what had to be done i said malaya kenya cyprus aden id seen it all and i was tired of people justifying the murder of the innocent by pleading that it was all in the name of the revolution when i finished there was no more terror by night in kota baru no more butchering of little girlsthat should count for something god knows i was surprised at the feeling in my voice the way my hands were shaking i stood up and pulled her forward roughly you wanted to take the wheel its all yours stay on this course and wake me in three hours before if the weather changes she grabbed my sleeve im sorry vaughan i really am you live long enough you get over anything i said ive learnt that or so i told myself as i went below perhaps if i repeated it often enough i might really come to believe it i slept on one of the saloon bench seats and when i awakened it was almost three oclock binnie was snoring steadily in the aft cabin i peered in and found him flat on his back collar and tie undone mouth open i left him to it and went up the companionway there was quite a sea and cold spray stung my face as i moved along the heaving deck and opened the wheelhouse door norah murphy was standing at the wheel her face disembodied in the compass light how are things going i asked fine theres been a sea running for about half an hour now i glanced out likely to get worse before it gets better ill take over she made way for me her body brushing mine as we squeezed past each other i dont think i could sleep now if i wanted to all right i said make some more tea and come back things might get interesting and check the forecast on the radio i increased speed racing the heavy weather that threatened from the east and the waves grew rougher jbthe savage day rockingkathleen from side to side visibility was rotten utter darkness on every hand except for a slight phosphorescence from the sea norah murphy seemed to be taking her time but when she returned she brought more bacon sandwiches as well as the tea the forecast wasnt too bad she said wind moderating intermittent rain squalls anything else some fog patches towards dawn but nothing to worry about i helped myself to a sandwich hows the boy wonder she didnt like that i could see but she kept her temper and handed me a mug hes sitting up now in the saloon i gave him tea with something in it hell be all right lets hope so he could be needed she said let me tell you about binnie gallagher major vaughan during the rioting that broke out in belfast in august an orange mob led by b specials would have burned the falls road to the ground chased out every catholic family who lived there or worse they were prevented by a handful of ira men who took to the streets led by michael cork himself the small man again and binnie was one of that lot dont tell me youre actually impressed oh but i am i said they did a hell of a good job that night those men a great ploy as my mother would have said and binnie was one of them he must have been all of sixteen he was staying with an aunt in the area she gave him an old revolver a war souvenir of her dead husbands and binnie went in search of the small man fought at his right hand during the whole of that terrible night hes been his shadow ever since his most trusted aide which explains why he guards the great mans niece she lit a couple of cigarettes and passed one to me i said how does an american come to be mixed up in all this anyway its simple enough my father spent around seventeen years in one kind of british prison or another if you add up all his sentences i was thirteen when he was finally released and we emigrated to the states to join my uncle michael a new life so we thought but too kte for my father he was a sick man when they released mm he died three years later and you never forgave them they might as well have hanged him and you decided you ought to take up where he left off we have a right to be free she said the people of ulster have been denied their nationhood too long it sounded like the first two sentences of some illwritten political pamphlet and probably was i said look what happened in august was a bad business which was exactly why the army was brought in to protect the catholic minority while the necessary political changes were put in hand and it was working until the ira got up to their old tricks again i wonder what your uncle would have thought if he could have heard you say that the dear old schoolmaster of stradbalk i said tbinnies particular hero the saint who wouldnt see the children harmed at any price he doesnt exist hes a myth no revolutionary leader could act like he was supposed to and survive what are you trying to say she said amongst other things that he had at least forty people executed including several british officers in reprisal for the execution of ira men a pretty dubious action morally i would have thought on one particularly unsavoury occasion he was responsible for the shooting of a seventyeightyearold woman who was thought to have passed on information to the police in the light of the binnacle her right fist was clenched so tightly that the knuckles gleamed white in revolutionary warfare these things have to be done she said there is no other choice have you tried telling binnie that i said or hadnt it occurred to you that that boy really believes with all bis heart that it can be done with clean hands i saw him at ma kellys remember hed have killed those two proves himself if you hadnt stopped him because he couldnt stomach what theyd done tbinnie is an idealist she said theres nothing wrong in that hed lay down his life for ireland without a seconds hesitation td have thought it more desirable all round if hed lived for her i said but then thats just my opinion and why in the hell should he take any notice of that she demanded who are you anyway vaughan a failure a renegade whos willing to turn on his own side for the sake of a pound or two thats me i said simon vaughan your friendly arms salesman i was smiling again although it was something of an effort and she couldnt stand that you arrogant bastard she said angrily at least well have something to show for our struggles people like binnie and me i know i said a land of standing corpses she moved very close a curious glitter in her eye and her voice was a sort of hoarse whisper better that than what we had id rather see the city of belfast burn like a funeral pyre than go back to what we had and suddenly for no sensible reason i knew that i was close to the heart of things where she was concerned i said calmly and what was that norah tell me there was a kind of vacant look on her face the voice changed became noticeably more belfast than american and there was a lost littlegirl touch to it that chilled my blood when my father was released from jail that last time he didnt want any more trouble so he dropped out of sight till we were ready to leave for america they came to our house looking for him several times who did i said the b specials one night while they were interrogating my mother one of them took me out into the back yard he said he believed there might be arms in the shed my stomach tightened as if to receive a blow i said and were there i was thirteen she said remember that he made me lie down on some old sacking when he was finished he told me there was no point in trying to tell anyone because i wouldnt be believed and he made threats against my mother and the family he said he wouldnt be responsible for what might happen there was a longish silence the splutter of rain against the glass she said youre the first person ive told vaughan the only one not even a priest isnt that the strange thing i said hoarsely im sorry youre sorry and at that she exploded broke apart at the seams by god ill see them in hell vaughan every last one of them for what they did to me do you understand she stumbled outside the door slammed it occurred to me then and not for the first time that there were occasions when i despaired of humanity and yet there was no sense of personal involvement and any pity i felt w s not so much for norah murphy as for that wretched frightened little girl in the back yard of that house in belfast so many years ago i lit a cigarette and turning to flick the match through the open window on my left found binnie standing there as if turned to stone die face contorted into a mask of agony such suffering in the eyes as i never hope to see again i put a hand on his shoulder which seemed to bring him back to life he looked up at me in a strange dazed way then turned and walked away along the deck we raised rathlin island just before four am although i could only catch a glimpse of the lighthouse intermittently due to the bad visibility from then on we were in enemy waters so to speak and i had both norah murphy and binnie join me in the wheelhouse for a final briefing she seemed entirely recovered and so did he i could not imagine for one moment that he would have told her that he had overheard our conversation or ever would but in that bleak undertakers coat of his he certainly looked his old grim self again as he leaned over the chart i traced our course with a pencil here we are another ten minutes and we round crag island and start the runin to the coast the channel through the reef is clearly marked and good deep water bloody passage norah murphy saidis that it i nodded apparently one of the biggest ships in the spanish armada went down there according to old documents the bodies floated in for weeks i glanced at my watch its fourtwenty now and were due in at five first lights around sixfifteen which gives us plenty of time to get in and out lets hope your people are on time they will be she said once were into the passage ill have to kill the deck lights so i want both you and binnie in the prow to look for the signal a red light at twosecond intervals on the minute or three blasts on a foghorn on the minute if visibility is really bad which it was there was no doubt about that as we crept in towards the shore the engine throttled right back to the merest murmur not that it was particularly dangerous even when i switched off the deck and masthead lights for bloody passage was a good hundred yards across so there was little chance of coming to harm we were close now very close and i strained my eyes into the darkness looking for that light but it was hopeless in all that mist and rain and then as i leaned out of the side window a foghorn sounded three times in the distance binnie appeared at the door did you hear that major i nodded and replied on our own foghorn with exactly the same signal i told binnie to return to the prow throttled back and coasted in gently the foghorn sounded again very close now which surprised me for by my reckoning we still had a good quarter of a mile to go i replied again as agreed and in the same moment some strange instinct product i suppose of several years of rather hard living told me that something was very wrong indeed too late of course for a moment later a searchlight picked us out of the darkness there was a rumble of engines breaking into life and an mtb cut across our bow i was aware of the white ensign fluttering bravely in the dim light and then the sudden menacing chatter of a heavy machinegun above our heads as i ducked instinctively she cut in again and an officer on the bridge called through a loudhailer im coming aboard heave to or i sink you norah murphy appeared in the doorway at the same moment what are we going to do she demanded i should have thought that was obvious i cut the engines switched on the deck lights and lit a cigarette binnie had moved along the deck and was standing outside the open window i said remember boy no heroics nothing to be gained as the mtb came alongside a couple of ratings jumped down to our deck a line was thrown and quickly secured the standard submachinegun in general use by the royal navy is the sterling so it was something of a surprise when a petty officer appeared at the rail above holding a thompson gun ready for action the model with the hundred drum magazine the officer appeared beside him a big man in a standard reefer coat and peaked cap a pair of night glasses slung about his neck norah murphy sucked in her breath sharply my god she said frank barry it was a name id heard before and then i remembered my cell on skarthos and the brigadier briefing me on the ira and its various splinter groups fanatical fringe elements who wanted to blow up every thing in sight and the worst of the lot were frank barrys sons of erin he leaned over the rail and grinned down at her in storm warningj the flesh and twice as handsome good night to you norah murphy binnie made a sudden convulsive movement and barry said genially i wouldnt binnie me old love tim pat here would cut you in half one of the two ratings who had already boarded relieved binnie of his browning i leaned out of the window and said softly friends of yours binnie friends he said bitterly majori wouldnt cut that bloody lot down if they were hanging six bloody passage the man with the thompson gun the one dressed as a petty officer whom barry had called tim pat came over the rail to confront us on closer inspection he proved to have only one eye but otherwise bore a distinct resemblance to the great victor mclaglen in one of those roles where he looks ready to clear the bar of some waterfront saloon on his own at any moment barry dropped down beside him a handsome leanfaced man with one side of his mouth hooked into a slight perpetual half smile as if permanently amused by the world and its inhabitants god save the good work norah he took off his cap and turned a cheek towards her have you got a kiss for me binnie swung a punch at him which barry blocked easily and tim pat got an arm about the boys throat and squeezed ive told you before norah barry said shaking his head you should never use a boy when a mans work is needed i think she could have killed him then certainly she looked capable of it eyes hot in that pale face of hers but always there was that iron control god knows what was needed to break her but i doubted whether barry was capable he shrugged lit a cigarette turning to me as he flicked the match over the rail now you major he said look like a sensible man to me and where exactly does that get us to you telling me where youve got the stuff stowed away well find it in the end but id rather it was sooner than later and tim pat heres the terrible impatient one if hes kept waiting which seemed more than likely from the look of him so i volunteered the necessary information thats what i like about the english he said youre always so bloody reasonable he nodded to tim pat put them in the aft cabin for the time being and lets get moving i want that gear transferred and us out of it in fifteen minutes at the outside he snapped his fingers and another half a dozen men all in british naval uniform came over the rail but by then tim pat was already herding us towards the companionway he took us below shoved us into the big aft cabin and locked us in i stood at the door listening to the bustle in the saloon then turned to face my companions and who might this little lot be the walking ape is tim pat keogh binnie said violently and one of these days cool it binnie norah murphy cut in on him sharply that kind of talk isnt going to help one little bit she turned back to me the boss man is frank barry he was my uncles righthand man until six or seven months ago then he decided to go his own way whatisheaprovo she shook her head no he runs his own show the sons of erin they call themselves i believe there was a revolutionary organization under that name in fenian times he seems to be remarkably well informed i said what else do he and his men get up to besides this kind of thing theyd shoot the pope if they thought it was necessary binnie said i glanced at norah murphy in some surprise and she shrugged and theyre all good catholic boys except for barry himself remember the stern gang in palestine well the sons of erin are exactly the same they believe in the purity of violence if the cause is just so anything goes the bomb in the cafd women kids the lot thats the general idea well its a point of view i suppose not in my book it isnt binnie said quietly theres got to be another way has to be or theres no point to any of it which was the kind of remark that had roughly the same effect on one as being hit by a very light truck the brigadier had once accused me of being the kst of the romantics but i wasnt even in the running for that title with binnie around the door opened and frank barry appeared a bottle of my jameson in one hand four tin mugs from the galley hanging from his fingers behind him they were passing the lahtis out of the other cabin and up the companionway by god major vaughan but you deal in good stuff and i dont just mean your whiskey he said those lahtis are the meanestlooking thing ive seen in many a long day i cant wait to try one out on a weasel armoured car we aim to please i said the motto of the firm i only hope youve had your money he splashed whiskey into all four mugs norah and binnie stood firm but it seemed to me likely to be cold where i was going so i emptied one at a swallow and helped myself to another the small man wont be pleased by this nights work barry said to norah at a guess id say hell have your hide and nail it to the door chance would be a fine thing he toasted her mug raised that slight mocking smile hooked firmly into place an immensely likeable human being in every way or so he appeared at that first meeting and it seemed to me more than a probability that he would be the end of me in the near future if i did not get to him first tim pat appeared in the doorway behind him were ready to go frank barry drained his mug then turned casually without another word to us bring them up he said and went out norah followed him and i paused long enough to let binnie go in front of me as we went up the companionway i stumbled against him as if losing my footing and muttered quickly well only get one chance if that so be ready he didnt even glance over his shoulder as he moved out on deck and tim pat gave me a shove after him barry was standing by the rail lighting another cigarette with some difficulty because of the heavy rain he nodded to tim pat get norah on board we havent much time she rushed forward as if to argue and tim pat handed his thompson to one of the other men grabbed her by the waist and lifted her bodily over the rail of the mtb then he climbed up to join her binnie and i stood waiting for sentence in the heavy rain there was only barry and the two original ratings who had first boarded us left now one of them holding the thompson now what i said barry shrugged that depends he turned to binnie i could use you boy youre still the best natural shot with a handgun i ever did see binnies hair was plastered to his forehead and he looked very young he said quietly but so clearly that everyone on the mtb must have heard it i wouldnt sit on your deathbed barry didnt stop smiling for a moment simply shrugged all right major get back in the wheelhouse start her up and move out to sea again well follow and when i give the signal youll cut your engines and open the sea cocks he clambered up over the mtbs rail one of the ratings rammed a browning into my side so i took the hint and moved along the deck into the wheelhouse the mtbs powerful engines rumbled into life the browning dug pointedly into my ribs again and i pressed the starter button and looked out of the side window barry was walking across the deck to the short ladder which led up to the bridge norah ran after him and grabbed him by the arm i heard her cry no you shant i wont let you he had her by both arms now and kughed softly as she started to struggle by god norah but you have your nerve all right just to please you he turned to tim pat keogh ive changed my mind about binnie pipe him on board i leaned out of the window and what about me then he paused half way up the ladder and turned to smile at me why damn me major but i just took it for granted that the sum total of any real captains ambition was to go down with his ship we definitely operate on the same wavelength thats exactly what i thought youd say i called and added cheerfully the big moment binnie i put my left hand on the wheel my right went under the chart table found my secret button and pressed the flap fell and i had the mauser and shot my guard through the head at pointblank range all in one continuous movement the silencer was really very effective the only noise a dull thud audible at a range of three yards the other guard was in the process of urging binnie towards the rail prodding him with the barrel of the thompson i called softly binnie and shot the man in the back of the head and he went down like a stone falling in the instant as if by magic binnie had the thompson in his hands was already firing as he turned catching the man who was standing by norah murphy with a long burst that drove him right back across the deck of the mtb and over the far rail then he went for barry who was still pulling hard for the top of the ladder there was a flash of yellow oilskins on the far side of the rail binnie stopped firing as norah murphy ran crouching then scrambled over as she reached the safety of our decks he started to fire again but by then barry was over the top of the ladder and into the safety of the wheelhouse a moment later the engine note deepened as someone gave it full throttle and the mtb surged away into the darkness a burst of submachinegun fire came our way and i ducked as one of the side windows in the wheelhouse shattered binnie kept on firing until the thompson jammed he tossed it to the deck with a curse and stood listening in the sudden silence to the sound of the mtbs engines fading into the distance i replaced the mauser in its clip shoved the flap back into place and went out on deck norah murphy crouched by the rail on one knee her face buried against her arm i touched her gently on the shoulder and she looked up at me a great weariness in her eyes you had a gun i nodded but i dont understand i thought they searched they did i pulled her to her feet and binnie said y god but youre the close one major and i didnt hear a damn thing you wouldnt id have had them if the thompson hadnt jammed he kicked it towards me and i picked it up and tossed it over the rail a bad habit they had the early ones now lets get rid of the evidence i turned to norah murphy tump some water up and get the deck swabbed down make sure you clean off any bloodstains my god she said a kind of horror on her face you must be the great original coldblooded bastard of all time thats me i said and dont forget the broken glass in the wheelhouse youll find a broom in the galley whatever she felt she turned to after that and binnie and i deal with the two guards stripping their bodies of any obvious identification before putting them over the rail then i went back to the wheelhouse and examined the chart quickly norah was sweeping the last of the glass out and paused now what we need a place to hole up in for a few hours i told her time to breathe again and work out the next move before we put in to stramore i found what i was looking for a moment later this looks like it small island called magil ten miles out uninhabited and a nice secluded spot to anchor in horseshoe bay binnie was still at the rail at the spot where we had thrown the two bodies over from where i stood it looked as if he was praying which didnt seem all that probable or did it i leaned out of the window and called were getting out of here he turned and nodded i switched off the deck lights took thekathleen round in a tight circle and headed out to sea again magil was everything i could have hoped for and horseshoe bay proved an excellent anchorage being almost landlocked it was still dark when we arrived but dawn wasnt very far away and there was a kind of pale luminosity to everything in spite of the heavy rain when i went out on deck when i went below binnie and norah murphy were sitting on either side of the saloon table heads together secrets i said cheerfully from me now i call that very naughty i got the jameson and a glass out norah said harshly dont you ever drink anything else ive heard of starting early but this is ridiculous at least let me get you something to eat later i said after ive had a good four hours sleep you can wake me with another of those bacon sandwiches of yours i moved towards the aft cabin and she said angrily for gods sake vaughan cut out the funny stuff weve got to decide what to do what about i said and poured myself a large jameson which for some reason probably the time of day as she had so kindly pointed out tasted foul the guns she said what else you are the most infuriating man ive ever met all right i said if you want to talk lets talk although i would have thought it simple enough youll want to get in touch with your small man to see about another consignment and i can assure you the price has gone up after last nights little fracas the royal navy and ten years inside is one thing but your friend barry and his bloody sons of erin are quite another she glanced at me whitefaced how much a subject for discussion i poured myself another drink on theotherhand maybe you donthave the funds we have the funds she said i tossed back the whiskey most of which like the previous one had actually gone down the leg of my left gumboot and tried to sound slightly tight when i laughed i just bet you have i poured another drink spilling a little maybe well ask for gold this time something solid to hang on to in this changing world of ours binnies hand went inside his coat where the browning once more safely nestled and norah murphy said fiercely what in the hell are you getting at oh come off it angel i said i know the small man was behind that bullion raid on the glasgow mail boat word gets around how much did he get away with half a million or were they exaggerating they both sat there staring at me and i got to my feet anyway you go and see your uncle when we get in and ill have a word with meyer well sort something out youll see can i go to bed now she sat there staring at me and i moved towards the aft cabin chuckling away to myself when i reached the door i said you know it really is very funny whichever way you look at it id love to see frank barrys face when he checks those submachineguns and the lahtis and finds the firing pins are missing her hands tightened on the edge of the table and there was a look of incredulity on her face what are you talking about she whispered oh didnt i tell you i said meyers got them one of those little tricks of the trade we find useful life being such a cruel hard business on occasion especially in our game there was a look of unholy joy on binnies face and he slammed a hand down hard across the table by christ major vaughan but youre the man for me for gods sake take the oath and join us and well have the entire thing under wraps in six months sorry old lad i said i dont take sides not any more ask the good doctor shell tell you and then norah murphy did the most incredible thing she started to laugh helplessly which was so unexpected that i closed the cabin door and actually poured myself a whiskey which i drank then i lay down on one of the bunks and as is usual with the wicked and depraved of this world was plunged at once into a deep and refreshing sleep seven when that man is dead and gone we came into stramore just after noon it was still raining but the mist had cleared and according to the forecast brighter weather was on the way stramore was little more than a village really the sort of place which had lived off the fish for years and was now doing better out of weekend yachtsmen except for the side window missing in the wheelhouse and the odd chip where a bullet had splintered the woodwork we showed little sign of the skirmish with barry and his men we anchored off the main jetty and used the dinghy to go ashore i arranged to meet norah murphy and binnie in the local pub after id reported to the harbourmaster which was only an excuse for i had something much more important to do i found a telephonebox up a back street and dialled the number meyer had given me it was somehow surprising to hear the receiver picked up at the other end almost instantly to hear the familiar voice al bowlly belting outeverything i have is yours in the background randall cottage mr berger here mr berger i said you asked me to contact you the moment i got in about that consignment i was handling for you ah yes he said everything all right im afraid not another carrier insisted on taking over the goods en route his voice didnt even flicker that is unfortunate i think ill have to contact my principal about this can you come to see me any time you say all right give me a couple of hours ill expect you around threethirty the receiver clicked into place cutting al bowlly dead and i left the phonebox and moved back towards the waterfront i wondered if he would have the brigadier there by the time i arrived it should prove an interesting meeting or so i told myself as i turned the corner and walked towards the pub where id arrangedto meet norah and binnie they were sitting in the snug by a roaring fire a plate of meat sandwiches between them pickles in a jar and two glasses of cold lager and what am i supposed to do live off my fat i demanded as i sat down norah reached for a small handbell and tang it and a when that man is dead and gone pleasantlooking middleaged woman appeared a moment kter with another plate of sandwiches was it the kger sir like the others she asked thats it i said she brought it and disappeared norah murphy said satisfied for the moment and what did your friend meyer have to say i tried to look puzzled and she frowned in exasperation oh be your age vaughan it stood out a mile why you wanted to be alone did you think i was born yesterday tsfever that i said and held up my hands all right i surrender so when are you seeing him i told her and she frowned why the delay i dont know hes got things to do its only a couple of hours after all and we can reach him quickly enough the place hes taken is no more than ten miles from here what about your end of things oh thats all taken care of ive been doing some telephoning too she glanced at her watch in fact ill have to get moving im being picked up outside the schoolhouse in fifteen minutes by the local brigade commander it was his people who were waiting for us on the beach last night he wasnt too pleased i can imagine will you be seeing your uncle tm not sure i dont know where he is at the moment though i think theyll have arranged for me to speak to him on the phone i emptied my glass and binnie picked it up without a word went behind the bar and got me another norah murphy put a cigarette in her mouth as i gave her a light the match flaring in my cupped hands i said loothe savage day tm surprised at you smoking those things and you a doctor she seemed puzzled a slight frown on her face then glanced at the cigarette and laughed that distinctive harsh laugh of hers oh what the hell vaughan well all be dead soon enough in a sense had a moment of genuine insight there saw deeper than i had seen before certainly but we were on dangerous ground and i had to go carefully i said what will you do when its all over over she stared at me blankly what in the hell are you talking about but youre going to win arent you you and your friends you must believe that or there wouldnt be any point to any of it i simply wondered what you would do when it was all over and everything was back to normal she sat there staring at me caught in some timeless moment like a fly in amber unable to answer me for the simple and inescapable reason that there was only one answer i nodded slowly you remind me of that uncle of mine binnie put the pint of lager down on the table what was it they called him again binnie the schoolmaster of stradballa thats it major i turned to norah murphy and said gently but with considerable cruelty for all that he never wanted it toend either it was his whole life you see trenchcoats and thompson guns action by night a wonderful violent game he enjoyed it norah if thats the right word it was the only way he wanted to live his life just like you she was whitefaced trembling a kind of agony in her eyes and she turned it all on me i fight for a cause when that man is dead and gone major ill die for it if necessary and proud to like thousands before me she placed both hands flat on the table and leaned towards me what did you ever believe in major simon bloody vaughan what did you kill for you mean what was my excuse dont you nodded oh yes doctor we all need one of those she sat back in the chair still trembling and i said softly youll be late for the pickup better get going she took a deep breath as if to pull herself together and stood up i want binnie to go with you dont you trust me not particularly and id like the address and telephone number of this place where your friend meyer is staying ill phone you at four oclock whatever happens dont leave till you hear from me she turned to binnie tm counting on you to see that he does as hes told binnie he looked more troubled than id ever seen him torn between the two of us i suspect for it had become more than obvious that the events of the previous night had considerably enlarged his respect for me on the other hand he loved norah murphy in his own pure way she had been put into his charge by the small man he would die if necessary to protect her it was as simple or as complicated as that a great deal of this norah murphy saw and her mouth tightened i wrote meyers address and phone number on a scrap of paper and gave it to her ask for mr berger i said if anything goes adrift well meet back at the boat she said nothing simply glanced at the piece of paper briefly dropped it into the fire and walked out binnie said when i was a kid on my das farm in kerry i had the bestlooking red setter you ever paw i tried some more lager is that so there was a little flatcoat retriever bitch on the next place and whenever he went over there she used to take lumps out of him youve never seen the like there was a heavy pause and he went on when he was run over by the milk lorry one morning she lay in a corner that little bitch for a week or more would neither drink nor eat now wasnt that the strange thing not at all i said its really quite simple she was a woman now get the hell out of here with your homespun philosophy and hire us a car at the local garage ill wait here for you leave it to me major he said his face expressionless and went out the door closed with a soft whuff wind lifted a paper off the bar the fire flared up what was my reason for killing thats what she had said i tried to think of kota baru of the burnedout mission the stink of roasting flesh it had seemed enough at the time more than enough but there was nothing real to it any more it was an echo from an ancient dream something that had never happened and then it was quiet so quiet that i could hear the clock ticking on the mantelpiece and for no logical reason whatsoever my stomach tightened dead mens fingers seemed to crawl across my skin and i suddenly knew exactly what meyer meant by having a bad feeling there had been no car available at the towns only garage but binnie had managed to borrow an old ford pickup truck from them probably by invoking the name of the organization although i didnt enquire too closely into that when that man is dead and gone he did the driving and i sat back and smoked a cigarette and stared morosely into the driving rain it was a pleasant enough ride green fields high hedges rolling farmland with here and there grey stone walls that had once been the boundaries of the great estates or still were he had picked up an ordnance survey map of the area and i found randall cottage again the track leading to it was perhaps a quarter of a mile long and the place was entirely surrounded by trees the right kind of hidey hole for an old fox like meyer i gave binnie the sign when we were close and he started to slow a car was parked on the grass verge at the side of the road a hundred yards from the turning a large green vauxhall estate with no one inside god knows why that instinct again for bad news i suppose the product of having lived entirely the wrong sort of life but something was wrong id never been more certain of anything i clapped a hand on binnies shoulder and told him to pull up i got out of the car walked back to the vauxhall and peered inside the doors were locked and everything seemed normal enough rooks called in the elm trees beyond the wall that enclosed the plantation and randall cottage i walked back to the van through the rain and binnie got out to meet me whats up that car i said it worries me it could be that its simply broken down and the drivers walking on to the next village for help pigs could also fly on the other hand he said slowly if someone wanted to walk up to the cottage quiet like thats right so what do we do about it i gave the matter some thought and then i toldhim the track to the cottage wasnt doing the vans springs much good and i stayed in bottom gear sliding from one pothole to the next in the heavy rain it was a gloomy sort of place that wood choked with undergrowth pine trees unthinned over the years cutting out all light the track took a sharp right turn that brought me out into a clearing suddenly and there was randall cottage a colonial style wooden bungalow with a wide verandah running along the front it was unexpectedly large but quite dilapidated and the paved section at the foot of the verandah steps was badly overgrown with grass and weeds of every description as i got out of the van thunder rumbled overhead a strange menacing sound and the sky went very dark so that standing there in the clearing amongst the trees it seemed as if the day was drawing to a close and darkness was about to fall i went up the steps and knocked on the front door which stood slightly ajar heh meyer are you there i called cheerfully there was no reply but when i pushed the door wide al bowlly sounded faintly and rather eerily from somewhere at the rear of the house the song he was singing waswhen that man is dead and gone a number hes reputed to have dedicated to adolf hitler it was the last thing he ever recorded because a couple of weeks later he was killed by a bomb during the london blitz none of which was calculated to make me feel any when that man is dead and gone happier as i moved in and advanced along a dark musty corridor following the sound of the music the door at the far end stood wide and i paused on the threshold there were french windows on the far side curtains partially drawn so that the room was half in darkness meyer sat in a chair beside a table on which the cassette taperecorder was playing heh meyer i said what in the hell are you up to and then i moved close enough to see that he was tied to the chair i tilted his chin and his eyes stared up at me blankly fixed in death his cheeks were badly blistered probably from repeated application of a cigarettelighter flame there was froth on his lips hed had a bad heart for some time now it seemed pretty obvious what had happened poor old meyer to escape the gestapo by the skin of his teeth so young and all these years later to end in roughly the same way and yet i was not particularly angry not filled with any killing rage for anger stems from frustration and i knew with complete certainty that meyer would not go unavenged for long the door slammed behind me as i had expected and when i turned tim pat keogh was standing there flanked by two hardlooking men in reefer coats who both held revolvers in their hands surprise surprise tim pat said and he laughed this just isnt your day major did you have to do that to him i asked a tough old bastard ill give him that but then i wanted him to tell me where those firing pins were and he was stubborn as kellys mule one of his friends came forward and ran his hands over me so inexpertly that i could have taken him and the gun in his hand in any number of ways but there was no need iothe savage day he moved back slipping his gun in his pocket and the three of them faced me wheres binnie then major tim pat demanded did you lose him on the way the french windows swung in with a splintering crash the curtains were torn aside and binnie stood there crouching the browning ready in his left hand there was a sudden silence the one curtain remaining fluttered in the wind rain pattered into the room thunder rumbled on the horizon of things binnie said coldly here i am you bastard tim pats breath went out of him in a dying fall well would you look at that now one of the other two men was still holding his gun binnie extended the browning suddenly the revolver dropped to the floor the hands went up what about mr meyer look for yourself i pulled meyers head back a glance was enough the boys eyes became empty devoid of all feeling for a moment the same look as on that first night in belfast and then something moved there some cold spark and the look on his face was terrible to see you did this he said in a strange dead voice in the name of ireland for gods sake binnie tim pat protested the ould bugger wouldnt open his mouth now what in the hell could i do binnies glance nickered once again to meyer the man with his hands raised dropped to one knee and grabbed for his revolver in the same moment tim pat and the other man went for their guns one of the finest shots in the world once put five specials into a playing card at fifteen feet in half a second he would have met his match in binnie gallagher his when that man is dead and gone first bullet caught the man who had dropped to one knee between the eyes he put two into the head of the other one that could not have had more than two fingers span between them tim pat fired once through the pocket of his raincoat then a bullet shattered his right arm he bounced back against the wall staggered forward mouth agape and blundered out through the french windows binnie let him reach the bottom of the steps start across the lawn then shot him three times in the back so quickly that to anyone other than an expert it must have sounded like one shot al bowlly was intomoonlight on the highway now i switched oft the cassette recorder than i walked past binnie and went down the steps tim pat lay on his face i turned him over and felt in his pocket for the gun it was a smith and wesson automatic and when i pulled it out a piece of cloth came with it binnie stood over me reloading the browning i held up the smith and wesson let that be a lesson to you never fire an automatic from your pocket the slide usually catches on the lining so you can only guarantee to get your first shot off just like our friend here you learn something new every day he said from inside the house the phone started ringing i went back in at once and found it in the darkness of the hall on a small table i lifted the receiver and said randall cottage norah murphys harsh distinctive voice sounded at the other end who is this vaughan is meyer there only in a manner of speaking im afraid the opposition got there first three of them there was silence for a moment and then she said youre all right both of you fine i said binnie handled it with his usual efficiency i hope our friends have got funeral insurance this ones going to be expensive for them where shall we meet back at the boat she said i can be there in fifteen minutes well talk then the receiver clicked into place and i hung up and turned to binnie all right back to strarnore we went out into the rain and i paused beside the van are you okay do you want me to drive god save us why shouldnt i major im fit as a hare you sit back and enjoy your cigarette as we went down the farm track his hands were steady as a rock on the wheel the green vauxhall still waited on the grass verge at the side of the road as we passed would probably stand there for some time before anyone thought to do any checking although that was not all that probable in times like these about five miles out of stramore we had a puncture in the offside rear tyre binnie managed to pull into a layby and we got out together to fix it only to discover that while there was a reasonably serviceable spare there was no jack he gave the offending wheel an angry kick would you look at that two quid that dirty bowser took off me wait now till i see him well be having a word and maybe more we started to walk side by side in the heavy rain i wasnt particularly put out at what had happened i needed a time to think and this was as good a chance as when that man is dead and gone any i had a problem on my hands a hell of a problem meyer had been the pipeline to the brigadier had probably spoken to him as soon as he had heard from me if tim pat keogh and his friends had given him time so now i was nicely adrift for the brigadier had made it plain that under no circumstances was i to get involved with the military whichever way you looked at it it seemed obvious that if i was ever to get in touch with him at all which seemed pretty essential now i would have to disregard that part of my instructions i suppose we had been walking for about half an hour when we were picked up by a travelling shop the driver was going to stramore and was happy to take us there if we didnt mind a roundabout route as he had calls to make at a couple of farms on the way the end result was that we were a good two hours kter into stramore than i had calculated and it was past six oclock when the van dropped us at the edge of town we had to pass the garage on the way down to the harbour and as it was still open binnie went in and i waited for him five minutes later he emerged face grim what happened i asked him he held up two one pound notes he saw reason he said a decent enough man with the facts before him i wondered if the browning had figured in the proceedings but that was none of my affair we went down the narrow cobbled street together and turned along the front binnie tugged at my sleeve quickly the boats gone he was right enough but when we went down to the jetty itself we found thekathleen moored at the bottom of a flight of wide stone steps on the far side nothe savage day now what in the hell would she do that for binnie asked i led the way down the steps without replying there was something wrong here i sensed that but in view of the time and place it didnt seem likely to be anything to do with frank barry and his merry men we reached the concrete landing strip at the bottom and i called norah are you there she screamed high and clear from inside the cabin run for it vaughan run for it but we were already too late a couple of strippeddown landrovers roared along the jetty in the same instant and a moment later there were at least eight paratroopers lining the jetty above us plus the same number of submachineguns pointing in our direction binnies hand was already inside his coat and i barely had time to grab his arm before he could draw i told you before boy no heroics theres no percentage in it therell be another time he looked at me eyes glazed that strange dazed expression on his face again and by then they were down the steps and on to us they put us up against the wall and none too gently which was only to be expected legs astraddle for the search the sergeant in charge found the browning of course but nothing on me after that we waited until someone said all right sergeant turn them round a young paratrooper captain was standing by the wheelhouse wearing red beret camouflaged uniform and flak jacket just like his men he was holding the browning in one hand norah murphy stood beside him her face very white the captain had the lazy rather amiable face of the f when that man is dead and gone kind of man who usually turns out to be as tough as old boots underneath he looked me over with a sort of mild curiosity you are major simon vaughan thats right captain i laid a slight emphasis on my use of his handle which he didnt fail to notice for he smiled faintly your wheelhouse would appear to have been in the wars major window gone wood splintered and a couple of nine millimetre rounds embedded in one panel would you care to comment it was a rough trip i said or didnt you hear the weather report he shrugged under the circumstances i have no alternative but to take you all into custody norah murphy said tm an american citizen i demand to see my consul at the earliest possible moment maam he assured her gravely another vehicle turned on to the jetty and braked to a halt above us i heard a door slam and a cheerful familiar voice called now then stacey whats all this what have we got here the captain sprang to attention and gave the kind of salute that even the guards only reserve for very senior officers as the brigadier came down the steps resplendent in camouflaged uniform flak jacket and dark blue beret a browning in the holster on his right hip a swagger stick in his left hand eight interrogation in happier times stramore had only needed one constable which meant that the local police post was a tiny affair little more than an office and single cell which from the look of it had been constructed to accommodate all the local drunks at the same time it was clean enough with greenpainted brick walls four iron cot beds and a single narrow window heavily barred as was to be expected the door was unlocked by the police constable and captain stacey led the way in tm sorry we cant offer separate accommodation in your case dr murphy he said but it wont be for long tonight at the most i would anticipate moving you first thing in the morning norah murphy said calmly im not going anywhere till i hear from the american consul stacey saluted and turned to leave binnie and i had both been handcuffed and i held out my hands what about these sorry he said ive had my orders the door closed the key turned i moved to the window and tried to peer outside but there was nothing to see for the glass was misted with rain and it was almost dark norah murphy said softly are we wired for sound in this place i couldnt help laughing that only happens on stage six at mgm get me a cigarette lefthand pocket she put one in my mouth and gave me a light then took one herself all right what went wrong tim pat keogh and a couple of barrys goons were waiting for us what happened they killed the old man binnie told her burnt his face with a cigarettelighter to make him tell them where the firing pins were and that bastard tim pat tried to justify it he spat in the corner may he roast in hell she turned back to me what did happen to the firing pins then are they still at the cottage theyre in scotland sweetheart i said thats the irony of it in an old garage meyer rented in oban we intended bringing them over with the rest of the stuff on the second trip if everything had gone all right this time her eyes widened in horror then meyer died for nothing exactly i moved to the window and peered out again it was quite dark of course the really interesting question is how did they know where he was when i turned she was watching me closely a slight frown on her face or to put it another way who told them binnie had been sitting on one of the beds he stood up quickly what are you trying to say major norah murphy cut him off with a quick gesture no binnie let him have his say all right i said its straightforward enough i was the only one who knew meyers address until i gave it to you in the pub on a piece of paper binnie didnt even see in fact he didnt know where we were going till we were on our way in any case as hes knocked off four of barrys men by now hes hardly likely to be working for him which leaves me she said calmly the only possibility you even knew there was plenty of time for action because meyer didnt want to see me till threethirty a quick phone call was all it took it also explains how they came to be waiting for us in bloody passage last night which was also reasonably coincidental i mean wed hardly advertised the trip now had we all this of course was right out of the top of my head it made sense there was a sort of logic to it and yet i was whistling in the dark to a certain extent attempting more than anything else to provoke some kind of reaction i was totally unprepared for the violence of her reply her face was contorted with rage on the instant and she flung herself at me one hand catching me solidly across the face the other on the rebound and she could punch her weight ill kill you for saying that she cried til kill you vaughan she grabbed me by the lapels and shook me furiously i couldnt do all that much to defend myself what with the handcuffs and the unexpectedness of the attack but as she clawed at my face again binnie moved in behind her pulled her away with both hands and got between us he looked at me over his shoulder you shouldnt have said that major youve done a bad thing here she collapsed on the bed dry sobs racking her body her face in her hands and binnie crouched beside her like a dog his handcuffed hands in her lap she ran her fingers through his hair after a while she looked up her face was calm again but the eyes were somehow weary and the voice was very tired i spoke to the commander of the north antrim brigade of the official ira this afternoon he was the man whose people were waiting for us on that beach last night as a matter of interest he was notified within one hour of your friend meyers arrival at randall cottage yesterday just as hes told immediately of any stranger moving into a house anywhere in his district these days unfortunately frank barry and his organization hold just as much sway in this area and last night all right she nodded heavily there was a leak but at least twenty people were on that beach it could have been any one of them if i know my barry he would be cunning enough to leave a sympathizer or two within the ranks of the official ira when he broke away it was all plausible enough in fact the truth of the matter was that it was beginning to look as if i had been about as wrong as a man could be i said all right then did you speak to your uncle i did where is he the hate in her eyes when she looked up at me was really quite something id burn in hell before id tell you that now i dont know where the thing might have gone after that but as it happened the door opened and the police constable appeared would you be good enough to come with me maam he said to norah where are you taking me she demanded to the nearest wall i said where they have a firing party waiting for you a bad habit the british army have or dont you believe your own propaganda she went out fast like a dipper under full sail the police constable closed the door when i turned binnie was sitting on the edge of the bed watching me what did you have to go and say a thing like that for major i dont really know i shrugged it seemed like a good idea at the time there has to be some explanation she gave it to you didnt she he said violently christ jesus but i will hear no more of this he jumped to his feet eyes staring the handcuffed hands held out in front of him and for a moment i thought he might have a go at me and then the door opened and the police constable appeared again this time with the paratroop sergeant at his shoulder major vaughan sk will you come this way please everyone was being too bloody polite to be true but i winked at binnie and went out the police constable leading the way the paratroop sergeant falling in behind me we went straight out of the front door and hurried through the teeming rain across the yard to what looked like a church hall the entrance was sandbagged and a sentry stood guard beside a heavy machinegun we moved past him along a short corridor and paused outside a door at the far end the sergeant knocked and when he opened it i saw the brigadier seated behind a desk in a tiny cluttered office major vaughan sir the sergeant said the brigadier looked up thank you grey bring the major in and wait outside and see that were not disturbed i advanced into the room the door closed behind me the brigadier leaned back in his chair and looked me over well you seem to have survived so far only just he stood up got a chair from the corner and put it down beside me sorry about the handcuffs but youll have to hang on to those for the time being just for the sake of appearances i understand but j can offer you a cigarette and a glass of scotch he produced a bottle of white horse and two glasses from a cupboard in the desk and i sat down this place seems snug enough he pushed a glass across to where i could reach it and half filled it used to be the sunday school this was the superintendents office rum kind of soldiering i suppose so he leaned across the desk to give me a cigarette youd better fill me in on what happened on the run from scotland which didnt take long in the telling when i had finished he saidand when you got in this morning you phoned meyer thats it he told me hed get in touch with you straight awayhe asked me to be at the cottage by threethirty was he dead when you arrived i nodded youve been there he opened the bottle of white horse and splashed more whisky into my glass i arrived at randall cottage at fourtwenty precisely which was the earliest i could manage id told meyer to hold you till i got there and all you found was a butchers shop in hell exactly i hoped youd gone back to the boat naturally with the pipeline cut it seemed the only thing to do which was why i phoned through to captain stacey whos in charge here and got him to lay on a reception party for you and your friends an elaborate device for getting us together again but there didnt seem any other way and time is of the essence after all who were the other three at the cottage by the way some of barrys men they were after the firing pins which explains the condition of poor old meyers face he nodded i see now did you kill them no the boy took care of that department he didnt like what theyd done to meyer hes that good the best i ever saw with a handgun the complete idealist he honestly thinks you can fight this kind of a war and come out of it with clean hands i swallowed my whisky and shook my head god help him but hes going to get one hell of a shock before hes through you sound as if you like him oh i jike him all right the only trouble is that one of us will very probably end up by knocking off the other before this little affair is over there was a bad explosion in belfast this afternoon in one of the big public offices many casualties thirty or more mostly young girls from the typing pool and half of them were catholic theres the irony interrogationup the provisional have already claimed credit if thats the right word a nasty business binnie gallagher would be the first to agree with you which seemed to have little or no effect on him for he sat staring down at the desk whistling softly to himself while he traced complicated patterns on a memo pad with a pencil i said look im not too happy about what you might call the security aspects of the affair the fact that barry and his men were waiting for us out there in bloody passage the way they turned up at meyers cottage just like that he looked up have you any ideas on the subject i told him about my confrontation with norah murphy and when i was finished he shook his head michael corks niece selling him down the river it doesnt make any kind of sense what does then the girls own explanation what i told you about ira splinter groups at your briefing in london is absolutely true theyre not only having a go at the british theyre fighting each other each group has its own spies out believe me on top of that its almost impossible to keep any kind of security the way things are there isnt a post office or shop or telephone exchange in the country that doesnt have sympathisers working in it ordinary decent people on the whole who probably hate the violence but are willing to pass on interesting information for all that and then theres always intimidation he poured me another whisky and sat back holding his glass up to the light on the whole id say things are going very well youve got frank barry and one of the most wanted terrorist squads in ireland sniffing at your izothe savage day heels and as long as you stick with the girl youve a direct line to the small man himself do you think she knows where the bullion is my hunch is no but i couldnt be definite at this stage you could always try pulling out her fingernails your sense of humour will be the death of you one of these fine days simon just like your father did i ever tell you that i knew him back in the old days in india several times is that so he dropped into that brown study of his again i said patiently all right sir what happens now he drained his glass rolled the kst of the whisky around his tongue thats easy enough he glanced at his watch its just after seventhirty at nine oclock precisely im taking the three of you back to belfast with me escorted by captain stacey and sergeant grey do we get there of course not about ten miles out on the road to ballymena well have engine trouble which means that stacey and sergeant grey will know what theyre about exactly ill come round to the rear of the vehicle to check your handcuffs giving you an excellent chance to grab my browning only make damn sure its you and not that lad from the way hes been carrying on hed leave the three of us lying in the nearest ditch then what you play the game as the cards fall if you want me you get in touch with the following belfast telephone number itll be manned day and night he gave it to me and i memorized it quickly and the bullion is still number one on the agenda followed by the apprehension of michael cork himself with frank barry and his men number three i stood up thats about it then he chuckled suddenly as if to himself sons of erin why on earth do they choose such ridiculous bloody names you know how it is i said the celtic twilight and all that sort of rubbish you know you really have got me wrong my boy he said i like the irish no i do finest soldiers in the world next to the english of course well as a matter of fact i was going to give pride of place to the germans terribly unpatriotic i know but truth must out i retired defeated and sergeant grey took me back to my cell norah murphy was standing at the window peering out into the night when i went in there was no sign of binnie she said what happened i had a chat with the brigadier ferguson his name is very pleasant what about you captain stacey cigarettes coffee and lots of public school charm i just kept asking for the american consul he gave up in the end hes talking to binnie now he wont get very far there she sat down on the bed crossed one knee over the other and looked up at me what did you tell the brigadier then that id hired thekathleen in oban and that as far as i was concerned any bullet holes must date from some previous occasion i also told him in confidence one gentleman to another that you and i were very much in love and that the passage to stramore had been designed as a kind of prewedding honeymoon trip just to make certain we were physically suited there was that look on her face again of helpless rage and yet there was something else in her eyes something indefinable you what i crouched down in front of her and kid my manacled hands on her knees actually id say the idea had a great deal to commend it and once again the humour welled up from deep inside her breaking the mask into a hundred pieces she laughed harshly and cupped my face in her two hands you bastard vaughan what am i going to do with you you could try kissing me which she did but before i could appreciate the full subtlety of the performance the key rattled in the lock i got to my feet as the door opened and binnie and captain stacey entered followed by the brigadier binnie moved to join us and norah stood up so that we confronted them in a tight little group the brigadier brushed his moustache with the back of a finger tm afraid im not satisfied with the answers any of you have given not satisfied at all under the circumstances i intend to transfer you to military intelligence hq outside belfast where you may be properly interrogated we leave at nine oclock youll be given something to eat before then he turned and went out followed by stacey the door clanged shut with a kind of grim finality and when norah murphy turned to me there was real despair on her face for the first time since id known her we left exactly on time in an army landrover captain stacey driving the brigadier beside him and the three of us behind them all handcuffed now including norah sergeant grey crouched in the rear with a sterling submachinegun the rain was really bad now the road a ribbon of bkck wet tarmac in the powerful headlights there was a moment of excitement about two miles out of stramore when grey announced suddenly that we were being followed i glanced over my shoulder there were headlights there certainly but a moment later as he cocked his submachinegun they turned off into a side road never mind sergeant captain stacey said keep your eyes skinned just the same one never knows i sat there in the darkness waiting for the big moment norahs knees rubbing against mine i tried a little pressure after a moments hesitation she responded i dropped my manacled hands on hers it was all very romantic from somewhere up ahead there was one hell of a bang and orange flames blossomed in the night we came round a corner to find a ford van slumped against a tree petrol spilling out to where a man lay sprawled in the middle of the road a tongue of flame sweeping towards him with the rapidity of a burning fuse i didnt fall for it not for a minute but stacey and the sergeant were already out of the vehicle and running towards the injured man there were several bursts of submachinegun fire from the wooded hillside to our right knocking the sergeant sideways into the ditch stacey managed to get his browning out fired twice desperately then turned and ran back towards the landrover head down they all seemed to be firing at him then pieces jumping out of his flak jacket as the bullets hammered into him his beret flew off his face was suddenly a mask of blood he fell against the bonnet and slid to the ground the brigadier went out head first browning in one hand crouched beside the landrover waiting in the sudden silence there was kughter up there in the trees and then submachinegun fire sprayed across the road again there seemed no point in letting the old boy do a little big horn so i did the most sensible thing i could think of in the circumstances opened the rear door and hit him in the back of the neck with my two clenched fists he went flat on his face and lay there groaning i picked up the browning in both hands and stood up you can come out now whoever you are tut the browning down and stand back a voice called i did as i was told there was a rustle in the bushes to our right and frank barry stepped into the light the ford truck was going well by now the kind of blaze that seemed likely on a conservative estimate to attract every soldier and policeman in a mile radius but barry and his men didnt seem disposed to hurry there were six of them and at one point he took a small walkietalkie from his pocket and murmured something into it which seemed to indicate that he had other forces not too far away he noticed me watching and grinned as he put it away grand things these major a great comfort on occasion the minute you left the police post in stramore i knew interrogation j he lit a cigarette and said what about my firing pins now theres a dirty trick youre wasting your time i said theyre in oban is that a fact he turned to binnie who stood beside me youve been a bad boy binnie tim pat donal mcguire and terry donaghue all at one blow just like the tailor in the fairy tale i can see im going to have to do something about you im frightened to death binnie told him you will be barry told him genially and turned suddenly as the brigadier groaned and tried to get up whats this then one of them still kicking he took a revolver from inside his coat and i said quickly seems like a hell of a waste to me barry i mean brigadier generals arent all that thick on the ground he lowered the revolver instantly and crouched down is that what he is by god youre right he straightened and nodded to a couple of his men get the old bugger on his feet well take him with us i might find a use for him someone brought the handcuff keys found on staceys body and barry slipped them in his pocket then he turned and peered inside the laridrover where norah murphy still sat are you there norah me love its your favourite man a large van came round the corner reversed across the road and braked to a halt beside us barry pulled her out of the landrover and put an arm about her nothing mean about me norah see i even provide transport to take you home my home of course she struggled in his grasp furiously angry and he tightened his grip and kissed her full on the mouth weve such a lot to talk over norah old times you me the small man cabbages and kings ships and sealing wax gold bullion she went very still staring up at him fixedly shadows dancing across her face in the firelight as he laughed softly oh yes norah that too then he picked her up in his arms and carried her across to the van nine spanish head our destination as i discovered kter was only a dozen miles along the coast from stramore yet such was the circuitous back country route we followed that it took us almost an hour to get there there were a couple of small plastic windows in the side of the van for most of the time there wasnt much to see but then the rain stopped and by the time we turned on to the coast road it had become fine clear night with a half moon lighting the sky the road seemed to follow the contours of the cliff edge exactly and as far as i could judge there was a drop on our left beyond the fence of a good two hundred feet we finally took a narrow road to the left and braked to a halt so that one of the men could get out to open a gate there was a notice to one side i craned my neck and managed to make out the wordsspanish head andnational trust before the gate opened and we drove through spanish head i murmured in norahs ear does that mean anything to you his uncles place one of the guards leaned forward and prodded me on the shoulder shut your face an inelegant phrase but he made his point eloquently enough i contented myself with the view from the window after that which was interesting enough we went over a small rise the road dropped away to a wooded promontory there was a castle at the very end above steep cliffs battlements and towers black against the night sky like something out of a childrens fairy tale it was only as we drew closer that i saw that i was mistaken that it was no more than a large country house built from the look of it during that period of victorias reign when gothic embellishments were considered fashionable the van came to a halt the door was opened and when i scrambled out i found myself in a courtyard at the rear of the main building barry himself came round to hand norah murphy down and he also unlocked her handcuffs now be a good girl and youll come to no harm as my old grannie used to say he took her by the arm firmly and led her towards die door stick the others in the cellar he said carelessly over his shoulder ill have them up when i need them after hed gone a couple of his men took us in through the same door there was a long dark flagged passage inside presumably to the kitchen quarters at the far end a flight of stairs obviously gave access to the rest of the house there was a stout oaken door beside it which one of the men opened to disclose steps leading into darkness he switched on a light and we went down there was a series of cellars below one leading into another and there were wine racks everywhere although most of them were empty we finally arrived at what looked suspiciously like a cell door straight out of some victorian prison for it was sheathed in iron plate and secured by steel bolts so krge that the guard who opened them needed two hands a cell indeed it was as we found when we went in bare limewashed walls oozing damp no window of any description an iron cot with no mattress a wooden table and two stools the door shut the bolts rammed home solidly the steps of the two guards faded away along the passage outside there was a zinc bucket in one corner presumably for the purposes of nature and i gave it a kick every modern convenience binnie sat on the edge of the bed the brigadier limped to one of the stools and sat down massaging the back of his neck are you all right sir i asked politely no thanks to you he glared up at me and i said if i hadnt done what i did youd be dead meat by now be reasonable i managed to fish out my cigarettes with some difficulty as i was still handcuffed and offered him one go to the devil he said i turned to binnie and grinned no pleasing some people but he simply lay down on the bare springs of the cot without a word staring up at the ceiling unable i suspect to get norah murphy out of his mind i managed to light a cigarette then sat down against the wall suddenly rather tired when i looked across at the brigadier his right eyelid moved fractionally it must have been about an hour later that the door was unbolted and a couple of men entered both of them armed with sterling submachineguns one of them jerked his thumb at me without a word a squat powerfullooking individual whose outstanding feature was the absence of hair on his skull i went out the door was closed and bolted again and we set off in echelon through the cellars the gentleman with the bald head leading the way when we reached the kitchen area again we kept right on going taking the next flight of stairs coming out through a green baize door at the top into an enormous entrance hall all pillars and greek statues a great marble staircase drifting up into the half darkness above our heads we mounted that too turned along a wide corridor at the top and climbed into two more flights of stairs the last being narrow enough for only one man at a time when the final door opened i found myself on the battlements at the front of the house frank barry sat at a small konwork table at the far end i caught the fragrance of cigar smoke as i approached and there was a glass in his hand i could see him clearly enough in the moonlight and he smiled well what do you think of it major the finest view in ireland i always say you can see the whole of the north antrim coast from here it was certainly spectacular enough and in the silvery moonlight it was possible to see far far out to sea the lights of some ship or other moving through the passage between the mainland and rathlin he took a bottle dripping with water from a bucket on the floor beside him a glass of wine major sancerre one of my favourites theres still two or three dozen left in the cellar i held up my wrists and he smiled with that immense charm of his there i go again completely forgetting my manners he produced the keys from his pocket i held out my hands and he unlocked the cuffs the second of the two guards had faded away but my friend with the bald head still stood watchfully by the sterling ready a boat came round the headland a hundred yards or so to our right the noise of its engine no more than a murmur in the night it started to move into an inlet in the cliffs below and disappeared from sight presumably into some harbour or anchorage belonging to the house that should be yourkathleen barry said i sent a couple of my boys round to stramore to lift her from the harbour as soon as it was dark do you usually think of everything only way to live he filled a glass for me ty the way old kd lets keep it civilized dooley here served with me in korea hes been deaf dumb and minus his hair since a chinese trench mortar blew him forty feet through the air that means he only has his eyes to think with and hes apt to be a bit quick off the mark ill remember what were you in ulster rifles worst national service second lieutenant in the army i tried some of the wine it was dry icecold and i sampled a little more with mounting appreciation this is really quite excellent glad you like it he refilled my glass what would you say if i offered to let you go in return for what the firing pins and the rest of the arms you have stored away over there in oban somewhere he sampled some of his wine id see you were suitably recompensed on delivery naturally i laughed out loud i just bet you would i can imagine what your version of payment would be a nine millimetre round in the back of the head no really old lad as one gentleman to another he was quite incredible i laughed again youve got to be joking he sighed heavily you know nobody but nobody takes me seriously thats the trouble he emptied his glass and stood up lets go downstairs ill show you over the place i hadnt the slightest idea what his game was but on the other hand i didnt exactly have a choice in the matter with dooley dogging my heels that submachinegun at the ready we went down to the main corridor leading to the grand stairway barry said my revered unclemy mothers brother made the place over to the national trust on condition he could continue to live here it has to be open to the public from may to september the rest of the time you could go for weeks without seeing a soul very convenient for you but doesnt it ever occur to the military to look the place over once in a while in view of the special relationship with my uncle a past grand master of the orange lodge a unionist since carsons day as a matter of interest he threw me out on my ear years ago a wellknown fact of ulster life then how does he allow you to come and go as you please now til show you we paused outside a large double door he knocked a key turned and it was opened by a small wizened man in a grey alpaca jacket who drew himself stiffly together at once and stood to one side like an old soldier and how is he this evening sean barry asked fine sir just fine we moved into an elegant booklined drawingroom which had a large fourposted bed in one corner there was a marble fireplace logs burning steadily in the hearth and an old man in a dressinggown sat in a wing chak before it a blanket about his knees he held an empty glass in his left hand and there was a decanter on a small table beside him hello uncle barry said and how are we this evening the old man turned and stared at him listlessly the eyes vacant in the wrinkled face lips wet here have another brandy itll help you sleep barry poured a good four fingers into the glass steadied the shaking hand as it was raised in spite of that a considerable amount dribbled from the loose mouth as the old man gulped it down greedily he sank back in the chair and barry said cheerfully there you are vaughan old lord palsy himself i had found him likeable enough until then in spite of his doings but a remark so cruel was hard to take doubly so when one considered that it was being made about his own flesh and blood there was a silver candelabrum on a sideboard with half a dozen candles in it he produced a box of matches lit them one by one then moved to the door which the man in the alpaca jacket promptly opened for him barry turned to look back at his uncle ill give you one guess who the heir is when he goes vaughan he laughed sardonically my god can you see me taking my seat in the house of lords it raises interesting possibilities mind you the tower of london for instance instead of the crumlin road gaol if they ever catch me i said nothing simply followed him out and walked at his side as he went down the great stairway to the hall it was a strange business for we moved from one room to another dooley keeping pace behind the only light the candelabrum in barrys hand nickering on silver and glass and polished furniture drawing the faces of those longdead out of the darkness as we passed canvas after canvas in ornate gilt frames and he talked ceaselessly he stopped in front of a portrait of a portly bewigged gentleman in eighteenthcentury hunting dress this is the man who started it all francis the first i always call him never got over spending the first twenty years of his life slaving on a galway potato patch made his fortune out of slaves and sugar in barbados his plantation out there was called spanish head when hed got enough he came home changed his religion bought a peerage and settled down to live the life of an irish protestant gentleman what about your fathers side of things ah now there you have me he said he was an actor whose looks outstripped his talent by half a mile and in their turn were only surpassed by his capacity for strong liquor which actually allowed him to survive to the ripe old age of forty was he a catholic believe it or not vaughan but im not the first protestant to want a united ireland he held a candle up to an oil painting that was almost lifeske theres another wolfe tone he started it all and thats my favourite relative beside him francis the fourth by the time he was twentythree hed killed three men in duels and had it off with every presentable female in the county had to flee to america the resemblance to barry himself was quite remarkable what happened to him killed at a pkce called shiloh during the american civil war on which side what do you think grey brought out the colour of his eyes thats what he said in a letter home to his mother ive read it we had turned and were making a slow promenade back towards the entrance hall i said when i look at all this you dont make sense why exactly your present activities i like a fight he shrugged korea wasnt all that bad if it hadnt been for the bloody cold and life gets so damn boring dont you think some people might think that was a pretty poor excuse my reasons dont matter vaughan its what im doing for the cause that counts we had reached the hall and he put the candelabrum down on the table and took out the handcuffs i held out my wrists he said thirty years ago if id been doing exactly what im doing today for the resistance in france or norway id have been looked upon as a gallant hero strange how perspective changes with the point of view not mine i said he looked at me closely and what do you believe in vaughan nothing i cant afford to a man after my own heart he turned to dooley and jerked his thumb downwards takehim back to the others for now he picked up the candelabrum and went upstairs i stood watching him for a moment then dooley put the muzzle of the sterling in my back and prodded me towards the door when i was returned to the cell binnie was fast asleep on the cot his head to one side mouth slightly open when the door closed he stirred slightly but did not waken the brigadier put a finger to his lips moved to check that the boy was genuinely asleep then crossed to the table and we both sat down a pretty kettle offish he said whats been happening to you i told him and in detail for in some way almost everything barry had said to me seemed important if only because of the way in which it threw some light on the man himself when id finished the brigadier nodded it makes sense that he would ask you to go to oban after all youre on call to the highest bidder as far as he knows and you couldnt very well go running to the police he said hell be seeing me later presumably to discuss the deal further what do i say you accept of course all along the line and what about you god knows what do you think hed do if you told ghq where i was and they sent the royal marine commandos to get me out hed use you as a hostage try to bargain and if that failed and it would fail because the moment the government gives in to that kind of blackmail its finished what would he do then tut a bullet through your head exactly the bolts rattled again the door was flung open with a crash that brought binnie up off the cot to his feet he stood there swaying slightly wiping sleep from his eyes with the back of a hand dooley was back again with a couple of men this time outside all of you one of them ordered roughly we followed the same route as before up through the green baize door to the hall then mounted the marble stairs to the main landing and turned along the corridor we paused at another of those tall double doors dooley opened it and led the way in it was a rather similar room to the old mans although there was no bed but it was pleasantly furnished in regency style norah murphy sat in a chair by the fire her hands tightly folded in her lap barry stood beside her a hand on the back of the chair good then as were all here we can get started i should tell you gentlemen that dr murphy is being more than a trifle stubborn she has certain information i need rather badly which she stupidly insists on keeping to herself he put a hand on her shoulder shall we try again what happened to the bullion norah wheres he hidden it you go to hell she said crisply if i did know youre the last man on earth id tell a great pity he nodded to dooley speaking slowly enunciating the words so that he could read his lips come and hold her dooley slung his sterling over one shoulder and moved behind the chair norah tried to get up and he shoved her down and twisted her arms back cruelly holding her firm barry leaned down to the fire when he turned he was holding a poker the end of which was redhot binnie gave a desperate cry took a step forward and got the butt of a sterling in the kidneys he went down on one knee and barry said coldly if any one of them makes a move put a bullet in him he turned to norah grabbed her hair turning her face up to him and held the poker over her ill ask you once more norah wheres the bullion i dont know she said youre wasting your time this will get you nowhere he touched her cheek with the rip of the poker there was a plume of smoke the smell of burning flesh she gave a terrible cry and fainted binnie forced himself up on one knee and put out a hand in appeal its the truth shes telling you nobody knows where the gold is except the small man himself not even her because thats the way he wanted it barry looked down at him frowning for a long moment then he nodded all right ill buy that where is he now binnie got to his feet and stood swaying a hand to his back not saying a word barry grabbed the unconscious girl by the hair again the poker raised in threat you tell me damn you or ill mark the other side of her face all right binnie said but much good itll do you hes in the old hideyhole in the sperrins and theres nothing hed like better than for you and your men to try and take him there barry underwent another personality change became once again the smiling genial man id taken wine with earlier he dropped the poker into the fireplace and nodded to dooley take her into the bedroom dooley picked her up effortlessly crossed the room and kicked open a door on the far side barry moved to a sideboard and poured himself a whiskey when he turned he was smiling i wouldnt get within ten miles of that farmhouse there isnt a farm labourer or shepherd or snottynosed little boy in every village you touch on up there who isnt another pair of eyes for the small man exactly binnie said i know barry nodded but you binnie theyd welcome with open arms binnie stared at him amazement on his face you must be mad no im not old love ive never been saner in my life youre going to go and see my old friend michael for me and youre going to point out the obvious and unpleasant fact that im holding his favourite niece if i get the gold or details of its whereabouts he gets her back in one piece if i dont by god they broke the mould when they made you binnie said ill kill you for this barry before god i will barry sighed heavily and patted the boys face binnie corks milk and water religion his letssitdownandtalk isnt going to win this war its people like me who are willing to go all the way and to hell with the cost the brigadier put in the slaughter of the innocents all over again when barry turned to him there was a madness in his eyes that chilled the blood if thats whats needed he said we wont shirk the price any price because we are strong and you are weak he turned back to binnie with that gold i buy enough arms to take on the whole british army what will the small man do with it binnie stared at him that slightly dazed look on his face again and barry calmer now patted him on the shoulder youll leave at dawn binnie its a good time on the back roads nice and quiet it shouldnt take you more than a couple of hours to get there ill give you a good car binnies shoulders sagged all right it was almost a whisper good lad barry patted him again and looked straight at me and well send the major along just to keep you company that public school accent of his should be guaranteed to get you past any road blocks you run into especially with the kind of papers ill provide him with all right major vaughan do i have any choice i shouldnt think so he gave me that lazy genial smile of his looking more than ever like francis the fourth of the portrait up there in the gallery i didnt smile back because i was thinking of norah remembering the stink of her flesh burning considering with some care exactly how i was going to give it to him when the time came ten run for your life barry himself disappeared and a great deal seemed to happen after that the brigadier was hauled off to his cell binnie and i rather puzlingly had our pictures taken by one of barrys men using a flash camera afterwards we were taken by way of the back stairs to a bedroom on the next floor it was comfortable enough with dark mahogany furniture and brass bedstead a faded indian carpet on the floor there was a familiarlooking suitcase on the bed as approached it barry came into the room i had your stufl brought up from the boat old lad i dont think those seagoing togs of yours will be exactly appropriate for this little affair suit collar and tie raincoat or something of that order can you oblige everything except the raincoat no problem there barry turned to look at him as impeccable as usual all done up to go to somebodys funeral yours maybe binnie said and i noticed that his forehead was damp with sweat barry chuckled not in the least put out you always were a comfort binnie boy he turned to me theres a bathroom through there plenty of hot water no bars on the window but its fifty feet down to the courtyard and two men on the door so behave yourselves ill see you later the door closed behind him binnie went to the window opened it and stood there breathing deeply on the damp air as if to steady himself i said are you all right he turned that look on his face again tor what he has done to norah murphy he is a dead man walking major he is mine for the taking when the time comes nothing can alter that something cold moved inside me then fear i suppose at his utter implacability which went so much beyond mere hatred there was a power in this boy an elemental force that would carry him through most things a dead man walking he had called frank barry and i wondered what he would call me on that day of reckoning when he discovered my true motives which was all decidedly unpleasant so i left him there by the window staring out to sea went into the bathroom and ran a bath i dressed in a brown poloneck sweater donegal tweed suit and brown brogues the end result coupled with the bath and a shave was something of an improvement binnie who seemed to have recovered his spirits a little sat on the edge of the bed watching me as i pulled on my jacket and checked the general effect in the wardrobe mirror he whistled softly by god major but you look grand just like one of them fellas in the whiskey adverts in the magazines i had the distinct impression that he might break into laughter at any moment an unusual event indeed and the toe of my boot to you too you young bastard we were prevented from carrying the conversation any further for at that moment the door opened and the guards ordered us outside this time we were taken all the way down to the kitchen where we were given a really excellent meal with another bottle of that sancerre barry had liked so much to share between us it was all rather pleasant in spite of the guards in the background as we were finishing barry appeared the formidable dooley at his back he had an old trenchcoat over one arm which he dropped across the back of a chair that should keep out the weather and these should get you past any road blocks you run into military or police there were two military intelligence identity cards each with its photo which explained the camera work earlier binnie was a sergeant omeara i had become captain geoffrey hamilton there was also a very authenticlooking travel permit authorizing me to proceed from strabane to interrogate an ira suspect named malloy being held at police headquarters there i passed binnie his id card these are really very good indeed they should be theyre the real thing he turned to binnie the boys will take you down to the garage now so you can check the car the major and i will be along in a few minutes binnie glanced at me briefly i nodded and he got up and went out followed by two of the guards dooley stood by the door watching me woodenly his sterling at the ready i pulled on the trenchcoat barry took a couple of packets of cigarettes from his pocket and shoved them across the table for the journey he stood watching me hands in pockets as i stowed them away very nice of you i said now what do you want binnie is inclined to be a little emotional where norah is concerned but not me i must say i had rather got that impression i said as far as im concerned shes just a medium of exchange you make that clear to cork just in case binnie doesnt get the message across he turned and nodded to dooley who went out of the room immediately the first sign of anything untoward at all dooley puts a bullet in her head in other words you mean business i hope ive made that clear enough and norah shes okay he said callously when last seen she was giving herself an injection from that bag of hers of course shell have a fair old scar from now on but then i always say that kind of thing gives a person character he was baiting me ithink but i playedhim at bis own game just like a broken nose exactly he laughed yet frowned a little by god but youre a cold fish vaughan what does it take to get you roused that usually comes half way through the second bottle of jameson i said theres this click inside my head and he raised a hand all right you win wed better see how binnie is getting on you havent got much time the garage had obviously been the coach house in other days and stood on the far side of the courtyard binnie was checking the engine of a green cortina gt when i went in watched impassively by the guards he dropped the bonnet and wiped his hands on a rag where did you knock this off he demanded barry grinned according to the papers in the glove compartment its on loan from a car hire firm in belfast which is exactly as it should be when theyre in plain clothes the field security boys dont like to use military vehicles you think of everything i said i try to old lad its the only way he glanced at his watch its just after four so you should be there by seven at the outside six oclock tonight is your deadline nothing to come for after that which i trust youll make plain to small michael for me binnie slid behind the wheel without a word and i got in the passenger seat barry leaned down to the window by the way field security personnel are supposed to go armed during the present emergency so youll find a couple of brownings in the glove compartment army issue naturally only dont try turning round at the gate and coming back in like a twoman commando that really would be very silly binnie slipped the handbrake and took the cortina away with a burst of speed that wouldnt have disgraced the starting line at monza and barry had to jump for it pretty sharply the needle was flickering at fifty as we left the courtyard and it kept on climbing the result was that we were skidding to a halt in a shower of gravel at the private gate giving access to the main road within no more than a couple of minutes i got out opened the gate and closed it again after binnie had driven through when i returned to the car the glove compartment was open and he was checking a browning a grim look on his face in the light from the dashboard i said i wouldnt if i were you binnie he meant it dooley is her shadow from now on with orders to kill at even a hint of trouble for a moment he clutched the browning so tightly that his knuckles turned white and then something seemed to go out of him and he pushed it into his inside breast pocket youre right he said only the small man can help now wed better get moving can i ask where he has a place in the sperrins an old farmhouse in a valley near a mountain called mullaclogha we need to be on the other side of mount hamilton on the plumbridge road do you anticipate a clear run god knows ill use what back roads i can for the rest well just have to take it as it comes he drove away at a much more moderate speed this time and i dropped the seat back a little closed my eyes and went to sleep i was out completely for the first hour which passed entirely without incident and dozed fitfully during the next half so that it must have been somewhere around fivethirty when he nudged me sharply in the ribs with his left elbow weve got company major looks like a road block up ahead i raised my seat as he started to slow it was raining again a slight persistent drizzle there were two landrovers a barrier across the road halfadozen soldiers all wearing rubber capes against the rain and looking thoroughly miserable which in view of the time and the weather was understandable enough i leaned out of the window identity card and movement order in hand and called whos in charge here a young sergeant got out of the nearest landrover and crossed to the cortina he was wearing a flak jacket and camouflaged uniform but no cape he was prepared to be belligerent i could see by the set of his jaw so i forestalled him quickly captain hamilton field security and im in one hell of a hurry so get the barrier out of the way theres a good chap it worked like a charm he took one look at the documents saluted swiftly as he passed them back then turned to bark an order at his men a moment kter and the lights of the road block were fading into the darkness like taking toffee off a kid binnie crowed i can see now what barry meant about you having the right manner major as a junior officer i once served with an old colonel who had spent a hairraising three months on his journey to the swiss border after escaping from a polish prison camp three miles from his destination he paused in a village inn to wait for darkness he was arrested by a colonel of mountain troops who only happened to be there because his car had broken down on the way through it seems he had been a member of a party of german officers who had visited sandhurst in when the old boy was an instructor there he had been recognized instantly in spite of the circumstances the years between and the brevity of the original meeting time and chance the right place at the wrong time or vice versa fate grabbing you by the trouser leg how could i speak to binnie of things like these what purpose would it serve the truth is i suppose that i was experiencing one of poor old meyers famous bad feelings which didnt exactly help because it simply made me think of him with some sadness and other good men dead on sombre grey mornings like this we pulled in at a filling station which was closed as far as i could see in any case according to the gauge there was plenty of petrol in the tank whats this i demanded i need to make a phone call binnie said as he opened the door ask a friend to tell a friend well meethim in a certain place he was beginning to sound more like an ira man in one of those old hollywood movies by the minute i watched him go into the telephonebox at the side of the building he wasnt long i noticed it was six oclock and switched on the radio to get the news to my astonishment the first thing i heard was my own name then norah murphys binnie got back in the car thats all right then were expected shut up and listen i said the announcers voice moved on the police are also anxious to trace james aloysius gallagher there followed as accurate a description of binnie as any hardworking police officer could reasonably have hoped for he was behind the wheel in an instant and we were away i kept the radio on and it couldnt have been worse the bodies of captain stacey and sergeant grey had been discovered by a farmer during the past hour and the absence of the brigadier and the three of us could only lead to one conclusion god save us major binnie said as the broadcast finished at a conservative estimate id say theyve got half the british army out on this one and then some i said how much further ten or fifteen miles thats all i bypassed draperstown just before i stopped youd see the mountains on the right here if it wasnt for the rain and mist have we any more towns to pass through mount hamilton and theres no way round we take a road up into the mountains about three miles on the other side all right i said so we go through nice and easy if anything goes wrong put your foot down and drive like hell and never mind the gunplay ah go teach your grandmother to suck eggs major he said the young bastard was enjoying it that was the thing this was meat and drink to him a great wonderful game that was for real always for real he sat there hunched over the wheel cap over his eyes the collar of his undertakers overcoat turned up and there was a slight pale smile on his face we were entering mount hamilton now i said youd have gone down great during prohibition binnie al capone would have loved you ah to hell with that one major wasnt there some irish lad took that capone fella on dion obannion i said god save the good work with a name like that he must have gone to mass every day of his life and twice on sundays we slowed behind a couple of farm trucks and a milk float all waiting their turn to pass through the checkpoint there were four or five landrovers at least twenty paratroopers and a couple of ruc constables who leaned against a police car and chatted to a young paratroop lieutenant the milk float moved on through the gap between the landrovers and i repeated my previous performance holding my identity card and movement order out of the window and calling to the young officer lieutenant a moment if you please he came at once instantly alert for whatever else i had become i had spent twenty years of my life a soldier and as they say in the army it takes an old academy man to recognize one captain hamilton field security i said were in a hell of a hurry theyve got a terrorist in custody in strabane who might be able i didnt get any further because one of the policemen who had moved to join him a matter of idle curiosity no more than that leaned down at my window suddenly and stared past me the eyes starting from his head god love us binnie gallagher i put my fist in his face binnie gunned the motor wheels spinning and we shot through the space between the two landrovers bouncing from one to the other in the process but we were through as he accelerated i screamed head down a sterling chattered glass showering everywhere the cortina skidded wildly and then he had her again in full control we were round a bend in the road and away it was raining harder now mist rolling down the slopes of the mountains reducing visibility considerably beyond that first bend the road ran straight as a die for about a mile we were no more than a hundred and fifty yards into it when the police car came round the bend closely followed by the landrovers binnie had the cortina up to eighty now the needle still mounting and the wind and rain roared in through the shattered windscreen so that i had to shout to be heard how far a couple of miles theres a road to the right which takes us up into the hills tanbrea they call the pkce well be met there we were almost at the end of the straight now and when i glanced back the police car seemed if anything to have closed the gap theyre moving up i yelled then discourage them a little for christs sake when it came right down to it i had little choice in the matter as far as the police or the army were concerned i was an ira terrorist on the run or as good as so they would have no qualms about putting a bullet into me if necessary i wondered what the brigadier would have said ijzthe savage day probably shoot the policeman and be damned to the consequences on the grounds that the end justified the means but life after all is a matter of compromise so when i drew my browning turned and fired back through the shattered rear window at the pursuing vehicles i took care to aim as far above them as possible the policeman who fired back at us out of his side window had understandably different intentions and he was good one bullet passed between binnie and me shattering the speedometer another ricocheted from the roof we skidded violently binnie cursed and dropped a gear as we drifted broadside on into the next bend in the end it was his undoubted driving skill that saved us plus a litde of the right kind of luck for a moment things seemed to be going every which way but when we finally came out of the bend into the next straight we were pointing in the right direction the police car was nothing like as fortunate bounced right across the road turned in a circle twice and ended half way through a thorn hedge on the lefthand side of the road binnie could see all this for himself for strangely enough the rearview mirror had survived intact and he laughed out loud theres one down for a start and two to go i shouted as the first landrover came round the corner followed by the second a signpost on the lefthand side of the road seemed to be rushing towards us at a rate of knots binnie braked violently and dropped into third the car drifting into another of those longangled slides and then miraculously we were into a narrow country kne that climbed steeply between grey stone walls things became a little calmer then such were the twists and turns that he had to drop right down for it was the sort of road where thirty miles an hour would have been construed as dangerous driving in some places how far now i demanded to tanbrea five miles but how in the hell can we stop there with the british army snapping at our heels and the small man waiting might as well serve up his head with an apple between the teeth well have to drive straight on through i leaned out of the window and looked down through the mist and rain to where the road twisted between grey stone walls below i caught a brief glimpse of one of the landrovers and then another they were several hundred yards in the rear now i said to binnie is this the only road through the mountains he nodded on this section then well never make it ive got news for you marconi has very inconveniently invented a thing called radio by the time we get to the other side of the mountains theyll have every soldier and policeman for miles around waiting i shook my head well have to do better than that such as i thought about it for a moment and came up with the one obvious solution well have to die binnie rather nastily or at least make them think we have for an hour or two and preferably on the other side of tanbrea tanbrea was a couple of streets a pub a small church a scattering of grey stone houses on the hillside the only sign of life was a dog in the centre of the main street who got out of the way fast as we roared through the road lifted steeply on the other side climbing the mountain through what looked like a forestry commission fir plantation about half a mile beyond the village we rounded a sharp bend and binnie braked to a halt in the centre of the road there was a wooden fence on the lefthand side i got out of the cortina and glanced over there was a drop of a hundred feet or more through fir trees to a stream bed below this is it i said lets get moving id intended a good solid push but binnie surprised me to the end instead of getting out he moved into gear and drove straight at the fence for a heartstopping moment i thought hed left it too late and then as the cortina smacked through the fence and disappeared over the edge i saw him rolling over and over on the far side as he picked himself up there was the noise of metal tearing somewhere down below a tremendous thud and then the kind of explosion that sounded as if someone had detonated around fifty pounds of gelignite pieces of metal cascaded into the air like shrapnel when i peered over the edge what was left of the cortina was blazing furiously in the ravine below somewhere near at hand i could hear engines roaring as the landrovers started to climb the hill when i turned binnie was already running for the fence on the other side of the road i scrambled over no more than a yard behind him and we plunged into the undergrowth we were half way up the hillside when the two landrovers braked to a halt on the bend below one behind the other the paratroopers got out and ran to the edge of the road the young lieutenant from the checkpoint in mount hamilton well to the fore we didnt hang about to see what happened binnie tugged at my sleeve we went over a small rise and i followed a stream that dropped down through a narrow ravine to the village as we came out of the trees at the back of the church one of the landrovers came down the road fast i grabbed binnie by the arm we dropped behind the graveyard wall and waited until the landrover had disappeared between the houses come on he said follow me major and do exactly as i tell you we went through the graveyard cautiously moving from tombstone to tombstone when we were almost at the rear entrance of the church a couple of paratroopers appeared on the street side of the far wall we dropped down behind a rather nice victorian mausoleum and waited in the steady rain a grey angel leaning over us protectively binnie said sure and theres nothing better than a nice cemetery have you ever seen your uncles grave at stradballa major not since i was a boy there was just a plain wooden cross as i remember not now he shook his head they bought a stone by public subscription about ten years ago white marble it says michael fitzgerald soldier of the irish republican army he died for ireland by god but that would suit me a somewhat limited ambition i would have thought he stared at me blankly so i pulled him to his feet the soldiers having moved elsewhere come on lets get out of this im soaked to the bloody skin a moment kter we were into the shelter of the back porch he opened the massive oak door motioning me to silence and led the way in it was very quiet winking candles and incense heavy on the cold morning air and down by the altar the virgin seemed to float out of darkness a slight fixed smile on her delicate face half a dozen people waited by a couple of confessional boxes someone turned and looked at us blankly an old woman with a scarf bound round her head peasantfashion binnie put a finger to his lips as one by one the others sitting there turned to look at us beyond the great door at the far end a voice shouted an order steps approached outside binnie grabbed me by the arm and dragged me towards the nearest confessional box in a moment we were jammed together inside the curtain drawn there was a movement on the other side of the grille and a quiet voice said my son i have sinned most grievously father and thats a fact binnie told him but even hell fire and damnation would be preferable to what the bastards whore coming in now are likely to dish out if they ky hands on us there was silence then the main church door opened and steps approached the boots ringing on the flagstones there was a movement on the priests side of the grille and i turned to peer through the curtain aware that binnie had drawn his browning the young paratroop officer from the road block was there a gun in his hand he paused and then my view of him was blocked as a priest appeared in alb and black cassock a violet confessional stole around his shoulders can i help you lieutenant he asked quietly the young officer murmured something i couldnt catch what and the priest laughed no one here except a few backsliders as you can see anxious to be confessed in time for early mass im sorry father he bolstered his gun turned and walked away the priest stood watching him go when the door closed behind him he said calmly and without turning round you can come out now binnie binnie jerked back the curtain michael he said is it you the priest turned slowly and i was face to face at last with the small man eleven the small man i waited in a small cold annexe outside the vestry aware of the murmur of voices inside but unable to hear a thing through that stout oaken door not that it mattered for the moment id lost interest too much had happened in too short a time so i smoked a cigarette sacrilege or no and slumped into a chair in the corner after a while the door opened and cork appeared binnie sitting on the edge of a table behind him i knew he was in his sixties but when he took off his hornrimmed spectacles and cleaned them with a handkerchief he looked older much older he said id like to thank you major vaughan it seems we owe you a great deal binnies told you then i said about norah and frank barry he replaced his spectacles oh yes i think you could say hes put me in the picture so what do you intend to do about it there were the sounds of more vehicles arriving in the street outside a shouted command he smiled gravely from the looks of things i wouldnt say were in a position to do much about anything at the moment major wait here he took a shovel hat down from a peg put it on and went out through the church briskly the front door clanged there was silence i said does he do this often the priest bit i mean it gets him around binnie said you know how it is nuns and priests everybody trusts them and the army has to be careful in its dealings with the church people take offence easy over things like that what about the local priest they dont have one here a young jesuit comes up from strabane once a week so corks performance isnt official he laughed harshly the church has never been exactly a friend of the ira major if they knew about this there would be hell to pay what do you think hell do about norah i mean he didnt say he lapsed into silence after that staring moodily into space reaction i suppose and hardly surprising i went back to my chair and stared blankly at the wall opposite more tired than i had been in my life before after a while the front door of the church opened again then closed the candles by the altar flickering wildly we flattened ourselves against the wall binnie with that damned browning ready in his hand but it was i only cork and a small gnarled old man in doth cap tattered raincoat and muddy boots more troops have arrived cork hung up his shovel hat and more to come i fancy paratroops in the main ive been talking to that young lieutenant gifford his name is nice lad he frowned in a kind of abstraction and binnie said and whats happening for gods sake they seem to think youre down in the ravine in the wreckage of that car theyre still searching i think youd better go up to the farm for the time being till i sort this thing out sean here will take you he turned to me its only half a mile up the valley at the back of the church major youll be safe there theres a hideyhole for just this kind of occasion that theyve never discovered yet and norah binnie demanded urgently what about her all in good time binnie lad cork patted him on the shoulder now be off with you he took down his hat and went out again the door clanged the candles nickered only this time most of them went out i hoped it wasnt an omen the old man sean took us out through the graveyard and plunged into the trees at the back of the church walking strongly in spite of his obvious age what with the rain and the mist visibility was reduced to a few yards certainly excellent weather to turn and run in not that it was necessary for we didnt see a soul and within fifteen minutes came out of the trees above a small farm in a quiet valley it was a poor sort of place and badly in need of a coat of whitewash broken fences everywhere and a yard that looked more like a ploughed field after heavy rain than anything else there didnt seem to be anyone about and old sean crossed to a large twostoreyed barn built of crumbling grey stone opened one half of the double door and led the way in there was the general air of decay i might have expected a rusting threshing machine a brokendown tractor several holes in the roof where sktes were missing there was also a hayloft a kdder leading up to it at first i thought the old man intended climbing it but instead he moved it to the other side of the barn and leaned it against the wall which was constructed of wooden planking then he stood back binnie said follow me major the black hole of calcutta we call it he went up the ladder nimbly paused half way reached to one side got a finger into a knot hole and pulled the door which opened was about three feet square he ducked inside and i followed him the old man was already moving the ladder back to its original position by the loft as binnie closed the door light streamed in through various nooks and crannies enough for me to see that we were in a small narrow room barely large enough to stand up in he said follow me and watch it its thirty feet down and no place to find yourself with a broken leg i could see the top of a kdder protruding through some sort of trapdoor waited until he wis well on his way and went after him dropping into the kind of darkness that was absolute binnie said softly easy does it major youre nearly there my feet touched solid earth again a moment later i turned cautiously there was the scrape of a match and as it flared i saw him reaching to an oil lamp that hung from a hook in the wall all the comforts of home he said which was a fair enough description for there was a rough wooden table chairs two old army cots and plenty of blankets a shelf stocked with enough tinned food to feed half a dozen men for a week or more where are we exactly i demanded unbuttoning my trenchcoat underneath the barn this pkce has been used by our people since the nineteentwenties and never discovered once the far end of the room was like a quartermasters store there were at least two dozen british army issue automatic rifles a few old lee enfields several sterlings and six or seven boxes of ammunition all stamped war department there were camouflage uniforms flak jackets several tin hats a few paratroop berets what in the hell is all this lot for i demanded the great day mostly stuff weve knocked off at one time or another and some of the lads wore the uniforms when we raided an arms dump a few months back he draped his wet overcoat carefully across a chair and sprawled out on one of the beds christ but im bushed major i could sleep for a week and thats a fact i think he was asleep before he knew it to judge by the regularity of his breathing but in the circumstances it seemed the sensible thing to do i tried the other bed nothing had ever felt so comfortable i closed my eyes i dont know what brought me awake some slight noise perhaps but when i opened my eyes cork was sitting on the other side of the table from me reading a book as i stirred he peered over the top of his spectacles ah youre awake my watch had stopped what time is it ten oclock youve been asleep maybe three hours andbinnie he turned and glanced towards the other bed still with his head down a good thing too while he has the chance in our line of work a man should always snatch forty winks at every opportunity but theres no need to tell an old soldier like you that major i joined him at the table and offered him a cigarette but he produced a pipe and an old pouch no thanks i prefer this the book was st augustinescityofg d heavy stuff i commented he chuckled when i was a lad my father sent me to maynooth to study for the priesthood a mistake as i realized after a year or two and got out but old habits die hard was that before you were in prison or after oh after a desperate attempt by the family to rehabilitate me they were a terrible middleclass lot major looked upon the ira as a kind of mafia and none of it did any good not a bit of it he puffed at his pipe until it was going mind you a couple of years in the crumlin road gaol was enough ive managed to stay out of those places since then thank god i know what you mean he nodded as i remember the chinese had you for a spell in korea thete was a slight pause he sat there puffing away at his pipe staring into the distance in that rather abstracted way that seemed characteristic of him i said what are you going to do about norah you mean he sighed well now it seems to me id better go to stramore myself and see exactly whats in franks mind just like that with a little luck of course and god willing i said hes a bad bastard i think he means what he says hell kill her if you dont tell him where the bullion is oh im sure he will major vaughan in fact im certain of it there isnt much you can tell me about frank barry we worked together far too long what caused the split as the times change all men change with them or nearly all he sighed and scratched his head suppose im what youd call an oldfashioned kind of revolutionary oh ill use force if i have to but id rather sit round a table and talk and barry a different story altogether frank has this idea about the purity of violence he believes anything is justified to gain his end there was another of those silences i said will you tell him what he wants to know id rather not no answer his smile had great natural charm and i suddenly realized what an enormously likeable man he was i said how could you ever have worked with a man like barry or the others that are like him for that matter the kind who think it helps the cause to slaughter indiscriminately women kids anyone who happens to be around he sighed and scratched his head again another characteristic gesture revolutionaries major like the rest of humanity are good bad and indifferent i think youll find thats held true in every similar situation since the war we have our anarchists the bombhappy variety who simply want to destroy and one or two who enjoy having a sort of legal excuse for criminal behaviour like barry terhaps we also have a considerable number of brave and honest men whove dedicated their lives to an ideal of freedom i didnt have any real answer to that except the most obvious one i suppose it all depends on your point of view he chuckled you know i knew your uncle michael fitzgerald of stradballa now there was a man who just didnt know when to stop fighting ah but youve got quite a look of him about you he put another match to his pipe then glanced at me quizzically over the tops of his glasses youre a funny kind of gunrunner boy and thats a fact now what exactly would your game be i wonder dangerous ground indeed but i was saved from an unexpected quarter there were three distinct blows against the floor above our heads binnie came awake on the instant and cork jumped up and climbed the ladder in the corner binnie swung his legs to the floor and ran a hand through his hair whats going on im not sure i said cork came back down the ladder and returned to the table right he said its time to be off binnie stared at him blankly whats all this youre going back to stramore binnie cork told him patiently and im going with you binnie turned to me is he going crazy or am i isnt half the british army scouring the hills for us out there true enough cork said and with paratroopers by the dozen in every country lane wholl notice two more he walked to the other end of the room picked up one of the camouflaged uniforms and tossed it on to the table then he rummaged in one of the boxes for a moment when he returned he was holding a couple of majors crowns in his open palm stick those in your epaulettes and youve got your old rank back again major youll have to make do with corporal binnie you dont have the right kind of face for a british officer binnie gave a kind of helpless shrug i said to cork all right whats the plan simplicity itself you and binnie get into uniform and go back down to the village keep to the woods and it anyone sees you theyll think youre simply searching the area like everyone else ill pick you up at the roadside on the other side of the village in my car you cant miss it its an old morris ten rather slow im afraid but i find that an asset in my line of work no one ever seems to think a car that will only do forty miles an hour worth chasing will you still be playing the priest oh yes thats all part of the plan once we reach the bottom road the story if were stopped is that youre escorting me to plumbridge to make an identification if we get through there in one piece well change direction from there on youll be escorting me to dungiven after that coleraine sure and well be at stramore before you know it the military have a terrible respect for rank major with a modicum of luck we wont get stopped for more than a minute at any one time it had a beautiful simplicity that made every kind of sense god help me i said but its just daft enough to work he glanced at his watch good ill pick you up as arranged in exactly half an hour he climbed the kdder and disappeared binnie stared at me wildly hes mad major he must be maybe he is i said but unless you can think of another way out of this mess youd better get into uniform and fast we havent got much time i was dressed in one of the camouflaged uniforms and a flak jacket inside five minutes and that included fixing the majors crowns to the epaulettes binnie once he started moving wasnt far behind when he was ready i moved close to check that everything was in order and adjusted the angle of his red beret christ jesus major but youre the sight for sore eyes there was a small broken mirror on the wall and he tried to peer into it my old da would spin in his grave if he could see this i found a webbing belt and holster to hold my browning binnie stowed his out of sight inside his flak jacket and we each took a sterling from corks armoury when i followed binnie out through the trapdoor to the barn old sean was waiting at the bottom of the ladder he showed not the slightest surprise at our appearance simply picked up the ladder when i reached the ground and carried it across to the hayloft again it was only as we went out into the rain and started across the farmyard that i realized he hadnt spoken a single word to us since that first meeting in the church binnie led the way at a brisk pace cutting up into the trees on the opposite side of the valley from the way we had come it was quiet enough up there the only sound the rain swishing down through the branches or the occasional noise of an engine from the road once through a clear patch in the mist i saw a red beret or two in the trees on the other side of the valley but there was no one on our side we bypassed the village altogether keeping high in the trees only moving down towards the road when we were well dear of the kst houses we crouched in the bushes and waited a landrover swished past moving towards the village the old morris ten appeared perhaps three minutes later and we stood up and showed ourselves instantly binnie scrambled into the rear seat i got in beside cork and he drove away in his shovel hat clerical collar and shabby black raincoat he was as authenticlooking a figure as one could have wished for a thought which for some reason i found rather comforting i said so far so good just what i was after telling myself he gknced in the driving mirror and smiled binnie you look lovely if they could see you in stradballa now get to hell outa that binnie told him come on now binnie i said i thought any sacrifice was worth making for the cause which made cork laugh so much he almost put us into the ditch he recovered just in time and the morris proceeded sedately down the hill at a good twentyfive miles an hour the first few miles were uneventful enough several military vehicles passed us going the other way but we didnt run into a road block until we reached the outskirts of plumbridge there was the usual line of vehicles and cork moved to join on at the end i said were on military business arent we straight through to the head of the queue he didnt argue simply pulled out of line and did as i told him as a young sergeant came forward i leaned out of the window he took one look at those majors crowns and sprang to attention for gods sake clear a way for us sergeant i said were due in stramore in half an hour to make a most important identification it worked like a charm they pulled aside the barrier and the spiked chain they had across the road a yard or two further on to rip open the tyres of anyone who tried to barge their way through now i know what they mean by audacity cork said we were already moving out into the countryside and binnie laughed delightedly it worked it actually worked i think it was at that precise moment that the rear nearside tyre burst not that we were in any danger considering the relatively slow speed at which we were travelling the morris wobbled slightly but responded to the wheel reasonably enough as cork turned in towards the grass verge what they used to call lags luck when i was in prison he said as he switched off the engine never mind that i said lets have that wheel off and the spare on and out of here double quick ive somehow got a feeling that its healthier to stay on the move binnie handled the jack while i got the spare out of the boot as i wheeled it round to him a landrover passed us going towards plumbridge it vanished into the mist but a moment kter reappeared reversing towards us the driver got out and came round to join us he was no more than eighteen or nineteen a lancecorporal in the royal corps of transport he saluted smartly anything i can do sir his attitude was natural enough at the sight of a major getting his hands dirty i made the first mistake by trying to get rid of him no everythings under control corporal off you go there was a flicker of surprise in his eyes he hesitated then leaned down to binnie who reacted violently you heard what he said didnt you clear off it was an understandable reaction to stress but delivered as it was in that fine kerry accent of his it compounded my original error the corporal hesitated seemed about to speak then thought better of it he saluted punctiliously then moved back to the landrover he started to get inside or so it seemed then turned and i saw that he was holding a sterling id like to see your identity card if you dont mind sir he said firmly now look here i said binnie straightened slowly and the lad who knew his business ill say that for him said hands on top of the car cork walked straight towards him a puzzled smile on his face tor heavens sake young man he said control yourself youre making a terrible mistake stand back the young corporal said i warn you but he had hesitated for that one fatal second that seemed to give cork his opportunity he flung himself forward clutching at the sterling there was the briefest of struggles i had already taken a couple of strides to join him when there was a single shot cork staggered back with a terrible cry and fell on his back i put a fist into the corporals stomach and a knee in his face as he doubled over that laid him unconscious at the side of the landrover and was better than a bullet in the head from binnie he was already on his knees beside cork who was obviously in great pain and barely conscious blood on his lips i ripped open the front of his cassock and looked inside it was enough is it bad binnie demanded not good from the looks of it id say hes been shot through the lungs he needs a doctor badly wheres the nearest hospital stramore and life imprisonment if he pulls through binnie said have you got a better idea we could try to get him over the border into the republic thats crazy even if we could pull it off its too far there isnt time he needs skilled treatment as soon as possible twelve miles he said clutching my flak jacket thats all and i know a farm track south of clady that runs clear into the republic theres a hospital no more than three miles on the other side run by the little sisters of pity theyll take him in one thing was certain another vehicle might appear from the mist at any moment so whatever we were going to do had to be done fast right get him into the landrover i said we lifted him in between us putting him out of sight behind the rear seat then i got out again knelt beside the unconscious corporal and tied his hands behind his back with his belt binnie joined me as i finished what are we going to do with him well have to take him with us cant afford to have anybody find him too soon binnies anger boiled over suddenly and he kicked the unconscious man in the side if he got his deserts id put a bullet in him for gods sake get his feet and shut up i said if you want your precious small man to live youd better get him where were going fast we bundled the corporal into the landrover putting him on the floor between the front and rear seats i got into the back with cork and left the driving to binnie i wasnt really conscious of the passing of time although i was aware that wherever we were going we were going there very fast indeed i was too occupied with keeping cork as upright as possible an essential where lung wounds are concerned i had found the vehicles firstaid box easily enough and held a field dressing over the wound tightly in an effort to staunch the bleeding gradually his condition grew worse all colour had faded from his face the breathing sounded terrible and there was a kind of gurgling inside his chest as he inhaled one of the nastiest sounds i have ever heard as i say i was not conscious of the passage of time and yet i realize now that until that moment i had not spoken a word to binnie since we had left the scene of the shooting blood trickled from the corner of corks mouth and i said desperately for gods sake binnie when do we reach the border the mans dying on us hang on to your hat major he replied over his shoulder for the past mile and a half youve been inside the republic twelve the race north the convent looked more like a seventeenthcentury country house than anything else which was very probably what it had once been it was surrounded by a fifteenfoot wall of mellow brick and the main gate was closed binnie braked to a halt jumped out and pulled on a bellrope after a while a small judas opened and a nun peered out it was not unknown for british patrols to cross the illmarked border in error on occasion which probably explained the expression of shocked amazement on her face at the sight of the uniform good heavens young man dont you realize where you are youre in the irish republic turn round and go back where you came from this instant tor gods sake sister will you listen to me binnie demanded were not what we seem weve a man near dying in the back here she came through the gate without hesitation and approached the landrover binnie ran in front of her and got the rear door open she looked in and was immediately confronted with the sight of the wounded man held upright in my arms he chose that exact moment to cough blood spurting from his mouth she turned and ran picking up her skirts the gates swung open a moment later and binnie drove into the courtyard the anteroom was surprisingly well furnished with padded leather club chairs and a selection of magazines laid out on a coffee table there was a glass partition at one side and i could see into the reception room where they had taken cork he lay on a trolley covered with a blanket and four nuns in nursing uniform busied themselves in giving him a blood transfusion amongst other things the door opened and another nun appeared a tall plainlooking woman in her forties the others got out of her way fast and she examined him within a moment or so she was giving orders and cork was being wheeled out one nun keeping pace with the trolley the bottle of blood held high the one who had examined him turned to glance at us through the glass wall then followed them out a moment later the door opened behind us and she entered i am sister teresa mother superior here her voice was wellbred pleasant more english than irish very definitely someone who had known the better things of life and i wondered in a strange detached way what her story was what had she given up for this there was an edge to her voice when she spoke again who are you binnie glanced at me briefly then shrugged tra from across the border and that man in there is he a priest he shook his head and she went on who is he then michael cork i said otherwise known as the small man perhaps you know of him her eyes widened closed briefly then opened again have heard of mr cork he is extremely ill the bullet has penetrated the left lung and lodged under the shoulderblade i think the heart has also been touched but i cant be sure until i operate you operate binnie said taking a step towards her i would imagine so she replied calmly i am senior surgeon here and a case like this requires experience the bullet was fired at point blank range sister i informed her i had imagined that must be so from the powder burns what calibre tsjine millimetre sterling submachinegun she nodded thank you you must excuse me now binnie caught her sleeve as she turned he said no need to inform the authorities about this is there sister on the contrary she said the moment more pressing matters are taken care of i shall make it my first duty to inform the area military commander of mr corks presence you gentlemen i presume will have had the good sense to take yourselves back where you came from by then wed like to stay for a while sister i said until after the operation if youve no objection she hesitated then made her decision very well ill send for you when its all over she opened the door paused a hand on the knob and turned to binnie who had slumped into a chair shoulders bowed i spent five years at a mission hospital in the congo young man so gunshot wounds are not unknown to me a small prayer might be in order however but i was long past that kind of thing myself perhaps there was a god who cared although from my own experience i doubted it but i knew a professional when i saw one and beyond any shadow of a doubt if sister teresa couldnt save him no one could i left binnie and went out to the landrover to check on our prisoner when i opened the door i found that he was not only conscious again but had managed to roll over on his back his face was streaked with dried blood and his nose from the look of itwas very possibly broken he looked up at me daed and more than a little frightened where am i i said youre on the wrong side of the border in the hands of the ira lie very still and quiet theres a good lad and you might come out of this with a whole skin he seemed to shrink inside himself i got up and went back to the anteroom we werent left alone for very long after twenty minutes or so a nun appeared and took us down the corridor to a washroom where we could clean up then we were taken to a large diningroom with several rows of tables we had the whole place to ourselves two nuns standing patiently by to serve us while we ate afterwards we were escorted back to the anteroom it the raee north was a long wait in fact a good two hours before a nun appeared and beckoned us we followed her along the corridor to another small room at the far end again there was a glass wall this time looking in at a side ward there were half a dozen beds but only one occupant michael cork and he was in an oxygen tent a couple of nuns knelt at the end of the bed in prayer two more leaned over the patient one of them turned and came towards us it was sister teresa and she still wore a surgeons white cap and gown a mask suspended around her neck she looked tired lines etched deeply from either side of her nose to the limits of her mouth i think i knew what she was going to say even before she opened the gkss door and joined us hes going to be all right binnie said on the contrary she told him calmly hes going to die and very soon now as i had feared there was damage to the heart as well as to the lungs but much worse than i would have thought possible binnie turned away i said hes a good man sister a fine man i know the church does not approve of the iras actions but he deserves a priest ive sent for one she said simply but first he wishes to speak to you are you certain he is quite rational though very weak he said i was to bring the major quickly there isnt much time she opened the glass door and i followed her through i paused beside the oxygen tent and waited the voices of the nuns in prayer a soft murmur cork opened his eyes and looked up at me sister teresa unzipped the plastic flap that we might speak tm going vaughan he whispered at the end of things at last and full of doubts im not sure if ive been right if its all been worth while do you follow me i think so connolly and pearse big mick collins they were names to conjure with but what came after did it really measure up to their sacrifice he closed his eyes i could have been wrong all these years i cant risk another death on my conscience norahpisaid he opened his eyes get back to stramore if you have to walk through hell to do it tell barry that if he wants that bloody gold hell have to swim for it its six fathoms down in the middle of horseshoe bay on magil island thats where i sank the launch i havent been back since which was interesting and for a second i got a flash of the place again in my minds eye as i had last seen it gtey windswept and lonely beneath the barren rocks of the island in the morning rain he stared up at me in mute appeal til see to it i said and something made me add in irish ill settle barry for you small man his eyes opened again rwho are you boy what are you i said nothing and he continued to stare up at me a slight frown on his face and then his eyes widened and i think a kind of understanding dawned holy saints he said theres irony for you my god but i call that rich he started to laugh weakly and sister teresa pulled me gently away please leave now she said as you promised of course sister she turned back to the bed as the priest was ushered in andi went into the anteroom and took binnie by the arm lets get out of here no sense in prolonging the agony he looked once towards the bed where the priest leaned over cork turned and walked out i followed him along the corridor and out of the front door to the courtyard where the landrover still waited at the bottom of the steps binnie said what now stramore i said where else his eyes widened he told you then where the stuffis not ten miles from spanish head remember that island we stopped at yesterday morning magil he sank the kunch in the bay there binnie glanced at his watch then slammed a fist against his thigh in a kind of impotent fury much good will it do us his despair was absolute which was understandable enough he had just lost the one man he respected above all others was now faced with the knowledge that norah murphy would almost certainly end the same way and there was nothing he could do about it no chance of reaching stramore by six oclock now major no chance at all oh yes there is i said if we dont waste time dodging round the back country stay on main roads all the way but how he demanded its asking to be lifted bluff binnie i said two paratroopers in an army landrover taking a chance on the queens highway does the prospect please you he laughed suddenly much more his old self again by god major but there are times when i think youre very probably the devil himself i opened the rear door and pulled the young corporal up and out into the open he seemed unsteady on his feet the skin around the swollen nose and eyes blackening into bruises i sat him down carefully on the convent steps binnie said what are we going to do with him leave him here by the time the nuns have patched him up and fed him and reported his presence to the garda itll be evening he cant do us any harm but if were going weve got to go now the nun on the gates had got them open as we drove through i called weve left you another patient back there on the steps sister tell sister teresa im sorry her mouth opened as if she was trying to say something but by then it was too late and we were out into the road and away five minutes later we bumped over the farm track that took us into ulster and turned along the road to strabane the streets of strabane were jammed with traffic and there seemed to be road blocks everywhere which was pretty much what i had expected the authorities must have known for some considerable time that we were not in the wreckage of that burnedout cortina at the bottom of the ravine getting through proved unbelievably easy for the obvious reason that there were soldiers everywhere and we were just two more i told binnie to simply bkst his way through which he did on several occasions taking to the pavement to get past lines of cars and trucks waiting their turn at every check point we came to we were waved on without the slightest hesitation and within ten minutes of entering the town we were clear again and moving along the main road to londonderry binnie was like some kid out for the day excitement and laughter bubbling out of him id say they were looking for somebody back there wouldnt you major so it would seem thats the bloody british army for you he snapped his fingers and took us down the centre of the road overtaking everything in sight i said mildly not so much of the bloody binnie i used to be a part of it remember he glanced at me surprise on his face as if he had genuinely forgotten and then he laughed out loud but not now major now youre one of us christ but youll be taking the oath next its all thats needed he started to sing thesoldiers song at the top of his voice hardly the most appropriate of choices considering he was wearing a british uniform and concentrated on his driving i lit a cigarette and sat back the sterling across my knees i wondered what kind efface hed show me at that final fatal moment when as they used to say in the old melodramas all was revealed he would very probably make me kill him if only to save my own skin something i very definitely did not want to do binnie and i had come a long way since that first night in cohans select bar in belfast and id learned one very important thing the ira didnt just consist of bombhappy provos and frank barry and company there were genuine idealists there also in the pearse and connolly tradition always would be people like the small man god rest him and binnie gallagher whether one agreed with them or not they were honest men who believed passionately that they were engaged in a struggle for which the stake was nothing less than the freedom of their country they would lay down thek lives if necessary they would kill soldiers but not children never that whatever happened they wanted to be able to face it with clean hands and a little honour their tragedy was that in this kind of war that just was not possible frank barry of course was a different proposition altogether which brought me right back to the brigadier and norah murphy and the present situation at spanish head the brigadier had told me quite dearly that i was to avoid contact with the military on any official level at all costs and it seemed to me that no purpose was to be gained by disregarding his instructions in the present circumstances if the guards parachute company itself was dropped in on spanish head the brigadier and norah would be the first to go not that i believed for one moment that barry would keep his promise and release the gkl and the brigadier of course had never been a party to the agreement in the first place no whichever way you looked at it the only thing to do was to go in and play it by ear in the hope of extracting every possible advantage from the fact that i had something he wanted very badly indeed we were somewhere past londonderry on the coast road before we ran into any kind of trouble and when it came it was from the most unexpected quarter we went round a bend and binnie had to brake hard for the road in front of us was jammed with vehicles in the distance i could see the roofs of houses amongst the trees and smoke drifted across them in a black pall there were two or three isokted shots followed by the rattle of a submachinegun as binnie pulled out to bypass the line of traffic i heard confused shouting faintly in the distance this doesnt look good said is there a way round no theres a central square to the place and everything goes through it i told him to keep on going and we reached the outskirts of the village to find a couple of mp landrovers blocking one half of the road as binnie braked to a halt a corporal came forward and saluted i said whats going on in there riot situation sir local police arrested a youth they found painting slogans on the walls of the church hall after half an hour a mob collected outside the police barracks demanding he should be freed when the petrol bombs started coming in they sent for us whos handling it haifa company of highlanders sk but there are more on the way i turned to binnie all right drive on as we started to move the corporal ran alongside you want to watch it on the way in sk that crowd is in a bloody ugly mood binnie accelerated and we moved down the centre of the street people stood outside the small terrace houses huddled together in groups as we passed heads turned and the insults started to come thick and fast a stone bounced from the canopy and then another but worse was to come for when we turned the corner the streets were jammed with an angry mob and beyond them in the square the highlanders were drawn up in a phalanx transparent riot shields held out before them a petrol bomb curved through the ak and exploded carpeting the area in front of the troops with orange flame they moved back in good order and the crowd surged forward binnie said this doesnt look too good what do we do drive like hell and dont stop for anything if that lot get their hands on us its a length of rope and the nearest lamppost at that moment someone at the rear of the crowd turned and saw us and raised the alarm the howl that went up was enough to chill the blood i ducked instinctively as a shower of stones came towards us though most of them rattled harmlessly enough from the bodywork of the landrover a petrol bomb soared through the air binnie swerved violently and it exploded to one side and then we were into the crowd he slowed instinctively couldnt help it as they crowded in men women even children howling like wolves hands tearing at the landrover as we passed some madman jumped into our direct path arms wide bounced from the bonnet into the crowd like a rubber ball binnie slammed his foot on the brake it was like that kst great wave one reads about sweeping in i did the only possible thing leaned out of the window and fired a burst from the sterling above their heads the effect was all that i could have hoped for and everyone scattered i shook binnie by the shoulder tsfow lets get moving we shot forward swerving to avoid someone lying on the ground narrowly missed a lamppost and drove through the debris of the square towards the line of highlanders they opened their ranks to receive us and binnie pulled in beside an ambulance and an armoured troop carrier a young lieutenant in camouflaged uniform flak jacket and glengarry bonnet came forward and saluted formally a near thing sir for a while there i thought we might have to come and get you my names ford major parker second paras i held out my hand sorry to descend on you like this but i didnt have much option ive been ordered to report to police headquarters in coleraine as soon as possible to have a look at someone theyve picked up in connection with the brigadier ferguson kidnapping if its the man they think it is i can identify him positively can we get through i should think so sir ford said only a church and a few almshouses on that side not many people around there was a sudden cry and as we turned at least half a dozen petrol bombs burst in front and behind his men there seemed to be flames everywhere smoke billowing across the square for a moment there was considerable confusion and the highlanders scattered one young soldier ran towards us screaming his legs ablaze still clutching his transparent shield in one hand a riot stick in the other binnie got to him before i did sticking out a foot deftly to trip him up we beat at the flames with our hands then someone appeared with a fire extinguisher from one of the landrovers and sprayed his legs the young soldier ky there crying helplessly his face screwed up in agony and a couple of medics ran across from the ambulance with a stretcher one of them got a morphine ampoule out of his firstaid kit and jabbed it in the boys arm binnie stayed on one knee watching his face very white the eyes full of pain i pulled him up are you all right it was the stink of his flesh burning he said as they carried the lad away it reminded me of norah now you see how the other half live i said the highlanders were on the offensive now firing rubber bullets into the crowd following this up with a wild baton charge to drive them back it was a scene from hell pools of fire all over the square from the petrol bombs black greasy smoke billowing everywhere shouts and screams from the crowd where handtohand fighting was taking place binnie was looking anything but happy which was understandable enough so i gave him a push towards the landrover time to go he got behind the wheel and started the engine as i climbed in beside him lieutenant ford approached ready for off sir thats right i think weve got things under control here now and another companys due to assist ill just put you on your way he stood on the runningboard hanging on to the door as binnie drove away the square was in fact lshaped and we moved round a corner and looked across to a church the entrance to a narrow street beside it thats where you want to be sir ford said and pointed there was a single shot a highpowered rifle from the sound of it he gave a grunt and went sideways i dropped out grabbed him by the flak jacket and dragged him round the corner as another bullet chipped a cobblestone a yard to one side as binnie reversed to join us a third round punched a hole in the lefthand side of the windscreen the bullet had gone straight through fords right thigh and he lay there on the cobbles clutching it with both hands blood spurting between bis fingers the medics appeared on the run there was a rumble of thunder above us and it started to rain a sudden drenching downpour that put out the petrol fires almost instantly one of the medics slapped a couple of field dressings on either side of fords thigh and started to bandage it tightly binnie had got out of the landrover and crouched against the wall beside me now what he whispered i heard ford say johnson take a look and see if you can spot him johnson a stocky young sergeant crawled to the corner and peered round cautiously nothing happened even the crowd on the other side of the square had gone quiet johnson eased forward there was a single shot and he was lifted bodily backwards he cannoned against me and rolled over gasping but when a couple of his men lifted him into a sitting position we saw that the bullet had mushroomed against his flak jacket and he was simply winded by the blow another round chipped the corner and a second ricocheted from the cobbles on the other side of the landrover someone tried a steel helmet on the end of a stick round the corner and the moment it appeared a bullet drilled a neat hole through it the medics were trying to persuade ford to get on a stretcher so they could take him to the ambulance and he was telling them exactly what to do about it in crisp anglosaxon by god but hes doing a great job whoever he is binnie whispered hes got every bastard here neatly pinned down including us i said or had you forgotten that weve got just over an hour to get to spanish head binnie which means that if were not out of here within the next ten minutes norah murphys had it he stared at me aghast i picked up the helmet with the hole through and handed it to him when i give the word toss that out into the square i pulled off my beret then crawled to the corner on my belly and peered round at ground level the most likely spot seemed to be the church tower opposite i was proved right a moment later for when binnie threw the helmet there was some sort of movement up there in the belfry and the helmet jumped twenty feet as another round pumped into it a second shot chipped the corner just above my head and i withdrew hurriedly whats the situation sir ford called hes in the belfry i said and hes good hell kill any man stone dead who tries to make it to that church door ford nodded wearily well have to wait till b company gets here well smoke him out soon enough then as i stood up binnie whispered urgently we cant stand around here doing nothing while norahs lifes ticking away by the minute exactly i said and the only way out of here is by knocking out the kd up there in die tower but hes one of our own its either him or norah murphy make up your mind his face was very pale now sweat on his brow he glanced about him wildly as if looking for some other way out then nodded all right damn you what do we have to do its simple i said i want you to draw his fire by driving the landrover out into the square ill handle the rest he turned from me at once went to the landrover and got behind the wheel as he started the engine i took the rifle from a young private who was kneeling beside me i said to ford perhaps we wont have to wait for b company after all lieutenant then i flattened myself against the corner and gave binnie the nod he roared out into the square and the sniper in the tower went to work instantly i allowed him two shots then ran out into the open raised the rifle to my shoulder and fired six or seven times up into the belfry very rapidly it was enough the bells started to ring a hideous clamour as bullets ricocheted from them a rifle jumped into the air a man in a trenchcoat seemed to poise there for a moment then dived head first to the cobbles i handed the rifle back to its owner and started across the square binnie had braked to a halt in the centre as i reached him the highlanders moved past me towards the body the smoke seemed suddenly to grow thicker from the rain i suppose choking the square so that visibility was reduced to a few yards i climbed in beside binnie think this would be as good a time as any to get out of here the skin was drawn tightly over his cheekbones so that his face was skulllike and it was as if death himself stared out at me when he turned i didnt look he said i couldnt is he dead drive on binnie i told him gently theres a good lad oh my god he said and as he drove away his eyes were wet and i do not think it was from the smoke alone thirteen may you die in ireland we turned in through the gate leading to the private road to spanish head at about ten minutes to six the final part of the run had proved completely uneventful for although we had run across two more road blocks near coleraine we had been waved through without the slightest hesitation it had stopped raining for the moment although there was a dampness to the air that seemed to indicate there was more to come and heavy grey clouds out to sea crowded in towards a horizon that was touched with a weird orange glow the house seemed dark and sombre waiting for us at the edge of the cliff in the pale evening light and there was no sign of life at all as we rolled into the courtyard and braked to a halt so here we were again at the final dangerous edge of things i lit a cigarette and turned to binnie we made it so it would appear major he rested his forehead on the steeringwheel as if suddenly very weary there was a slight eerie creaking as the garage door eased open i said softly dont lets do anything drastic its vaughan and binnie gallagher i turned slowly and found dooley and three of his chums standing line abreast each man covering us with a submachinegun when we went into the drawingroom on the first floor frank barry was standing with his back to the fire a glass of brandy in one hand he looked us over with obvious amusement my my but this is one for the book ive never seen you so well dressed binnie you should wear it all the time binnie said quietly wheres norah you can see her when im good and ready now what didcork have to say you heard him i said first norah then we talk i think that for a moment there he was going to argue about it but instead he shrugged and nodded to dooley who went into the next room he returned leading norah by the arm she looked pale and ill and her cheek was covered by a padded dressing held in place by surgical tape she seemed stunned at the sight of binnie and tried to take a step towards us frank barry pulled her back and shoved her down into a chair all right he said what about cork he died earlier this afternoon i said simply barry stared at me thunderstruck youre lying i would have heard it would have been on the news hes too important he was shot during a struggle with a british soldier near plumbridge i said binnie and i took him to a convent hospital just across the border into the republic you know the place binnie said gleragh barry glanced at him briefly then turned back to me go on they operated he died its as simple as that but before he went he told me what you wanted to know i turned to norah murphy who sat gazing fixedly at me the eyes dark and tragic in that ravaged face he said he didnt want you on his conscience too norah when he died she buried her face in her hands and barry said impatiently come on old lad out with it where is the stuff not so fast i said you gave us a promise you said youd free us all if we got you the information you wanted what guarantee do we have that you intend to keep your word he stood there staring at me a slight fixed frown on bis face guarantee he said he laughed suddenly and it was not a pleasant sound ill tell you what i will guarantee he grabbed norah murphy by the hair and yanked her head back that ill give her a repeat performance on the other cheek if you dont come clean he ripped the dressing away brutally and the girl cried out in pain i caught my breath at the sight of that hideous swollen burn i think binnie went a little mad there for a moment for he flung himself at barry hands reaching for the throat dooley moved in fast and gave him the butt of his sterling in the back binnie went down on his knees and barry booted him in the stomach he shoved the wretched girl back into her chair and turned to me all right make up your mind i havent got all night theres an island about ten miles out from here called magil i told him cork said he sank the launch containing the gold in five or six fathoms of water in horseshoe bay he said that if you wanted it youd have to swim for it well the old bastard the cunning old fox he threw back his head and laughed uproariously now thats what i call very very funny im gkd you think so i said though i must say the point of the joke escapes me oh youll see it soon enough he said you see youre going to get that gold for me vaughan after all youre the expert in the diving department ive seen all that gear you keep on thekathleen and afterwards he spread his arms wide let you go all of you and no hard feelings and what guarantee do i have that youll keep your promise this time none he said none at all but then you dont really have any choice in the matter do you the final screw in the coffin or so it seemed i suppose it showed in my face for he laughed harshly turned and walked out still laughing they took binnie downstairs presumably to the cellars and dooley and another man escorted me up the back stairs and locked me in the room with the dark mahogany furniture and the brass bedstead my suitcase was still there exactly as i had left it it was almost like coming home i ran a bath got rid of the flak jacket and camouflaged uniform wallowed in water as hot as i could bear for half an hour and tried to think things out it was a mess whichever way you looked at it barry had gone back on his promise once what possible hope was there that he would keep his word now the more i considered the matter the more likely it appeared that once id raised the gold for him hed put me back over the side double quick with about forty pounds of old chain around my ankles i dried off and got a change of clothes from my suitcase corduroy slacks blue flannel shirt and a sweater then i opened the window and had a look out there barry had warned me on an earlier occasion that there was no need for bars and i could see why there was a clear drop of fifty feet to the courtyard at the rear and the walls on either side were beautifully smooth not even the hint of a toehold between the stonework no fallpipes within reaching distance nothing the door opened behind me and dooley appeared the everpresent sterling at the ready he jerked his head and i took the hint and moved out past him he was on his own and on the way downstairs i wondered for one wild moment about having a go at him missed a step deliberately and allowed myself to stumble dropping to one knee my god but he was quick the sterling rammed up against the back of my head on the instant i managed a smile with some difficulty but there was no response at all on that bleak stone face discretion very definitely being the better part of valour i gotup and continued down the stairs when we entered the drawingroom barry was sitting alone at the table by the fire finishing a meal there was a decanter and several gksses on a silver tray and he nodded towards it have a glass of port old lad the logs spluttered cheerfully in the adam fireplace it was all quite splendid with the oil painting on the wall the silver and crystal on the table rather like the officers mess in one of the better regiments an admiralty chart for the coastal area was opened out across the lower end of the table i glanced at it casually as i poured a couple of glasses of port and pushed one across to him he was i think mildly surprised but took it all the same very civil of you i raised my glass up the republic he laughed out loud head thrown back by god but i like you vaughan i really do you have a sense of humour thats what it is and so few of us do the irish in spite of their reputation are a sad race all that rain i said now what do you want a few words about the job in hand thats all i had that chart brought up from thekathleen as far as i can judge there isnt more than five fathoms anywhere in horseshoe bay i had a look at the chart so it would appear it should be easy enough he said mean you can stay down there at that depth for as long as it takes you wont need to decompress or anything like that it seemed likely that he was simply testing me so i decided to be honest not really a slow smile spread across his face you told the truth thats encouraging my mother always said i should im glad you decided to follow her advice he took a small book from a drawer and tossed it on the table i found that on the boat with your diving gear so i was able to check the situation for myself it was a board of trade pamphlet containing various tables relating to diving depths decompression rates and so on i said one thing that doesnt tell you is that i only have about an hours air left in my aqualung then youll have to work fast wont you he obviously hadnt bothered to check how many ingots went into half a million in gold bullion there didnt seem to be any point in trying to tell him because i didnt know myself although i suspected it must be a considerable number i said all right when do we go not me old lad you he said with dooley and another of my men to keep you company anything smaller than thequeen elizabeth brings out the worst in me if you leave at five youll be there by first light the more i thought about it the less i liked it for i could imagine what dooleys orders would be the moment i delivered the goods one small change i said binnie goes with me he shook his head sorrowfully still dont trust me old lad do you not one damn bit all right he said cheerfully if it makes you feel any happier binnie you shall have with a browning in his pocket tsiow that really would be expecting too much he went back to the table poured two more glasses of port and handed one to me well almost at the end of tilings now vaughan eh what shall we drink to why to you i said and gave him in irish that most ancient of all toasts i had expected another of those laughs of his but instead saw only a brief reflective smile a fine toast major vaughan an excellent sentiment better by far than shiloh and another mans war he drew himself up proudly looking more like francis the fourth than ever and raised his glass up the republic it was only then i think that i realized just how seriously he took himself dooley took me back up to the bedroom and locked the door on me again i stood at the window smoking a cigarette and looked out at the night an old irish custom it was raining again now and i could smell the sea although i couldnt see it for a moment i saw the waters of horseshoe bay grey in the dawn light it would be cold down there and lonely with only a dead ship waiting the celt in me againi shivered involuntarily in spite of myself and the door opened behind me as i turned binnie was pushed into the room he was dressed in a pair of faded jeans an old rollneck sweater but still wore the paratroop boots i said where have they been keeping you down in the cellar with the old brigadier hes still in one piece then as far as i could see whats all this about major im supposed to leave for magil in thekathleen just before dawn with dooley and one of his cronies to keep me company it seemed to me more than likely theyd put me over the side when id done the necessary so i told barry i wouldnt go unless you went with me and he agreed why a couple of reasons one he wanted to keep me happy for the time being that is and two hes probably decided dooley might just as well take care of you at the same time as he disposes of me there was still that sense of strain about him the skin too tightly drawn across the cheekbones and he was very pale but when he spoke his voice was calm almost toneless and what are we going to do about it i havent the slightest idea because so much depends on unknown factors will either of us be allowed in the wheelhouse for example and why should that be so important i told him about the secret flap under the chartroom table whatever happens i went on if you see the slightest chance of grabbing one of those guns take it theyre both silenced by the way but for once technical detail even when concerned with his favourite subject failed to interest him and what if they keep us out of the wheelhouse entirely what if we dont get anywhere near those guns all right i said lets say i come up from the wreck twice as i go down for the third time you create a diversion of some sort ill surface on the other side of the boat and ill try to board and get into the wheelhouse undetected he thought about it for quite some time and then nodded slowly i dont suppose we have a great deal of choice do we major and afterwards now you are running ahead of the game there may be no afterwards anyway on the other hand there is one interesting thing ive noticed the ranks of the sons of erin seem to be thinning rapidly since weve been back ive only seen dooley and four other men even if one supposes another watching norahs door it still makes the odds bearable his face seemed paler than ever at the mention of her name i suppose and the eyes seemed to recede into the sockets have you seen her again he asked i shook my head no did you see her face major the spirit in her broken utterly his hands tightened over the brass rail at the end of the bed by christ but i will have the eyes out of his head for doing that to her from the look on his face id say he meant every word of it the tiny harbour in the inlet below spanish head was reached by a metalled road that zigzagged down the side of the cliff in a reasonably hairraising way we were taken down in the back of the ford truck and when it stopped we got out to find ourselves on a long stone jetty the cliffs towered above us on either hand and from that vantage point it was impossible to see anything of spanish head at the far end of the inlet there was a massive boathouse which i presumed contained the mtb although i could not be sure as the great wooden doors were dosed thekathleen was tied up at the bottom of a flight of stone steps and dooley pushed us down in front of him his companion was already on board a squat roughlooking man with a shock of red hair and a tangled beard who wore fishermans boots turned down at the knees and an aran sweater as i stepped over the rail the landrover wed come all the way from plumbridge in braked to a halt on the jetty above and frank barry got out everything all right old lad he called mcguire there knows these waters like the back of his hand so hell run the ship or boat or whatever you call it we dont want to overwork you so that was very much thati said just as you say barry he smiled beautifully thought youd see it my way now for the surprise norahs come to see you off he pulled her out of the landrover so forcefully that she lost her balance and almost fell over binnie put a foot on the rail and dooley raised his sterling ominously at the same moment the engines rumbled into life and mcguire leaned out of the wheelhouse and told us to cast off i looked up and had a final glimpse of norah murphy standing under the lamp in the rain a pale shadow of her former self so frail that from the looks of her she would have fallen down had it not been for barrys supporting arm and then they suddenly receded into darkness as mcguire increased speed and we moved out to sea fourteen dark waters magil island was as bleak a sight as i have ever seen in the grey light of dawn as we nosed into horseshoe bay at the height of summer the place could never hope to seem more than it was a bare black rock but just now in the morning mist rain driving across the bay in a grey curtain it looked about the last place there was on top of earth id been preparing on the way over and was already wearing my wetsuit as mcguire cut the engines and dropped anchor as close to the centre of the bay as he could gauge standing at my side in an old reefer coat the collar turned up against the driving rain binnie shivered visibly as he looked down at the dark waters rather you than me major will it take long to find do you think it doesnt look to me as if youve a hope of seeing a thing down there its as dark as the grave cork said the centre i reminded him and we cant be too far out whatever happens the damn bay is only about seventyfive yards across as far as i can see he started to help me on with my equipment while mcguire rigged the winch to start hauling which was i suppose the right kind of optimistic attitude as i strapped my corkhandled divers knife to my leg i noticed dooley watching from a distance the sterling as always ready for action any objection you great stupid bastard i demanded the stone mask he called a face didnt move a muscle i turned away stood up and binnie helped me into my aqualung as he tightened the straps i whispered dont forget when i go down for the third time he handed me a divers lamp without a word i pulled down my mask got a firm grip on my mouthpiece and went over the rail i paused briefly to adjust my air supply and went down quickly it wasnt anything like as bad as id thought it would be the water was strangely clear like black glass i was reminded suddenly and with a touch of unease of those dark pools of celtic mythology into which the heroes were constantly diving to seek out monstrous beasts that preyed on lesser men the bottom of the bay at that point was covered with seaweed great pale fronds reaching out towards me like tentacles five or six feet in length i hovered beside the anchor chain for a moment turning full circle but in spite of the almost unnatural clearness of the waters my visibility range was only a few yards there was nothing for it then but to start looking i swam towards the shore staying close to the sea bed and found the launch almost instantly lying tilted to one side in the centre of a patch of clear white sand i went down to deck level grabbed hold of the rail and hung on the signs of the fight with the royal navy mtb were plain to see two largish holes in the superstructure where cannon shells had hit and dozens of bullet holes in the hull that could only have been made by heavy machinegun fire i went up fast and surfaced a good thirty yards nearer the shore than thekathleen binnie was the first to see me and waved his hand they hauled in the anchor mcguire started the engines and coasted towards me youve found it binnie asked as they slowed beside me and mcguire let the anchor down again i nodded im making my first dive now to assess the situation i got a grip on my mouthpiece again and went down fast hanging on to the deck rail while i adjusted my air supply then i switched on the lamp and went head first down the companionway a small amount of grey light filtered in through the portholes but not much and it was as eerie as hell in that passage one of the cabin doors swung gently to and fro i shoved it open with my foot and a body lifted gently off the bunk opposite in the sudden turbulence and subsided again but not before id seen the face swollen to incredible proportions like something out of a nightmare another drifted above my head pinned to the cabin roof i got out and closed the door hurriedly i found what i wanted the moment i entered the main saloon for several large boxes were jumbled together in the angle between the centre table and the bulkhead where the boat had tilted most of them were padlocked but one had been opened and the contents spilled out in an untidy pile like childrens bricks gold is heavy stuff and the ingot i picked up must have weighed a good twenty pounds but i was conscious of no particular elation as i moved back along the companionway the chips were down with a vengeance and a hell of a lot depended on what happened during the next ten or fifteen minutes i surfaced beside the ladder mcguire had put over the rail and held up the ingot binnie came down the ladder and stood kneedeep in water to take it from me hanging on with one hand it was a heavensent opportunity and as i passed the ingot to him i slipped my divers knife from its sheath and pushed it down inside one of his paratroopers boots his face as usual gave nothing away he handed the ingot over the rail to mcguire who turned excitedly to show it to dooley dooley was more interested in watching me are you all right major binnie asked its bloody cold i said so lets have that net down pretty damn quick i want to get out of here mcguire helped by binnie pushed the winch arm out over the rail they had akeady fixed a heavy net to the pulley hook which they now let down i adjusted my mouthpiece and went after it filling the net was a laborious process for as i needed the lamp to negotiate the interior of the wreck i could only carry one ingot at a time it took me a good twenty minutes to move six which was very definitely enough so i hauled on the line and followed them up as i surfaced they were already swinging the net in over die deck jesus man is this the best you can do mcguire called its bloody hard work told him well youd better get on with it or well be here all day i glanced at binnie who was crouched over the rail busily engaged in moving the ingots dooley stood against the rail towards the prow watching me so i gave him two fingers and dived i went nearly all the way to the bottom before changing direction and striking for the surface again keeping directly under the keel of thekathleen when i was almost there i unbuckled the straps of my aqualung and got rid of it surfacing gently on the other side ofkathleen i heard binnie say angrily will you watch what youre doing you stupid bastard or youll get my fist in your teeth you little runt mcguire answered ill break your bloody neck i could see none of this of course as i hauled myself under the rail and slipped inside the wheelhouse my finger found the button under the chart table the flap fell i reached for the mauser with my left hand as i pulled it from the clip there was the faintest of sounds behind me i turned very carefully to find dooley standing in the open doorway what sixth sense had brought him there ill never know but there was no expression on his face as he stood covering me with the sterling i dropped the mauser having little option in the matter he smiled beautifully then shot me through the left forearm i lay on my back in the corner for a moment there was some sort of disturbance taking place on the other side of the wheelhouse for i could hear mcguire cursing gunshot wounds seldom hurt straight away but the shock to the nervous system is considerable so that i was understandably not quite myself as i struggled to my feet i fully expected dooley to finish me off there and then but instead he moved outside and beckoned me to follow i must have looked quite a sight as i paused in the doorway daed and shocked blood pouring from my left arm because he gave me that smile again and lowered the sterling i think it was the smile that did it but then i learned a long time ago that you survive in my line of country only by seizing each chance as it comes i moved out of the door swaying ready to fall down at any moment and gave him the edge of my right hand across his throat he dropped the sterling and staggered back against the companionway by rights such a blow should have put him on his back but the heavy collar of his reefer coat turned up against the rain saved him as i leaned down and tried to pick up the sterling he came for me i kicked the sterling under the rail which seemed the sensible thing to do and put a fist into his mouth when he got close enough it was like hitting the rock of gibraltar and his own blow in return was of such devastating power that i felt at least two ribs go in my right side he wrapped those great arms around me and started to squeeze perhaps hed some pleasant little idea in mind like breaking my back across the rail if so it was his last mistake for when he pushed me up against it i let myself go straight over taking him with me and the sea was my element not his i kicked hard taking us down clutching at his reefer coat as he tried to pull away my back scraped against the anchor chain i grabbed hold of it with my left hand ignoring the pain and clamped my right forearm across his throat god how he struggled but he was already halfgone and nothing on top of earth or beneath it could have made me let go my lungs were near to bursting when i finally released him and followed him up binnie reached for me as i surfaced beside dooley i sucked in air and shook my head give me a line ill pass it under his arms christ jesus major the bastards dead youve only got to look at him do as i say i insisted til explain later binnie got a line as i requested i passed it under the dead mans arms and he hauled him over the rail i followed a moment later and collapsed on the deck my back against the wheelhouse jesus but you look in a bad way major binnie said anxiously as he leaned over me never mind that what happened to mcguire i put the knife to him and shoved him over the side good lad now bring me a bottle of jameson up from the saloon and the firstaid kit youve got some patching up to do i moved into the wheelhouse and he cut me out of the wet suit and set to work by the time i was on my third large jameson hed bandaged the forearm but the ribs were a different proposition he taped them up as best he could but each time i breathed it felt like a knife in the lungs after that he gave me two shots of morphine under my instructions and helped me dress zothe savage day i poured another krge jameson and he said anxiously sure now and didnt i read somewhere that booze and that stuff dont mix too well maybe not i said but i need them both for what ive got to do and what would that be major oh get back to spanish head and sort out that bastard barry once and for all i managed a grin hes really beginning to annoy me binnie im with you there all the way he said all right then lets have a look at the situation when we take thekathleen in there are two possibilities the first is that barry will be waiting on the jetty in person eager for his first sight of the gold and the second hell stay up at the house and leave his men or some of them to do the welcoming but theyll know something is wrong the moment they see either of us at the wheel as we come in binnie pointed out i shook my head and fought hard to keep control of the pain in my side but neither of us will be at the wheel binnie thats the point i looked out to where dooley sprawled on his back on the deck eyes wide for all eternity fifteen fire from heaven we moved in towards the inlet below spanish head dooley in the helmsmans seat in the wheelhouse his hands on the wheel the ropes which held him in place were concealed by his reefer coat and i was satisfied that he would pass muster at any but the closest range i steered on my hands and knees peering out through a hole i had kicked in the panelling of the wheelhouse for that very purpose the pain wasnt so bad now but i felt strangely numb it was as if nothing was real and anything could happen the effects of mixing morphine jameson and nine millimetre bullets before breakfast a dangerous combination we must certainly have been under surveillance for some considerable time for the mist had cleared now and visibility was quite good although it was still raining heavily the ford truck was parked half way along the jetty at the end of the road but there was no sign of the landrover two of barrys men waited at the jettys edge one was smoking a cigarette they both carried sterlings i called softly to bitxnie who waited in the shelter of the companionway no sign of barry just the two of them about a minute to go and when you hit hit hard we cant afford any mistakes at this stage one of the men called heh mac where are you and then the other leaned forward and stared at dooley an expression of horror on his face my god i heard him say whats wrong with him as something like the truth dawned on them i yelled now binnie he sprang from the shelter of the companionway the stengun bucking in his hands as he sprayed the top of the jetty as i have said the sten mk iis is probably one of the most remarkable submachineguns ever invented the only sound as it is fired being the bolt clicking backwards and forwards as that is not audible above a distance of twenty yards there was no danger of anyone at spanish head being alerted to the holocaust below binnie cut them both down in that first second knocking one of them clean over the edge of the jetty into the water using all thirtytwo rounds in the magazine as far as i could make out he went over the rail to make thekathleen fast then started up the steps you get the truck started i called want to immobiuze the engine just in case anyone gets ideas i got what i needed from the wheelhouse went aft and took off the engine hatch and did what i had to do it only took me two or three minutes but in spite of that binnie was waiting in an agony of impatience at the edge of the jetty tor gods sake major will you hurry the second of the two men he had killed was lying face down near the truck there was a browning on the ground beside him i picked it up slipped it into my pocket and heaved myself painfully into die cab now what binnie demanded as he drove away i felt strangely lightheaded and my side was beginning to hurt like hell again and for some reason i found his question rather irritating i said as i dont happen to have my tarot cards with me i cant answer that one so just get us up to the house in one piece theres a good kd and well take it from there he glanced at me frowning opened his mouth to speak and obviously thought better of it i leaned back in my seat and fought against the tiredness which threatened to overwhelm me we drove into the courtyard at the rear of the house very fast indeed and braked to a halt outside the back door binnie jumped down and was inside in a second i summoned up my kst reserves of willpower and energy and followed him he kicked open the kitchen door and went in crouching there was only one occupant a man in shirtsleeves who sat at the table drinking tea and reading a newspaper binnie had him against the wall in a flash and ran his hand over him removing a browning from the hip pocket and shoving it into his own waistband he turned the man round and slapped him across the face right keenan you bastard tell us what we want to know or ill give it to you now keenan stared death in the face and started to tremble for gods sake binnie take it easy will you all right i said speak up and you wont get hurt who else is in the house at the moment just barry and whos guarding the girl binnie demanded ramming the muzzle of the browning up under keenans chin no one binnie no one keenan was shaking with fear theres no need and her with batty himself like always binnie was beside himself with rage and grabbed keenan by the shirtfront come on then lead us to them make any kind of wrong move and ill kill you just a moment binnie i said and turned to keenan what about the brigadier is he still in the cellar thats right wheres the key hanging on that nail there i took it down well get him out now before we go any further why should we for christs sake binnie exploded he could be useful if not now later which was pretty thin but the best i could do on short notice i went out before he could argue opened the door at the end of the passage and went down the cellar steps when i unlocked the door of the cell the brigadier was lying on the cot reading a book which looked suspiciously like the bible he looked at me calmly for a long moment over the top of it then sat up i must say youve taken your own sweet time about it what kept you oh little unimportant things like being shot in the arm and having my ribs kicked in not to mention being chased over large parts of ulster by what seemed on occasion to be the entire strength of the present british army and at exactly what stage in the affair are we now michael cork is dead ive found your gold and binnie gallagher and i are about to see what we can do about barry right now i took the spare browning from my pocket and offered it to him if youd care to join in the fun follow me only keep that out of sight for the moment im afraid binnie thinks im pearse connolly and michael collins all rolled into one very sad he was looking at me strangely which didnt surprise me for my voice seemed to be coming from somewhere outside me i turned and led the way out through the wine cellars and mounted the stairs to where binnie waited impatiently with keenan what kept you for gods sake he demanded then turned on the brigadier without waiting for a reply you follow close behind and keep your mouth shut do you understand perfectly the brigadier assured him we went up keenan in the lead and emerged through the green baize door into the hall it was very quiet he paused for a moment listening then started up that great stairway we moved along the corridor past the stiff ladies and gentlemen of bygone years set in canvas for all time someone was playing a piano i could hear it quite plainly a bach prelude lovely icecold stuff even at that time in the morning the music was coming from inside frank barrys sittingroom and when we stopped at the door i paused caught by the beauty of it theyre in there keenan whispered binnie put a knee into his crutch turned as keenan slipped to the floor with a groan and burst into the room the sten at the ready barry was seated at the piano and stopped playing instantly norah murphy was in the chair by the fire she jumped to her feet and turned to us the dressing on her right cheek making her face seem misshapen and ugly norah binnie cried are you all right she stood staring at us a strange dazed expression on her face and then she ran forward suddenly and flung her arms around him oh binnie binnie ive never been so glad to see anyone in my whole life in the same moment she yanked the browning from his waistband and moved back to a point where she could cover all of us comfortably i would advise complete stillness gentlemen if you want to live that is she said crisply in the harsh pungent tones of the norah murphy i knew and loved frank barry stayed where he was but drew a revolver from a shoulder holster the brigadier and i being sensible men raised our hands although i didnt get very far with my left you know i wondered about you from the beginning sweetheart i said the fact that barry and his boys were waiting for us on the way in and the speed with which they ran poor old meyer to earth that really was rather hard to swallow but you took it not really it was the branding that finally persuaded me i must have been wrong now that was quite a show what did you do barry fill her up with painkiller beforehand just like going to the dentist he said but it needed something as drastic as that to persuade binnie she was in real danger to send him running to the small man but she never was i said we wanted to know where the bullion was old kd and cork wouldnt even tell norah that had a thing about holding it in reserve as a last resort if the talking failed and he needed more arms talk norah murphy said thats all he ever wanted to do and what good was it hed had his day he and his kind now well try our way force and even more force the brigadier said terror on terror and what have you left after that little lot its the only way she said the only way we can make them see we mean business frank understands which is why youve been working together i asked her during all this binnie had stood as if turned to stone the stengun hanging from one hand by its sling but this final remark seemed to bring him back to life you mean youre one of them he whispered youve been working for frank barry all along a man who would murder has murdered women kids anyone who happens to stand in his road at the wrong moment for them sometimes its the only way binnie there was a pleading note in her voice as if she would make him understand we cant afford weakness now we must be strong you bloody murdering bitch he cried and took a step towards her the sten coming up she shot him twice at close quarters he staggered back spun round and fell on his face she stood there the browning ready in her hand for anyone else who made a move very pale but quite composed showing no evidence of even the slightest remorse for what she had done but it was frank barry who took over now answers vaughan and quickly or you get the same here and now dooley mcguire the men i sent down to the jetty to meet the boat all gone i said very sad and the gold on board thekathleen all of it all that i could find he stood there thinking for a moment then said to norah all right were leaving now in the boat you get the landrover from the garage and meet me out front she went out quickly stepping over keenan who still lay in the corridor moaning softly to himself and clutching his privates i said what about us behave yourselves and ill let you go just before we leave now ckp your hands behind your necks and start walking i didnt believe him of course not for a moment but there didnt seem to be anything we could do about it we went along the corridor down the great stairway and out through the front door there was no sign of norah and barry marched us across the gravel drive to the patch of grass with a balustrade from which one could look down into the inlet below he finally told us to halt and we turned to face him is this where we get it the brigadier asked him im afraid so barry said but then i thought youd prefer to have it outdoors and it really is a splendid view you must admit the landrover came round the corner and braked to a halt a few yards away norah murphy sat behind the wheel looking at us waiting for him to get on with it and behold how the evil ones shall reap fire from heaven i called thats what the good book says youll get yours norah never fear frank barry smiled and opened his mouth to make some lastban mot i suppose but the words were never uttered the air was full of a strange metallic chattering bullets shredding his jacket blood spurting from a dozen places sending him staggering sideways in a mad drunken dance of death to fall head first over the balustrade and disappear from view binnie gallagher lurched down the steps clutching the sten and started across the gravel drive towards the landrover norah sat there staring at him frozen waiting for the axe to descend he paused a yard or two away stood there swaying then suddenly said contemptuously oh get to hell out of that why dont you youre not worth spitting on it took a moment for it to sink in and then she switched on the engine quickly and drove away turning into the corkscrew road that led down to the inlet binnie dropped the sten and moved past me grabbing at the balustrade to keep himself from falling a hell of a view ill give the bastard that much as he started to fall i ran to catch him and we went down together his sweater was soaked in blood the face very pale he said it was fun while it lasted major sure and the two of us could wrap the whole british army up between us in six months isnt that the fact i nodded it is surely he smiled for the last time up the republic simon vaughan he cried and then he died the brigadier said tm sorry about this you liked him didnt you you could say that he coughed awkwardly what about the girl she isnt going anywhere i immobilized the engine just in case there are only a few bars of gold on board anyway its going to take a navy diver to get the rest ill show them where he coughed again as if to clear his throat its beginning to look as if we owe you rather a lot if theres anything i can do ill tell you one thing you are going to do i said youre going to pull the right kind of strings in the republic so that you and i take this boy here back to stradballa which in case you dont know it is the village in kerry where my mother was born i see he said i suppose it could be arranged oh youll arrange it all right i told him or ill know the reason why just like youll arrange for him to be buried next to my sainted uncle michael fitzgerald and well have a stone the finest marble you can buy fire from heaven and what will it say on it binnie gallagher soldier of the irish republican army he died for ireland i looked down at binnie hed like that i turned away and lit a cigarette the sky was dark and grey swollen with rain it seemed set for die day i said do you think weve accomplished anything really and truly weve won a little more time thats all in the end thats what soldiers are for the rest is up to the politicians god help us all then there was a slight pause and he said vaughan ive got a confession to make the night you were arrested in greece running those guns im afraid i arranged the whole thing thats all right i said decided that was a distinct possibility within ten minutes of meeting you anyway it got me out didnt it or had iti stood there at the balustrade staring out into the grey morning and down below at the jetty hidden by the overhang in the cliffs thekathleens engine burst into life ferguson moved beside me quickly my god shes getting away i thought you said you immobilized the engine thekathleen appeared in the inlet far below heading out to sea i saw the bow wave as norah murphy increased speed a moment later the whole vessel seemed to split apart orange flame spurting outwards as the fuel tanks went up what was left went down like a stone fire from heaven i said i warned her but she wouldnt listen oh my god whispered the brigadier i gazed down at the dark waters searching for some sign of norah murphy the merest hint that she had existed and found none then i turned and walked away through the rain the end
