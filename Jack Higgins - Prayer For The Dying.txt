jack higgins a prayer for the dying i fallon when the police car turned the corner at the end of the street fallon stepped into the nearest doorway instinctively and waited for it to pass he gave it a couple of minutes and then continued on his way turning up his collar as it started to rain he walked on towards the docks keeping to the shadows his hands pushed deep into the pockets of his darkblue trench coat a small dark man of five feet four or five who seemed to drift rather than walk a ship eased down from the pool of london sounding its foghorn strange haunting the last of the dinosaurs moving aimlessly through some primeval swamp alone in a world already alien it suited his mood perfectly there was a warehouse at the end of the street facing out across the river the sign said janos kristou importer fallon opened the little judas gate in the main entrance and stepped inside the place was crammed with bales and packing cases of every description it was very dark but there was a light at the far end and he moved towards it a man sat at a trestle table beneath a naked light bulb and wrote laboriously in a large oldfashioned ledger he had lost most of his hair and what was left stuck out in a dirty white fringe he wore an old sheepskin jacket and woolen mittens fallon took a cautious step forward and the old man said without turning round martin is that you fallon moved into the pool of light and paused beside the table hello kristou there was a wooden case on the floor beside him and the top was loose fallon raised it and took out a sterling submachinegun thick with protective grease still at it i see whos this for the israelis or the arabs or have you actually started taking sides kristou leaned across took the sterling from him and dropped it back into the box i didnt make the world the way it is he said maybe not but you certainly helped it along the way fallon lit a cigarette i heard you wanted to see me kristou put down his pen and looked up at him speculatively his face was very old the parchmentcoloured skin seamed with wrinkles but the blue eyes were alert and intelligent he said you dont look too good martin ive never felt better fallon told him now what about my passport kristou smiled amiably you look as if you could do with a drink he took a bottle and two paper cups from a drawer irish whiskey the best just to make you feel at home fallon hesitated and then took one of the cups kristou raised the other may you die in ireland isnt that what they say fallon swallowed the whiskey down and crushed the paper cup in his right hand my passport he said softly kristou said in a sense its out of my hands martin i mean to say you turning out to be so much in demand in certain quarters that alters things fallon went round to the other side of the table and stood there for a moment head bowed hands thrust deep into the pockets of the blue trench coat and then he looked up very slowly dark empty eyes burning in the white face if youre trying to put the screw on me old man forget it i gave you everything i had kristous heart missed a beat there was a cold stirring in his bowels god help me martin he said but with a hood on youd look like death himself fallon stood there eyes like black glass staring through and beyond and then suddenly something seemed to go out of him he turned as if to leave kristou said quickly there is a way fallon hesitated and what would that be your passport a berth on a cargo boat leaving hull for australia sunday night he paused and two thousand pounds in your pocket to give you a fresh start fallon said incredulously what do i have to do kill somebody exactly the old man answered fallon laughed softly you get better all the time kristou you really do he reached for the whiskey bottle emptied kristous cup on the floor and filled it again the old man watched him waiting rain tapped against a window as if somebody was trying to get in fallon walked across and peered down into the empty street a car was parked in the entrance to an alley on his left no lights which was interesting the foghorn sounded again farther downriver this time a dirty night for it he turned but thats appropriate for what martin kristou asked oh for people like you and me he emptied the cup at a swallow walked back to the table and put it down in front of kristou very carefully all right he said fm listening kristou smiled now youre being sensible he opened a manila folder took out a photo and pushed it across the table take a look at that fallon picked it up and held it under the light it had obviously been taken in a cemetery and in the foreground there was a rather curious monument a bronze figure of a woman in the act of rising from a chair as if to go through the door which stood partly open between marble pillars behind her a man in a dark overcoat head bare knelt before her on one knee now this kristou pushed another photo across the scene was the same except for one important fact the man in the dark overcoat was now standing facing the camera hat in hand he was massively built at least six foot two or three with chest and shoulders to match he had a strong sly face with high flat cheekbones and narrow eyes he looks like a good man to keep away from fallon said a lot of people would agree with you who is he his names krasko jan krasko polish originally but that was a long time ago hes been here since before the war and wheres here up north youll be told where at the right time and the woman in the chair his mother kristou reached for the photo and looked at it himself every thursday morning without fail wet or fine there he is with his bunch of flowers they were very close he put the photos back in the manila folder and looked up at fallon again well whats he done to deserve me a matter of business thats all what you might call a conflict of interests my clients tried being reasonable only krasko wont play so hell have to go and as publicly as possible to encourage the others something like that fallon moved back to the window and looked down into the street the car was still there in the alley he spoke without turning round and just what exactly is kraskos line of business you name it kristou said dubs gambling betting shops whores and drugs fallon turned round and your client kristou raised a hand defensively now youre going too far martin now youre being unreasonable good night kristou fallon turned and started to walk away all right all right kristou called something dose to panic in his voice you win as fallon moved back to the table kristou opened a drawer and rummaged inside he took out another folder opened it and produced a bundle of newspaper clippings he sorted through them finally found what he was looking for and passed it to fallon the clipping was already yellowing at the edges and was dated eighteen months previously the article was headed the english al capone there was a photo of a large heavily built man coming down a flight of steps he had a fleshy arrogant face under a homburg hat and wore a darkblue doublebreasted melton overcoat a handkerchief in the breast pocket the youth at his shoulder was perhaps seventeen or eighteen and wore a similar coat but he was bareheaded an albino with white shoulderlength hair that gave him the look of some decadent angel underneath the photo it said jack meehan and his brother billy leaving manchester central police headquarters after questioning in connection with the death of agnes drew and who was this agnes drew fallon demanded some whore who got kicked to death in an alley an occupational hazard you know how it is i can imagine fallon glanced at the photo again they look like a couple of bloody undertakers kristou laughed until the tears came to his eyes thats really very funny you know that thats exactly what mr meehan is he runs one of the biggest funeral concerns in the north of england what no clubs no gambling no whores no drugs fallon put the clipping down on the table thats not what it says here all right kristou leaned back took off his spectacles and cleaned them with a soiled handkerchief what if i told you mr meehan is strictly legitimate these days that people like krasko are leaning on him leaning hard and the law wont help oh i see it all now fallon said you mean give a dog a bad name thats it kristou slammed a fist against the table thats it exactly he adjusted his spectacles again and peered up at fallon eagerly its a deal then like hell it is fallon said coldly i wouldnt touch either krasko or your friend meehan with a bargepole i might catch something for gods sake martin whats one more on the list to you kristou cried as he turned to go how many did you kill over there thirtytwo thirtyfour four soldiers in londonderry alone he got up quickly his chair going backwards darted round the table and grabbed fallon by the arm fallon pushed him away anything i did i did for the cause because i believed it was necessary very noble kristou said and the kids in that school bus you blew to a bloody pulp was that for your cause he was back across the table a hand of iron at his throat staring up into the muzzle of a browning automatic and behind it fallon and the white devils face on him there was the click of the hammer being cocked kristou almost fainted he had a partial bowel movement the stench foul in the cold sharp air of the warehouse and fallon pushed him away in disgust never again kristou he whispered and the browning in his left hand was rocksteady never again the browning disappeared into the righthand pocket of his trench coat he turned and walked away his footsteps echoing on the concrete floor the judas gate banged kristou got up gingerly tears of rage and shame in hiseyes someone laughed and a harsh aggressive yorkshire voice said from the shadows now thats what i call really being in the shit kristou jack meehan walked into the light his brother billy at his heels they were both dressed exactly as they had been in the newspaper photo it really was quite remarkable meehan picked up the clipping what in the hell did you want to show him that for i sued the bastard who wrote that article and won thats right billy meehan giggled the judge would have made it a farthing damages only theres no such coin any more his voice was highpitched repellent nothing masculine about it at all meehan slapped him casually backhanded across the mouth and said to kristou his nose wrinkling in disgust go and wipe your backside for christs sake then we talk when kristou returned meehan was sitting at the table pouring whiskey into a clean paper cup his brother standing behind him he sampled a little spat it out and made a face all right i know the irish still have one foot in the bog but how can they drink this muck tm sorry mr meehan kristou said youll be a bloody sight sorrier before im through with you you cocked it up proper didnt you kristou moistened dry lips and fingered his spectacles i didnt think hed react that way what in the hell did you expect hes a nutcase isnt he i mean they all are over there going round shooting women and blowing up kids thats civilised kristou couldnt think of a thing to say but was saved by billy who said carelessly he didnt look much to me little halfpint runt without that shooter in his fist hed be nothing meehan sighed heavily you know there are days when i really despair of you billy youve just seen hell on wheels and didnt recognise it he laughed harshly again youll never come closer kristou he was mad at you you old bastard mad enough to kill and yet that shooter didnt even waver kristou winced i know mr meehan i miscalculated i shouldnt have mentioned those kids then what are you going to do about it kristou glanced at billy then back to his brother frowning slightly you mean you still want him mr meehan ii doesnt everybody thats true enough he laughed nervously and meehan stood up and patted him on the face you fix it kristou like a good kid you know where im staying if i havent heard by midnight ill send fat albert to see you and you wouldnt like that would you he walked into the darkness followed by his brother and kristou stood there terrified listening to them go the judas gate opened and meehans voice called kristou yes mr meehan dont forget to have a bath when you get home you stink like my aunt marys midden the judas banged shut and kristou sank down into the chair fingers tapping nervously goddamn fallon it would serve him right if he turned him in and then it hit him like a bolt from the blue the perfect solution and so beautifully simple he picked up the telephone dialed scotland yard and asked to be put through to the special branch it was raining quite heavily now and jack meehan paused to turn up his collar before crossing the street billy said i still dont get it why is it so important you get fallon number one with a shooter in his hand hes the best there is meehan said number two everybody wants him the special branch military intelligence even his old mates in the ira which means number three that hes eminently disposable afterwards whats that mean billy said as they turned the corner of the alley and moved towards the car why dont you try reading a few books for christs sake meehan demanded all you ever seem to think of is birds they were at the front of the car by now a bentley continental and meehan grabbed billy by the arm and pulled him up quickly here what the hells going on wheres fred i a slight concussion mr median nothing much hes sleeping it off in the rear seat a match flared in a nearby doorway pulling felons face out of the darkness there was a cigarette between his lips he lit it then flicked the match into the gutter meehan opened the door of the bentley and switched on the lights what are you after he said calmly i just wanted to see you in the flesh so to speak thats all fallon said good night to you he started to move away and meehan grabbed his arm you know i like you fallon i think weve got a lot in common i doubt that meehan ignored him ive been reading this german philosopher lately you wouldnt know him he says that for authentic living what is necessary is the resolute confrontation of death would you agree with that heidegger fallon saidinteresting you should go for him he was himmlers bible he turned away again and meehan moved quickly in front of him heidegger he said youve read heidegger there was genuine astonishment in his voice ill double up on the original offer and find you regular work now i cant say fairer than that can i good night mr meehan fallon said and melted into the darkness what a man meehan said what a hardnosed bastard why hes beautiful billy even if he is a fucking mick he turned come on lets get back to the savoy you drive and if you put as much as a scratch on this motor ill have your balls fallon had a room in a lodginghouse in hanger street in stepney just off the commercial road a couple of miles no more so he walked in spite of the rain he hadnt the slightest idea what would happen now kristou had been his one his only hope he was finished it was as simple as that he could run but how far as he neared his destination he took out his wallet and checked the contents four pounds and a little silver and he was already two weeks behind with his rent he went into a cheap wine shop for some cigarettes then crossed the road to hanger street the newspaperman on the corner had deserted his usual pitch to shelter in a doorway from the driving rain he was little more than a bundle of rags an old londonirishman totally blind in one eye and only partially sighted in the other fallon dropped a coin in his hand and took a paper good night to you michael he said the old man rolled one milky white eye towards him his hand fumbling for change in the bag which hung about his neck is it yourself mr fallon and who else you can forget the change the old man grabbed his hand and counted out his change laboriously you had visitors at number thirteen about twenty minutes ago the law fallon asked softly something in uniform they went in and didnt come out again two cars waiting at the other end of the street another across the road he counted a final penny into felons hand fallon turned and crossed to the telephonebox on the other corner he dialed thenumber of the lodginghouse and was answered instant by the old woman who ran the place he pushed in the coin and spoke mrs keegan pits daly here i wonder if youd mind doing me a favour he knew at once by the seconds hesitation by the strain in her voice that old michaels supposition had been correct oh yes mr daly the thing is im expecting a phone call at nine oclock take the number and tell them ill ring back when i get in i havent a hope in hell of getting there now i ran into a couple of old friends and were having a few drinks you know how it is there was another slight pause before she said as if in response to some invisible prompt sounds nice where are you a pub called the grenadier guard in kensington high street ill have to go now see you later he replaced the receiver left the phonebox and moved into a doorway from which he had a good view of no i halfway down the short street a moment later the front door was flung open there were eight of them special branch from the look of it the first one on to the pavement waved frantically and two cars moved out of the shadows at the end of the street the whole crew climbed inside the cars moved away at speed a car which was parked at the kerb on the other side of the main road went after them fallon crossed to the corner and paused beside the old newspaper seller he took out his wallet extracting the four remaining pound notes and pressed them into his hand god bless you mr fallon michael said but fallon was already on the other side of the road walking rapidly back towards the river this time kristou didnt hear a thing although he had been waiting for something like an hour nerves taut he sat there at the table ledger open the pen gripped tightly in his mittened hand there was the softest of footfalls wind over grass only then the harsh deliberate click as the hammer of the browning was cocked kristou breathed deeply to steady himself whats the point martin he said what would it get you fallon moved round to the other side of the table the browning in his hand kristou stood up leaning on the table to stop from shaking im the only friend youve got left now martin you bastard fallon said you sicked the special branch on to me i had to kristou said frantically it was the only way i could get you back here it was for your own good martin youve been like a dead man walking i can bring you back to life again action and passion thats what you want thats what you need felons eyes were like black holes in the white face he raised the browning at arms length touching the muzzle between kristous eyes the old man dosed them all right if you want to go ahead get it over with this is a life the life i lead only remember one thing kill me you kill yourself because there is no one else not one single person in this world that would do anything other than turn you in or put a bullet in your head there was a long pause he opened his eyes to see fallon gently lowering the hammer of the browning he stood there holding it against his right thigh staring into space kristou said carefully after all what is he to you this krasko a gangster a murderer the kind who lives off young girls he spat a pig fallon said dont try to dress it up whats the next move one phone call is all it takes a car will be here in half an hour youll be taken to a farm near doncaster an outoftheway place youll be safe there you make the hit on thursday morning at the cemetery like i showed you in the photo krasko always leaves his goons at the gate he doesnt like having them around when hes feeling sentimental all right fallon said but i do my own organising thats understood of course anything you want kristou opened the drawer took out an envelope and shoved it across theres five hundred quid there in fives to be going on with fallon weighed the envelope in his hand carefully for a moment then slipped it into a pocket when do i get the rest he said and the passport mr meehan takes care of that end on satisfactory completion fallon nodded slowly all right make your phone call kristou smiled a mixture of triumph and relief youre doing the wise thing martin believe me you are he hesitated theres just one thing if you dont mind me saying so and what would that be the browning no good to you for a job like this you need something nice and quiet fallon looked down at the browning a slight frown on his face maybe you have a point what have you got to offer what would you like fallon shook his head ive never had a preference for any particular make of handgun that way you end up with a trademark something they can fasten on to and thats bad kristou unlocked a small safe in the corner opened it and took out a cloth bundle which he unwrapped on the table it contained a rather uglylooking automatic perhaps six inches long a curiouslooking barrel protruding a farther two inches the bundle also contained a threeinch silencer and two fiftyround cartons of ammunition and what in the hell is this fallon said picking it up a czech ceska kristou told him seven point five mm model twentyseven the germans took over the factory during the war this is one of theirs you can tell by the special barrel modification made that way to take a silencer is it any good ss intelligence used them but judge for yourself he moved into the darkness a few moments later a light was turned on at the far end of the building and fallon saw that there was a target down there of a type much used by the army a lifesized replica of a charging soldier as he screwed the silencer on to the end of the barrel kristou rejoined him any time youre ready fallon took careful aim with both hands there was a dull thud that outside would not have been audible above three yards he had fired at the heart and chipped the right arm he adjusted the sight and tried again he was still a couple of inches out he made a further adjustment this time he was dead on target kristou said didnt i tell you fallon nodded ugly but deadly kristou just like you and me did i ever tell you that i once saw a sign on a wall in derry that said is there a life before death isnt that the funniest thing you ever heard kristou stared at him aghast and fallon turned his arm swung up he fired twice without apparently taking aim and shot out the targets eyes father da costa the lord is my shepherd i shall not want father michael da costa spoke out bravely as he led the way up through the cemetery his words almost drowned in the rush of heavy rain inside he was sick at heart it had rained heavily all night was raining even harder now the procession from chapel to graveside was a wretched affair at the best of times but this occasion was particularly distressing for one thing there were so few of them the two men from the funeral directors carrying the pitifully small coffin between them and the mother already on the point of collapse staggering along behind supported by her husband on one side and her brother on the other they were poor people they had no one they turned inward in their grief mr obrien the cemetery superintendent was waiting at the graveside an umbrella over his head against the rain there was a gravedigger with him who pulled off the canvas cover as they arrived not that it had done any good for there was at least two feet of water in the bottom obrien tried to hold the umbrella over the priest but father da costa waved it away instead he took off his coat and handed it to the superintendent and stood there in the rain at the graveside the old red and gold cope making a brave show in the grey morning obrien had to act as server and father da costa sprinkled the coffin with holy water and incense and as he prayed he noticed that the father was glaring across at him wildly like some trapped animal behind bars the fingers of his right hand clenching and unclenching convulsively he was a big man almost as big as da costa foreman on a building site da costa looked away hurriedly and prayed for the child face upturned rain beading his tangled grey beard into jour hands o lord we humbly commend our sister lead her for whom you have shown so great a love into the joy of the heavenly paradise not for the first time the banality of what he was saying struck him how could he explain to any mother on this earth that god needed her eightyearold daughter so badly that it had been necessary for her to choke to death in the stinking waters of an industrial canal to drift for ten days before being found the coffin descended with a splash and the gravedigger quickly pulled the canvas sheet back in place father da costa said a final prayer then moved round to the woman who was now crying bitterly he put a hand on her shoulder mrs dalton if theres anything i can do the father struck his arm away wildly you leave her alone i he cried shes suffered enough you and your bloody prayers what goods that i had to identify her did you know that a piece of rotting flesh that was my daughter after ten days in the canal what kind of a god is it that could do that to a child obrien moved forward quickly but father da costa put up an arm to hold him back leave it he said calmly a strange hunted look appeared on daltons face as if he suddenly realised the enormity of his offence he put an arm about his wifes shoulders and he and her brother hurried her away the two funeral men went after them obrien helped da costa on with his coat tm sorry about that father a bad business he has a point poor devil da costa said after all what am i supposed to say to someone in his position the gravedigger looked shocked but obrien simply nodded slowly its a funny old life sometimes he opened his umbrella til walk you back to the chapel father da costa shook his head til take the long way round if you dont mind i could do with the exercise ill borrow the umbrella if i may certainly father obrien gave it to him and da costa walked away through the wilderness of marble monuments and tombstones the gravedigger said that was a hell of an admission for a priest to make obrien lit a cigarette ah but then da costa is no ordinary priest joe devlin the sacristan at st annes told me all about him he was some sort of commando or other during the war fought with tito and the yugoslav partisans afterwards he went to the english college in rome had a brilliant career there could have been anything instead he decided to go into mission work after he was ordained where did they send him korea the chinese had him for nearly five years afterwards they gave him some administrative job in rome to recuperate but he didnt like that got them to send him to mozambique i think it was his grandfather who was portuguese anyway he speaks the language what happened there oh he was deported the portuguese authorities accused him of having too much sympathy with rebels so whats he doing here parish priest at holy name that pile of rubble the gravedigger said incredulously why its only standing up because of the scaffolding if he gets a dozen for mass on a sunday hell be lucky exactly obrien said oh i get it the gravedigger nodded sagely its their way of slapping his wrist hes a good man obrien said too good to be wasted he was suddenly tired of the conversation and for some strange reason unutterably depressed better get that grave filled in what now in this rain the gravedigger looked at him bewildered it can wait till later cant it no it damn well cant obrien turned on heel and walked away and the gravedigger swearing softly pulled back the canvas sheet and got to work father da costa usually enjoyed a walk in the rain it gave him a safe enclosed feeling some psychological thing harking back to childhood he supposed but not now now he felt restless and ill at ease still disturbed by what had happened at the graveside he paused to break a personal vow by lighting a cigarette awkwardly because of the umbrella in his left hand he had recently reduced his consumption to five a day and those he smoked only during the evening a pleasure to be savoured by anticipation but under the circumstances he moved on into the oldest part of the cemetery a section he had discovered with delight only a month or two previously here amongst the pines and the cypresses were superb victoriangothic tombs winged angels in marble bronzed effigies of death something different on every hand and on each slab a pious sentimental implacable belief in the hereafter was recorded he didnt see a living soul until he went round a corner between rhododendron bushes and paused abruptly the path divided some ten yards in front of him and at the intersection stood a rather interesting grave a door between marble pillars partially open in front of it the bronze figure of a woman in the act of rising from a chair a man in a dark overcoat head bare knelt before her on one knee it was very quiet only the rushing of the rain into wet earth and father da costa hesitated for a moment unwilling to intrude on such a moment of personal grief and then an extraordinary thing happened a priest stepped in through the eternity door at the back of the grave a youngish man who wore a dark clerical raincoat over his cassock and a black hat what took place then was like something out of a nightmare frozen in time no reality to it at all as the man in the dark overcoat glanced up the priest produced an automatic with a long black silencer on the end there was a dull thud as he fired fragments of bone and brain sprayed out from the rear of his victims skull as he was slammed back against the gravel father da costa gave a hoarse cry already seconds too late for gods sake no t the young priest in the act of stepping towards his victim looked up aware of da costa for the first time the arm swung instantly as he took deliberate aim and da costa looked at death at the white devils face on him the dark dark eyes and then unaccountably as his lips moved in prayer the gun was lowered the priest bent down to pick something up the dark eyes stared into his for a second longer and then he slipped back through the door and was gone father da costa threw the umbrella to one side and dropped to his knees beside the man who had been shot blood trickled from the nostrils the eyes were halfclosed and yet incredibly there was still the sound of laboured breathing he began to recite in a firm voice the prayers for the dying go christian soul from this world in the name of god the father almighty who created thee and then with a hoarse rattle the breathing stopped abruptly fallon followed the path at the north end of the cemetery walking fast but not too fast not that it mattered he was well screened by rhododendron bushes and it was unlikely that there would be anyone about in such weather the priest had been unfortunate one of those time and chance things it occurred to him with something like amusement and not for the first time in his life that no matter how well you planned something unexpected always seemed to turn up he moved into a small wood and found the van parked in the track out of sight as he had left it there was no one in the drivers seat and he frowned varley where are you he called softly a small man in a raincoat and cloth cap came blundering through the trees mouth gaping clutching a pair of binoculars in one hand he leaned against the side of the van fighting for breath fallon shook him roughly by the shoulder where in the hell have you been i was watching varley gasped he raised the binoculars mr meehans orders that priest he saw you why didnt you give it to him fallon opened the van door and shoved him in behind the wheel shut up and get driving he went round to the rear opened the doors got in and closed them again as the engine roared into life and they lurched away along the rough track he opened the small window at the rear of the drivers compartment steady he said easy does it the slower the better a friend of mine once robbed a bank and made his escape in an icecream van that couldnt do more than twenty miles an hour they expect you to move like hell after a killing so do the other thing he started to divest himself of the raincoat and cassock underneath he wore a dark sweater and grey slacks his navy blue trench coat was ready on the seat and he pulled it on then he took off the rubber galoshes he was wearing varley was sweating as they turned into the dual carriageway oh god he moaned mr meehan will have our balls for this let me worry about meehan fallon bundled the priests clothing into a canvas hold all and zipped it shut you dont know him mr fallon varley said hes the devil himself when hes mad there was a fella called gregson a month or two back professional gambler bent as a corkscrew he took one of mr meehans clubs for five grand when the boys brought him in mr meehan nailed his hands to a tabletop did it himself too sixinch nails and a fivepound hammer left him like that for five hours to consider the error of his ways thats what he said what did he do to him after that fallon asked i was there when they took the nails out it was horrible gregson was in a terrible state and mr meehan he pats him on the cheek and tells him to be a good boy in future then he gives him a tenner and sends him to see this paki doctor he uses varley shuddered i tell you mr fallon hes no man to cross he certainly seems to have his own special way of winning friends and influencing people fallon said the priest back there do you know him father da costa varley nodded has a brokendown old church near the centre of the city holy name its called he runs the crypt as a kind of doss house for downandouts about the only congregation he gets these days one of these areas where theyve pulled down all the houses sounds interesting take me there the car swerved violently so great was valleys surprise and he had to fight to regain control of the wheel dont be crazy my orders were to take you straight back to the farm im changing them fallon said simply and he sat back and lit a cigarette the church of the holy name was in rockingham street sandwiched between gleaming new cement and glass office blocks on the one hand and shabby decaying warehouses on the other higher up the street there was a vast brickfield where old victorian slum houses had been cleared the bulldozers were already at work digging the foundation for more tower blocks varley parked the van opposite the church and fallon got out it was a victoriangothic monstrosity with a squat ugly tower at its centre the whole networked with scaffolding although there didnt seem to be any work in progress it isnt exactly a hive of industry fallon said they ran out of money the way i hear it the bloody place is falling down varley wiped sweat from his brow nervously lets get out of it mr fallon please in a minute fallon crossed the road to the main entrance there was the usual board outside with da costas name there and the times of mass confession was at one oclock and five on weekdays he stood there staring at the board for a moment and then he smiled slowly turned and went back to the van he leaned in the window this funeral place of meehans where is it pauls square varley said its only ten minutes from here on the side of the town hall ive got things to do fallon said tell meehan ill meet him there at two oclock for christs sake mr fallon varley said frantically you cant do that but fallon was already halfway across the road going back towards the church varley moaned you bastard i and he moved into gear and drove away fallon didnt go into the church instead he walked up the side street beside a high greystone wall there was an old cemetery inside flat tombstones mainly and a house in one corner presumably the presbytery lt looked to be in about the same state as the church it was a sad grey sort of place the leafless trees black with a century of city soot that even the rain could not wash away and he was filled with a curious melancholy this was what it all came to in the end whichever way you looked at it words in cracked stones a gate clicked behind him and he turned sharply a young woman was coming down the path from the presbytery an old trench coat over her shoulders against the rain she carried an ebony walking stick in one hand and there was a bundle of sheet music under the other arm fallon judged her to be in her late twenties with black shoulderlength hair and a grave steady face one of those plain faces that for some strange reason you found yourself looking at twice he got ready to explain himself as she approached but she stared straight through him as if he wasnt there and then as she went by he noticed the occasional tap with the stick against the end of a tomb familiar friends she paused and turned a slight uncertain frown on her face is anyone there she called in a calm pleasant voice fallon didnt move a muscle she stayed there for a moment longer then turned and continued along the path when she reached a small door at the end of the church she took out a yale key opened it and went inside fallon went out through the side gate and round to the main entrance when he pushed open the door and went inside he was conscious of the familiar odour and smiled wryly incense candles and the holy water he said softly and his fingers dipped in the bowl as he went past in a kind of reflex action it had a sort of charm and somewhere in the dim past somebody had obviously spent a lot of money on it there was victorian stained glass and imitation medieval carvings everywhere gargoyles skulls imagination running riot scaffolding lifted in a spiders web to support the nave at the altar end and it was very dark except for the sanctuary lamp and candles flickering before the virgin the girl was seated at the organ behind the choir stalls she started to play softly just a few tentative chords at first and then as fallon started to walk down the centre aisle she moved into the opening of the bach prelude and fugue in d major and she was good he stood at the bottom of the steps listening then started up she stopped at once and swung round is anyone there tm sorry if i disturbed you he told her i was enjoying listening there was that slight uncertain smile on her face again she seemed to be waiting so he carried on if i might make a suggestion you play the organ yes i do look that trumpet stop is a reed unreliable at the best of times but in a damp atmosphere like this he shrugged its so badly out of tune its putting everything else out id leave it in if i were you why thank you she said ill try that she turned back to the organ and fallon went down the steps to the rear of the church and sat in a pew in the darkest corner he could find she played the prelude and fugue right through and he sat there eyes dosed arms folded and his original judgment still stood she was good certainly worth listening to when she finished after half an hour or so she gathered up her things and came down the steps she paused at the bottom and waited perhaps sensing that he was still there but he made no sign and after a moment she went into the sacristy and in the darkness at the back of the church fallon sat waiting miller father da costa was just finishing his second cup of tea in the cemetery superintendents office when there was a knock at the door and a young police constable came in sorry to bother you again father but mr miller would like a word with you father da costa stood up mr miller he said detectivesuperintendent miller sir hes head of the cid it was still raining heavily when they went outside the forecourt was crammed with police vehicles and as they walked along the narrow path there seemed to be police everywhere moving through die rhododendron bushes the body was exactly where he had left it although it was now partially covered with a groundsheet a man in an overcoat knelt on one knee beside it making some sort of preliminary examination he was speaking in a low voice into a portable dictaphone and what looked like a doctors bag was open on the ground beside him there were police here everywhere too in uniform and out several of them were taking careful measurements with tapes the others were searching the ground area the young detectiveinspector who had his statement was called fitzgerald he was standing to one side talking to a tall thin rather scholarlylooking man in a belted raincoat when he saw da costa he came across at once there you are father this is detectivesuperintendent miller miller shook hands he had a thin face and patient brown eyes just now he looked very tired he said a bad business father it is indeed da costa said as you can see were going through the usual motions and professor lawlor here is making a preliminary report hell do an autopsy this afternoon on the other hand because of the way it happened youre obviously the key to the whole affair if i might ask you a few more questions anything i can do of course but i can assure you that inspector fitzgerald was most efficient i dont think there can be anything he overlooked fitzgerald looked suitably modest and miller smiled father ive been a policeman for nearly twentyfive years and if ive learned one thing its that theres always something and its usually that something which wins cases professor lawlor stood up ive finished here nick he said you can move him he turned to da costa you said if i got it right from fitzgerald that he was down on his right knee at the edge of the grave he walked across about here thats correct lawlor turned to miller it fits he must have glanced up at the crucial moment and his head would naturally be turned to the right the entry wound is about an inch above the outer corner of the left eye anything else interesting miller asked not really entry wound a quarter of an inch in diameter very little bleeding no powder marking no staining exterior wound two inches in diameter explosive type with disruptions of the table of the skull and lacerations of the right occipital lobe of the brain the wound is two inches to the right of the exterior occipital protuberance thank you doctor adare miller said professor lawlor turned to father da costa and smiled you see father medicine has its jargon too just like the church what im really trying to say is that he was shot through the skull at close quarters but not too close he picked up his bag the bullet shouldnt be too far away or whats left of it he said as he walked off thank you for reminding me miller called ironically fitzgerald had crossed to the doorway and now he came back shaking his head theyre making a plaster cast of those footprints but were wasting our time he was wearing galoshes another thing weve been over the appropriate area with a tooth comb and there isnt a sign of a cartridge case miller frowned and turned to da costa youre certain he was using a silencer absolutely you seem very sure as a young man i was lieutenant in the special air service superintendent da costa told him calmly the aegean islands yugoslavia that sort of thing im afraid i had to use a silenced pistol myself on more than one occasion miller and fitzgerald glanced at each other in surprise and then father da costa saw it all in a flash of blinding light but of course he said its impossible to use a silencer with a revolver it has to be an automatic pistol which means the cartridge case would have been ejected he crossed to the doorway let me see the pistol was in his right hand so the cartridge case should be somewhere about here exactly miller said only we cant find it and then da costa remembered he dropped to one knee and picked something up just before he left miller turned to fitzgerald who looked chagrined which wasnt in your report my fault superintendent da costa said i didnt tell him it slipped my mind as i said father theres always something miller took out a pipe and started to fill it from a worn leather pouch i know one thing this mans no runofthemill tear away hes a professional right down to his fingertips and thats good i dont understand father da costa said because there arent many of that calibre about father its as simple as that let me explain about six months ago somebody got away with nearly a quarter of a million from a local bank took all weekend to get into the vault a beautiful jobtoo beautiful you see we knew straight away that there were no more than five or six men in the country capable of that level of craftsmanship and three of them were in jail the rest was purely a matter of mathematics i see da costa said now take my unknown friend i know a hell of a lot about him already hes an exceptionally clever man because that priests disguise was a touch of genius most people think in stereotypes if i ask them if they saw anyone theyll say no if i press them theyll remember they saw a postman or as in this case a priest if i ask them what he looked like were in trouble because all they can remember is that he looked like a priest any priest i saw his face da costa said quite clearly i only hope youll be as certain if you see a photo of him dressed differently miller frowned yes he knew what he was doing all right galoshes to hide his normal footprints probably a couple of sizes too large and a crack shot most people couldnt hit a barn door with a handgun at twelve feet he only needed one shot and thats going some believe me and considerable nerve father da costa said he didnt forget to pick up that cartridge case remember in spite of the fact that i had appeared on the scene we ought to have you in the department father miller turned to fitzgerald you carry on here ill take father da costa down town da costa glanced at his watch it was twelvefifteen and he said quickly im sorry superintendent but that isnt possible i hear confessions at one oclock and my niece was expecting me for lunch at twelve shell be worried miller took it quite well i see and when will you be free officially at onethirty it depends of course on the number of customers exactly miller nodded goodhumouredly all right father ill pick you up at two oclock will that be all right i should imagine so da costa said til walk you to you car the rain had slackened just a little as they went along the path through the rhododendron bushes miller yawned several times and rubbed his eyes father da costa said you look tired superintendent i didnt get much sleep last night a car salesman on one of the new housing estates cut his wifes throat with a bread knife then picked up the phone and dialed nineninenine a nice straightforward job but i still had to turn out personally murders important i was in bed again by nine oclock and then they rang through about this little lot you must lead a strange life da costa said what does your wife think about it she doesnt she died last year tm sorry im not she had cancer of the bowel miller told him calmly then frowned slightly sorry i know you dont look at things that way in your church father da costa didnt reply to that one because it struck him with stapling suddenness that in millers position he would have very probably felt the same way they reached his car an old grey mini van in front of the chapel and miller held the door open for him as he got in da costa leaned out of the window you think youll get him superintendent youre confident til get him all right father miller said grimly ive got to if im to get the man i really want the man behind him the man who set this job up i see and you already know who that is td put my pension on it father da costa switched on the ignition and the engine rattled noisily into life one thing still bothers me he said whats that father this man youre looking for the killer if hes as much a professional as you say then why didnt he kill me when he had the chance exactly miller said which is why it bothers me too see you later father he stood back as the priest drove away and fitzgerald appeared round the comer of the chapel quite a man he said miller nodded find out everything you can about him and i mean everything ill expect to hear from you by a quarter to two he turned on the astonished fitzgerald it should be easy enough for you youre a practising catholic arent you and a knight of st columbia or whatever you call it or is that just a front for the ira it damn well isnt fitzgerald told him indignantly good try the cemetery superintendent first and then theres the cathedral they should be able to help theyll talk to you he put a match to his pipe and fitzgerald said despairingly but why for gods sake because another thing ive learned after twentyfive years of being a copper is never to take anything or anyone at face value miller told him he walked across to his car climbed in nodded to the driver and leaned back by the time they reached the main road he was already asleep confessional anna da costa was playing the piano in the living room of the old presbytery when father da costa entered she swung round on the piano stool at once and stood up enter michael youre late what happened he kissed her cheek and led her to a chair by the window youll hear soon enough so i might as well tell you now a man was murdered this morning at the cemetery she gazed up at him blankly those beautiful useless dark eyes fixed on some point beyond and there was a complete lack of comprehension on her face murdered i dont understand he sat down beside her and took both her hands in his i saw it anna i was the only witness he got up and started to pace up and down the room i was walking through the old part of the cemetery remember i took you there last month he described what had happened in detail as much for himself as for her because for some reason it seemed suddenly necessary and he didnt shoot me anna he said thats the strangest thing of all i just dont understand it it doesnt make any kind of sense she shuddered deeply oh uncle michael its a miracle youre here at all she held out her hands and he took them again conscious of a sudden overwhelming tenderness it occurred to him and not for the first time that in some ways she was the one creature he truly loved in the whole world which was a great sin for a priests love after all should be available to all but then she was his dead brothers only child an orphan since her fifteenth year the clock struck one and he patted her head til have to go im already late i made sandwiches she said theyre in the kitchen til have them when i get back he said i wont have much time im being picked up by a detectivesuperintendent called miller at two oclock he wants me to look through some photos to see if i can recognise the man i saw if hes early give him a cup of tea or something the door banged it was suddenly very quiet she sat there thoroughly bewildered by it all unable to comprehend what he had told her she was a quiet girl she knew little of life her childhood had been spent in special schools for the blind after the death of her parents music college and then uncle michael had returned and for the first time in years she had somebody to care about again who cared about her but as always there was solace in her music and she turned back to the piano feeling expertly through the braille music transcripts for the chopin prelude she was working on it wasnt there she frowned in bewilderment and then suddenly remembered going across to the church earlier to play the organ and the stranger whod spoken to her she must have left the piece she wanted over there with her organ transcripts she went out into the hall found a raincoat and a walking stick and let herself out of the front door it was still raining hard as father da costa hurried through the churchyard and unlocked the small door which led directly into the sacristy he put on his alb threw a violet stole over his shoulder and went to hear confession he was late not that it mattered very much few people came at that time of day perhaps the odd shopper or office worker who found the old church convenient on some days he waited the statutory half an hour and no one came at all the church was cold and smelt of damp which wasnt particularly surprising as he could no longer meet the heating bill a young woman was just lighting another candle in front of the virgin and as he moved past he was aware of at least two other people sitting waiting by the confessional box he went inside murmured a short prayer and settled himself the prayer hadnt helped mainly because his mind was still in a turmoil obsessed with what he had seen at the cemetery the door clicked on the other side of the screen and a woman started to speak middleaged from the sound of her he hastily forced himself back to reality and listened to what she had to say it was nothing very much sins of omission in the main some minor dishonesty concerning a grocery bill a few petty lies the next was a young woman presumably the one he had seen lighting the candle to the virgin she started hesitantly trivial matters on the whole anger impure thoughts lies and she hadnt been to mass for three months is that all he prompted her in the silence it wasnt of course and out it came an affair with her employer a married man how long has this been going on da costa asked her for three months father the exact period since she had last been to mass this man has made love to you yes father how often two or three times a week at the office when everyone else has gone home there was a confidence in her voice now a calmness of course bringing things out into the open often made people feel like that but this was different he has children three father there was a pause what can i do the answer is so obvious must be leave this place find another job put him out of your mind i cant do that why he said and added with calculated brutality because you enjoy it yes father she said simply and youre not prepared to stop i cant for the first time she cracked just a little but there was panic there now then why have you come here i havent been to mass in three months father he saw it all then and it was really so beautifully simple so pitifully human i see he said you cant do without god either she started to cry quietly this is a waste of time father because i cant say i wont go with him again when i know damn well my body will betray me every time i see him god knows that if i said any different id be lying to him as well as you and i couldnt do that how many people were that close to god father da costa was filled with a sense of incredible wonder he took a deep breath to hold back the lump that rose in his throat and threatened to choke him he said in a firm clear voice may our lord jesus christ absolve you and i by his authority absolve you from every bond of excommunication and interdict so far as i can and you have need therefore i absolve you from your sins in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit there was silence for a moment and then she said but i cant promise i wont see him again im not asking you to da costa said if you feel you owe me anything find another job thats all i ask well leave the rest up to god there was the longest pause of all now and he waited desperately anxious for the right answer aware of an unutterable sense of relief when it came very well father i promise good evening mass is at six oclock i never get more than fifteen or twenty people youll be very welcome the door clicked shut as she went and he sat there feeling suddenly drained with any luck hed said the right thing handled it the right way only time would tell it was a change to feel useful again the door clicked there was the scrape of the chair being moved on the other side of the grille please bless me father it was an unfamiliar voice soft irish an educated man without a doubt father da costa said may our lord jesus bless you and help you to tell your sins there was a pause before the man said father are there any circumstances under which what i say to you now could be passed on to anyone else da costa straightened in his cloak none whatsoever the secrets of the confessional are inviolate good the man said then id better get it over with i killed a man this morning father da costa was stunned killed a man he whispered murdered you mean exactly with a sudden terrible premonition da costa reached forward trying to peer through the grille on the other side a match flared in the darkness and for the second time that day he looked into the face of martin fallon the church was still when anna da costa came out of the sacristy and crossed to the choir stalls the braille transcripts were where she had left them she found what she was looking for with no difficulty she put the rest back on the stand and sat there for a few moments remembering the stranger with the soft irish voice hed been right about the trumpet stop she put out a hand and touched it gently one thing putting everything else out of joint how strange she reached for her walking stick and stood up and somewhere below her in the body of the church a door banged and her uncles voice was raised in anger she froze standing perfectly still concealed by the green curtains which hung beside the organ father da costa erupted from the confessional box flinging the door wide she had never heard such anger in his voice before come out come out damn you and look me in the face if you dare i anna heard the other door in the confessional box click open there was the softest of footfalls and then a quiet voice said here we are again then father fallon stood beside the box hands in the pockets of the navy blue trench coat father da costa moved closer his voice a hoarse whisper are you a catholic as ever was father there was a light mocking note in fallons voice then you must know that i cannot possibly grant you absolution in this matter you murdered a man in cold blood this morning i saw you do it we both know that he drew himself up what do you want with me ive already got it father as you said the secrets of the confessional are inviolate that makes what i told you privileged information there was an agony in father da costas voice that cut into annas heart like a knife you used me i he cried in the worst possible way youve used this church i could have closed your mouth by putting a bullet between your eyes would you have preferred that in some ways i think i would father da costa had control of himself again now he said what is your name fallon martin fallon is that genuine names with me are like the book of the month always changing im not wanted as fallon lets put it that way i see father da costa said an interesting choice i once knew a priest of that name do you know what it means in irish of course stranger from outside the campfire and you consider that appropriate i dont follow you i mean is that how you see yourself as some romantic desperado outside the crowd fallon showed no emotion whatsoever ill go now you wont see me again he turned to leave and father da costa caught him by the arm the man who paid you to do what you did this morning fallon does he know about me fallon stared at him for a long moment frowning slightly and then he smiled youve nothing to worry about its taken care of for such a clever man you really are very foolish father da costa told him the door at the main entrance banged open in the wind an old woman in a headscarf entered she dipped her fingers in the holy water genuflected and came up the aisle father da costa took fallons arm firmly we cant talk here come with me at one side of the nave there was an electric cage hoist obviously used by workmen for access to the tower he pushed fallon inside and pressed the button the cage rose through the network of scaffolding passing through a hole in the roof it finally jerked to a halt and da costa opened the gate and led the way out on to a catwalk supported by scaffolding that encircled the top of the tower like a ships bridge what happened here fallon asked we ran out of money father da costa told him and led the way along the catwalk in the rain neither of them heard the slight whirring of the electric motor as the cage dropped back to the church below when it reached ground level anna da costa entered closed the gate and fumbled for the button the view of the city from the catwalk was magnificent although the grey curtain of the rain made things hazy in the middle distance fallon gazed about him with obvious pleasure he had changed in some supple indefinable way and smiled slightly now this i like earth hath not anything to show more fair isnt that what the poet saidp great god in heaven i bring you up here to talk seriously and you quote wordsworth to me doesnt anything touch you at all not that i can think of fallon took out a packet of cigarettes to you use these father da costa hesitated then took one angrily yes i will damn you thats it father enjoy yourself while you can fallon said as he struck a match and gave him a light after all were all going to hell the same way you actually believe that from what ive seen of life it would seem a reasonable conclusion to me fallon leaned on the rail smoking his cigarette and father da costa watched him for a moment feeling strangely helpless there was obvious intelligence here breeding strength of character all the qualities and yet it seemed impossible to reach through and touch the man in any way youre not a practising catholic he said at last fallon shook his head not for a long time can i ask why no fallon told him calmly father da costa tried again confession fallon is a sacrament a sacrament of reconciliation he suddenly felt rather silly because this was beginning to sound dangerously like one of his confirmation classes at the local catholic school but he pressed on when we go to confession we meet jesus who takes us to himself and because we are in him and because we are sorry god our father forgives us im not asking for any forgiveness fallon said not from anybody no man can damn himself for all eternity in this way father da costa said sternly he has not the right just in case you hadnt heard the man i shot was called krasko and he was the original thing from under a stone pimp whoremaster drugpusher you name it he had a finger in it and you want me to say sorry for him then he was the laws concern the law fallon laughed harshly men like him are above the law hes been safe for years behind a triple wall of money corruption and lawyers by any kind of logic id say ive done society a favour for thirty pieces of silver oh more than that father much more fallon told him dont worry ill put something in the poor box on the way out i can afford it he flicked his cigarette out into space til be going now he turned and father da costa grabbed him by the sleeve pulling him round youre making a mistake fallon i think youll find that god wont let you have it your way fallon said coldly dont be stupid father in fact hes already taken a hand father da costa continued do you think i was there in that cemetery at that particular moment by accident he shook his head oh no fallon you took one life but god has made you responsible for another mine fallons face was very pale now he took a step back turned and walked towards the hoist without a word as he drew abreast of a buttress some slight noise caused him to look to his left and he saw anna da costa hiding behind it he drew her out gently but in spite of that fact she cried out in fear fallon said softly its all right i promise you father da costa hurried forward and pulled her away from him leave her alone anna started to weep softly as he held her in his arms fallon stood looking at them a slight frown on his face perhaps shes heard more than was good for her father da costa held anna away from him a little and looked down at her is that so she nodded whispering i was in the church she turned reaching out her hands feeling her way to fallon what kind of man are you one hand found his face as he stood there as if turned to stone she drew back hastily as if stung and da costa put a protective arm about her again leave us i she whispered hoarsely to fallon til say nothing of what i heard to anyone i promise only go away and dont come back please i there was a passionate entreaty in her voice father da costa held her close again and fallon said does she mean it she said didnt she father da costa told him we take your guilt on our souls fallon now get out of here fallon showed no emotion at all he turned and walked to the hoist as he opened the gate da costa called two of us now fallon two lives to be responsible for are you up to that fallon stood there for a long moment a hand on the open gate finally he said softly it will be all right i gave you my word my own life on it if youlike he stepped into the hoist and closed the gate there was the gentle whirring of the electric motor a dull echo from below as the cage reached the ground floor anna looked up hes gone she whispered father da costa nodded its all right now he was in the church earlier she said he told me what was wrong with the organ isnt that the strangest thing the organ da costa stared down at her in bewilderment and then he sighed shaking his head and turned her gently round come on now ill take you home youll catch your death they stood at the cage waiting for the gate to come up after he had pressed the button anna said slowly what are we going to do uncle michael about martin fallon he put an arm about her shoulder for the moment nothing what he told me in the church spilled over from the confessional box because of my anger and impatience so that what you overheard was still strictly part of that original confession im afraid i cant look at it in any other way he sighed im sorry anna i know this must be an intolerable burden for you but i must ask you to give me your promise not to speak of this to anyone but i already have she said to him a strange thing to say and it troubled him deeply as the cage arrived and they moved inside and made the quick descent to the church alone in his study he did a thing he seldom did so early in the day and poured himself a glass of whisky he sipped it slowly and stood one hand on the marble mantelpiece and stared down into the flames of the small coal fire and what do we do now michael he asked himself softly it was an old habit this carrying on a conversation with his inner self a relic of three years of solitary confinement in a chinese prison cell in north korea useful in any situation where he needed to be a objective as possible about some close personal problem but then in a sense this wasnt his problem it was fallons he saw that suddenly with stapling clarity his own situation was such that his hands were tied there was little that he could do or say the next move would have to be fallons there was a knock at the door and anna appeared superintendent miller to see you uncle michael miller moved into the room hat in hand there you are superintendent da costa said have you met my niece he made a formal introduction anna was remarkably controlled in fact she showed no nervousness at all which surprised him til leave you to it she hesitated the door halfopen youll be going out then not just yet father da costa told her miller frowned but i dont understand father i thought a moment please superintendent father da costa said and glanced at anna she went out closing the door softly and he turned again to miller you were saying our arrangement was that you were to come down to the department to look at some photos miller said i know superintendent but that wont be possible now may i ask why not father miller demanded father da costa had given considerable thought to his answer yet in the end could manage nothing more original than tm afraid i wouldnt be able to help you thats all miller was genuinely puzled and showed it lets start again father perhaps you didnt understand me properly all i want you to do is to come down to the department to look at some photos in the hope that you might recognise our friend of this morning i know all that father da costa told him and you still refuse to come there wouldnt be any point щwhy not because i cant help you for a moment miller genuinely thought he was going out of his mind this couldnt be happening it just didnt make any kind of sense and then he was struck by a sudden dreadful suspicion has meehan been getting at you in some way meehan father da costa said his genuine bewilderment so perfectly obvious that miller immediately dropped the whole idea i could have you brought in formally father as a material witness you can take a horse to water but you cant make him drink superintendent i can have a damn good try miller told him grimly he walked to the door and opened it dont make me take you in formally sir id rather not but i will if i have to superintendent miller father da costa said softly men of a harsher disposition than you have tried to make me speak in circumstances where it was not appropriate they did not succeed and neither will you i can assure you no power on earth can make me speak on this matter if i do not wish to well see about that sir ill give you some time to think this matter over then ill be back he was about to walk out when a sudden wild thought struck him and he turned slowly have you seen him again sir since this morning have you been threatened is your life in any kind of danger goodbye superintendent father da costa said the front door banged father da costa turned to finish his whisky and anna moved silently into the room she put a hand on his arm hell go to monsignor ohalloran the bishop being at present in rome that would seem the obvious thing to do he said hadnt you better get there first i suppose so he emptied his glass and put it on the mantelpiece what about you i want to do some more organ practice ill be all right she pushed him out into the hall and reached for his coat from the stand with unerring aim what would i do without you he said she smiled cheerfully goodness knows hurry back he went out she closed the door after him when she turned the smile had completely disappeared she went back into his study sat down by the fire and buried her face in her hands nick miller had been a policeman for almost a quarter of a century twentyfive years of working a threeshift system of being disliked by his neighbours of being able to spend only one weekend in seven at home with his family and the consequent effect upon his relationship with his son and daughter he had little formal education but he was a shrewd clever man with the ability to cut through to the heart of things and this coupled with an extensive knowledge of human nature gained from a thousand long hard saturday nights on the town had made him a good policeman he had no conscious thought or even desire to help society his job was in the main to catch thieves and society consisted of the civilians who sometimes got mixed up in the constant state of guerrilla warfare which existed between the police and the criminal if anything he preferred the criminal at least you knew where you were with him but dandy jack meehan was different one corruption was all corruption hed read that somewhere and if it applied to any human being it applied to meehan miller loathed him with the kind of obsessive hate that was in the end selfdestructive to be precise ten years of his life had gone to dandy jack without the slightest hint of success meehan had to be behind the krasko killing that was a fact of life the rivalry between the two men had been common knowledge for at least two years for the firs time in god knows how long hed had a chance and now the priest when he got into the rear of the car he was shaking with anger and on a sudden impulse he leaned across and told his driver to take him to the headquarters of meehans funeral business then he sat back and tried to light his pipe with trembling fingers dandy jack pauls square was a green lung in the heart of the city an acre of grass and flowerbeds and willow trees with a fountain in the centre surrounded on all four sides by georgian terrace houses most of which were used as offices by barristers solicitors or doctors and beautifully preserved there was a general atmosphere of quiet dignity and medians funeral business fitted in perfectly three houses on the north side had been converted to provide every possible facility from a flower shop to a chapel of rest a mews entrance to one side gave access to a car park and garage area at the rear surrounded by high walls so that business could be handled as quietly and as unobtrusively as possible a facility which had other uses on occasion when the big bentley hearse turned into the car park shortly after one oclock meehan was sitting up front with the chauffeur and billy he wore his usual doublebreasted melton overcoat and homburg hat and a black tie for he had been officiating personally at a funeral that morning the chauffeur came round to open the door and meehan got out followed by his brother thanks donner he said a small grey whippet was drinking from a dish at the rear entrance billy called here tommy it turned hurled itself across the yard and jumped into his arms billy fondled its ears and it licked his face frantically now then you little bastard he said with genuine affection ive told you before meehan said hell ruin your coat hairs all over the bloody place as he moved towards the rear entrance varley came out of the garage and stood waiting for him cap in hand a muscle twitched nervously in his right cheek his forehead was beaded with sweat he seemed almost on the point of collapse meehan paused hands in pockets and looked him over calmly you look awful charlie you been a bad lad or something not me mr meehan varley said its that sod fallon heї not here charlie meehan said softly i always like to hear bad news in private he nodded to dormer who opened the rear door and stood to one side meehan went into what was usually referred to as the receivingroom it was empty except for a coffin on a trolley in the centre he put a cigarette in his mouth and bent down to read the brass nameplate on the coffin whens this for dormer moved to his side a lighter ready in his hand threethirty mr meehan he spoke with an australian accent and had a slightly twisted mouth the scar still plain where a hair lip had been cured by plastic surgery it gave him a curiously repellent appearance modified to a certain extent by the handtailored dark uniform suit he wore is it a cremation donner shook his head a burial mr meehan meehan nodded all right you and bonati better handle it ive an idea im going to be busy he turned one arm on the coffin billy leaned against the wall fondling the whippet varley waited in the centre of the room cap in hand the expression on his face that of a condemned man waiting for the trap to open beneath his feet at any moment and plunge him into eternity all right charlie meehan said tell me the worst varley told him the words falling over themselves in his eagerness to get them out when he had finished there was a lengthy silence meehan had shown no emotion at all so hes coming here at two oclock thats what he said mr meehan and the van you took it to the wreckers yard like i told you saw it go into the crusher myself just like you said varley waited for his sentence face damp with sweat meehan smiled suddenly and patted him on the cheek you did well charlie not your fault things went wrong leave it to me ill handle it relief seemed to ooze out of varley like dirty water he said weakly thanks mr meehan i did my best honest i did you know me you have something to eat meehan said then get back to the car wash if i need you ill send for you varley went out the door closed billy giggled as he fondled the whippets ears i told you he was trouble we could have handled it ourselves only you wouldnt listen meehan grabbed him by the long white hair the boy cried out in pain dropping the dog do you want me to get nasty billy he said softly is that what you want i didnt mean any harm jack the boy whined meehan shoved him away then be a good boy tell bonari i want him then take one of the cars and go and get fat albert billys tongue flicked nervously between his lips albert he whispered for gods sake jack you know i cant stand being anywhere near that big creep he frightens me to death thats good meehan said til remember that next time you step out of line well call albert in to take you in hand he laughed harshly would you like that billys eyes were wide with fear no please jack he whispered not albert be a good lad then meehan patted his face and opened the door on your way billy went out and meehan turned to donner with a sigh i dont know what im going to do with him frank i dont really hes young mr meehan all he can think about is birds meehan said dirty little tarts in mini skirts showing all theyve got he shivered in genuine disgust i even found him having it off with the cleaning woman one afternoon fiftyfive if she was a day and on my bed donner kept a diplomatic silence and meehan opened an inner door and led the way through into the chapel of rest the atmosphere was cool and fresh thanks to airconditioning and scented with flowers taped organ music provided a suitably devotional background there were halfadozen cubicles on either side meehan took off his hat and stepped into the first one there were flowers everywhere and an oak coffin stood on a draped trolley whos this that young girl the student who went through the windscreen of the sports car donner told him oh yes meehan said i did her myself he lifted the face cloth the girl was perhaps eighteen or nineteen eyes closed lips slightly parted the face so skillfully made up that she might only have been sleeping you did a good job there mr meehan donner said meehan nodded complacently ive got to agree with you there frank you know something there was no flesh left on her left cheek when she came to me that girls face was mincemeat im telling you youre an artist mr meehan donner said genuine admiration in his voice a real artist its the only word for it its nice of you to say so frank i really appreciate that meehan switched off the light and led the way out i always try to do my best of course but a case like that a young girl well you got to think of the parents too true mr meehan they moved out of the chapel area into the front hall the original georgian features still beautifully preserved blue and white wedgwood plaques on the walls there was a glass door leading to the reception office on the right as they approached they could hear voices and someone appeared to be crying the door opened and a very old woman appeared sobbing heavily she wore a headscarf and a shabby woolen overcoat bursting at the seams she had a carrier bag over one arm and clutched a worn leather purse in her left hand her face was swollen with weeping henry ainsley the reception clerk moved out after her he was a tall thin man with hollow cheeks and sly furtive eyes he wore a neat clericalgrey suit and sober tie and his hands were soft im sorry madam he was saying sharply but thats the way it is anyway you can leave everything in our hands from now on thats the way what is meehan said advancing on them he put his hands on the old ladys shoulders we cant have this love whats up its all right mr meehan the old lady was just a bit upset shes just lost her husband ainsley said meehan ignored him and drew the old lady into the office he put her in a chair by the desk now then love you tell me all about it he took her hand and she held on tight ninety he was i thought hed last for ever and then i found him at the bottom of the stairs when i got back from chapel sunday night tears streamed down her face he was that strong even at that age i couldnt believe it i know love and now youve come here to bury him she nodded i dont have much but i didnt want him to have a state funeral i wanted it done right i thought i could manage nicely what the insurance money and then this gentleman here he told me id need seventy pound now look mr meehan it was like this ainsley cut in meehan turned and glanced at him bleakly ainsley faltered into silence meehan said you paid cash love oh yes she said i called at the insurance office on the way and they paid me out on the policy fifty pounds i thought it would be enough and the other twenty i had twentyfive pounds in the post office i see median straightened show me the file he said ainsley stumbled to the desk and picked up a small sheaf of papers which shook a little as he held them out meehan leafed through them he smiled delightedly and put a hand on the old womans shoulders ive got good news for you love theres been a mistake a mistake she said he took out his wallet and extracted twentyfive pounds mr ainsley was forgetting about the special rate weve been offering to old age pensioners this autumn she looked at the money a dazed expression on her face special rate here it wont be a state funeral will it i wouldnt want that meehan helped her to her feet not on your life private the best i guarantee it now lets go and see about your flowers flowers she said oh that would be nice he loved flowers did my bill all included love meehan glanced over his shoulder at dormer keep him here ill be back a door bad been cut through the opposite wall giving access to the flower shop next door when meehan ushered the old lady in they were immediately approached by a tall willowy young man with shoulderlength dark hair and a beautiful mouth yes mr meehan can i be of service he spoke with a slight lisp meehan patted his cheek you certainly can rupert help this good lady choose a bunch of flowers best in the shop and a wreath on the firm of course rupert accepted the situation without the slightest question certainly mr meehan and rupert see one of the lads runs her home afterwards he turned to the old lady all right love she reached up and kissed his cheek youre a good man a wonderful man god bless you he does my love dandy jack meehan told her every day of my life and he walked out death is something youve got to have some respect for meehan said i mean this old lady according to the form shes filled in shes eightythree i mean thats a wonderful thing he was sitting in the swing chair in front of the desk henry ainsley stood in front of him donner was by the door ainsley stirred uneasily and forced a smile yes i see what you mean mr meehan do you henry i wonder there was a knock at the door and a small dapper man in belted continental raincoat entered he looked like a southern italian but spoke with a south yorkshire accent you wanted me mr meehan thats it bonati come in meehan returned to ainsley yes i really wonder about you henry now the way i see it this was an insurance job shes strictly working class the policy pays fifty and you price the job at seventy and the old dear coughs up because she cant stand the thought of her bill having a state funeral he shook his head you gave her a receipt for fifty which shes too tired and old to notice and you enter fifty in the cash book ainsley was shaking like a leaf please mr meehan please listen ive had certain difficulties lately meehan stood up has he been brought in her husband ainsley nodded this morning hes in number three he hasnt been prepared yet bring him along meehan told donner and walked out he went into cubicle number three in the chapel of rest and switched on the light and the others followed him in the old man was laying in an open coffin with a sheet over him and meehan pulled it away he was quite naked and had obviously been a remarkably powerful man in his day with the shoulders and chest of a heavyweight wrestler meehan looked at him in awe he was a bull this one and no mistake look at the dick on him he turned to ainsley think of the women he pleasured think of that old lady by god i can see why she loved him he was a man this old lad his knee came up savagely henry ainsley grabbed for his privates too late and he pitched forward with a choked cry take him up to the coffin room meehan told dormer til join you in five minutes when henry ainsley regained his senses he was lying flat on his back arms outstretched donner standing on one hand bonati on the other the door opened and meehan entered he stood looking down at him for a moment then nodded all right pick him up the room was used to store coffins which werent actually made on the premises but there were a couple of workbenches and a selection of carpenters tools on a rack on the wall please mr meehan ainsley begged him meehan nodded to donner and bonati dragged ainsley back across one of the workbenches arms outstretched palms uppermost meehan stood over him im going to teach you a lesson henry not because you tried to fiddle me out of twenty quid thats one thing thats definitely not allowed but its more than that you see im thinking of that old girl shes never had a thing in her life all she ever got was screwed into the ground his eyes were smoking now and there was a slightly dreamy quality to his voice she reminded me of my old mum i dont know why but i know one thing shes earned some respect just like her old fellas earned something better than a state funeral youve got it wrong mr meehan ainsley gabbled no henry youre the one who got it wrong meehan selected two bradawls from the rack on the wall he tested the point of one on his thumb then drove it through the centre of kinsleys right palm pinning his hand to the bench when he repeated the process with the other hand ainsley fainted meehan turned to donner five minutes then release him and tell him if he isnt in the office on time in the morning ill have his balls all right mr meehan donner said what about fallon til be in the preparation room ive got some embalming to do when fallon comes keep him in the office till ive had a chance to get up to the flat then bring him up and i want albert up there as soon as he comes in kid glove treatment mr meehan what else frank what else meehan smiled patted the unconscious ainsley on the cheek and walked out the preparation room was on the other side of the chapel of rest and when meehan went in he dosed the door he liked to be alone on such occasions it aided concentration and made the whole thing somehow much more personal a body waited for him on the table in the centre of the room covered with a sheet beside it on a trolley the tools of his trade were laid out nearly on a white cloth scalpels scissors forceps surgical needles of various sizes artery tubes a large rubber bulb syringe and a glass jar containing a couple of gallons of embalming fluid on a shelf underneath was an assortment of cosmetics makeup creams and face powders all made to order he pulled away the sheet and folded it nearly the body was that of a woman of forty handsome darkhaired he remembered the case a history of heart trouble shed died in midsentence while discussing plans for christmas with her husband there was still that look of faint surprise on her face that many people show in death jaw dropped mouth gaping as if in amazement that this should be happening to her of all people meehan took a long curved needle and skillfully passed a thread from behind the lower lip up through the nasal septum and down again so that when he tightened the thread and tied it off the jaw was raised the eyeballs had fallen into their sockets he compensated for that by inserting a circle of cotton wool under each eyelid before closing it and cotton wool between the lips and gums and in the cheeks to give a fuller more natural appearance all this he did with total absorption whistling softly between his teeth a frown of concentration on his face his anger at ainsley had disappeared totally even fallon had ceased to exist he smeared a little cream on the cold lips with one finger stood back and nodded in satisfaction he was now ready to start the embalming process the body weighed nine and a half stones which meant that he needed about eleven pints of fluid of the mixture he habitually used formaldehyde glycerin borax with a little phenol added and some sodium citrate as an anticoagulant it was a simple enough case with little likelihood of complications so he decided to start with the axillary artery as usual he extended the left arm at right angles to the body the elbow supported on a wooden block reached for a scalpel and made his first incision halfway between the midpoint of the collarbone and the bend of the elbow it was perhaps an hour later as he tied off the last stitch that he became aware of some sort of disturbance outside voices were raised in anger and then the door flew open meehan glanced over his shoulder miller was standing there billy tried to squeeze past him i tried to stop him jack make some tea meehan told him tm thirsty and close that door youll ruin the temperature in here how many times have i told you billy retired the door dosing softly behind him and meehan turned back to the body he reached for a jar of foundation cream and started to rub some into the face of the dead woman with infinite gentleness ignoring miller completely miller lit a cigarette the match rasping in the silence and median said without turning round not in here inhere we show a little respect is that a fact miller replied but he still dropped the cigarette on the floor and stepped on it he approached the table meehan was now applying a medium red cream rouge to the womans cheekbones his fingers bringing her back to life by the minute miller watched for a moment in fascinated horror you really like your work dont you jack what do you want meehan asked calmly you nothing new in that is there meehan replied i mean anybody falls over and breaks a leg in this town you come to me all right miller said so well go through the motions jan krasko went up to the cemetery this morning to put flowers on his mothers grave hes been doing that for just over a year now every thursday without fail so the bastard has a heart after all why tell me at approximately ten past eleven somebody put a bullet through his skull a real pro job nice and public so everyone would get the message and what message would that be toe the meehan line or else meehan dusted the face with powder calmly i had a funeral this morning he said old marcus the draper at ten past eleven i was sitting in st saviors listening to the vicar say his piece ask billy he was with me along with around a couple of hundred other people including the mayor he had a lot of friends had old mr marcus but then he was a gentleman not many of his kind left these days he brightened the eyebrows and lashes with vaseline and coloured the lips the effect was truly remarkable the woman seemed only to sleep miller said i dont care where you were it was your killing meehan turned to face him wiping his hands on a towel prove it he said flatly all the frustration of the long years all the anger welled up in miller threatening to choke him so that he pulled at his tie wrenching open his collar til get you for this meehan he said tu lay it on you if its the last thing i do this time youve gone too far medians eyes became somehow luminous his entire personality assumed a new dimension power seemed to emanate from him like electricity you touch me he laughed coldly turned and gestured to the woman look at her miller she was dead ive given her life again and you think you can touch me miller took at involuntary step back and meehan cried go on get the hell out of it i and miller went as if all the devils in hell had been snapping at his heels it was suddenly very quiet in the preparation room meehan stood there chest heaving and then reached for the tin of vanishing cream and turned to the woman i gave you life again he whispered life he started to rub the cream firmly into the body face to face it was still raining when fallon crossed pauls square and went up the steps to the main entrance when he tried the office it was empty and then rupert appeared having noticed him arrive through the glass door of the flower shop can i help you sir fallons the name meehans expecting me oh yes sir rupert was exquisitely polite if youd like to wait in the office ill just see where he is he went out and fallon lit a cigarette and waited it was a good ten minutes before rupert reappeared til take you up now sit he said and with a flashing smile led the way out into the hall and where would up be fallon asked him mr meehans had the attics of the three houses knocked together into a penthouse suite for his personal use beautiful they reached a small lift and as rupert opened the door fallon said is this the only way theres the back stairs then the back stairs it is ruperts ready smile slipped a little now dont start to sly games ducky itll only get mr meehan annoyed which means ill end up having one hell of a night and to be perfectly frank im not in the mood id have thought youd have enjoyed every golden moment fallon said and kicked him very hard on the right shin rupert cried out and went down on one knee and fallon took the ceska out of his righthand pocket he had removed the silencer but it was still a deadlylooking item in every way rupert went white but he was game to the last hell crucify you for this nobody mixes it with jack meehan and passes the post first fallon put the ceska back in his pocket the stairs he said softly all right rupert leaned down to rub his shin its your funeral ducky the stairway started beside the entrance to the chapel of rest and they climbed three flights rupert leading the way there was a green bake door at the top and he paused a few steps below that leads directly into the kitchen fallon nodded youd better go back to minding the shop then hadnt you rupert needed no second bidding and went back down the stairs quickly fallon tried the door which opened to his touch as rupert had said a kitchen was on the other side the far door stood ajar and he could hear voices he crossed to it on tiptoe and looked into a superbly furnished lounge with broad dormer windows at either end meehan was sitting in a leather club chair a book in one hand a glass of whisky in the other billy holding the whippet stood in front of an adam fireplace in which a log fire was burning brightly dormer and bonati waited on either side of the lift whats keeping him for christs sake billy demanded the whippet jumped from his arms and darted across to the kitchen door it stood there barking and fallon moved into the lounge and crouched down to fondle its ears his right hand still in his coat pocket meehan dropped the book on the table and slapped a hand against his thigh didnt i tell you he was a hardnosed bastard he said to billy the telephone rang he picked it up listened for a moment and smiled its all right sweetheart you get back to work i can handle it he replaced the receiver that was rupert he worries about me thats nice fallon said he leaned against the wall beside the kitchen door hands in pockets donner and bonati moved in quietly and stood behind the big leather couch facing him meehan sipped a little of his whisky and held up the book it was the city of god by st augustine read this one have you fallon f a long time ago fallon reached for a cigarette with his left hand its good stuff meehan said he knew what he was talking about god and the devil good and evil they all exist and sex he emptied his glass and belched he really puts the record straight there i mean women just pump a man dry like i keep trying to tell my little brother here only he wont listen anything in a skirt he goes for you ever seen a dog after a bitch in heat with it hanging half out well thats our billy twentyfour hours a day he poured himself another whisky and fallon waited they all waited meehan stared into space no these dirty little tarts are no good to anybody and the boys are no better i mean whats happened to all the nice cleancut lads of sixteen or seventeen you used to see around these days most of them look like birds from the rear fallon said nothing there was a further silence and meehan reached for the whisky bottle again albert he called why dont you join us the bedroom door opened there was a pause and a man entered the room who was so large that he had to duck his head to come through the door he was a walking anachronism neanderthal man in a baggy grey suit and he must have weighed at least twenty stone his head was completely bald and his arms were so long that his hands almost reached his knees he shambled into the room his little pig eyes fixed on fallon billy moved out of the way nervously and albert sank into a chair on the other side of meehan next to the fire meehan said all right fallon you cocked it up you wanted krasko dead hes on a slab in the mortuary right now fallon said and the priest who saw you in action this father da costa ko problem he can identify you cant he varley says he was close enough to count the wrinkles on your face true enough fallon said but it doesnt matter ive shut his mouth you mean youve knocked him off billy demanded no need fallon turned to meehan are you a catholic meehan nodded frowning whats that got to do with it when did you last go to confession how in the hell do i know its so long ago i forget i went today fallon said thats where ive been i waited my turn at da costas one oclock confession when i went in i told him id shot krasko billy meehan said quickly but thats crazy hed seen you do it himself hadnt he but he didnt know it was me in that confessional box not until he looked through the grille and recognised me and that was after hr confessed so what for christs sake billy demanded but his brother was already waving him down his face serious i get it he said of course anything said to a priest at confessions got to be kept a secret i mean they guarantee that dont they exactly fallon said its the biggest load of cobblers ive ever heard billy said hes alive isnt he and he knows what guarantee do you have that he wont suddenly decide to shoot his mouth lets just say it isnt likely fallon said and even if he did it wouldnt matter im being shipped out from hull sunday night or have you forgotten meehan said i dont know maybe billy has a point billy couldnt find his way to the mens room unless you took him by the hand fallon told him flatly there was a dead silence meehan gazed at him impassively and albert picked a steel and brass poker out of the fireplace and bent it into a horseshoe shape between his great hands his eyes never leaving fallons face meehan chuckled unexpectedly thats good thats very good i like that he got up walked to a desk in the corner unlocked it and took out a large envelope he returned to his chair and dropped the envelope on the coffee table theres fifteen hundred quid in there he said you get another two grand on board ship sunday night plus a passport that clears the account thats very cavil of you fallon said only one thing meehan told him the priest goes fallon shook his head not a chance whats wrong with you then meehan jeered worried are you afraid the almighty might strike you down they told me you were big stuff over there fallon running round belfast shooting soldiers and blowing up kids but a priest is different is that it fallon said in what was little more than a whisper nothing happens to the priest thats the way i want it thats the way its going to be the way you want it meehan said and the anger was beginning to break through now albert tossed the poker into the fireplace and stood up he spoke in a rough hoarse voice which arm shall i break first mr meehan his left or his right f fallon pulled out the ceska and fired instantly the bullet splintered alberts right kneecap and he went back over the chair he lay there cursing clutching his knee with both hands blood pumping between his fingers for a moment nobody moved and then meehan laughed out loud didnt i tell you he was beautiful he said to billy fallon picked up the envelope and stowed it away in his raincoat he backed into the kitchen without a word kicked the door shut as meehan called out to him and started down the stairs in the lounge meehan grabbed his coat and made for the lift come on billy i as he got the door open donner called what about albert call that pakistani doctor the one who was struck off hell fix him up as the lift dropped to the ground floor billy said look what are we up to just follow me and do as youre bleeding well told meehan said he ran along the corridor through the hall and out of the front door fallon had reached the other side of the road and was taking one of the paths that led across the green centre of the square meehan called to him and ran across the road ignoring the traffic the irishman glanced over his shoulder but kept on щwalking and had reached the fountain before meehan and billy caught up with him he turned to face them his right hand in his pocket and meehan put up a hand defensively i just want to talk he dropped on to a bench seat slightly breathless and took out a handkerchief to wipe his face billy arrived a moment later just as the rain increased suddenly from a steady drizzle into a solid downpour he said this is crazy my bloody suits going to be ruined his brother ignored him and grinned up at fallon disarmingly youre hell on wheels arent you fallon there isnt a tear away in town who wouldnt run from fat albert but you he laughed uproariously you put him on sticks for six months he shouldnt have joined fallon said too bloody true but to hell with albert you were right fallon about the priest i mean fallon showed no emotion at all simply stood there watching him and meehan laughed scouts honour i wont lay a glove on him i see fallon said a change of heart exactly but it still leaves us with a problem what to do with you till that boat leaves sunday i think maybe you should go back to the farm no chance fallon said somehow i thought you might say that meehan smiled goodhumouredly still weve got to find you something he turned to billy what about jenny jenny fox couldnt she put him up i suppose so billy said sullenly a nice kid meehan told fallon shes worked for me in the past i helped her out when she was having a kid she owes me a favour shes a whore billy said so what meehan shrugged a nice safe house and not too far away billy can run you up there he smiled genially even the eyes smiled but fallon wasnt taken in for a moment on the other hand the sober truth was that he did need somewhere to stay all right he said meehan put an arm around his shoulders you couldnt do better she cooks like a dream that girl and when it comes to dropping her pants shes a little firecracker i can tell you they went back across the square and followed the mews round to the car park at the rear the whippet was crouched at the entrance shivering in the rain when billy appeared it ran to heel and followed him into the garage when he drove out in a scarlet scimitar it was sitting in the rear fallon slipped into the passenger seat and meehan dosed the door id stick pretty close to home if i were you no sense in running any needless risks at this stage is there fallon didnt say a word and billy drove away the door to the reception room opened and donner came out ive rung for that quack mr meehan what happened to fallon billys taking him up to jenny foxs place meehan said i want you to go over to the car wash and get hold of varley i want him outside jennys place within half an hour if fallon leaves he follows and phones in whenever he can i dont follow mr meehan donner was obviously mystified just till we sort things out frank meehan told him then we drop both of them him and the priest donner grinned as a great light dawned thats more like it i thought youd approve meehan smiled opened the door and went inside jenny fox was a small rather hippy girl of nineteen with good breasts high cheekbones and almondshaped eyes her straight black hair hung shoulderlength in a dark curtain and the only flaw in the general picture was the fact that she had too much makeup on when she came downstairs she was wearing a simple white blouse black pleated mini skirt and highheeled shoes and she walked with a sort of general and total movement of the whole body that most men found more than a little disturbing billy meehan waited for her at the bottom of the stairs and when she was dose enough he slipped a hand up her skirt she stiffened slightly and he shook his head a sly nasty smile on his face tights again jenny i told you i wanted you to wear stockings tm sorry billy there was fear in her eyes i didnt know youd be coming today youd better watch it hadnt you or youll be getting one of my specials she shivered slightly and he withdrew his hand what about fallon did he say anything asked me if i had a razor he could borrow who is he none of your business he shouldnt go out but if he does give jack a ring straight away and try to find out where hes going all right billy she opened the front door for him he moved in close behind her his arms about her waist she could feel his hardness pressed against her buttocks and the hatred the loathing rose like bile in her throat threatening to choke her he said softly another thing get him into bed i want to see what makes him tick and what if he wont play she said stocking tops and suspenders thats what blokes of his age go for youll manage he slapped her bottom and went out she dosed the door leaning against it for a moment struggling for breath strange how he always left her with that feeling of suffocation she went upstairs moved along the corridor and knocked softly on fallons door when she went in he was standing in front of the washbasin in the corner by the window drying his hands ill see if i can find you that razor now she said he hung the towel nearly over the rail and shook his head itll do later im going out for a while she was gripped by a sudden feeling of panic is that wise she said i mean where are you going fallon smiled as he pulled on his trench coat he ran a finger down her nose in a strangely intimate gesture that brought a lump to her throat girl dear do what you have to which i presume means ringing jack meehan to say im taking a walk but im damned if ill say where to will you be in for supper i wouldnt miss it for all the tea in china he smiled and was gone it was an oldfashioned phrase one her grandmother had used frequently she hadnt heard it in years strange how it made her want to cry when miller went into the forensic department at police headquarters he found fitzgerald in the side laboratory with johnson the ballistics specialist fitzgerald looked excited and johnson seemed reasonably complacent miller said i hear youve got something for me johnson was a slow cautious scot that just could be superintendent he picked up a reasonably misshapen piece of lead with a pair of tweezers this is what did all the damage they found it in the gravel about three yards from the body half an hour after you left sir fitzgerald put in any hope of making a weapon identification miller demanded oh ive pretty well decided that now there was a copy of small arms of the world beside johnson he flipped through it quickly found the page he was searching for and pushed it across to miller there you are there was a photo of the ceska in the top righthand corner ive never even heard of the damn thing miller said how can you be sure well ive some more tests to run but its pretty definite you see there are four factors which are constant in the same make of weapon groove and land marks on the bullet their number and width their direction which means are they twisting to the right or left and the rate of that twist once i have those facts i simply turn to a little item entitled the alas of arms and thanks to the two german gentlemen who so painstakingly put the whole thing together its possible to trace the weapon which fits without too much difficulty miller turned to fitzgerald get this information to cro at scotland yard straight away this ceskas an outoftheway gun if they feed that into the computer it might throw out a name somebody whos used one before you never know ill see you back in my office fitzgerald went out quickly and miller turned to johnson anything else let me know at once he went back to his office where he found a file on his desk containing a resum of father da costas career considering the limited amount of time fitzgerald had had it was really very comprehensive he came in as miller finished reading the file and closed it i told you he was quite a man sir you dont know the half of it miller said and proceeded to tell him what had happened at the presbytery fitzgerald was dumbfounded but it doesnt make any kind of sense you dont think hes been got at by meehan fitzgerald laughed out loud father da costa isnt the kind of man who can be got at by anybody hes the sort whos always spoken up honestly said exactly how he felt even when the person who was hurt most was himself look at his record hes a brilliant scholar two doctorates one in languages the other in philosophy and wheres it got him a dying parish in the heart of a rather unpleasant industrial city a church thats literally falling down all right im convinced miller said so he speaks up loud and clear when everyone else has the good sense to keep their mouths shut he opened the file again and hes certainly no physical coward during the war he dropped into yugoslavia by parachute three times and twice into albania dso in i wounded twice he shrugged impatiently theres got to be an explanation there must be it doesnt make any kind of sense that he should refuse to come in like this but did he actually refuse miller frowned trying to remember exactly what the priest had said no come to think of it he didnt he said there was no point to coming in as he wouldnt be able to help thats a strange way of putting it fitzgerald said youre telling me there was an even choicer item when i told him i could always get a warrant he said that no power on earth could make him speak on this matter if he didnt want to fitzgerald had turned quite pale he stood up and leaned across the desk he said that youre sure he certainly did miller frowned does it mean something fitzgerald turned away and moved across the room to the window i can only think of one circumstance in which a priest would speak in such a way and what would that be if the information he had at his disposal had been obtained as part of confession miller stared at him but that isnt possible i mean he actually saw this character up there at the cemetery it wouldnt apply it could fitzgerald said if the man simply went into the box and confessed da costa wouldnt see his face remembernot then and youre trying to tell me that once the bloke has spilled his guts da costa would be hooked certainly he would but thats crazy not to a catholic it isnt thats the whole point of confession that what passes between the priest and individual involved no matter how vile must be utterly confidential he shrugged just as effective as a bullet sir fitzgerald hesitated when we were at the cemetery didnt he tell you he was in a hurry to leave because he had to hear confession at one oclock miller was out of his chair and already reaching for his raincoat you can come with me he said he might listen to you what about the autopsy fitzgerald reminded him i thought you wanted to attend personally miller glanced at his watch theres an hour yet plenty of time the lifts were all busy and he went down the stairs two at a time heart pounding with excitement fitzgerald had to be right it was the only explanation that fitted but how to handle the situation that was something else again when fallon turned down the narrow street beside holy name varley was no more than thirty yards in the rear fallon had been aware of his presence within two minutes of leaving jennys place not that it mattered he entered the church and varley made for the phonebox on the comer of the street and was speaking to meehan within a few moments mr meehan its me hes gone into a church in rockingham street the church of the holy name ill be there in five minutes meehan said and slammed down the receiver he arrived in the scarlet scimitar with billy at the wheel to find varley standing on the street corner miserable in the rain he came to meet them as they got out hes still in there mr meehan i havent been in myself good lad meehan said and glanced up at the church bloody place looks as if it might fall down at any moment they serve good soup varley said to dossers they use the crypt as a day refuge ive been in the priest hes father da costa and his niece run it between them shes a blind girl a real smasher plays the organ here median nodded all right you wait in a doorway when he comes out follow him again come on billy he moved into the porch and opened the door gently they passed inside and he closed it again quickly the girl was playing the organ he could see the back of her head beyond the green baize curtain the priest knelt at the altar rail in prayer fallon sat at one end of a pew halfway along the aisle there was a small chapel to st martin de porres on the right not a single candle flickered in front of his image leaving the chapel in semidarkness meehan pulled billy after him into the concealing shadows and sat down in the corner what in the hell are we supposed to be doing billy whispered just shut up and listen at that moment father da costa stood up and crossed himself as he turned he saw fallon theres nothing for you here you know that he said sternly anna stopped playing she swung her legs over the seat as fallon advanced along the aisle and billy whistled softly christ did you see those legs shut up jack hissed i told you id see to things and i have done fallon said as he reached the altar rail i just wanted you to know that what am i supposed to do thank you father da costa said the street door banged open candles flickered in the wind as it closed again and to jack medians utter astonishment miller and fitzgerald walked up the aisle towards the altar ah there you are father miller called td like a word with you my god billy meehan whispered in panic weve got to get out of here like hell we do meehan said and his hand gripped billys right knee like a vice just sit still and listen this could be very interesting prelude and fugue fallon recognised miller for what he was instantly and waited shoulders hunched hands in the pockets of his trench coat feet apart ready to make whatever move was necessary there was an elemental force to the man that was almost tangible father da costa could feel it in the very air and the thought of what might happen here filled him with horror he moved forward quickly to place himself between fallon and the two policemen as they approached anna paused uncertainly a yard or two on the other side of the altar tail miller stopped hat in hand fitzgerald a pace or two behind him there was a slight awkward silence and da costa said i think youve met my niece superintendent he has inspector fitzgerald with him my dear miss da costa miller said formally and turned to fallon father da costa said and this is mr fallon superintendent fallon said easily he waited a slight irked smile on his mouth and miller looking into that white intense face those dark eyes was aware of a strange irrational coldness as if somewhere someone had walked over his grave which didnt make any kind of sense and then a sudden wild thought struck him and he took an involuntary step backwards there was a silence everyone waited rain drummed against a window it was anna who broke the spell by taking a blind step towards the altar rail and stumbling fallon jumped to catch her are you all right miss da costa he said easily thank you mr fallon how stupid of me her slight laugh sounded very convincing as she looked in millers general direction ive been having trouble щwith the organ im afraid that like the church its past its best mr fallon has kindly agreed to give us the benefit of his expert advice is that so miller said she turned to father da costa do you mind if we start uncle i know mr fallons time is limited well go into the sacristy if thats all right with you superintendent father da costa said or up to the house if you prefer actually id rather like to hang on here for a few minutes miller told him im a pianist myself but ive always been rather partial to a bit of organ music if mr fallon has no objection fallon gave him an easy smile sure and theres nothing like an audience superintendent for bringing out the best in all of us and he took anna by the arm and led her up through the choir stalls from the darkness at the rear of the little chapel to st martin de porres meehan watched fascinated billy whispered i said he was a nutter didnt i so how in the hell is he going to talk his way out of this one with his fingers billy with his fingers meehan said td put a grand on it there was sincere admiration in his voice when he added you know something im enjoying every bleeding minute of this its always nice to see a real pro in action he sighed there arent many of us left fallon took off his trench coat and draped it over the back of a convenient choir stall he sat down and adjusted the stool so that he could reach the pedals easily anna stood at his right hand have you tried leaving the trumpet in as i suggested he asked she nodded it made quite a difference good ill play something pretty solid and well see what else we can find wrong what about the bach prelude and fugue in d major i only have it in braille thats all right i know it by heart he turned and looked down at father da costa and the two policemen on the other side of the altar rail if youre interested this is reputed to have been albert schweitzers favourite piece no one said a word they stood there waiting and fallon swung round to face the organ it had been a long time a hell of a long time and yet quite suddenly and in some strange incomprehensible way it was only yesterday he prepared the swell organ hands moving expertly all stops except the vox humana and the celeste and on the great organ diapasons and a four foot principal he looked up at anna gravely as regards the pedal organ id be disinclined to use any reed stops on this instrument only the sixteenfoot diapason and the bourdon and maybe a thirtytwofoot stop to give a good solid tone what do you think she could not see the corner of his mouth lifted in a slight sardonic smile and yet something of that smile was in his voice she put a hand on his shoulder and said clearly an interesting beginning anyway to her horror he said very softly why did you interfere isnt that obvious she answered in a low voice for superintendent miller and his inspectors sake now play god forgive you but youre a terrible liar fallon told her and started he opened with a rising scale not too fast allowing each note to be heard heeling and toeing with his left foot in a clear bold loud statement playing with such astonishing power that millers wild surmise died on the instant for it was a masterly performance by any standard father da costa stood at the altar rail as if turned to stone caught by the brilliance of fallons playing as he answered the opening statement with the chords of both hands on the sparkling great organ he repeated feet then hands again manual answering pedals until his left toe sounded the long four bar bottom a and his hands traced the brilliant passages announced by the pedals miller tapped father da costa on the shoulder and щwhispered in his ear brilliant but im running out of time father can we have our chat now father da costa nodded reluctantly and led the way across to the sacristy fitzgerald was the last in and the door banged behind him in a sudden gust of wind fallon stopped playing have they gone he asked softly anna da costa stared blindly down at him a kind of awe on her face reached out to touch his cheek who are you she whispered what are you a hell of a question to ask any man he said and turning back to the organ he moved into the opening passage again the music could be heard in the sacristy muted yet throbbing through the old walls with a strange power father da costa sat on the edge of the table cigarette sir fitzgerald produced an old silver case father da costa took one and the light that followed miller observed him closely the massive shoulders that weathered usedup face the tangled grey beard and suddenly realised with something dose to annoyance that he actually liked the man it was precisely for this reason that he decided to be as formal as possible well superintendent father da costa said have you changed your mind sir since we last spoke not in the slightest miller fought hard to control his anger and fitzgerald moved in smoothly have you been coerced in any way since this morning sir or threatened not at all inspector father da costa assured him with complete honesty does the name meehan mean anything to you sir father da costa shook his head frowning slightly no i dont think so should it miller nodded to fitzgerald who opened the briefcase he was carrying and produced a photo which he passed to the priest jack median he said dandy jack to ms friends that one was taken in london on the steps of west end central police station after he was released for lack of evidence in an east end shooting last year meehan wearing his usual doublebreasted overcoat smiled out at the world hugely waving his hat in his right hand his left arm encircling the shoulders of a wellknown model girl the girl is strictly for publicity purposes fitzgerald said in sexual matters his tastes run elsewhere what you read on the sheet pinned to the back is all we have on him officially father da costa read it with interest jack meehan was fortyeight and had joined the royal navy in i at eighteen serving on minesweepers until i when he had been sentenced to a years imprisonment and discharged with ignominy for breaking a petty officers jaw in a brawl in i he had served six months on a minor smuggling charge and in i a charge of conspiracy to rob the mails had been dropped for lack of evidence since then he had been questioned by the police on over forty occasions in connection with indictable offences you dont seem to be having much success father da costa said with a slight smile theres nothing funny about jack meehan miller said in twentyfive years in the police force hes the nastiest thing ive ever come across remember the kray brothers and the richardson torture gang meehans worse than the whole damn lot of them put together he has an undertaking business here in the city but behind that facade of respectability he heads an organisation that controls drugpushing prostitution gambling and protection in most of the big cities in the north of england and you cant stop him i find that surprising rule by terror father the krays got away with it for years meehan makes them look like beginners hes had men shot on many occasions usually the kind of shotgun blast in the legs that doesnt kill simply cripples he likes them around as an advertisement you know this for a fact and couldnt prove it just as i couldnt prove he was behind the worst case of organised child prostitution we ever had or that he disciplined one man by crucifying him with sixinch nails and another by making him eat his own excreta for the briefest of moments father da costa found himself back in that camp in north korea the first one where the softening up was mainly physical lying halfdead in the latrine while a chinese boot ground his face into a pile of human ordure the guard had tried to make him eat too and he had refused mainly because he thought he was dying anyway he pulled himself back to the present with an effort and you think meehan is behind the killing of krasko this morning he has to be miller told him krasko was to put it politely a business rival in every sense of the word meehan tried to take him under his wing and he refused in meehans terms he wouldnt see reason and a killer was brought in to execute him publicly to encourage the others miller said in a sense the very fact that meehan dares to do such a thing is a measure of just how sick he is he knows that i know hes behind the whole thing but he wants me to know wants everyone to know he thinks nothing can touch him father da costa looked down at the photo frowning and fitzgerald said we could get him this time father with your help father da costa shook his head his face grave tm sorry inspector i really am miller said in a harsh voice father da costa the only inference we can draw from your strange conduct is that you are aware of the identity of the man we are seeking that you are in fact protecting him inspector fitzgerald here himself a catholic has suggested a possible explanation to me that your knowledge is somehow bound up with the secrets of the confessional if that is the term is there any truth in that supposition believe me superintendent if i could help you i щwould father da costa told him you still refuse im afraid so miller glanced at his watch all right father i have an appointment in twenty minutes and id like you to come with me no threats no coercion just a simple request i see father da costa said may i be permitted to ask where we are going to attend the post mortem of janos krasko at the city mortuary i see father da costa said tell me superintendent is this supposed to be a challenge thats up to you father father da costa stood up suddenly weary his will to resist was at a new low he was sick of the whole wretched business strangely enough the only thing of which he was aware with any clarity was the sound of the organ muted and far away i have evening mass superintendent and supper at the refuge afterwards i cant be long an hour at the most sir ill have you brought back by car but we really will have to leave now father da costa opened the sacristy door and led the way back into the church he paused at the altar anna he called fallon stopped playing and the girl turned to face him tm just going out my dear with superintendent miller what about mass she said i wont be long as for the organ he added perhaps mr fallon would come back after mass we could discuss it then glad to father fallon called cheerfully father da costa miller and inspector fitzgerald walked down the aisle past the chapel of st martin de porres where jack meehan and his brother still sat in the shadows and out of the front door it banged in the wind there was silence fallon said softly well now at a rough estimate id say youve just saved my neck i think he suspected something the good superintendent miller but not now she said not after such playing you were brilliant he chuckled softly that might have been true once as ill admit with becoming modesty but not any more my hands arent what they were for one thing brilliant she said theres no other word for it she was genuinely moved and for the moment it was as if she had forgotten that other darker side she groped for his hands a smile on her face as for your hands what nonsense she took them in hers still smiling and then that smile was wiped dean your fingers she whispered feeling at them what happened oh those he pulled his hands free and examined the ugly misshapen fingerends some unfriends of mine pulled out my nails a small matter on which we didnt quite see eye to eye he stood up and pulled on his coat she sat there horror on her face and reached out a hand as if to touch him pawing at space he helped her to her feet and placed her coat about her shoulders i dont understand she said and please god you never should he told her softly come on now and ill take you home they went down the altar steps and out through the sacristy the door closed behind them there was a moment of silence and then billy meehan stood up thank god for that can we kindly get the hell out of here now you can not me meehan told him find fallon and stick to him like glue but i thought that was varleys job so now im putting you on to it tell varley to wait outside and what about you billy said sullenly oh ill wait here for the priest to get back time we had a word he sighed and stretched his arms i like it here nice and peaceful in the dark with all those candles flickering away there gives a fella time to think billy hesitated as if trying to find some suitable reply and meehan said irritably go on piss off out of it for christs sake ill see you later he leaned back arms folded and dosed his eyes and billy left by the front entrance to do as he was told it was raining hard in the cemetery as they moved along the path to the presbytery fallon slipped her arm in his sometimes i think its never going to stop she said its been like this for days i know he said they reached the front door she opened it and paused in the porch while fallon stood at the bottom of the steps looking up at her nothing seems to make sense to me any longer she said i dont understand you or whats happened today or any part of it not after hearing you play it doesnt make sense it doesnt fit he smiled up at her gently go in now girl dear out of the cold stay safe in your own small world not now she said how can i youve made me an accessory now isnt that what they call it i could have spoken up but i didnt it was the most terrible thing she could have said to him he said hoarsely then why didnt you i gave my uncle my word had you forgotten and i would not hurt him for worlds fallon moved back into the rain very softly she called from the porch mr fallon are you there he didnt reply she stood there for a moment longer uncertainty on her face then went in and dosed the door fallon turned and moved back along the path billy had been watching them from the shelter of a large victorian mausoleum or rather he had been watching anna she was different from the girls he was used to quiet ladylike and yet she had an excellent figure there was plenty of warmth beneath that cool exterior he was certain of that and the fact of her blindness made his stomach churn exciting some perversity inside hi and he got an almost instant erection fallon paused hands cupped to light a cigarette and billy drew back out of sight fallon said all right billy im ready to go home now since youre here you can drive me back to jennys place billy hesitated then stepped reluctantly into the open think youre bleeding smart dont you to be smarter than you doesnt take much sonny fallon told him and another thing if i catch you hanging around here again ill be very annoyed why dont you go stuff yourself billy told him furiously he turned and walked rapidly towards the gate fallon was smiling as he went after him the city mortuary was built like a fort and encircled by twentyfoot walls of red brick to keep out prying eyes when millers car reached the main entrance the driver got out and spoke into a voice box on the wall he climbed back behind the wheel a moment later the great steel gate slid back automatically and they passed into an inner courtyard here we are father miller said the most modern mortuary in europe or so they say he and fitzgerald got out first and father da costa followed them the inner building was all concrete and glass functional but rather beautiful in its own way they went up a concrete ramp to the rear entrance and a technician in white overalls opened the door for them good morning superintendent he said professor lawlor said hed meet you in the dressingroom hes very anxious to get started there was the constant low hum of the airconditioning plant as they followed him along a maze of narrow corridors miller glanced over his shoulder at father da costa and said casually they boast the purest air in the city up here if you can breathe it at all that is it was the kind of remark that didnt seem to require an answer and father da costa made no attempt to make one the technician opened a door ushered them inside and left there were several washbasins a shower in the corner white hospital overalls and robes hanging on pegs on one wall underneath was a row of white rubber boots in various sizes miller and fitzgerald removed their raincoats and the superintendent took down a couple of white robes and passed one to father da costa here put this on you dont need to bother about boots father da costa did as he was told and then the door opened and professor lawlor entered come on nick he said youre holding me up and then he saw the priest and his eyes widened in surprise hello father id like father da costa to observe if youve no objection miller said professor lawlor was wearing white overalls and boots and long palegreen rubber gloves which he pulled at impatiently as long as he doesnt get in the way but do lets get on with it ive got a lecture at the medical school at five he led the way out and they followed along a short corridor and through a rubber swing door into the post mortem room it was lit by fluorescent lighting so bright that it almost hurt the eyes and there was a row of halfadozen stainless steel operating tables janos krasko lay on his back on the one nearest the door head raised on a wooden block he was quite naked two technicians stood ready beside a trolley on which an assortment of surgical instruments was laid out nearly the greatest surprise for father da costa were the closed circuit television cameras one set close up to the operating table the other waiting nearby on a movable trolley as you can see father science marches on miller said these days in a case like this everythings videotaped and in colour is that necessary father da costa asked him it certainly is especially when you get the kind of defence council who hasnt got much to go on and tries bringing in his own expert witness in other words some other eminent pathologist with his own particular theory about what happened one of the technicians was fastening a throat mike around lawlors throat and miller nodded the medical profession are great on opinions father ive learned that the hard way lawlor smiled frostily dont get bitter in your old age nick have you witnessed a post mortem before father not in your terms professor i see well if you feel sick you know where the dressingroom is and please stand well back all of you he turned and addressed the camera men and technicians right gentlemen lets get started it should have been like something out of a nightmare that it wasnt was probably due to lawlor as much as anything else that and the general atmosphere of clinical efficiency he was really quite brilliant more than competent in every department an artist with a knife who kept up a running commentary in that dry precise voice of his during the entire proceedings everything he says is recorded miller whispered to go with the video father da costa watched fascinated as lawlor drew a scalpel around the skull he grasped the hair firmly and pulled the entire face forward eyeballs and all like a crumpled rubber mask he nodded to the technicians who handed him a small electric saw and switched on lawlor began to cut round the top of the skull very carefully they call it a de soutter miller whispered again works on a vibratory principle a circular saw would cut too quickly there was very little smell everything being drawn up by extractor fans in the ceiling above the table lawlor switched off the saw and handed it to the technician he lifted off the neat skullcap of bone and placed it on the table then carefully removed the brain and put it in a rather commonplace red plastic basin which one of the technicians held ready the technician carried it across to the sink and lawlor weighed it carefully he said to miller til leave my examination of this until ive finished going through the motions on the rest of him ah right tine miller said lawlor returned to the corpse picked up a large scalpel and opened the entire body from throat to belly there was virtually no blood only a deep layer of yellow fat red meat underneath he opened the body up like an old overcoat working fast and efficiently never stopping for a moment father da costa said is this necessary the wound was in the head we know that the coroner will demand a report that is complete in every detail miller told him thats what the law says hes entitled to and thats what he expects its not as cruel as you think we had a case the other year an old man found dead at his home apparent heart failure when lawlor opened him up he was able to confirm that and if hed stopped at the heart that would have been the end of the matter there was more fractured vertebrae somewhere in the neck area i forget the details but it meant that the old boy had been roughly handled by someone which led us to a character whod been making a nuisance of himself preying on old people the sort who knocks on the door insists he was told to clean the drains and demands ten quid what happened to him the court accepted a plea of manslaughter gave him five years so hes due out soon a crazy world father and what would you have done with him td have hung him miller said simply you see for me its a state of war now a question of survival liberal principles are all very fine as long as they leave you with something to have principles about which made sense in its own way and it was hard to argue father da costa moved to one side as the technicians carried the various organs across to the sink in more plastic basins each item was weighed then passed to lawlor who sliced it quickly into sections on a wooden block with a large knife heart lungs liver kidneys intestines they all received the same treatment with astonishing speed and the camera on the trolley recorded everything at his side finally he was finished and put down his knife thats it he said to miller nothing worth mentioning ill go to town on the brain after ive had a cigarette he smiled at da costa well what did you think an extraordinary experience father da costa said disquieting more than anything else to find that man is just so much raw meat professor lawlor said is that what you think see for yourself lawlor crossed to the operating table and father da costa went with him the body was open to the view and quite empty gutted nothing but space from inside the rib cage and down into the penis remember that poem of eliots the hollow men well this is what he was getting at or so its always seemed to me and you think thats all there is dont you lawlor demanded one of the technicians replaced the skullcap of bone and pulled the scalp back into place amaing how easily the face settled into position again quite remarkable father da costa said a superb piece of engineering the human body infinitely functional there seems to be no task that a man cannot cope with if he so desires wouldnt you agree professor i suppose so sometimes i find the mystery of it quite terrifying i mean is this all thats left in the end of an einstein lets say or a picasso a gutted body a few scraps of raw meat swilling about in the bottom of a plastic bucket ah no you dont lawlor grinned tiredly no metaphysics if you please father ive got other things to do he turned to miller have you seen enough i think so miller said good then get this devils advocate out of here and leave me in peace to finish it will be the morning before you get the full report now he grinned at father da costa again i wont shake hands for obvious reasons but any time youre passing just drop in theres always someone here he laughed at his own joke was still laughing when they went back to the dressingroom one of the technicians went with them to make sure that the robes they had worn went straight into the dirty laundry basket so there was no opportunity to talk miller led the way back outside feeling tired and depressed he had lost he knew that already the trouble was he didnt really know what to do next except to take the kind of official action hed been hoping to avoid it was still raining when they went out into the courtyard when they reached the car fitzgerald opened the door and father da costa climbed in miller followed him fitzgerald sat in the front with the driver as they moved out into the city traffic miller said i wanted you to see the reality of it and it hasnt made the slightest difference has it father da costa said when i was twenty years of age i dropped into the cretan mountains by parachute dressed as a peasant all very romantic action by night that sort of thing when i arrived at the local village inn i was arrested at gunpoint by a german undercover agent a member of the feldgendarmerie miller was interested in spite of himself youd been betrayed something like that he wasnt a bad sort told me he was sorry but that hed have to hold me till the gestapo got there we had a drink together i managed to hit him on the head with a wine bottle father da costa stared back into the past and miller said gently what happened he shot me in the left lung and i choked him to death with my bare hands father da costa held them up ive prayed for him every day of my life since they turned into the street at the side of the church and miller said wearily all right i get the picture the car pulled in at the kerb and there was a new formality in his voice when he said in legal terms your attitude in this matter makes you an accessory after the fact you understand that perfectly da costa told him all right miller said this is what i intend to do i shall approach your superior in a final effort to make you see sense monsignor ohalloran is the man you want i tried to see him myself earlier but hes out of town hell be back in the morning but it wont do you any good then ill apply to the director of public prosecutions for a warrant for your arrest father da costa nodded soberly you must do what you think is right i see that superintendent he opened the door and got out til pray for you pray for me miller ground his teeth together as the car moved away have you ever heard the like i know sir fitzgerald said hes quite a man isnt he it was cold in the church and damp as father da costa opened the door and moved inside not long till mass he felt tired wretchedly tired it had been an awful day the worst he could remember in a great many years since the chinese prison camp at chong sam if only fallon and miller all of them would simply fade away cease to exist he dipped his fingers in the holy water and on his right a match flared in the darkness of the little side chapel to st martin de porres as someone lit a candle illuminating a familiar race there was a slight pause and then the devil moved out of the darkness and father da costa girded up his loins to meet him the devil and all his works what do you want here mr meehan father da costa said you know who i am oh yes father da costa told him i was taught to recognise the devil from a very early age meehan stared at him for a moment in genuine amazement and then he laughed harshly his head thrown back and the sound echoed up into the rafters thats good i like that father da costa said nothing and meehan shrugged and turned to look down towards the altar i used to come here when i was a kid i was an acolyte he turned and there was a challenge in his voice you dont believe me shouldnt i meehan nodded towards the altar ive stood up there many a time when it was my turn to serve at mass scarlet cassock white cotta my old lady used to launder them every week she loved seeing me up there father omalley was the priest in those days ive heard of him father da costa said tough as old boots meehan was warming to his theme now enjoying himself i remember one saturday evening a couple of drunken micks came in just before mass and started turning things upside down duffed them up proper he did straight out on their ear said theyd desecrated gods house and all that stuff he shook his head a real old sod he was he once caught me with a packet of fags id nicked from a shop round the corner didnt call the law just took a stick to me in the sacristy he chuckled kept me honest for a fortnight that father straight up father da costa said quietly what do you want here mr meehan meehan made a sweeping gesture with one arm that took in the whole church not what it was i can tell you used to be beautiful a real picture but now he shrugged ready to fall down any time this restoration fund of yours i hear youve not been getting very far father da costa saw it all and youd like to help is that it thats it father thats it exactly the door opened behind them they both turned and saw an old lady with a shoppingbag enter as she genuflected father da costa said we cant talk here come with me they went up in the hoist to the top of the tower it was still raining as he led the way out along the catwalk but the mist had lifted and the view of the city was remarkable in the far distance perhaps four or five miles away it was even possible to see the edge of the moors smudging the grey sky meehan was genuinely delighted heh i was up here once when i was a kid inside the belfry it was different then he leaned over the rail and pointed to where the bulldozers were excavating in the brickfield we used to live there thirteen khyber street he turned to father da costa who made no reply meehan said softly this arrangement between you and fallon you going to stick to it father da costa said what arrangement would that be come off it meehan replied impatiently this confession thing i know all about it he told me then as a catholic yourself you must know that there is nothing i can say the secrets of the confessional are absolute meehan laughed harshly i know hes got brains that fallon he shut you up good didnt he a small hot spark of anger moved in father da costa and he breathed deeply to control it if you say so meehan chuckled never mind father i always pay my debts how much his gesture took in the church the scaffolding everything to put all this right fifteen thousand pounds father da costa told him for essential preliminary work more would be needed later easy meehan said with my help you could pick that up inside two or three months might i ask how meehan lit a cigarette for a start theres the clubs dozens of them all over the north theyll all put the old collectingbox round if i give the word and you actually imagine that i could take it meehan looked genuinely bewildered its only money isnt it pieces of paper a medium of exchange thats what the bright boys call it isnt that what you need in case youve forgotten mr meehan christ drove the moneylenders out of the temple he didnt ask them for a contribution to the cause meehan frowned i dont get it then let me put it this way my religion teaches me that reconciliation with god is always possible that no human being however degraded or evil is beyond gods mercy i had always believed that until now meehans face was pale with fury he grabbed da costas arm and pushed him towards the rail pointing down at the brickfield thirteen khyber street a backtoback rabbit hutch one room downstairs two up one stinking lavatory to every four houses my old man cleared off when i was a kid he had sense my old lady she kept us going by cleaning when she could get it when she couldnt there were always ten bob quickies behind the boozer on a saturday night a bloody whore thats all she was who found time to clean and iron your cassock and cotta each week father da costa said who fed you and washed you and sent you to this church to hell with that meehan said wildly all she ever got all anybody from khyber street ever got was screwed into the ground but not me not jack meehan im up here now im on top of the world where nobody can touch me father da costa felt no pity only a terrible disgust he said calmly i believe you to be the most evil and perverted creature it has ever been my misfortune to meet if i could i would hand you over to the proper authorities gladly tell them everything but for reasons well known to you this is impossible meehan seemed to be more in control of himself again he said with a sneer thats good that is me you wouldnt touch with a tenfoot pole but fallon hes different isnt he i mean he only murders women and children for a moment father da costa had to fight for breath when he spoke it was with difficulty what are you talking about dont say he hasnt told you meehan jeered nothing about belfast or londonderry or that bus full of school kids he blew up he leaned forward a strange intent look on his face and then he smiled softly you dont like that do you fell for his irish charm did you fancy him then ive heard some of you priests there was a hand at his throat a hand of iron and he was back against the cage of the hoist fighting for his very life the priests eyes sparking fire meehan tried to bring up a knee and found only a thigh turned expertly to block it father da costa shook him like a rat then opened the door and threw him inside the cage door slammed as meehan picked himself up til have you for this he said hoarsely youre dead meat my god mr meehan father da costa said softly through the bars of the cage is a god of love but he is also a god of wrath i leave you in his hands he pressed the button and the cage started to descend as meehan emerged from the church porch a sudden flurry of wind dashed rain in his face he turned up his collar and paused to light a cigarette it was beginning to get dark and as he went down the steps he noticed a number of men wailing by a side door sheltering against the wall from the rain human derelicts most of them in tattered coats and broken boots he moved across the street and varley came out of the doorway of the old warehouse on the corner i waited mr meehan like billy said what happened to fallon went off in the car with billy meehan frowned but for the moment that could wait and he turned his attention to the queue again what are they all wailing for this bleeding soup kitchen to open thats right mr meehan in the crypt meehan stared across at the queue for a while and then smiled suddenly he opened his wallet and extracted a bundle of onepound notes i make it twentytwo in that queue charlie you give them a quid apiece with my compliments and tell them the pub on the comers just opened varley mystified crossed the street to distribute his largesse and within seconds the queue was breaking up several of the men touching their caps to meehan who nodded cheerfully as they shuffled past when varley came back there was no one left outside the door hes going to have a lot of bleeding soup on his hands tonight meehan said grinning i dont know about that mr meehan varley pointed out theyll only come back when theyve spent up and by then theyll have a skinful wont they so they might give him a little trouble in fact i think well make sure they do get hold of that bouncer from the kit kat club the irishman ohara big mick mr meehan varley stirred uneasily im not too happy about that hes a terrible man when he gets going meehan knocked off his cap and grabbed him by the hair you tell him to be outside that door with one of his mates at opening time nobody goes in for the first hour nobody he waits for at least a dozen drunks to back him then he goes in and smashes the place up if he does it right its worth twentyfive quid if the priest breaks an arm accidental like its worth fifty varley scrambled for his cap in the gutter is that all mr meehan he asked fearfully itll do for starters meehan was chuckling to himself as he walked away father da costa could count on only three acolytes for evening mass the parish was dying that was the trouble as the houses came down the people moved away to the new estates leaving only the office blocks it was a hopeless task he had known that when they sent him to holy name his superiors had known a hopeless task to teach him humility wasnt that what the bishop had said a little humility for a man who had been arrogant enough to think he could change the world remake the church in his own image two of the boys were west indians the other english of hungarian parents all a product of the few slum streets still remaining they stood in the corner waiting for him whispering together occasionally laughing newlywashed hair combed bright in their scarlet cassocks and white cottas had jack meehan looked like that once the memory was like a sword in the heart the fact of his own violence the killing rage the violence that had been so often his undoing through the years the men he had killed in ї the war that was one thing but after the chinese soldier in korea machinegunning a column of refugees he had picked up a rifle and shot the man through the head at two hundred yards expertly skillfully the old soldier temporarily in control had he been wrong had it really been wrong when so many lives had been saved and that portuguese captain in mozambique stringing up guerrillas by their ankles he had beaten the man half to death the incident that had finally sent him home in disgrace the days when bishops rode into battle with a mace in one hand are over my friend the bishops voice echoed faintly your task is to save souls violence for violence that was medians way sick and disgusted father da costa took off the violet stole he had worn for confession and put on a green one crossing it under his girdle to represent christs passion and death as he put on an old rosecoloured cope the outer door opened and anna came in her stick in one hand a raincoat over her he moved to take the raincoat holding her shoulders briefly are you all right she turned at once concern on her face what is it youre upset has anything happened i had an unpleasant interview with the man meehan he replied in a low voice he said certain things concerning fallon things which could explain a great deal ill tell you later she frowned slightly but he led her to the door and opened it pushing her through into the church he waited for a few moments to give her time to reach the organ then nodded to the boys they formed into their tiny procession one of them opening the door and as the organ started to play they moved into the church it was a place of shadows candlelight and darkness alternating cold and damp there were perhaps fifteen people in the congregation no more he had never felt so dispirited so dose to the final edge of things not since korea and then he looked across at the figure of the virgin she seemed to float there in the candlelight so calm so serene and the slight halfsmile on the parted lips seemed somehow for him alone asperges me he intoned and moved down the aisle on of the west indian boys carrying the bucket of holy water in front of him father da costa sprinkling the heads of his congregation as he passed symbolically washing them clean and who will cleanse me he asked himself desperately щwho in the faded rose cope hands together he commenced the mass i confess to almighty god and to you my brothers and sisters that i have sinned through my own fault here he struck his breast once as ritual required in my thoughts and in my words in what i have done and in what i have failed to do the voices of the congregation swelled up in unison behind him there were tears on his face the first in many years and he struck his breast again lord have mercy on me he whispered help me show me what to do the executioner the wind howled through the city like a living thing driving rain before it clearing the streets rattling old window frames tapping at the glass like some invisible presence when billy meehan went into jenny foxs bedroom she was standing in front of the mirror combing her hair she was wearing the black pleated mini skirt dark stockings patentleather highheeled shoes and a white blouse she looked extremely attractive as she turned billy closed the door and said softly nice very nice hes still in his room isnt he he said he was going out again though well have to change his mind then wont we billy went and sat on the bed come here she fought to control the instant panic that threatened to choke her the disgust that made her flesh crawl as she moved towards him he slipped his hands under her skirt fondling the warm flesh at the top of the stockings thats a good girl hell like that they always do he stared up at her that strange dreamy look in his eyes again you muck this up for me youll be in trouble i mean id have to punish you and you wouldnt like that would you her heart thudded painfully please billy please then do it right i want to see what makes this guy tick he pushed her away got up and moved to a small picture on the wall he removed it carefully there was a tiny peephole underneath skillfully placed and he peered through after a few moments he turned and nodded just taken his shirt off now you get in there and remember ill be watching his mouth was slack his hands trembling a little and she turned choiring back her disgust opened the door and slipped outside fallon was standing at the washbasin stripped to the waist lather on his face when she knocked on the door and went in he turned to greet her a bonehandled cutthroat razor in one hand she leaned against the door sorry about the razor it was all i could find thats all right he smiled my father had one of these wouldnt use anything else till the day he died a line of ugly puckered scars cut across his abdomen down into the left hip her eyes widened what happened he glanced down oh that a machinegun burst one of those times i should have moved faster than i did were you in the army in a manner of speaking he turned back to the mirror to finish shaving she moved across and stood beside him he smiled sideways crookedly stretching his mouth for the razor you look nice enough to eat going somewhere there was that warmth again that pricking behind her eyes and she suddenly realised with a sense of wonder just how much she had come to like this strange small man and in the same moment remembered billy watching her every move on the other side of that damned wall she smiled archly and ran a finger down his bare arm i thought i might stay in tonight what about you fallons eyes flickered towards her once something dose to amusement in them girl dear you dont know what youd be getting into and me twice your age ive got a bottle of irish whiskey in god save us and isnt that enough to tempt the devil himself he continued ids shaving and she moved across to the bed and sat down it wasnt going right it wasnt going right at all and at the thought of billys anger she turned cold inside she summoned up all her resources and tried again mind if i have a cigarette there was a packet on the bedside table and a box of matches she took one lit it and leaned back on the bed a pillow behind her shoulders have you really got to go out she raised one knee so that the skirt slid back provocatively exposing bare flesh at the top of dark stockings sheer black nylon briefs fallon sighed heavily put down the razor and picked up a towel he wiped the foam from his face as he crossed to the bed and stood looking down at her youll catch cold he smiled softly and pulled down her skirt if youre not careful and im still going out but ill have a glass with you before i do so be off now and open the bottle he pulled her up from the bed and pushed her firmly across the room she turned at the door fear in her eyes please she said fiercely please he frowned slightly and then a brief sad smile touched his mouth he kissed her gently on the lips and shook his head not me girl dear not me in the whole wide world you need a man im just a corpse walking it was such a terrible remark so dreadful in its implication that for the moment it drove every other thought from her mind she stared up at him eyes wide and he opened the door and pushed her outside fear possessed her now such fear as she had never known she couldnt face what awaited her in her bedroom if she could only get downstairs but it was already too late for as she tiptoed past the door opened and billy pulled her so violently into the bedroom that she stumbled losing a shoe and went sprawling across the bed she turned fearfully and found him already unbuckling his ii belt you cocked it up didnt you he said softly and after all ive done for you please billy please dont she said til do anything you can say that again youre going to get one of my specials just to keep you in line and maybe next time i tell you to do something youll bloody well make sure it gets done he started to unfasten his trousers go on turn over she was almost choiring and shook her head dumbly his face was like a mirror breaking madness staring at her from those pale eyes and he struck her heavily across the face you do as youre bloody well told you bitch he grabbed her by the hair forcing her round until she sprawled across the edge of the bed face down his other hand tore at her briefs pulling them down and then as she felt his hardness as he forced himself between her buttocks like some animal she screamed at the top of her voice head arched back in agony the door opened so violently that it splintered against the wall and fallon stood there one side of his face still lathered the cutthroat razor open in his right hand billy turned from the girl mouthing incoherently clutching at his trousers and as he stood up fallon took two quick paces into the room and kicked him in the privates billy went down like a stone and lay there twitching knees drawn up to his chest in a foetal position the girl adjusted her clothes as best she could and got up every last shred of decency stripped from her tears pouring down her face fallon wiped lather from his cheek mechanically with the back of his hand and his eyes were very dark she could hardly speak for sobbing he made me go into your room tonight he was watching she gestured towards the wall and fallon crossed to the peephole he turned slowly does this kind of thing happen often he likes to watch and you what about you tm a whore she said and suddenly it erupted from her all the disgust the selfhate born of years of degradation have you any idea what that means he started me early his brother jack meehan who else i was thirteen just right for a certain kind of client and from then its been downhill all the way you could leave where would i go to she had regained some of her composure now it takes money and i have a threeyearold daughter to think of here in this place she shook her head i board her out with a woman a nice woman in a decent part of town but billy knows where she is at that moment he stirred and pushed himself up on one elbow there were tears in his eyes and his mouth was flecked with foam youve had it he said faintly when my brother hears about this youre a dead man he started to zip up his trousers and fallon crouched down beside him my grandfather he began in a conversational tone kept a farm back home in ireland sheep mostly and every year hed geld a few to improve the flavour of the mutton or make the wool grow more something like that do you know what geld means billy boy like hell i do youre crackers billy said angrily like all the bloody irish it means he cut off their balls with a pair of sheep shears an expression of frozen horror appeared on the boys face and fallon said softly touch this girl in any way from now on he held up the cutthroat razor and i will attend to you personally my word on it the boy scrambled away from him and pushed himself up against the wall clutching at his trousers youre mad he whispered raving mad thats it billy fallon said capable of anything and dont you forget it the boy ducked out through the open door his feet thundered on the stairs the front door banged fallon turned a hand to his cheek could i finish my shaving now do you suppose she ran forward gripping his arms fiercely please dont go out please dont leave me i must he said he wont be back not as long as im staying here and afterwards щwell think of something she turned away and he grabbed her hand quickly til be an hour no more i promise and then we can have that glass of whiskey hows that she turned peering at him uncertainly the tears had streaked her makeup making her somehow seem very young you mean it on the word of an irish gentleman she flung her arms about his neck in delight oh ill be good to you i really will he put a finger on her mouth theres no need no need at all he patted her cheek til be back i promise only do one thing for me щwhats that wash your face for gods sake he closed the door gently as he went out and she moved across to the washbasin and looked into the mirror he was right she looked terrible and yet for the first time in years the eyes were smiling smiling through that streaked whores mask she picked up a flannel and some soap and started to wash her face thoroughly father da costa couldnt understand it the refuge had been open for just over an hour without a single customer in all the months he had been operating from the old crypt he had never known such a thing it wasnt much of a place but the stone walls had been nearly whitewashed there was a coke fire in the stove benches and trestle tables anna sat behind one of them knitting a sweater the soup was in front of her in a heatretaining container plates piled beside it there were several loaves of yesterdays bread supplied free by arrangement with a local bakery father da costa put more coke on the stove and stirred it impatiently with the poker anna stopped knitting what do you think has happened god knows he said tm sure i dont he walked to the door and went out to the porch the street was apparently deserted the rain had declined into a light drizzle he went back inside the irishman ohara the one varley had referred to as big mick moved out of the entrance to a small yard halfway up the street and stood under a lamp he was a tall broadshouldered man six foot three or four at least with curling black hair and a perpetual smile the man who moved out of the shadows to join him was two or three inches shorter and had a broken nose it was at this moment that fallon turned into the end of the street he approached silently pausing in the darkness to take stock of the situation when he saw ohara and his friend when the irishman started speaking fallon moved into a convenient doorway and listened sure and i think the reverend gentlemans just about ready for it daniel ohara said how many have we got in there now daniel snapped his fingers and several shadowy figures emerged from the darkness he counted them quickly i make it eight he said thats ten including us nine ohara said you stay outside and watch the door just in case they all know what to do ive seen to that daniel said for a quid apiece theyll take the place apart ohara turned to address the shadowy group remember one thing da costa hes mine daniel said doesnt that worry you mick i mean you being an irishman and so on after all hes a priest ive a terrible confession to make daniel ohara put a hand on his shoulder some irishmen are protestants and im one of them he turned to the others come on lads he said and crossed the road they went in through the door and daniel waited by the railings his ear cocked for the first sound of a disturbance from inside there was a slight polite cough from behind and when he turned fallon was standing a yard or two away hands in pockets where in hell did you spring from daniel demanded never mind that fallon said whats going on in there daniel knew trouble when he saw it but completely miscalculated his man you little squirt he said contemptuously get the hell out of it he moved in fast his hands reaching out to destroy but they only fastened on thin air as his feet were kicked expertly from beneath him he thudded against the wet pavement and scrambled to his feet mouthing obscenities fallon seized his right wrist with both hands twisting it up and around daniel gave a cry of agony as the muscle started to give still keeping that terrible hold in position fallon ran him headfirst into the railings daniel pulled himself up off his knees blood on his face one hand out in supplication no more for christs sake all right fallon said answers then whats the game theyre supposed to turn the place over who for daniel hesitated and fallon kicked his feet from under him who for jack meehan daniel gabbled fallon pulled him to his feet and stood back next time you get a bullet in the kneecap thats a promise now get out of it daniel turned and staggered into the darkness at the first sudden noisy rush father da costa knew he was in trouble as he moved forwards a bench went over and then another hands pawed at him someone pulled his cassock he was aware of anna crying out in alarm and turning saw ohara grab her from behind arms about her waist now then darlin what about a little kiss he demanded she pulled away from him in a panic hands reaching out blindly and cannoned into the trestle table knocking it over soup spilling out across the floor plates clattering as father da costa fought to get towards her ohara laughed out loud now look what youve done a soft quiet voice called from the doorway cutting through the noise mickeen ohara is it you i see the room went quiet everyone waited ohara turned an expression of disbelief on his face that seemed to say this couldnt be happening the expression was quickly replaced by one that was a mixture of awe and fear god in heaven he whispered is that you martin fallon went towards him hands in pockets and everyone waited he said softly tell them to clean the place up mick like a good boy then wait for me outside ohara did as he was told without hesitation and moved towards the door the other men started to right the tables and benches one of them got a bucket and mop and started on the floor father da costa had moved to comfort anna and fallon joined them im sorry about that father he said it wont happen again meehan father da costa asked fallon nodded were you expecting something like this he came to see me earlier this evening you might say we didnt get on too well he hesitated the big irishman he knew you little friend of all the world thats me fallon smiled good night to you he said and turned to the door father da costa reached him as he opened it and put a hand on his arm we must talk fallon you owe me that all right fallon said when til be busy in the morning but i dont have a lunchtime confession tomorrow will one oclock suit you at the presbytery til be there fallon went out dosing the door behind him and crossed the street to where ohara waited nervously under the lamp as fallon approached he turned to face him before god if id known you were mixed up in this martin i wouldnt have come within a mile of it i thought you were dead by now we all did all right fallon said how much was meehan paying you twentyfive quid fifty if the priest got a broken arm how much in advance not a sou fallon opened his wallet took out two tenpound notes and handed them to him traveling money for old times sake i dont think its going to be too healthy for you round here not when jack meehan finds out youve let him down god bless you martin ill be out of it this very night he started to turn away then hesitated does it bother you any more martin what happened back there every minute of every hour of every day of my life fallon said with deep conviction and he turned and walked away up the side street from the shelter of the porch father da costa saw ohara cross the main road he made for the pub on the corner going in at the saloon bar entrance and father da costa went after him it was quiet in the saloon bar which was why ohara had chosen it he was still badly shaken and ordered a large whisky which he swallowed at once as he asked for another the door opened and father da costa entered ohara tried to brazen it out so there you are father he said will you have a drink with me id sooner drink with the devil father da costa dragged him across to a nearby booth and sat opposite him where did you know fallon he demanded before tonight i mean ohara stared at him in blank astonishment glass halfraised to his lips fallon he said i dont know anyone called fallon martin fallon you fool father da costa said impatiently havent i just seen you talking together outside the church oh you mean martin ohara said fallon is that what hes calling himself now what can you tell me about him why should i tell you anything because ill ring for the police and put you in charge for assault if you dont detectivesuperintendent miller is a personal friend hell be happy to oblige im sure all right father you can call off the dogs ohara mellowed by two large whiskies went to the bar for a third and returned what do you want to know for does that matter it does to me martin fallon as you call him is probably the best man i ever knew in my life a hero to whom to the irish people oh i see well i dont mean him any harm i can assure you of that you give me your word on it of course all right i wont tell you his name his real name it doesnt matter anyway he was a lieutenant in the provisional ira they used to call vim the executioner in derry ive never known the likes of him with a gun in his hand hed have killed the pope if hed thought it would advance the cause and brains he shook his head a university man father would you believe it trinity college no less there were days when it all poured out of him poetry books that sort of thing and he played the piano eke an angel ohara hesitated fingering a cigarette frowning into the past and then there were other times what do you mean father da costa asked him oh he used to change completely go right inside himself no emotion no response nothing cold and dark ohara shivered and stuck the cigarette into the corner of his mouth when he was like that he scared the hell out of everybody including me i can tell you you were with him long only for a time they never really trusted me im a prod you see so i got out and fallon he laid this ambush for a saracen armoured car somewhere in armagh mined the road someone had got the time wrong they got a school bus instead with a dozen kids on board five killed the rest crippled you know how it is it finished martin i think hed been worrying about the way things were going for a while all the killing and so on the business with the bus was the final straw you might say i can see that it would be father da costa said without irony i thought he was dead ohara said last i heard the ira had an execution squad out after him me im no account nobody worries about me but for someone like martin its different he knows too much for a man like him theres only one way out of the movement and thats in a coffin he got to his feet face flushed well father ill be leaving you now this town and i are parting company he walked to the door and father da costa went with him as rain drifted across the street ohara buttoned up his coat and said cheerfully have you ever wondered what its all about father life i mean constantly father da costa told him thats honest anyway see you in hell father he moved off along the pavement whistling and father da costa went back across the road to the holy name when he went back into the crypt everything was in good order again the men had gone and anna waited patiently on one of the bench seats im sorry i had to leave you he said but i wanted to speak to the man who knew fallon the one who started all the trouble he went into the pub on the corner what did you find out he hesitated then told her when he was finished there was pain on her face she said slowly then he isnt what he seemed at first no he killed krasko father da costa reminded her murdered him in cold blood there was nothing romantic about that youre right of course she groped for her coat and stood up what are you going to do now what on earth do you expect me to do he said halfangrily save his soul its a thought she said slipping her hand into his arm and they went out together there was an old warehouse at the rear of meehans premises in pauls square and a fire escape gave easy access to its flat roof fallon crouched behind a low wall as he screwed the silencer on to the barrel of the ceska and peered across through the rain the two dormer windows at the rear of meehans penthouse were no more than twenty yards away and the curtains werent drawn he had seen meehan several times pacing backwards and forwards a glass in his hand on one occasion rupert had joined him putting an arm about his neck but meehan had shoved him away and angrily from the look of it it was a difficult shot at that distance for a handgun but not impossible fallon crouched down holding the ceska ready in both hands aiming at the lefthand window meehan appeared briefly and paused raising a glass to his lips fallon fired the silenced pistol once in the penthouse a mirror on the wall shattered and meehan dropped to the floor rupert who was lying on the couch watching television turned quickly his eyes widened my god look at the window somebody took a shot at you meehan looked up at the bullet hole the spiders web of cracks then across at the mirror he got up slowly rupert joined him you want to know something ducky youre getting to be too damn dangerous to know meehan shoved him away angrily get me a drink damn you ive got to think this thing out a couple of minutes later the phone rang when he picked up the receiver he got a callbox signal and then the line cleared as a coin went in at the other end that you meehan fallon said you know who this is you bastard meehan said what are you trying to do this time i missed because i meant to fallon said remember that and tell your goons to stay away from holy name and that includes you he put down the receiver and meehan did the same he turned his face white with fury and rupert handed him a drink you dont look too good ducky bad news fallon meehan said between his teeth it was that bastard fallon and he missed because he wanted to never mind ducky rupert said after all youve always got me thats right meehan said so i have i was forgetting and he hit him in the stomach with his clenched fist it was late when fallon got back much later than he had intended and there was no sign of jenny he took off his shoes and went up the stairs and along the landing to his room quietly he undressed got into bed and lit a cigarette he was tired it had certainly been one hell of a day there was a slight timid knock on the door it opened and jenny came in she wore a darkblue nylon nightdress her hair was tied back with a ribbon and her face was scrubbed clean she said jack meehan was on the phone about half an hour ago he says he wants to see you in the morning did he say where no he just said to tell you it couldnt be more public so youve nothing to worry about hell send a car at seventhirty fallon frowned a bit early for him isnt it f i wouldnt know she hesitated i waited you said an hour you didnt come tm sorry he said it couldnt be helped believe me i did she said you were the first man in years who didnt treat me like something youd scrape off your shoe ii she started to ct y wordless he pulled back the covers and held out a hand she stumbled across the room and got in beside him he switched off the lamp she lay there her face against his chest sobbing his arms about her he held her dose stroking her hair with his other hand and after a while she slept io exhumation the car that called to pick fallon up the following morning at seventhirty was a black funeral limousine varley was at the wheel dressed in a neat blue serge suit and peaked cap there was no other passenger fallon climbed into the rear and closed the door he reached across and slid back the glass window between the drivers compartment and the rest of the cat all right he said as varley moved into gear and drove away where are we going the catholic cemetery fallon in the act of lighting his first cigarette of the day started and varley said soothingly nothing to worry about mr fallon honest its just that mr meehan has an exhumation first thing this morning an exhumation fallon said thats right they dont come along very often and mr meehan always likes to see to a thing like that personally hes very particular about his funeral work i can believe that fallon said whats so special about this case nothing really i suppose he thought you might find it interesting the man theyre digging up is a german died about eighteen months ago his wife couldnt afford to take him back to germany then but now shes come into a bit of money and wants to bury him in hamburg he swung the car out into the main road and added cheerfully its a fascinating game the funeral business mr fallon always something new happening i just bet there is fallon said they reached the cemetery in ten minutes and varley turned in through the gate and drove up the drive past the chapel and the superintendents office following a narrow track the grave they were seeking was on top of the hill covered by a canvas awning at least a dozen people were grouped around it and there was a truck and a couple of cars meehan was standing beside one of them talking to a greyhaired man in rubber boots and an oilskin mac meehan wore a homburg hat and his usual melton overcoat and dormer stood beside him holding an umbrella over his head as fallon got out and splashed through the heavy rain towards them meehan turned and smiled ah there you are this is mr adams the public health inspector mr fallon is a colleague of mine adams shook hands and turned back to meehan til see how theyre getting on mr meehan he moved away and fallon said all right what game are we playing now no games meehan said this is strictly business and ive a funeral afterwards so im busy all morning but we obviously need to talk we can do it in the car on the way for the moment just stick dose to me and pretend to be a member of the firm this is a privileged occasion the cemetery superintendent wouldnt be too pleased if he thought an outsider had sneaked in he moved towards the grave dormer keeping pace with the umbrella and fallon followed the smell was terrible like nothing he had ever smelt before and when he peered down into the open grave he saw that it had been sprinkled with lime two feet of water down there mr meehan the public health inspector called no drainage too much day means the coffins going to be in a bad state probably come to pieces all in the game meehan said better have the other one ready he nodded and two of the gravediggers standing by lifted a large oaken coffin out of the back of the truck and put it down near the grave when they opened it fallon saw that it was zinc lined the old coffin drops inside and we dose the lid meehan said nothing to it the lid has to be welded into place mind you in front of the public health inspector but thats what the law says if you want to fly a corpse from one country to another just then there was a sudden flurry of movement and as they turned the halfdozen men grouped around the grave heaved up the coffin webbing bands had been passed underneath which to a certain extent held things together but as the coffin came into view the end broke away and a couple of decayed feet poked through minus their toes the smell was even worse now as the halfdozen unfortunate gravediggers lurched towards the new coffin clutching the old meehan seemed to enjoy the whole thing hugely and moved in close barking orders watch it now watch it ia little bit more to the left thats it the old coffin dropped into the new the lid was closed he turned triumphantly to fallon i told you there was nothing to it didnt i now lets get moving ive got a cremation at ninethirty the gravediggers seemed badly shaken one of them lit a cigarette hands trembling and said to fallon in a dublin accent is it a fact that theyre flying him over to germany this afternoon so i understand fallon said the old man made a wry face sure and i hope the pilot remembers to wind the windows down which at least sent fallon to the car laughing helplessly to himself donner drove and meehan and fallon sat in the back seat meehan opened a cupboard in the bottom half of the partition between the drivers compartment and the rear and took out a thermos flask and a halfbottle of cognac he halffilled a cup with coffee topped it up with cognac and leaned back last night that was very silly not what id call a friendly gesture at all what did you have to go and do a thing like that for you said the priest would be left alone fallon told him then sent ohara to the crypt to smash it up lucky i turned up when i did as for ohara he and i are old comrades in a manner of speaking hes cleared off by the way you wont be seeing him around here any more you have been busy meehan poured more cognac into his coffee i do admit i got just a little bit annoyed with father da costa on the other hand he wasnt very nice when i spoke to him yesterday evening and all i did was offer to help him raise the money to stop that church of his from falling down and you thought hed accept fallon laughed out loud youve got to be joking meehan shrugged i still say that bullet was an unfriendly act just like billy playing peeping tom at jenny foxs place fallon said when are you going to do something about that worm anyway he isnt fit to be out without his keeper meehans face darkened hes my brother he said he has his faults but we all have those anyone hurts him they hurt me too fallon lit a cigarette and meehan smiled expansively you dont really know me do you fallon i mean the other side of me for instance the funeral game you take it seriously it was a statement of fact not a question and meehan nodded soberly youve got to have some respect for death its a serious business too many people are too offhand about it these days now me i like to see things done right i can imagine meehan smiled thats why i thought it might be a good idea to get together like this morning you could find it very interesting who knows you might even see some future in tie business he put a hand on fallons knee and fallon eased away meehan wasnt in the least embarrassed anyway well start you off with a cremation he said see what you make of that he poured another coffee topped it up with more cognac and leaned back with a contended sigh the crematorium was called pine trees and when the car turned in through the gate fallon was surprised to see meehans name in gold leaf on the noticeboard one of halfadozen directors i have a fiftyone per cent holding in this place meehan said the most modern crematorium in the north of england you should see the gardens in spring and summer costs us a bomb but its worth it people come from all over the superintendents house and the office were just inside the gate they drove on and came to a superb colonnaded building meehan tapped on the glass and dormer braked to a halt meehan wound down the window this is what they call a columbarium he said some people like to store the ashes in an urn and keep it on display there are niches in all the walls most of them full we try to discourage it these days and what would you recommend fallon demanded irony in his voice strewing meehan said seriously scattering the ashes on the grass and brushing them in we come out of the earth we go back to it ill show you if you like after the funeral fallon couldnt think of a single thing to say the man took himself so seriously it was really quite incredible he sat back and waited for what was to come the chapel and the crematorium were in the centre of the estate and several hundred yards from the main gate for obvious reasons there were several cars parked there already and a hearse waited with a coffin at the back bonati at the wheel meehan said we usually bring the hearse on ahead of the rest of the party if the relations agree you cant have a cortege following the coffin these days not with present day traffic the procession gets split wide open a moment later a limousine turned out of the drive followed by three more billy was sitting up front beside the driver meehan got out of the car and approached hat in hand to greet the mourners it was quite a performance and fallon watched fascinated as meehan moved from one group to the next his face grave full of concern he was particularly good with the older ladies the coffin was carried into the chapel and the mourners followed it in meehan joined on at the end and pulled at fallons sleeve you might as well go in see the lot the service was painfully brief almost as synthetic as the taped religious music with its heavenly choir background fallon was relieved when the proceedings came to an end and some curtains were closed by an automatic device hiding the coffin from view they pull it through into the funeral room on a movable belt meehan whispered ill take you round there when theyve all moved off he did a further stint with the relatives when they got outside a pat on the back where it was needed an old ladys hand held for an instant it was really quite masterly finally he managed to edge away and nodded to fallon they moved round to the rear of the building he opened a door and led the way in there were four enormous cylindrical furnaces two were roaring away another was silent the fourth was being raked out by a man in a white coat meehan nodded familiarly arthurs all we need in here he said everythings fully automatic here ill show you the coffin fallon had last seen in the chapel stood waiting on a trolley rubber doors in the wall meehan explained it comes straight through on the rollers and finishes on the trolley he pushed it across to the cold oven and opened the door the coffin was at exactly the right height and moved easily on the trolley rollers when he pushed it inside he closed the door and flicked a red switch there was an immediate roar and through the glass peephole fallon could see flames streak into life inside thats all it needs meehan said these ovens operate by radiant heat and theyre the last word in efficiency an hour from beginning to end and you dont need to worry about preheating the moment it reaches around a thousand degrees centigrade that coffin will go up like a torch fallon peered through the glass and saw the coffin suddenly burst into flames he caught a glimpse of a head hair flaming and looked away hurriedly meehan was standing beside the oven where arthur was busily at work with his rake have a look at this this is what youre left with all that remained was a calcined bony skeleton in pieces as arthur pushed at it with the rake it broke into fragments falling through the bars into the large tin box below which already contained a fair amount of ash meehan pulled it out picked it up and carried it across to a contraption on a bench by the wall this is the pulveriser he said emptying the contents of the tin box into the top he clamped down the lid just watch two minutes is all it takes he flicked a switch and the machine got to work making a terrible grinding noise when meehan was satisfied he switched off and unscrewed a metal urn on the underside and showed it to fallon who saw that it was about threequarters full of powdery grey ash you notice theres a label already on the urn meehan said thats very important we do everything in strict rotation no possibility of a mistake he pulled open a drawer in a nearby desk and took out a white card edged in black and the next of kin get one of these with the plot number on what we call a restinpeace card now come outside and ill show you the final step it was still raining as they moved along the path at the back of the building between cypress trees they came out into a lawned area crisscrossed by box hedges the edges of the paths were lined with numbered plates a gardener was working away beside a wheelbarrow hoeing a flowerbed and meehan called more work for the undertaker fred better note it down in your little black book the gardener produced a notebook into which he entered the particulars typed on the urn label number five hundred and thirtyseven mr meehan he said when hed finished all right fred get it down meehan told him the gardener moved to the plate with the correct number and strewed the ashes across the damp grass then he got a besom and brushed them in meehan turned to fallon thats it the whole story ashes to ashes a restinpeace card with the right number on it is all thats left they walked back towards the chapel meehan said td rather be buried myself its more fitting but youve got to give people what they want they went round to the front of the chapel billy and bonati had gone but dormer was still there and varley had arrived in the other limousine the crematorium superintendent appeared wanting a word with meehan and fallon was for the moment left alone the stench of that open grave was still in his nostrils just inside the main door to the chapel there was a toilet and he went inside and bathed his face and hands in cold water a pane of glass in the small window above the basin was missing and rain drifted through he stood there for a moment suddenly depressed the open grave the toeless feet protruding from the rotting coffin had been a hell of a start to the day and now this a man came down to so little in the end a handful of ashes when he went outside meehan was waiting for him well thats it he said do you want to see another one not if i can help it meehan chuckled ive got two more this morning but never mind varley can take you back to jennys place he grinned broadly not worth going out on a day like this unless you have to id stay in if i were you i mean it could get interesting shes a real little firecracker when she gets going is our jenny i know fallon said you told me he got into the rear seat of the limousine and varley drove away instead of going down to the main gate he followed a track that was barely wide enough for the car and round to the right through trees i hope you dont mind mr fallon but it saves a good mile and a half this way they came to a fivebarred gate he got out opened it drove through and got out to close the gate again the main road was fifty yards farther on at the end of the track as they moved down towards the centre of the city fallon said you can drop me anywhere here charlie but you cant do that mr fallon you know you cant varley groaned you know what mr meehan said ive got to take you back to jennys place well you tell mr meehan with my compliments that he can do the other thing they were moving along rockingham street now and as they came to the holy name fallon leaned over suddenly and switched off the ignition as the car coasted to a halt he opened the door jumped out and crossed the road varley щwatched him go into the side entrance of the church then drove rapidly away to report ii the gospel according to fallon the right reverend monsignor canon ohalloran administrator of the procathedral was standing at his study window when miller and fitzgerald were shown in he turned to greet them moving towards his desk leaning heavily on a stick his left leg dragging good morning gentlemen or is it sometimes i think this damned rain is never going to stop he spoke with a belfast accent and miller liked him at once and for no better reason than the fact that in spite of his white hair he looked as if hed once been a useful heavyweight fighter and his nose had been broken in a couple of places miller said tm detectivesuperintendent miller sir i believe you know inspector fitzgerald i do indeed one of our knights of st columba stalwarts monsignor ohalloran eased himself into the chair behind the desk the bishop is in rome im afraid so youll have to make do with me you got my letter sir oh yes it was delivered by hand last night i thought that might save time miller hesitated and said carefully i did ask that father da costa should be present hes waiting in the next room monsignor ohalloran filled his pipe from an old pouch methodically i thought id hear what the prosecution had to say first miller said youve got my letter it says it all there and what do you expect me to do make father da costa see reason he must help us in this matter he must identify this man if your supposition is correct the pope himself couldnt do that superintendent monsignor ohalloran said calmly the secret nature of the confessional is absolute in a case like this miller said angrily thats ridiculous and you know it inspector fitzgerald put a restraining hand on his arm but monsignor ohalloran wasnt in the least put out he said mildly to a protestant or a jew or indeed to anyone outside the catholic religion the whole idea of confession must seem absurd an anachronism that has no place in this modern world wouldnt you agree superintendent when i consider this present situation then i must say i do miller told him the church has always believed confession to be good for the soul sin is a terrible burden and through the medium of confession people are able to relieve themselves of that burden and start again miller stirred impatiently but ohalloran continued in the same calm voice he was extraordinarily persuasive for a confession to be any good as therapy it has to be told to someone which is where the priest comes in only as gods intermediary of course and one can only expect people to unburden themselves when they know that what they say is absolutely private and will never be revealed on any account but this is murder were talking about monsignor miller said murder and corruption of a kind that would horrify you i doubt that monsignor ohalloran laughed shortly and put another match to his pipe its a strange thing but in spite of the fact that most people believe priests to be somehow cut off from the real world i come face to face with more human wickedness in a week than the average man does in a lifetime very interesting miller said but i fail to see the relevance very well superintendent try this during the last war i was in a german prisonerofwar camp where escape plans were constantly being frustrated because somebody was keeping the german authorities informed of every move that was made he heaved himself up out of his seat and hobbled to the window i knew who it was knew for months the man involved told me at confession and you did nothing miller was genuinely shocked oh i tried to reason with him privately but there was nothing else i could do no possibility of my even hinting to the others what was going on he turned a weary smile on his face you think it easy carrying that kind of burden superintendent let me tell you something i hear confessions at the cathedral regularly not a week passes that someone doesnt tell me something for which they could be criminally liable at law miller stood up so you cant help us then i didnt say that ill talk to him hear what he has to say would you wait outside for a few minutes certainly but id like to see him again in your presence before we leave as you wish they went out and monsignor ohalloran pressed a button on the intercom on his desk til see father da costa now it was a bad business and he felt unaccountably depressed in a personal sense he stared out at the rain swept garden wondering what on earth he was going to say to da costa and then the door clicked open behind him he turned slowly as da costa crossed to the desk michael what on earth am i going to do with you tm sorry monsignor father da costa said formally but this situation was not of my choosing they never are monsignor ohalloran said wryly as he sat down is it true what they suppose is this business connected in some way with the confessional yes father da costa said simply i thought so the superintendent was right of course as he said in his letter it was the only explanation that made any kind of sense he sighed heavily and shook his head i would imagine he intends to take this thing further are you prepared for that of course father da costa answered calmly then wed better get it over with monsignor ohalloran pressed the button on the intercom again send in superintendent miller and inspector fitzgerald he chuckled it has a certain black humour this whole business you must admit has it monsignor but of course they sent you to holy name as a punishment didnt they to teach you a little humility and here you are up to your ears in scandal again he smiled wryly i can see the expression on the bishops face now the door opened and miller and fitzgerald were ushered in again miller nodded to da costa good morning father monsignor ohalloran pushed himself up on to his feet again conscious that somehow the situation demanded it he said ive discussed this matter with father da costa superintendent to be perfectly frank there doesnt seem to be a great deal i can do i see sir miller turned to father da costa til ask you again father and for the last time are you prepared to help us tm sorry superintendent father da costa told him so am i father miller was chillingly formal now ive discussed the situation with my chief constable and this is what ive decided to do a report on this whole affair and your part in it goes to the director of public prosecutions today to take what action he thinks fit and where do you think that will get you monsignor ohalloran asked him i should think theres an excellent chance that theyll issue a warrant for the arrest of father da costa on a charge of being an accessory after the fact of murder monsignor ohalloran looked grave and yet he shook his head slowly youre wasting your time superintendent they wont play theyll never issue such a warrant well see sir miller turned and went out followed by fitzgerald monsignor ohalloran sighed heavily and sat down so there we are now we wait tm sorry monsignor father da costa said i know michael i know ohalloran looked up at him is there anything i can do for you anything at all will you hear my confession monsignor f of course father da costa moved round to the side of the desk and knelt down when fallon went into the church anna was playing the organ it was obviously a practice session hymns in the main nothing complicated he sat in the front pew listening and after a while she stopped playing abruptly he walked up the steps between the choir stalls the curse of the church organists life hymns he said she swung round to face him youre early uncle michael said one oclock id nothing else to do she stood up would you like to play not at the moment all right she said then you can take me for a walk i could do with some air her trench coat was in the sacristy he helped her on with it it was raining heavily when they went outside but she didnt seem concerned where would you like to go he asked her oh this will do fine i like churchyards i find them very restful she took his arm and they followed the path between the old victorian monuments and gravestones the searching wind chased leaves amongst the stones so that they seemed like living things crawling along the path in front of them they paused beside an old marble mausoleum for fallon to light a cigarette and it was that precise moment that billy meehan and varley appeared at the side gate they saw fallon and the girl at once and ducked back out of sight see hes still here varley said thank god for that you go back to pauls square and wait for jack billy said tell him where i am ill keep watch here varley moved away and billy slipped in through the gate and worked his way towards fallon and anna using the monuments for cover anna said id like to thank you for what you did last night it was nothing one of the men involved was an old friend of yours ohara wasnt that his name fallon said quickly no youve got it wrong i dont think so she insisted uncle michael spoke to him after youd left in the pub across the road he told him a great deal about you belfast londonderry the isa the bastard fallon said bitterly he always had a big mouth that one somebody will be closing his eyes with pennies one of these fine days if he isnt careful i dont think he meant any harm uncle michaels impression was that he thought a great deal about you she hesitated and said carefully things happen in war sometimes that nobody intends fallon cut in on her sharply i never go back to anything in thought or deed it doesnt pay they turned into another path and he looked up at the rain god is it never going to stop what a world even the bloody sky wont stop weeping you have a bitter view of life mr fallon i speak as i find and as far as i am concerned life is one hell of a name for the world as it is and is there nothing then she demanded not one single solitary thing worth having in this world of yours only you he said they were close to the presbytery now and billy meehan observed them closely with the aid of a pair of binoculars from behind a mausoleum anna stopped walking and turned to face fallon what did you say youve no business here he made a sweeping gesture with one arm encompassing the whole cemetery this place belongs to the dead and youre still alive and you there was a long pause and then he said calmly no its different for me im a dead man walking have been for a long time now she was to remember that remark always as one of the most terrible things she had ever heard in her life she stared up at him those calm blind eyes fixed on some point in space and then she reached up and pulled down his head and kissed him hard her mouth opening in a deliberately provocative gesture she pulled way did you feel that she demanded fiercely щdid i break through i think you could say that he said in some amazement good she said im going in now i want to change and then i have lunch to get ready youd better play the organ or something until my uncle gets back all right fallon said and turned away he had only taken a few steps when she called oh and fallon when he turned she was standing in the porch the door halfopen think of me remember me concentrate on that i exist im real she went in and dosed the door and fallon turned and walked away quickly it was only when he was out of sight that billy moved from the shelter of the mausoleum holding his binoculars in one hand fallon and the priests niece now that was interesting he was about to turn away when a movement at one of the presbytery windows caught his eye he moved back into cover and raised the binoculars anna was standing at the window and as he watched she started to unbutton her blouse his mouth went dry a hand seemed to squeee his insides and when she unzipped her skirt and stepped out of it his hands clutching the binoculars started to shake the bitch he thought and shes fallons woman fallons the ache between his thighs was almost unbearable and he turned and hurried away fallon had been playing the organ for just over an hour when he paused for breath it had been a long time and his hands were aching but it was good to get down to it again he turned and found father da costa sitting in the front pew watching him arms folded how long have you been there fallon got up and started down the steps between the choir stalls half and hour maybe more father da costa said youre brilliant you know that dont you used to be before you took up the gun for dear old mother ireland and that glorious cause fallon went very still when he spoke it was almost in a whisper thats of no interest to you its of every interest father da costa told him to me in particular for obvious reasons good god man how could you do what youve done and you with so much music in you sir philip sidney was reputed to be the most perfect of all knights of the court of elizabeth tudor fallon said he composed music and wrote poetry like an angel in his lighter moments he and sir walter raleigh herded irishmen together into convenient spots and butchered them like cattle all right father da costa said point taken but is that how you see yourself as a soldier my father was fallon sat back on the altar rail he was a sergeant in the parachute regiment killed at amhem fighting for the english theres irony for you and what happened to you my grandfather raised me he had a hill farm in the sperrins sheep mostly a few horses i ran happily enough wild and barefooted till the age of seven when the new schoolmaster who was also organist of the church discovered i had perfect pitch life was never the same after that and you went to trinity college fallon frowned slightly who told you that your friend ohara did you take a degree there was sudden real humour in fallons eyes would you i believe me now father if i told you the farm boy became a doctor of music no less why not da costa replied calmly beethovens mother was a cook but never mind that the other how did that start time and chance i went to stay with a cousin of mine in belfast one weekend in august i he lived in the falls road you may remember what happened father da costa nodded gravely i think so an orange mob led by b specials swarmed in bent on burning every catholic house in the area to the ground they were stopped by a handful of ira men who took to the streets to defend the area and you became involved somebody gave me a rifle lets put it that way and i discovered a strange thing what i aimed at i hit you were a natural shot exactly fallons face was dark and suddenly he took the ceska out of his pocket when i hold this when my fingers on the trigger a strange thing happens it becomes an extension and extension of me personally does that make sense oh yes father da costa said but of the most horrible kind so you continued to kill to fight fallon said his face stony and he slipped the ceska back inside his pocket as a soldier of the irish republican army and it became easier each time it became easier fallon straightened slowly his eyes were very dark he made no reply father da costa said ive just come from a final showdown with superintendent miller would you be interested to know what he intends all right tell me hes laying the facts before the director of public prosecutions and asking him for a warrant charging me with being an accessory after the fact to murder hell never make it stick and what if he succeeds would it cause you the slightest concern probably not good honesty at last theres hope for you yet and your cause fallon irish unity or freedom or hatred of the bloody english or whatever it was was it worth it the shooting and bombings people dead people crippled fallons face was very white now the eyes jet black expressionless i enjoyed every golden moment he said calmly and the children father da costa demanded was it worth that that was an accident fallon said hoarsely it always is but at least there was some semblance of reason to it however mistaken but krasko was plain coldblooded murder fallon laughed softly all right father you want answers ill try and give you some he walked to the altar rail and put a foot on it leaning an elbow on his knee chin in hand theres a poem by ezra pound i used to like some quick to arm it says and then later walked eyedeep in hell believing in old mens lies well that was my cause at the final end of things old mens lies and for that i personally killed over thirty people assisted at the end of god knows how many more all right so you were mistaken in the end violence in that sort of situation gains you nothing i could have told you that before you started but krasko father da costa shook his head that i dont understand look we live in different worlds fallon told him people like meehan theyre renegades so am i i engage in a combat thats nothing to do with you and the rest of the bloody civilians we inhabit our own world krasko was a whoremaster a pimp a drugpusher whom you murdered father da costa repeated inexorably i fought for my cause father fallon said killed for it even when i ceased to believe it worth a singlehuman life that was murder but now now i only kill pigs the disgust the selfloathing were dear in every word he spoke father da costa said with genuine compassion the world cant be innocent with man in it and what in the hell is that pearl of wisdom supposed to mean fallon demanded perhaps i can explain best by telling you a story father da costa said i spent several years in a chinese communist prison camp after being captured in korea what they called a special indoctrination centre fallon could not help but be interested brainwashing he said thats right from their point of view i was a special target the catholic churchs attitude to communism being what it is they have an extraordinarily simple technique and yet it works so often the original concept is pavlovian a question of inducing guilt or rather of magnifying the guilt that is in all of us shall i tell you the first thing my instructor asked me whether i had a servant at the mission to clean my room and make my bed when i admitted that i had he expressed surprise produced a bible and read to me that passage in which our lordspeaks of serving others yet here was i allowing one of those i had come to help to serve me amazing how guilty that one small point made me feel and you fell for that a man can fall for almost anything when hes halfstarved and kept in solitary confinement and they were clever make no mistake about that to use the appropriate marxian terminology each man has his thesis and his antithesis for a priest his thesis is everything he believes in everything he and his vocation stand for and his antithesis his darker side the side which is present in all of us fear hate violence aggression the desires of the flesh this is the side they work on inducing guilt feelings to such a degree in an attempt to force a complete breakdown only after that can they start their own particular brand of reeducation what did they try on you with me it was sex father da costa smiled a path they frequently follow where catholic priests are concerned celibacy being a state they find quite unintelligible what did they do halfstarved me left me on my own in a damp cell for three months then put me to bed between two young women who were presumably willing to give their all for the cause just like you he laughed it was rather childish really the idea was i suppose that i should be racked with guilt because i experienced an erection whereas i took it to be a chemical reaction perfectly understandable in the circumstances it seemed to me that would be gods view also so no sin in you then driven snow is that it not at all i am a very violent man mr fallon there was a time in my life when i enjoyed killing perhaps if theyd щworked on that they would have got somewhere it was to escape that side of myself that i entered the church it was still is my greatest weakness but at least i acknowledged its existence he paused and then said deliberately do you any man can know about things fallon said its knowing the significance of things thats important he paused and father da costa said go on what do you want me to do drain the cup fallon demanded the gospel according to fallon all right if thats what you want he mounted the steps leading up to the pulpit and stood at the lectern i never realised you had such a good view what do you want me to say anything you like all right we are fundamentally alone nothing lasts there is no purpose to any of it you are wrong father da costa said you leave out god god fallon cried what kind of a god allows a world where children can be happily singing one minute here his voice faltered for a moment and blown into strips of bloody flesh the next can you honestly tell me you still believe in a god after what they did to you in korea are you telling me you never faltered not once strength comes from adversity always father da costa told him i crouched in the darkness in my own filth for six months once on the end of a chain there was one day one moment when i might have done anything and then the stone rolled aside and i smelled the grave saw him walk out on his own two feet and i knew fallon i knew well all i can say is that if he exists your god i wish to hell you could get him to make up his mind hes big on how and when not so hot on why have you learned nothing then father da costa demanded oh yes fallon said ive learned to kill with a smile father thats very important but the biggest lesson of all i learned too late and what might that be that nothing is worth dying for it was suddenly very quiet only the endless rain drifting against the windows fallon came down the steps of the pulpit buckling the belt of his trench coat he paused beside father da costa and the real trouble is father that nothings worth living for either he walked away down the aisle his footsteps echoing the door banged the candles flickered father da costa knelt down at the altar rail folded his hands and prayed as he had seldom prayed before after a while a door clicked open and a familiar voice said uncle michael are you there he turned to find anna standing outside the sacristy door over here he called she moved towards him and he went to meet her reaching for her outstretched hands he took her across to the front pew and they sat down and as usual she sensed his mood what is it she said her face full of concern wheres mr fallon gone he said we had quite a chat i think i understand more now hes dead inside she said everything frozen and racked by selfhate he hates himself so he hates all of life he has no feelings left not in any normal sense in fact it is my judgment that the man is probably seeking death one possible reason for him to continue to lead the life he does but i dont understand she said he puts his whole life on the scales gave himself for a cause he believed was an honourable one gave everything he had a dangerous thing to do because if anything goes wrong if you find that in the final analysis your cause is as worthless as a bent farthing youre left with nothing he told me he was a dead man walking she said i think thats how he sees himself she put a hand on his arm but what can you do she said what can anyone do help him find himself save his soul perhaps i dont really know but i must do something i must he got up walked across to the altar rail knelt down and started to pray i more work for the undertaker fallon was in the kitchen having tea щwith jenny when the doorbell rang she went to answer it when she came back jack meehan and billy followed her into the room all right sweetheart meehan told her make yourself scarce this is business she gave fallon a brief troubled look hesitated then went out shes taken a shine to you i can see that meehan commented he sat on the edge of the table and poured himself a cup of tea billy leaned against the wall by the door hands in his pockets watching fallon sullenly shes a nice kid fallon said but you havent come here to discuss jenny meehan sighed youve been a naughty boy again fallon i told you when i left you this morning to come back here and keep under cover and what did you do at the first opportunity gave poor old varley the slip again and that isnt nice because he knows how annoyed i get and he has a weak heart make your point all right you went to see that bloody priest again like hell he did billy put in from the doorway he was with that da costa bird in the churchyard the blind girl meehan said thats right she kissed him meehan shook his head sorrowfully leading the poor girl on like that and you leaving the country after tomorrow shes a right whore billy said viciously undressing at the bloody window she was anybody could have seen her thats hardly likely fallon said not with a twentyfoot wall round the churchyard i thought i told you to stay away from there whats wrong billy jeered frightened ill queer your pitch want to keep it all for yourself fallon stood up slowly and the look on his face would have frightened the devil himself go near that girl again harm her in any way and ill kill you he said simply and his voice was the merest whisper jack meehan turned and slapped his brother across the face backhanded you randy little pig he said sex thats all you can think about as if i dont have enough troubles go on get out of it billy got the door open and glared at fallon his face white with passion you wait you bastard ill fix you you see if i dont you and your posh bird i said get out of here meehan roared and billy did just that slamming the door behind him meehan turned to fallon til see he doesnt step out of line dont you worry fallon put a cigarette between his lips and lit it with a taper from the kitchen fire and you he said who keeps you in line meehan laughed delightedly nothing ever throws you does it i mean when miller walked into church yesterday and found you talking to the priest i was worried i can tell you but when you sat down at that organ he shook his head and chuckled that was truly beautiful there was a slight frown on fallons face you were there oh yes i was there all right meehan lit a cigarette theres one thing i dont understand and what would that be you could have put a bullet in my head last night instead of into that mirror why didnt you i mean if da costa is so important to you and you think im some sort of threat to him it would have been the logical thing to do and what would have happened to my passport and passage on that boat out of hull sunday night median chuckled you dont miss a trick do you were a lot alike fallon you and me id rather be the devil himself fallon told him with deep conviction medians face darkened coming the superior bit again are we my life for ireland the gallant rebel gun in hand there was anger in his voice now dont give me that crap fallon you enjoyed it for its own sake running around in a trench coat with a gun in your pocket like something out of an old movie you enjoyed the killing shall i tell you how i know because youre too bloody good at it not to have done fallon sat there staring at him his face very white and then by some mysterious alchemy the ceska was in his hand meehan laughed harshly you need me fallon remember without me theres no passport and no passage out of hull sunday so put it away like a good boy he walked to the door and opened it fallon shifted his aim slightly following him and meehan turned to face him all right then lets see you pull that trigger fallon held the gun steady meehan stood there waiting hands in the pockets of his overcoat after a while he turned slowly and went out closing the door behind him for a moment or so longer fallon held the ceska out in front of him staring into space and then very slowly he lowered it resting his hand on the table his finger still on the trigger he was still sitting there when jenny came in theyve gone she said fallon made no reply and she looked down at the gun with distaste what did you need that thing for what happened nothing much he said he held up a mirror thats all but there was nothing there that i hadnt seen before he pushed back his hair and stood up i think ill get a couple of hours sleep i he moved to the door and she said diffidently would you like me to come up it was as if he hadnt heard her and went out quietly trapped in some dark world of his own she sat down at the table and buried her face in her hands when fitzgerald went into millers office the superintendent was standing by the window reading a carbon copy of a letter he offered it to fitzgerald thats what we sent to the director of public prosecutions fitzgerald read it quickly that seems to sum up the situation pretty adequately to me sir he said as he handed the letter back when can we expect a decision thats the trouble theyll probably take a couple of days unofficially ive already spoken to the man wholl be handling it by telephone and what did he think sir if you really want to know he wasnt too bloody hopeful millers frustration was a tangible thing anything to do with religion you know what people are like thats the english for you i see sir fitzgerald said slowly it was only then that miller noticed that the inspector was holding a flimsy in his right hand what have you got there fitzgerald steeled himself bad news im afraid sir from cro about that ceska miller sat down wearily all right tell me the worst according to the computer the last time a ceska was used to kill someone in this country was in june nineteen fiftytwo sir a polish exserviceman shot his wife and her lover to death they hanged him three months later marvellous miller said bitterly thats all i needed of course theyre circulating arms dealers in the london area for us fitzgerald said it will take time but something could come out of that line of enquiry i know miller said bitterly pigs might also fly he i pulled on his raincoat do you know what the unique feature of this case is i dont think so sir then ill tell you theres nothing to solve we already know whos behind the killing jack meehan and if that damned priest would only open his mouth i could have his head on a platter miller turned angrily and walked out banging the door so hard that the glass panel cracked fallon had only taken off his shoes and jacket and had lain on top of the bed he awakened to find the room in darkness he had been covered with an eiderdown which meant that jenny must have been in it was just after eight when he checked his watch and he pulled on his shoes hurriedly grabbed his jacket and went downstairs jenny was doing some ironing when he went into the kitchen she glanced up i looked in about three hours ago but you were asleep you should have wakened me he said and took down his raincoat from behind the door jack meehan said you werent to go out i know he transferred the ceska to the pocket of his raincoat and fastened the belt its that girl isnt it she said youre worried about her he frowned slightly and she rested the iron oh i was listening outside the door i heard most of what went on whats she like shes blind fallon said that means shes vulnerable and youre worried about billy you think he might try to pay you off for what happened last night by getting at her something like that i dont blame you she started to iron a crisp white blouse let me tell you about him so you know what youre up against at twelve most boys are lucky if theyve learnt how to make love to their hand but not our billy at that age he was having it off with grown women whores mostly working for jack meehan and billy was jacks brother so they didnt like to say no she shook her head he never looked back by the time he was fifteen he was a dirty sadistic little pervert it was downhill all the way after that she rested the iron again so if i were you id worry all right where hes concerned thanks he said dont wait up for me the door banged and he was gone she stood there for a moment staring into space sadly and then she returned to her ironing anna da costa was about to get into the bath when she heard the phone ringing she put on a robe and went downstairs arriving in the hall as her uncle replaced the receiver what is it she asked the infirmary the old italian lady i visited the other day shes had a relapse they expect her to die some time tonight ill have to go she took down his coat from the hallstand and held it out for him he opened the front door and they moved out into the porch the rain was pouring down til walk he said its not worth taking the van will you be all right dont worry about me she said how long will you be god knows probably several hours dont wait up for me he plunged into the rain and hurried down the path passing a magnificent victorian mausoleum the pride of the cemetery with its bronze doors and marble porch billy meehan dropped back into the shadows of the porch quickly but when the priest had gone past he moved forward again he had heard the exchange at the door and a cold finger of excitement moved in his belly he had already had intercourse twice that night with a prostitute not that it had been any good he didnt seem to be able to get any satisfaction any more hed intended going home and then hed remembered anna anna at the window undressing hed only been lurking in the shadows of that porch for ten minutes but he was already bitterly cold and rain drifted in on the wind he thought of fallon the humiliation of the previous night and his face contorted the bastard he said softly the little mick bastard ill show him he produced a halfbottle of scotch from his pocket and took a long pull father da costa hurried into the church he took a host out of the ciborium and hung it in a silver pyx around his neck he also took holy oils with him to anoint the dying womans ears nose mouth hands and feet and went out quietly the church was still and quiet only the images floating in candlelight the drift of rain against the window it was perhaps five minutes after father da costas departure that the door creaked open eerily and fallon entered he looked about him to make sure that no one was there then hurried down the aisle went inside the cage and pressed the button to ascend he didnt go right up to the tower stopping the cage on the other side of the canvas sheet covering the hole in the roof of the nave it only sloped slightly and he walked across the sheeting lead and paused at the low retaining wall sheltering in the angle of a buttress with the tower from here his view of the presbytery was excellent and two tall concrete lampposts in the street to the left towered above the cemetery walls throwing a band of light across the front of the house there was a light in one of the bedroom windows and he could see right inside the room a wardrobe a painting on the wall the end of a bed and then anna suddenly appeared wrapped in a large white towel from the look of things she had obviously just got out of the bath she didnt bother to draw the curtains probably secure in the knowledge that she was cut off from the street by twentyfoot high walls or perhaps it was something to do with her blindness as fallon watched she started to dry herself off strange how few women looked at their best in the altogether he told himself but she was more than passable the black hair almost reached the pointed breasts and a narrow waist swelled to hips that were perhaps a trifle too large for some tastes she pulled on a pair of holdup stockings black bra and pants and a green silk dress with a pleated skirt and started to brush her hair perhaps the most womanly of all actions fallon felt strangely sad no desire in him at all certainly not for anything physical just the sudden terrible knowledge that he was looking at something he could never have on top of this earth and there was no one to blame but himself she tied her hair back with a black ribbon and moved out of sight a second later the light went off fallon shivered as the wind drove rain in his face and turned up his collar it was very quiet only the occasional sound of a car muted in the distance and then quite clearly he heard the crunch of a foot in the gravel on the path below as he peered down a figure moved out of the shadows into the light the white shoulderlength hair identifying him at once billy meehan as fallon leaned forward the boy mounted the steps to the front door and tried the handle it opened to his touch and he passed inside fallon turned and scrambled back across the roof to the hoist he jumped inside the cage dosed the gate and pressed the button to descend his heart racing the sight of anna at the window had excited billy median to a state where he could no longer contain himself the ache between his legs was unbearable and the halfbottle of whisky which he had consumed had destroyed completely any last vestige of selfcontrol he moved into the porch and tried the door and when it opened to his touch he almost choked with excitement he tiptoed inside dosing it behind him and pushed the bolt home he could hear someone singing softly from a room at the end of the passage he approached quietly and peered in through the partly opened door anna was sitting at one end of a victorian sofa a small table at her elbow and the large sewingbox which stood on it was open she was sewing a button on a shirt and as he watched she reached into the mendingbox fumbled for a pair of scissors and cut the thread billy took off his overcoat dropped it to the floor and moved towards her shaking with excitement she was aware first of the coat dropping and then the faint sound of his approach and frowned her face turned towards him who is it is anyone there he paused momentarily and she stood up billy approached on tiptoe and as she halfturned clutching the shirt to her a needle in the other hand he circled behind her who is it she demanded fear in her voice he slipped a hand up her skirt from the rear cupping it between her thighs and giggled thats nice you like that dont you most girls like what i do to them she gave a cry of horror pulling away turning to face him at the same moment and he reached forward and slipped a hand inside the neck of her dress feeling for a breast anna cried out her face a mask of horror no please in the name of god who is it fallon he said its me fallon liar she screamed liar i and lashed out blindly catching him across the face billy slapped her backhanded til teach you you bitch ill make you crawl he knocked her back across the sofa tearing at her pants forcing her thighs apart brutally crushing his mouth on hers through the unbelievable horror of it the nameless disgust she was aware of his hand between his legs fumbling with the zip of his trousers and then the hardness pushing against her she screamed he slapped her again forcing her head back across the end of the sofa and her right hand grabbing at the table for support fastened upon the scissors she was almost unconscious by then so that as the darkness flooded over her she was not aware of her hand swinging convulsively driving the scissors up under the ribs with all the force of which she was capable piercing the heart and frilling him instantly finding the front door barred fallon had only been able to gain entry by breaking a kitchen window he arrived in the sitting room to find billy meehan sprawled across the unconscious girl and hurled himself on him it was only in dragging him away that he saw the handle of the scissors protruding beneath the ribs he picked her up in his arms and carried her upstairs the first room he tried was obviously her uncles but the second was hers and he laid her on the bed and covered her with an eiderdown he sat there holding her hand and after a while her eyelids flickered she started violently and tried to pull her hands away fallon said soothingly there now its me martin fallon youre all right now youve nothing to worry about she gave a great shuddering sigh thank god thank god what happened cant you remember only this dreadful man he said he was you and then he tried to he tried to she shuddered oh god the feel of his hands it was horrible horrible i fainted i think thats right fallon said calmly then i arrived and he ran away she turned her face to him those blind eyes focusing to one side did you see who it was tm afraid not was it she hesitated do you think meehan was behind it i should imagine so she closed her eyes and when fallon gently took her hand she pulled it away convulsively it was as if for the moment she could not bear the touch of a man any man he steeled himself for the obvious question did he have his way with you no i dont think so would you like me to get you a doctor for gods sake no not that the very idea that anyone should know fills me with horror and your uncle hes attending a dying woman at the infirmary he could be hours fallon stood up all right stay here and rest ill bring you a brandy she closed her eyes again the lids were pale translucent she seemed very vulnerable and fallon went down the stairs full of controlled icecold anger he dropped to one knee beside billy meehan took out a handkerchief wrapped it around the handle of the scissors and pulled them out there was very little blood and obviously most of the bleeding was internal he cleaned the scissors then went to the door and picked up the boys overcoat some car keys fell to the floor he picked them up mechanically then draped the coat across the body as he looked down at it he was conscious only of disgust and loathing the world was well rid of billy meehan his ending had been richly deserved but could anna da costa live with the knowledge that she had killed him and even if the verdict of the court was as it should be even if she were exonerated the whole world would know at the thought of the shame the humiliation for that gentle creature fallons anger was so great that he kicked the corpse in the side and in the same moment a thought came to him that was so incredible it almost took his breath away what if she didnt have to know now or ever what if billy meehan vanished utterly and completely from the face of the earth as if he had never existed there was a way it could be done in any event he owed it to her to try the keys which had fallen from the overcoat pocket indicated the presence of billys car somewhere in the vicinity and if it was the red scimitar it should be easy enough to find fallon let himself out of the front door hurried through the cemetery to the side gate the scimitar was parked at the kerb only a few yards away he unlocked the tailgate and when he opened it tommy the grey whippet barked once then nuzled his hand the presence of the dog was unfortunate but couldnt be helped fallon closed the tailgate and hurried back to the presbytery he pulled off the overcoat and went through the boys pockets systematically emptying them of everything they held he removed a gold medallion on a chain around the neck a signet ring and a wrist watch and put them in his pocket then he wrapped the body in the overcoat heaved it over his shoulder and went out he paused at the gate to make sure that the coast was clear but the street was silent and deserted he crossed to the scimitar quickly heaved up the tailgate with one hand and dumped the body inside the whippet started to whine almost immediately and he dosed the tailgate quickly and went back to the presbytery he washed the scissors thoroughly in hot water in the kitchen went back to the sittingroom and replaced them in the mendingbox then he poured a little brandy in a glass and took it upstairs she was already half asleep but sat up to drink the brandy fallon said what about your uncle do you want him to know what happened yes yes i think so its right that he should know all right fallon said and he tucked the quilt around her go to sleep now ill be downstairs youve nothing to worry about ill wait till your uncle comes back he might be hours she said sleepily thats all right he walked to the door tm sorry to be such a nuisance she whispered i brought you to this he said if it hadnt been for me none of this would have happened its pointless to talk like that she said theres a purpose to everything under heaven a reason even for my blindness we cant always see it because were such little people but its there he was strangely comforted by her words god knows why and said softly go to sleep now and closed the door time now was the critical factor and he quietly let himself out of the front door and hurried through the churchyard to the scimitar strangely enough the whippet gave him no trouble during the drive it crouched in the rear beside the body whining only occasionally although when he put a hand on it it was trembling he approached pine trees crematorium by the back lane varley had used that morning getting out of the car to open the fivebarred gate that led into the estate he followed the same narrow track down through the cypress trees cutting the engine for the last hundred yards which was slightly downhill not that it mattered for as he remembered it the superintendents house and the main gate were a good quarter of a mile from the crematorium itself so noise was really no problem he left the scimitar at the side of the chapel and gained access by reaching in through the broken pane in the lavatory which he had noticed during his visit that morning and unfastening the window itself the chapel door had a yale lock so it opened easily enough from the inside he returned to the scimitar there was a torch in the glove compartment which he slipped into his pocket then he raised the tailgate and heaved the body over his shoulder the whippet tried to follow but he managed to shove it back inside with his free hand and dosed the tailgate again he gained access to the furnace room by sliding the body along the rollers of the movable belt and crawling through after it himself following the route the coffin had taken that morning the furnaces were cold and dark he opened the door of the first one and shoved the body inside next he produced the various items he had taken from billy meehans pockets and examined them in the light of the torch those things which would burn he placed on top of the body the ring the watch and the medal he put back in his pocket then he closed the oven door and pressed the switch he could hear the muted rumble of the gas jets as they roared into life and peered inside what was it meehan had said an hour at the most he lit a cigarette opened the back door and went outside the sound of the furnace in operation was barely discernible outside the building not at all when he moved a few yards away he went back inside to see what was happening the gauge was just coming up to the thousand degrees centigrade mark and as he peered through the observation panel in the door the wallet he had left on the bodys chest burst into flames the clothing was already smouldering there was a sudden bright flash and the whole body started to burn he lit another cigarette went and stood at the back door and waited at the end of the specified period he switched off there was part of the skull the pelvic girdle and some of the limbs dearly visible and much of this crumbled into even smaller pieces at the first touch of the rake he filled the tin box found a hand brush and shovel carefully swept up every trace of ash that he could see then closed the furnace door leaving it exactly as he had found it certainly all heat would be dissipated again before the morning he found an empty urn screwed it on the bottom of the pulveriser then poured in the contents of the tin box he clamped down the lid and switched on while he was waiting he opened the desk drawer and helped himself to a blank restinpeace card when he switched off about two minutes later and unscrewed the urn all that was left of billy meehan was about five pounds of grey ash he walked along the path to the point meehan had taken him to that morning until he came across a gardeners wheel barrow and various tools indicating where the man had stopped work that afternoon fallon checked the number plate and strewed the ashes carefully then he took a besom from the wheelbarrow and worked them well in when he was satisfied he replaced the besom exactly as he had found it turned and walked away it was when he reached the scimitar that he ran into his first snag for as he opened the door to get behind the wheel the whippet slipped through his legs and scampered away fallon went after it fast it went round the corner of the chapel and followed the path he had just used when he reached the place where he had strewn the ashes the whippet was crouching in the wet grass whining very softly fallon picked him up and fondled his ears talking softly to his as he walked back when he got behind the wheel this time he held on to the animal until he had dosed the door he put it in the rear seat and drove away quickly it was only after he had dosed the fivebarred gate behind him and turned into the main road again that he allowed that iron composure of his to give a little he gave a long shuddering sigh a partial release of tension and when he lit a cigarette his hands were trembling it had worked and there was a kind of elation in that for a while it had seemed that billy meehan might prove to be just as malignant an influence in death as he had been in life but not now he had ceased to exist had been wiped dean off the face of the earth and fallon felt not even a twinge of compunction as far as he was concerned billy meehan had been from under a stone not fit to wipe anna da costas shoes let be when he reached pauls square he turned into the mews entrance cautiously but luck was with him to the very end the yard was deserted he ran the scimitar into the garage left both the keys and the whippet inside and walked rapidly away when he got back to the presbytery there was no sign of father da costa fallon went upstairs on tiptoe and peered into annas bedroom she was sleeping soundly so he dosed her door and went back downstairs he went into the sitting room and checked the carpet carefully but there was no sign of blood so that was very much that he went to the sideboard and poured himself a large whisky as he was adding a dash of soda the front door opened fallon turned round as father da costa entered the room the priest stopped short in amazement fallon what are you doing here and then he turned very pale and said oh dear god i anna he turned and moved to the stairs and fallon went after him shes all right shes sleeping father da costa turned slowly what happened there was an intruder fallon said i arrived in time to chase him away one of meehans men fallon shrugged maybe i didnt get a good look at him father da costa paced up and down the hall fingers intertwined so tightly that the knuckles turned white oh my god he said when will it all end tm leaving on sunday night fallon told him theyve arranged passage for me on a ship out of hull and you think that will finish it father da costa shook his head youre a fool fallon jack meehan will never feel safe while i am still in the land of the living trust honour truth the sanctity of the given word none of these exist for him personally so why should he believe that they have a meaning for someone else all right fallon said its all my fault what do you want me to do theres only one thing you can do father da costa said set me free in the only way possible and spend my life in a maximum security cell fallon shook his head tm not that kind of hero he walked to the front door and father da costa said she at all right fallon nodded soberly a good nights rest is all she needs shes a much stronger person than you realise in every way he turned to go out and father da costa said that you arrived when you did was most fortuitous all right fallon said so i was watching the house father da costa shook his head sadly you see my friend good deeds in spite of yourself you are a lost man go to hell fallon said and he plunged out into the rain and walked rapidly away i the church militant father da costa was packing his vestment into a small suitcase when anna went into the study it was a grey morning that eternal rain still tapping at the window she was a little paler than usual but otherwise seemed quite composed her hair was tied back with a black ribbon and she wore a neat grey skirt and sweater father da costa took both her hands and led her to the fire are you all right im fine she said truly i am are you going out tm afraid i have to one of the nuns at the convent school of our lady of pity died yesterday sister marie gabrielle theyve asked me to officiate he hesitated i dont like leaving you nonsense she said til be all right sister claire will be bringing up the children from the junior school for choir practice at tenthirty i have a private lesson after that until twelve fine he said ill be back by then he picked up his case and she took his arm and they went through to the hall together youll need your raincoat he shook his head the umbrella will be enough he opened the door and hesitated ive been thinking anna perhaps you should go away for a while just until this thing is settled one way or the other no she said firmly he put down his case and took her by the shoulders standing there in the halfopen doorway ive never felt so helpless so confused after what happened last night i thought of speaking to miller but you cant do that she said quickly too quickly not without involving fallon he gazed at her searchingly you like him dont you its not the word i would choose she said calmly i feel for him he has been marked by life no used by life in an unfair way spoiled utterly there was a sudden passion in her voice no one could have the music in him that man has and have no soul god could not be so inhuman the greatest gift god gave to man was free will my dear good and evil each man has a free choice in the matter all right she said fiercely i only know one thing with any certainty when i needed help last night more than i have ever needed it in my life before it was fallon who saved me i know father da costa told her he was watching the house her entire expression changed colour touched those pale cheeks and you dont care what happens to him oh i care father da costa said gravely more than you perhaps understand i see a man of genius brought down to the level of the gutter i see a human being a fine human being committing for his own dark reasons a kind of personal suicide then help him she said to help himself father da costa shook his head sadly that only works in books seldom in life whoever he is this man who calls himself martin fallon one thing is certain he hates himself for what he has done for what he has become he is devoured by selfloathing but by now she looked completely bewildered i dont understand this not any of it he is a man who seeks death at every turn anna who would welcome him with open arms he shook his head oh yes i care what happens to martin fallon care passionately the tragedy is that he does not he turned and left her there in the porch and hurried away through the churchyard head down against the rain not bothering to raise his umbrella when he moved into the side porch to unlock the sacristy door fallon was sitting on the small bench leaning against the corner head on his chest hands in the pockets of his trench coat father da costa shook him by the shoulder and fallon raised his head and opened his eyes instantly he badly needed a shave and the skin of his face seemed to have tightened over the cheekbones and the eyes were vacant a long night father da costa said gently time to think fallon said in a strange dead voice about a lot of things any conclusions oh yes fallon stood up and moved out into the rain the right place for me a cemetery he turned to face da costa a slight smile on his lips you see father ive finally realised one very important thing and whats that father da costa asked him that i cant live with myself any more he turned and walked away very quickly and father da costa moved out into the rain one hand extended as if he would pull him back fallon he called hoarsely a few rooks lifted out of the tree on the other side of the churchyard fluttering in the wind like a handful of dirty black rags calling angrily as they settled again fallon turned the corner of the church and was gone when anna dosed the front door of the presbytery and went down the steps she was instantly aware of the organ she stood quite still looking across the cemetery towards the church head slightly turned as she listened the playing of course was quite unmistakable the heart quickened inside her she hurried along the path as fast as she dared tiptapping with her stick when she opened the sacristy door the music seemed to fill the church he was playing pavane for a dead infanta infinitely moving touching the very heart of things the deep places of life brilliant technique and emotion combining in a way she would never have thought possible he finished on a dying fall and sat shoulders hunched for a long moment as the last echoes died away when he swung round on the stool she was standing at the altar rail ive never heard such playing she told him he went down through the choir stalls and stood on the other side of the rail from her good funeral music his words touched the heart of her like a cold finger you mustnt speak like that she forced a smile did you want to see me lets say i hoped youd come here i am then i want you to give your uncle a message tell him im sorry more sorry than i can say but i intend to put things right youll have nothing more to worry about either of you he has my word on that but how she said i dont understand my affair fallon told her calmly i started it ill finish it goodbye anna da costa you wont see me again i never have she said sadly and put a hand on his arm as he went by isnt that a terrible thing he backed away slowly and delicately making not the slightest sound her face changed she put out a hand uncertainly mr fallon she said softly are you there fallon moved quickly towards the door it creaked when he opened it and as he turned to look at her for the last time she called martin come back and there was a terrible desperation in her voice fallon went out the door dosed with a sigh and anna da costa tears streaming down her face fell on her knees at the altar rail the little sisters of pity were not only teachers they also had an excellent record in medical missionary work overseas which was where father da costa had first met sister marie gabrielle in korea in nineteen fiftyone a fierce little frenchwoman who was probably the kindest most loving person he had met in his entire life four years in a communist prison camp had ruined her health but that indomitable spirit that allembracing love had not been touched in the slightest some of the nuns being human were crying as they sang the offertory domiae jesu christ rex glorias libera aniraas omnium fidelium their voices rose sweetly to the rafters of the tiny convent chapel as father da costa prayed for the repose of sister marie gabrielles soul for all sinners everywhere whose actions only cut them off from the infinite blessing of gods love for anna that she might come to no harm for martin fallon that he might face what must be done and for dandy jack meehan but here a terrible thing happened for his throat went dry and he seemed to choke on the very name once the mass was over and the absolutions given the nuns carried the coffin out through the rain to the small private cemetery in a corner between the inner and outer walls of the convent at the graveside father da costa sprinkled the grave and the coffin with holy water and incensed them and after he had prayed some of the nuns lit candles with some difficulty because of the rain to symbolise sister marie gabrielles soul with god now and shining still and they sang together very sweetly the twentythird psalm which had been her favourite father da costa remembered her for a moment during those last days the broken body racked with pain oh god he thought why is it the good who suffer people like sister marie gabrielle and then there was anna so gentle so loving and at the thought of what had taken place the night before black rage filled his heart try as he might the only thought that would come to mind as he looked down into the open grave was that meehans firm had probably made the coffin jenny fox had taken two sleeping pills the previous night and overslept it was after eleven when she awakened and she put on her dressinggown and went downstairs she went into the kitchen and found fallon sitting at the table the bottle of irish whiskey in front of him a halffilled tumbler at his elbow he had taken the ceska to pieces and was putting it carefully together again the silencer was also on the table next to the whiskey bottle youre starting early she commented a long time since i had a drink he said a real drink now ive had four i had some thinking to do he emptied his glass in a single swallow rammed the magazine into the butt of the ceska and screwed the silencer on the end of the barrel jenny said wearily did you come to any conclusions oh yes i think you could say that he poured himself another whiskey and tossed it down ive decided to start a jack meehanmustgo campaign a sort of one man crusade if you like you must be crazy she said you wouldnt stand a chance hell be sending for me some time today jenny he has to because hes shipping me out from hull tomorrow night so weve got things to discuss he squinted along the barrel of the gun and jenny whispered what are you going to do im going to kill the bastard he said simply you know what shakespeare said a good deed in a naughty world he was drunk she realised that but in his own peculiar way she said desperately dont be a fool kill him and therell be no passage out of hull for you what happens then i couldnt really care less he flung up his arm and fired there was a dull thud and a small china dog on the top shelf above the refrigerator shattered into fragments well now he said if i can hit that at this range after halfa bottle of whiskey i dont see how i can very well miss dandy jack he stood up and picked up the bottle of whiskey jenny said martin listen to me for gods sake he walked past her to the door i didnt go to bed last night so i will now wake me if meehan calls but whatever happens dont let me sleep past five oclock ive got things to do he went out and she stood there listening as he mounted the stairs she heard the door of his bedroom open and close and only then did she move going down on her hands and knees wearily to pick up the shattered fragments of the china dog the bull and bell yard was not far from pauls square a dirty and sunless cobbled alley named after the public house which had stood there for two hundred years or more beside the entrance to the snug stood several overflowing dustbins and cardboard boxes and packing cases were thrown together in an untidy heap the bull and bell itself did most of its trade in the evening which was why jack meehan preferred to patronise it in the afternoon for one thing it meant that he could have the snug to himself which was handy for business of a certain kind he sat on a stool a tankard of beer at his elbow finishing a roast beef sandwich and reading the financial times dormer was sitting in the window seat playing solitaire meehan emptied his tankard and pushed it across the bar same again harry harry was a large hefty young man who in spite of his white apron had the physique of a professional rugby player he had long dark sideburns and a cold rather dangerouslooking face as he filled the tankard and pushed it across the door opened and rupert and bonati came in rupert was wearing a sort of caped anklelength highwaymans coat in large checks he shook himself vigorously and unbuttoned his coat whens it going to stop thats what id like to know meehan drank some more beer and belched he said what in the hell do you want whos minding the shop rupert slid gracefully on to the stool next to him and put a hand on his thigh i do have to eat some time ducky i mean i need to keep my strength up dont i all right harry meehan said give him his bloody mary rupert said by the way does anyone know where billy is i havent seen him since last night meehan told him who wants him anyway the superintendent of pine trees phoned into the office just before i left and what did he want it seems they found billys whippet wandering about up there soaked to the skin and trembling life a leaf apparently wanted to know what to do with him meehan frowned what in the hell would it be doing up there dormer said last i saw of it was about half eight this morning when i went into the garage it was inside the scimitar i figured billy had forgotten about it when he came in last night so i let it out i mean hes done that before when hes been pissed or something left tommy in the car i mean he still hadnt come in when i came out this morning meehan said and if he left his car in the garage that means he went to one of the city centre dubs probably still in bed with some whore the dirty little bastard he turned to bonati youd better go up to pine trees and get it take it back home and give it something to eat all right mr meehan bonati said and went out meehan swallowed some more beer inconsiderate little swine ill kick his arse for him when i see him hes young mr meehan harry said hell learn he picked up a bucket of slops moved from behind the bar and opened the door and went out into the yard as he emptied the bucket across the cobbles father da costa entered the yard he was wearing his cassock and held the umbrella over his head against the rain harry looked him over in some amazement and father da costa said politely tm looking for mr meehan mr jack meehan they told me at his office that i might find him here inside harry said he moved into the snug and father da costa followed pausing just inside the door to put down his umbrella it was rupert who saw him first in the mirror behind the bar good god almighty he said there was a long silence and meehan turned on his stool very slowly and what in the hell are you doing there rattling the box for christmas or something will a quid get rid of you he took out his wallet ostentatiously and father da costa said quietly i was hoping we might have a few words in private he stood there with the umbrella in his hand the skirts of his cassock soaking wet from the long grass of the convent cemetery mud on his shoes grey beard tangled waiting for some sort of response meehan laughed out loud god but i wish you could see yourself you look bloody ridiculous men in skirts he shook his head itll never catch on father da costa said patiently i dont expect it will now can we talk meehan indicated donner and rupert with a wave of the hand theres nothing you can say to me that these two cant hear very well father da costa said its simple enough i want you to stay away from holy name and i dont want any repetition of what happened at the presbytery last night meehan frowned what in the hell are you talking about all right mr meehan father da costa said wearily last night someone broke into the presbytery when i was out and attacked my niece if fallon hadnt arrived at the right moment and chased the man away anything might have happened to her on the other hand i suppose youll now tell me that you know nothing about it no i bloody well dont meehan shouted father da costa struggled to contain his anger youre lying he said simply meehans face was suffused with blood the eyes bulging who in the hell do you think you are he demanded hoarsely its my final warning father da costa said when we last spoke i told you my god was a god of wrath as well as of love youd do well to remember that meehans face was purple with rage and he turned to the barman in fury get him out of here i harry lifted the bar flap and moved out right on your way mate til go when im ready father da costa told him harrys right hand fastened on his collar the other on his belt and they went through the door on the run to a chorus of laughter from donner and rupert they crowded to the door to see the fun and meehan joined them father da costa was on his hands and knees in the rain in a puddle of water whats up ducky rupert called have you pissed yourself or something it was a stupid remark childish in its vulgarity and yet it was some sort of final straw that set black rage boiling inside father da costa so that when harry dragged him to his feet an arm about his throat he reacted as he had been taught to react thirty years earlier in that hard brutal school of guerrilla warfare and action by night harry was grinning widely we dont like fancy sods like you coming round here annoying the customers he didnt get a chance to say anything else father da costas right elbow swung back into his ribs and he pivoted on one foot as harry reeled back gasping you should never let anyone get that close they havent been teaching you properly harry sprang forward his right fist swinging in a tremendous punch father da costa swayed to one side grabbed for the wrist with both hands twisted it round and up locking the arm and ran him headfirst into the stack of packing cases as father da costa turned donner came in fast and received a kick under the right kneecap perfectly delivered that doubled him over in pain and father da costa followed with a knee in the face that lifted him back against the wall rupert gave a cry of dismay and in his haste to regain the safety of the snug slipped on the top step bringing meehan down with him as meehan started to get up father da costa punched him in the face a good solid right hand that carried all his rage all his frustration with it bone crunched meehans nose flattened beneath father da costas knuckles and he fell back into the snug with a groan blood gushing from his nostrils rupert scrambled behind the bar on his hands and knees and father da costa stood over meehan the killing rage still on him his fists clenched and then he looked down at his hands saw the blood on them and an expression of horror appeared on his face he backed slowly out into the yard harry lay on his face amongst the packing cases donner was being sick against the wall father da costa looked in horror once again at the blood on his hands turned and fled when he went into his study at the presbytery anna was sitting by the fire knitting she turned her face towards him youre late i was worried he was still extremely agitated and had to force himself to sound calm tm sorry something came up she put down her knitting and stood up after youd gone when i went down to the church to get ready for choir practice fallon was playing the organ he frowned did he say anything did you speak with him he gave me a message for you she told him he said to tell you that it had all been his fault and he was sorry was there anything else yes he said that there was no need to worry from now on that hed started it so hed finish it and he told me we wouldnt be seeing him again what did he mean do you think he intends to give himself up god knows father da costa forced a smile and put a hand on her shoulder a gesture of reassurance im just going down to the church something i have to do i wont be long he left her there and hurried down through the cemetery entering the church by way of the sacristy he dropped on his knees at the altar rail hands clenched together and looked up at christ on the cross forgive me he pleaded heavenly father forgive me he bowed his head and wept for in his heart he knew there was not one single particle of regret for what he had done to jack meehan worse than that much worse was the still small voice that kept telling him that by wiping meehan off the face of the earth he would be doing mankind a favour meehan came out of the bathroom at the penthouse wearing a silk kimono and holding an ice bag to his face the doctor had been and gone the bleeding had stopped but his nose was an ugly swollen bruised hump of flesh that would never look the same again dormer bonati and rupert waited dutifully by the door dormers mouth was badly bruised and his lower lip was twice its usual size meehan tossed the ice bag across the room no bloody good at all that thing somebody get me a drink rupert hurried to the drinks trolley and poured a large brandy he carried it across to meehan who was standing at the window staring out in the square frowning slightly he turned suddenly and mysteriously his old self again he said to dormer frank what was the name of that old kid who was so good with explosives ellerman mr meehan is he the one youre thinking of thats him he isnt inside is he not that i know of good then i want him here within the next hour you go get him and you can tell him theres a couple of centuries in it for him he swallowed some mote of his brandy and turned to rupert and you sweetheart ive got just the job for you you can go and see jenny for me were going to need her too for what i have in mind rupert said do you think shell play she can be an awkward bitch when she feels like it not this time median chuckled til give you a proposition to put to her that she cant refuse he laughed again as if it was a particularly good joke and rupert glanced uncertainly at donner dormer said carefully whats it all about mr meehan ive had enough meehan said thats what its all about the priest fallon the whole bit im going to clean the slate once and for all take them both out this very night and heres how were going to do it harvey ellerman was fifty years of age and looked ten years older which came of having spent twentytwo years of his life behind bars if he added his various sentences together he was a small diffident individual who habitually wore a tweed cap and brown raincoat and seemed crushed by life yet this small anxiouslooking man was reputed to know more about explosives than any man in the north of england in the end his own genius had proved his undoing for such was the uniqueness of his approach to the task in hand that it was as if he had signed his own name each time he did a job and for some years the police had arrested him with monotonous regularity the moment he put a foot wrong he came out of the lift into the penthouse followed by donner holding a cheap fibre suitcase in one hand that was bound together by a cheap leather strap meehan went to meet him hand extended and ellerman put the suitcase down great to see you harvey meehan said hope youll be able to help did frank explain what im after he did mr meehan in a manner of speaking ellerman hesitated you wont want me personally on this thing mr meehan theres no question of that of course not meehan told him ellerman looked relieved its just that ive retired from active participation in anything mr meehan he said you know how it is too true i do harvey you were too bloody good for them he picked up ellermans suitcase and put it down on the table okay lets see what youve got ellerman unfastened the strap and opened the suitcase it contained a varied assortment of explosives carefully packed in tins a selection of fuses and detonators neat coils of wire and a rack of tools frank told me you wanted something similar to the sort of thing the ira have been using in ireland not just similar harvey i want it to be exactly the same when tie forensic boys get to examine whats left of this bomb i dont want there to be the slightest doubt in their minds where its come from all right mr meehan ellerman said in his flat colourless voice just as you say he produced a tin from the case well use this then a waverley biscuit tin made in belfast packed with plastic gelignite say twenty pounds that should do the trick what about a ruse ellerman held up a long slim dark pencil theyve been using a lot of these things lately chemical ruse of russian manufacture virtually foolproof once you break the cap seal youve got twenty minutes just the job meehan rubbed his hands together youd better get started then he turned and walked across to the window whistling happily grimsdyke fallon came awake to find jenny shaking him by the shoulder wake up she kept saying insistently wake up there was a slight persistent throbbing ache behind his right eye but otherwise he felt strangely lightheaded he sat up swinging his legs to the floor and ran his hands over his stubbled chin what time is it he asked her about four your friend father da costa was on the phone he wants to see you fallon straightened slowly and looked at her a slight puzzled frown on his face when was this about ten minutes ago i wanted to come and get you but he said there wasnt time and where does he want to see me at holy name she shook her head no he said he was taking his niece into the country he thought it would be safer for her a little place called grimsdyke its about twenty miles from here in the marshes he wants you to meet him there as soon as possible i see fallon said to you know where this place is she nodded i used to go there for picnics when i was a kid ive never been to this place hes going to mill house he called it but he told me how to get there fallon nodded slowly and youd take me if you like we could go in my car it wouldnt take much more than half an hour he stared at her the eyes very dark no expression there at all she glanced away nervously unable to meet his gaze and i flushed angrily look its no skin of my nose do you want to go or dont you he knew she was lying yet it didnt seem to matter because for some strange reason he knew beyond any shadow of a doubt that she was leading him in the right direction all right he said fine just give me a couple of minutes to get cleaned up ill meet you downstairs as soon as she had gone he took the ceska from his jacket pocket ejected the magazine reloaded carefully with eight rounds and slipped it into the righthand pocket of his trench coat he moved across to the window dropped to one knee and raised the carpet to disclose a browning automatic he had used at his first meeting with kristou in london underneath it was a large buff envelope containing the best part of two thousand pounds in tenpound notes the bulk of the money he had received from meehan he slipped the envelope into his breast pocket and checked the browning quickly he found a roll of surgical tape in the cabinet over the washbasin and cut off a couple of lengths using the razor jenny had loaned him then taped the browning to the inside of his left leg just above the anklebone covering it with his sock he buttoned his trench coat as he went downstairs jenny was waiting in the hall dressed in a red plastic mac she gave him a tight smile as she pulled on her gloves ready to go then he opened the front door but stopped her with a hand on her shoulder as she was about to step outside there isnt anything else is there anything youve forgotten to tell me she flushed and the anger was there in her voice again would i be likely to do a thing like that thats all right then he smiled calmly wed better get going he dosed the door and followed her down the steps to the minicooper parked at the bottom the marsh at grimsdyke on the river estuary was a wild lonely place of seacreeks and mud flats and great pale barriers of reeds higher than a mans head since the beginning of history men had come here for one purpose or another roman saxon dane norman but now it was a place of ghosts an alien world inhabited mainly by the birds curlew and redshank and brent geese coming south from siberia for the winter on the mud flats they passed through the village a pleasant enough little place thirty or forty houses a garage and pub and then they were out on the other side it was raining quite hard the wind driving it in off the sea and across the marshes in great clouds half a mile beyond the village on the right jenny glanced at fallon briefly thats what the man said this looks like it fallon told her she turned the cooper off the main road and followed a track no wider than a farm cart that was little more than a raised causeway of grass on either side miles of rough marsh grass and reeds marched into the heavy rain and a thin sea mist was drifting before the wind fallon lowered the window on his side and took a deep breath of the pungent salt air quite a place i used to love coming here when i was a kid she said it was like nowhere else on earth a different world after the city the closer they got to the estuary the more the mist seemed to close in on them and then they topped a rise and saw what was very obviously the mill sticking up above a clump of trees about a hundred yards to the south of them fallon put a hand on her arm and she braked to a halt now what well walk from here is that necessary if ive learned anything in life its never to take anything for granted she shrugged but got out of the car without further argument and fallon left the track and forced his way through a fir plantation towards the mill dimly seen through the trees he crouched under a bush pulling jenny down beside him and examined the place carefully there was a threestoreyed stone tower roof open to the sky at one end there was an extension made of wood which looked like a barn and seemed to be in a better state of repair than the rest of the building a thin trickle of smoke drifted up from an iron chimney at the other side there was an immense waterwheel and it was moving round now with an unearthly creaking and groaning forced by the rushing waters of the flooded stream no sign of his mini van fallon said softly hell have it inside that barn wont he jenny replied and then added impatiently for goodness sake make your mind up are we going on or arent we im getting wet she seemed angry and yet the fingers of her left hand trembled slightly he said you go give me a call if everything is all right she glanced at him with a certain surprise in her eyes then shrugged stood up and walked out into the open he watched her go all the way to the barn she turned to look at him once then opened the big double door and went in she reappeared a moment later and called its all right everythings fine come on fallon hesitated for a moment and then shrugged and walked out into the clearing a slight fixed smile on his face when he was four or five yards from the door jenny said theyre here and she went back inside he followed her in without hesitation the place smelled of old hay and mice there was a decrepit cart in one corner and a large loft ran round three sides of the building with round glassless windows letting in light a fire was burning in an old iron stove in the corner there was no sign of father da costa or anna not that fallon had really expected there to be only jenny standing alone beside a small iron cot bed against the far wall on which a little fairhaired girl was apparently sleeping covered by a blanket im sorry martin she said and there was genuine distress in her face now i didnt have any choice up here fallon a voice called fallon looked up and saw dormer on the edge of the loft holding an armalite rifle rupert was standing beside him clutching a sawnoff shotgun and harry the barman from the bull and bell appeared in the loft at the other side of the building some sort of revolver in his hand dormer raised the armalite a little they tell me that a bullet from one of these things goes in at the front and out at the back and takes a sizeable piece of you with it on the way so id advise you to stay very still oh i will fallon assured him without irony and he raised his hands harry came down the ladder from the loft first he looked terrible his left eye was completely closed and one side of his face was very badly bruised he stood a yard or two away covering fallon with his revolver while rupert followed him down the ladder when they were both in position donner lowered the armalite and joined them never trust a woman ducky rupert said with a mocking smile id have thought youd have learnt that unreliable bitches the lot of them ruled by the moon now me for instance donner kicked him in the leg shut up and search vim hell probably have the shooter in his righthand pocket rupert found the ceska at once and the buff envelope containing the money donner looked inside and whistled softly how much he demanded two thousand fallon said donner grinned that must be what they meant by an unexpected bonus he put the envelope in his inside pocket and rupert started to run his hands over fallons body lovely he breathed i could really go for you ducky and he patted fallons cheek fallon sent him staggering back with a stiff right arm put a hand on me again and ill break your neck ruperts eyes glittered and he picked up the sawnoff shotgun and thumbed back the hammer my my arent we butch he said softly but i can soon fix that dormer kicked him in the backside you bloody stupid little bitch he cried what are you trying to do ruin everything at this stage he shoved him violently away go on and make some tea its all youre fit for rupert moved over to the stove sullenly still clutching his shotgun and dormer took a pair of regulation police handcuffs from his pocket he snapped them around fallons wrists locked them and slipped tie key into his breast pocket you can have it the hard way or you can have it easy he said its all one to me understand i always try to fallon said right go and sit down by the bird where i can keep an eye on both of you fallon moved across to the cot and sat down beside it his back against the wall he looked at the child her eyes were closed the breathing easy the daughter you told me about he said is she all right she nodded they gave her a sedative thats all her eyes were bright with tears tm sorry martin i didnt have any choice i collected her after lunch like i do every saturday and took her to the playground in the local park thats where rupert and that creep harry picked us up and they threatened you they said theyd hang on to sally that i could have her back if i managed to get you out here she put a hand on his arm what else could i do i was terrified you dont know jack meehan like i do hes capable of anything just like billy billy will never bother you again fallon said i killed him last night she stared at him eyes wide you what just as i intend to kill dandy jack fallon said calmly theres a packet of cigarettes in my lefthand jacket pocket by the way light me one will you like a good girl she seemed stunned by the enormity of what he had said but did as she was told she put a cigarette in his mouth and as she struck a match donner joined them he was carrying a tartan bag in one hand and squatted down in front of fallon and unzipped it one by one he produced three bottles of irish whiskey and placed them on the ground jameson fallon said my favourite how did you guess and all for you donner told him all three bottles i must say it sounds like an interesting idea fallon said tell me more why not donner said actually its very good i think youll like it you see we have three problems fallon the priest and his niece because they know more than whats good for them and me fallon said exactly donner helped himself to a cigarette anyway mr meehan had this rather nice idea its beautifully simple we get rid of da costa and his niece and put the blame on you i see said fallon and just how do you propose to do that you were a big man with a bomb in your hand over there in ulster werent you so it would make sense if you used the same method when you wanted to knock someone off over here my god jenny said donner ignored her and he was obviously enjoying himself he said evening mass at holy name is at six oclock when its over mr meehan and bonati will pick up father da costa and his niece and take em up that tower together with about twenty pounds of plastic gelignite and a chemical fuse packed in a waverley biscuit tin when that little lot goes up they go with it and the church comes down i see fallon said and me what about me thats easy bonati drives out here in da costas mini van you get three bottles of irish whiskey poured down your throat we put you behind the wheel and send you for a drive theres a hill called cullens bend about three miles from here a terrible place for accidents and you think that will wrap things up fallon asked him as neat as a christmas pared when they check whats left of that van theyll find bombmaking equipment and a few sticks of gelignite from the same batch the church bomb was manufactured from not to mention the gun that was used to kill krasko the forensic boys will have a field day and lets face it the special branch and intelligence have been after you for years theyll be delighted miller wont buy it for a second fallon said he knows meehan was behind the krasko killing perhaps he does but there wont be a thing he can do about it jenny said in a whisper its murder coldblooded murder you cant do it shut your mouth dormer said she backed away fearfully and then she noticed an extraordinary thing fallons eyes seemed to have changed colour slightly the dark flecked with light and when he looked up at her there was a power in him that was almost physical a new authority somehow it was as if he had been asleep and was now awake he glanced across at the other two harry was examining the old cart his back to them and rupert stood beside the stove fingering the shotgun thats it then he said softly dormer shook his head in mock sorrow you should have stayed back home in the bogs fallon youre out of your league so it would appear fallon said donner leaned across to help himself to another cigarette fallon got both hands to the butt of the browning he had taped so carefully to the inside of his leg above the ankle tore it free and shot donner through the heart at point blank range the force of the shot lifted donner off his feet slamming him back against the ground and in the same instant fallon shot harry in the back before he could turn the bullet shattering his spine driving him head first into the cart and as jenny screamed fallon knocked her sideways on his feet now the browning arcing towards rupert as he turned in alarm already too late still clutching the shotgun in both hands his mouth opened in a soundless scream as fallons third bullet caught him squarely in the forehead blood and brains sprayed across the grey stones as the skull disintegrated and rupert was knocked back against the wall his finger tightening convulsively on the trigger of the shotgun in death discharging both barrels jenny sprawled protectingly across the child still deep in her drugged sleep there was silence she looked up fearfully and saw that fallon was standing quite still legs apart perfectly balanced the browning held out in front of him in both hands his face was very white wiped clean of all expression the eyes dark his right sleeve was torn and blood dripped to the floor she got to her feet unsteadily youre hurt he didnt seem to hear her but walked to the cart where harry sprawled on his face and stirred him with his foot then he crossed to rupert jenny moved to join him is he dead she whispered and then she saw the back of the skull and turned away stomach heaving clutching at the wall to steady herself when she turned again fallon was on his knees beside donner fumbling in the dead mans breast pocket he found the key he was looking for and stood up get me out of these things the stench of that butchers shop filled her nostrils seeped into her very brain and when she walked towards him dazed and frightened she stumbled and almost fell down he grabbed her by one arm and held her up steady girl dont let go now i need you tm fine she said really i am she unlocked the handcuffs fallon threw them to one side dropped to one knee again and took the buff envelope from dormers inside pocket as he stood up jenny said wearily youd better let me have a look at that arm all right fallon said i he took off his jacket and sat on the edge of the bed smoking a cigarette while she did what she could for him the arm was a mess three of four nasty wounds where steel buckshot had ripped into the flesh she bandaged it as best she could with the handkerchief from dormers breast pocket fallon picked up one of the bottles of jameson pulled the cork with his teeth and took a long swallow when she was finished she sat on the bed beside him and looked around the bam how long did it take two maybe three seconds r she shivered what kind of man are you martin fallon pulled on his jacket awkwardly you heard dormer didnt you a little mick out of his league who should have stayed back home in the bogs he was wrong wasnt he where i come from he wouldnt have lasted a day fallon said dispassionately what time is it she glanced at her watch fivethirty good he stood up and reached for his trench coat evening mass at holy name starts at six and finishes around seven you take me there now she helped him on with the trench coat that boat she said the one you were supposed to leave on from hull i heard the name donner and rupert were talking you could still go without a passport he turned trying to belt his coat awkwardly because of his wounded arm and she did it for him money talks she said and youve got plenty in that envelope she stood very close her hands around his waist looking up at him fallon said calmly and youd like to come with me i suppose she shook her head you couldnt be more wrong its too late for me to change now it was too late the day i started its you im thinking of youre the only man ive ever known who gave me more than a quick tumble and the back of his hand fallon stared at her somberly for a long moment and then said quietly bring the child he walked to the door jenny picked up her daughter wrapped her in a blanket and followed when she went outside he was standing hands in pockets staring up into the rain where brent geese passed overhead in a v formation he said quietly theyre free and im not jenny can you understand that when he took his right hand out of his pocket blood dripped from the fingers she said you need a doctor i need dandy jack meehan and no one else he said now lets get out of here and he turned and led the way back along the track to the car the wrath of god meehan was feeling pleased with himself in spite of his broken nose as he and bonati walked past the town hall pleased and excited his homburg was set at a jaunty angle the collar of his doublebreasted melton overcoat was turned up against the wind and he carried a canvas hold all containing the bomb in his right hand i know one thing he said to bonati as they crossed the road id like to know where our billy is right now ill have the backside off him for this when i see him you know what its like for these young lads when they get with a bird mr meehan bonati said soothingly hell turn up bloody little tarts meehan said in disgust all that lad ever thinks of is his cockend he turned the corner into rockingham street and received his first shock when he heard the organ playing at holy name and voices raised in song he dodged into a doorway out of the rain and said to bonati what in the hell goes on here evening mass starts at six i only make it ten to search me mr meehan they crossed the street heads down in a flurry of rain and paused at the notice board bonati peered up reading it aloud evening mass six oclock saturdays fivethirty meehan swore softly a bloody good job we were early come on lets get inside it was cold in the church and damp and the smell of the candles was very distinctive there were only a dozen people in the congregation father da costa was up at the altar praying and on the other side of the green baize curtain meehan could see anna da costas head as she played the organ he and bonati sat down at one side partially hidden by a pillar and he put the canvas hold all between his feet it was really quite pleasant sitting there in the halfdarkness meehan decided with the candles flickering and the organ playing the four acolytes in their scarlet cassocks and white cottas reminded him nostalgically of his youth strangest thing of all he found that he could remember some of the responses i confess to almighty god and to you my brothers and sisters said father da costa that i have sinned through my own fault he struck his breast and meehan joined in enthusiastically asking blessed mary ever virgin all the angels and saints and the rest of the congregation to pray for him to the lord our god as they all stood for the next hymn it suddenly struck him with something like surprise that he was thoroughly enjoying himself as the cooper went over a humpedback bridge fallon who had been sitting with his head forward on his chest sat up with a start are you all right jenny asked him anxiously tm fine he said and his voice was calm and perfectly controlled he touched his right arm gingerly the shock effects were wearing off now and it was beginning to hurt like hell he winced and jenny noticed at once i think i should take you straight to the infirmary he ignored the remark and turned to look at the child who lay on the back seat still in her drugged sleep wrapped in the blanket in which jenny had carried from the mill shes a nice kid he said the road was dangerous now in the heavy rain as darkness fell and needed ail her attention yet there was something in his voice that caused her to glance warily at him he lit a cigarette onehanded and leaned back against the seat td like you to know something he said what dormer said back there about me being bombhappy wasnt true those kids in that school bus it was an accident they walked into an ambush wed laid for a saracen armoured car it was a mistake he hammered his clenched fist against his right knee in a kind of frenzy i know jenny told him i understand thats good thats marvellous he said because i never have the agony in his voice was more than she could bear and she concentrated on the road tears in her eyes as the congregation moved out anna continued to play and father da costa went into the sacristy with the acolytes he took off his cope as the boys got out of their cassocks and into their street clothes he saw them out of the side door bidding each one of them good night anna was still playing something more powerful now which meant that the last of the congregation had left she always seemed to sense that moment it was bach again from the sound of it the piece fallon had played she stopped abruptly father da costa paused in the act of pulling off his alb and waited but she did not start playing again he frowned opened the sacristy door and went into the church anna was standing at the altar rail and jack meehan was holding her firmly by the arm father da costa took an angry step forward and bonati moved from behind a pillar holding a luger in his left hand it stopped father da costa dead in his tracks and meehan smiled thats better now were all going to take a little ride in the cage up to the catwalk theres only room for two at a time so well have to split up ill stick with the girl you go with bonati father and remember one thing anything you try thats the slightest bit out of turn will be reflected in the girls treatment so keep your hands to yourself and dont try any rough stuff all right mr meehan father da costa said what do you want with me all in good time meehan pushed anna across to the hoist opened the cage door and followed her inside as they started to rise he looked out at father da costa remember what i told you he said so dont try anything funny father da costa waited the black killing rage in him again and he fought to control it what on earth did the man want what was it all about when the hoist descended again he rushed inside eagerly and bonati followed him and pressed the button when it jolted to a halt father da costa opened the gate at once and stepped out meehan had switched the light on and the boards of the catwalk wet with rain glistened in the darkness anna was standing one hand on the rail complete uncertainty on her face father da costa took a step towards her and meehan produced a browning from his pocket stay where you are he nodded to bonati tie his wrists together there was little that father da costa could do except comply and he put his arms behind him bonati lashed his wrists together quickly with a piece of thin twine now the girl meehan said anna didnt say a word as bonati repeated the performance as he finished her uncle moved to join her are you all right he asked her in a low voice i think so she said whats going to happen to us tm afraid youll have to address that question to mr meehan personally he said tm sure i dont know meehan unzipped the hold all slipped his hand inside and broke the detonating cap on the chemical fuse then he zipped the bag up again and put it down casually at the side of the catwalk in the shadows all right father ill tell you what im going to do with you im going to leave you and your niece up here on your own for fifteen minutes to meditate when i return i hope to find you in a more reasonable frame of mind if not then but i dont understand father da costa interrupted i what on earth are you hoping to accomplish at that moment the organ in the church below broke into the opening bars of the bach prelude and fugue in d major the astonishment on meehans face was something to see its fallon he whispered it cant be bonati said then who the hell am i listening to a ghost playing meehans anger overflowed like whitehot lava go and get him he raved bring the bastard up here tell him the girl gets it if he doesnt come bonati hurriedly stepped into the cage closed the gate and started down when he was halfway there the organ stopped playing the cage juddered to a halt it was suddenly very quiet he cocked the luger kicked the gate open and stepped out when the cooper turned into rockingham street and pulled up opposite holy name fallon was leaning in the corner eyes dosed at first jenny thought he was unconscious or at the very least asleep but when she touched him gently he opened his eyes at once and smiled at her where are we holy name she said he took a deep breath and straightened up good girl he put a hand inside his coat and produced the buff envelope and passed it across to her theres nearly two thousand pounds in there the money i received from jack meehan on account and hard earned i wont need it where im going go off somewhere somewhere youve never even heard of take the kid with you and try again the envelope was slippery with blood as she examined it in the light from the instrument panel oh my god she said and then she switched on the interior light and turned to look at him oh martin she said in horror theres blood all over you it doesnt matter he said and he opened the car door she got out on her side hell kill you she said desperately you dont know him like i do you dont stand a chance let me get the police let mr miller handle him god save us but ive never asked a policeman for help in my life a slight ironic smile touched fallons mouth fleetingly too late to start now he patted her face gently youre a nice girl jenny a lovely girl it didnt touch you any of it always believe that now get the hell out of it and god bless you he turned and crossed the road to holy name jenny got into the cooper and started the engine he was going to his death she was convinced of that and the compulsion to save him was something that she was unable to deny suddenly resolute she drove round the corner stopped at the first telephonebox she came to and dialed nineninenine when they put her through to the main switchboard at police headquarters she asked for detectivesuperintendent miller there were still lights at the windows but it was the absence of music that fallon found puzzling until gazing up at the notice board he made the same discovery that jack meehan had about the time of evening mass on a saturday panic moved inside him oh my god he thought im too late the door went back against the wall with a crash that echoed throughout the silent building but the church was empty only the eternal ruby light of the sanctuary lamp the flickering candles the virgin smiling sadly down at him christ high on his cross down there by the altar he ran along the centre aisle and reached the hoist the cage was not there they were still on top and he was conscious of a fierce joy he pressed the button to bring the cage down but nothing happened he pressed it again with the same result which meant that the cage was standing open up there he hammered his clenched fist against the wall in despair there had to be a way to bring meehan down there had to be and there was of course and it was so beautifully simple that he laughed out loud his voice echoing up the nave as he turned and moved towards the altar rail and went up through the choir stalls he sat down on the organ stool switched on and pulled out an assortment of stops feverishly there was blood on the keys but that didnt matter and he moved into the opening of the bach prelude in d major the glorious music echoed between the walls as he gave it everything he had ignoring the pain in his right hand and arm come on you bastard i he shouted aloud lets be having you he stopped playing and was immediately aware of the slight clanging the cage made on its descent he got up and went down the steps through the choir stalls drawing the ceska from his pocket and screwing the silencer into place with difficulty arriving at the correct vantage point as the cage reached ground level fallon flattened himself against the wall and waited the ceska ready the cage door was kicked open and bonati stepped out clutching the luger fallon shot him through the hand and bonati dropped the luger with a sharp cry and turned to face him meehan fallon said is he up there bonati was shaking like a leaf in a storm frightened out of his wits he tried to speak but could only manage to nod his head vigorously all right fallon smiled and bonati saw that face again a face to frighten the devil go home and change your ways bonati needed no second bidding and ran up the aisle clutching his wrist the door banged behind him the candles fluttered it was quiet again fallon moved into the cage and pressed the button to ascend on the catwalk meehan anna and father da costa waited the rain falling in silver strands through the yellow light the cage jerked to a halt the door swung open it was dark in there meehan raised his browning slightly bonati fallon drifted out of the darkness a pale ghost hello you bastard he said meehan started to take aim and father da costa ducked low in spite of his bound hands and shouldered him to the rail tripping him deftly so that meehan fell heavily the browning skidded along the catwalk and fallon kicked it into space he leaned against the rail for support suddenly strangely tired his arm really hurting now and gestured with the ceska all right untie him meehan did as he was told reluctantly and the moment he was free father da costa untied anna he turned to fallon concern in his voice are you all right fallon kept all his attention on meehan the bomb have you set the fuse get stuffed meehan told him bomb father da costa demanded yes fallon said did he have a bag with him over there father da costa pointed to where the canvas hold all stood in the shadows all right fallon said youd better get anna out of here fast and i mean out if that thing goes off it will bring the whole church down like a house of cards father da costa didnt even hesitate he grabbed anna by the arm and guided her towards the hoist but she pulled free and turned towards fallon martini she cried and caught at his trench coat we cant go without you the cage only takes two at a time he said be sensible there was blood on her hand from his sleeve and she held it dose to her face as if trying to see it oh my god she whispered father da costa put an arm around her shoulders and said to fallon youre hurt youre running out of time fallon said patiently father da costa pushed anna inside the cage and followed her in as he pressed the button to descend he called through the bars til be back martin wait for me his voice was swallowed up by darkness and fallon turned to meehan and smiled you and me jack at the final end of things isnt that something we can go to hell together youre mad meehan said im not waiting here to die im going to get rid of this thing he moved towards the hold all and fallon raised the ceska threateningly ive had experience remember at this stage itll go up at the slightest touch he chuckled til tell you what well do well leave it with god if the cage gets back in time we leave if not you raving bloody lunatic meehan was shouting now fallon said calmly by the way ive just remembered ive got something for you he produced a crumpled white card with a black border and held it out meehan said what in hell is that supposed to be a restinpeace card isnt that what you call them its off billy plot number five hundred and eightytwo at pine trees meehan seemed stunned youre lying fallon shook his head i killed him last night because he tried to rape anna da costa i took him up to the crematorium and put him through the whole process just like you showed me last i saw of your brother he was five pounds of grey ash scattered across damp grass meehan seemed to break into a thousand pieces billy i he screamed and went for fallon head down fallon pulled the trigger of the ceska there was a dull click and then meehan was on him smashing him back against the guard rail it splintered sagged then gave way and fallon went over the edge into space he hit the canvas tarpaulin stretched over the hole in the roof and went straight through meehan turned and reached for the hold all as he picked it up and turned to throw it out into the darkness it exploded as father da costa and anna went out of the door into the street two police cars arrived at speed miller scrambled out of the first one and hurried towards them as he put a foot on the first step leading up to the porch the bomb exploded the effect was extraordinary for the whole church started to fall in almost in slow motion first the tower the steel scaffolding crumpling around it and then the roof miller grabbed annas other arm and he and father da costa ran her down into the safety of the street between them as they reached the cars a scaffolding pole rebounded from the wall of the warehouse above their heads and everyone ducked father da costa was first on his feet and stood fists clenched gating up at the church as the dust cleared he saw that most of the walls and the rear entrance porch were still standing a young constable came forward from one of the police cars holding a spot lamp and father da costa simply took it from him and turned to miller im going back in he started forward and miller grabbed him by the arm you must be crazy fallon was in there father da costa said he saved us dont you understand he might still be alive i must know fallon miller said in astonishment my god so it was fallon all the time father da costa hurried up the steps to the porch and pushed open the door the scene inside was incredible holy name was finished at the end of things at last but the worst damage was by the tower or what was left of it father da costa went up the central aisle flashing the spot before him the area in front of the altar where the tower and roof had come down together was a mountain of bricks and mortar the spot picked out something inside it could have been a face he wasnt sure there seemed to be a tunnel of sorts he got down on his hands and knees and started to crawl through holding the spot before him he found fallon at the end of the tunnel only his head and shoulders exposed the figure of christ on the cross the large one which had stood by the altar had fallen across him protectingly at least for the moment father da costa crouched beside him and the great cross sagged under the weight it was holding and dust descended on his head martin he said can you hear me there was a scraping sound behind him as miller arrived for gods sake father he said we must get out of here the whole damn lot might come down at any moment father da costa ignored him martin fallon opened his eyes did you get anna out i did martin thats all right then im sorry sorry for everything the cross sagged a little more stones and rubble cascaded over father da costas back and he leaned across fallon to protect him martin he said can you hear me fallon opened his eyes i want you to make an act of contrition say after me my god who art infinitely good in thyself o my god martin fallon said and died there was a long silence even that mass of rubble and debris seemed to have stopped moving for some strange reason miller suddenly felt as if he didnt belong as if he had no right to be there he turned and started to crawl out behind him father michael da costa got down on his knees head bowed beneath that frail roof and started to pray for the soul of the man who had called himself martin fallon the end praise for jack higgins and his bestselling novels the presidents daughter all of
