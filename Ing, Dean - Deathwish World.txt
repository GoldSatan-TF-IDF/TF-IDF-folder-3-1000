foreword the greatest land acquisitions by any power in the history of the world took place without even the faintest threat of arms not a shot was fired by the conqueror in this unprecedented colonization program alexander caesar genghis khan and tamerlane were tyros by comparison for none of them ruled a whole continent much less two with scores of neighboring islands and it was possibly the softest sell of all time the united states government simply issued a declaration that it welcomed any countries in north central or south america or the caribbean to join it conferring all rights pertaining to american citizens including the guaranteed annual stipend or gas sometimes called negative income tax our english friends called it the dole they had seen it before the english had seen everything before including permanent decline though the united states of america became the united states of the americas without force all was not simplicity military dictatorships particularly in the banana republics did all in their power to remain separate armies were ordered to fire upon mobs demanding admission to the new united states but the soldiers laughed one had to reach the rank of major to attain an income equal to that of a citizen of the united states on gas so with little strain on the yankees the western hemisphere assimilated into the united states of the americas and in the eyes of some that was only the beginning chapter one horace hampton a battered hovercar pulled up in the parking lot behind the aged apartment building there were few other vehicles there three men got out and headed across the parking area for the back door the one in the middle carried a cane and affected a slight limp the other two carried tiredlooking attachй cases all three were dressed neatly though their clothing was only a thin cut better than prole level the one in the middle looked up at the paintflaked wooden building which was their destination you could sell it for an antique he said one of the others grunted and told him you could sell all new salem as an antique restore it something like colonial williamsburg over in virginia you could put up a big sign for the tourists new salem bible belt town circa they ascended the stairs to the second floor thus far they had seen nobody at all which was understandable they had counted on the total population being down at the park for the political rally aside from tridi there was precious little in the way of local entertainment on the second floor the largest of the three men looked up and down the hall dipped a hand into his side pocket and brought forth a pair of thin black gloves his right hand went back into the pocket of his shorts and came forth with a key he unlocked the door and all three filed through quickly he locked the door behind him the other two put their attachй cases and the cane on the rooms center table and also donned gloves they seemed in no hurry they took out handkerchiefs and carefully wiped the cane and case with professional care their leader a black went through the small apartment which consisted of bedroom bath and kitchen besides the living room into which they had entered and checked it out carefully he too had left his attachй case on the table after wiping it clean his companions looked about at the nondescript furniture which included a broken couch and an oldfashioned rocking chair the two were of dark complexion but there the resemblance ended one was tall wiry and cougarlike of movement black of hair and eye the other was below average height stocky muscular he tended to smile while his companion was stoic of expression in keeping with his amerind tradition the smaller man was latino the stocky one said look civilization he pointed at the sole representative of modern furnishing a small tridi set the black who had checked out the other rooms returned and said wizard lets get the show roadbound jose zavalla took up the walking stick and began to unscrew the handle his limp was gone the handle came away and he upended the cane to let its contents slide gently into his right hand it was a metallic tube about three feet long threaded on one end externally internally on the other he laid it back on the table jesus its light he said tom horse the indian who was opening the two attachй cases said titanium alloy the sole contents of the hand luggage consisted of seven items all carefully wrapped in foam rubber tom took them out gingerly one by one and laid them in a row on the table he said hows it look up the road hamp hamp was the black a wellbuilt darkchocolate man with features more caucasian than bantu he went over to the middle of the three curtained windows that lined the street side of the room he pulled one curtain aside a bit and peered out looking toward the north from a jacket pocket he brought forth a small monoscope twisted it open and took off both lens shields he put the eyepiece to his right eye adjusted the focus he said quite a turnout must be triple the population of the town you dont hear the governor sound off every day in new salem and environs tom told him unwrapping his packages with love care nice big banner above the speakers stand hamp said says america for the americans very sentimental american flags at both ends they look a little out of date how many stars in the flag these days who keeps track about a hundred tom said he had taken up the tube joe had extracted from the hollow cane and was carefully screwing one of the other objects a stubby rectangular affair into the threads of its interior he said bitterly america for the americans you can be an englishman or german whose parents came over twenty years ago and took out citizenship papers and youre an american but you can have ancestors going back twenty thousand years on this continent and youre on the shit list hamp said still surveying with his monoscope you damn redskins are always complaining wait a minute i think theyve erected that speakers stand thirty meters farther up than we figured on hell the indian said taking up an aluminum rod from the table one end of it was threaded i had it all zeroed sightedin calibrated joe watching the assembly job said thats the smallest breech ive ever seen uh huh tom said winding the aluminum rod into a hole at the end of the deadly device this is a singleshot bolt action but the bolt doesnt stick out to the side its this little knob on the top whats that joe said of the steel rod the other was manipulating he had obviously never seen the thing before assembled or otherwise part of the skeleton stock tom told him tightening it firmly the rod canted downward from the breech at an angle hamp came back to the table where tom horse and jose zavalla were assembling the gun tom was saying to joe hand me that other rod hamp brought a quarterliter bottle from an inner pocket he studied its label for a moment then unscrewed the top he held it to his lips and took a long pull whats that tom said not looking particularly happy as he twirled the new rod into its place cognac hamp told him brandy have a slug listen what effect is it going to have their erecting that stand in the wrong place no thanks the indian said still not happy about the liquor im driving besides didnt you know we savages cant handle firewater joe said brandy reaching for the bottle you mean aguardiente man you blacks really live it up i havent had anything but synthogin for as long as i can remember he took a hearty pull brought the bottle down and stared at the label admiringly vsop what the hells that mean it means its worth its weight in diamonds hamp said cloddies like us cant afford it its forced on me by admiring women who lust for my body i brought it along as medicine never know when i might get sick how about the range tom tom had finished screwing the shorter aluminum rod into the back of the breech it stuck out at a shallower angle so that the two rods looked like two sides of a narrow triangle joe handed him the short curved base padded with holes drilled into it near both ends there was no threading now tom simply inserted the aluminum rods in the holes and gave the base a whack with the heel of his right hand driving it tightly home he said to the black its not important this scope weve got is an autorange latest thing combines a range finder with a regular telescopic sight no sweat hand me that silencer joe youre sure hamp said pushing the back of his left hand over his mouth sure im sure the other told him take a minute or so to get it all sighted in again he took the long tube joe handed over and began screwing it into the barrel it projected about a foot and a half when he had it tightly fitted the silencer was about two and a half times the diameter of the barrel tom said whered you get this sweetheart hamp its a handmade work of art news reporter i used to know used to collect offbeat guns he picked it up in one of the bush wars over in africa assassin gun for all i know its the only one ever made he was crazy giving this away tom said its a real collectors item joe handed him the telescopic sight there were grooves gouged into the metal top of the barrel the indian carefully eased the sights into them on the top and righthand side of the instrument were small vernier screws for adjusting the crossed hairs inside the scope wheres the fuckin trigger tom said holding out his hand mind your fuckin language the chicano told him im a lady on my mothers side he brought forth from one of the attachй cases a twirl of tissue paper unwrapped it and handed the contents over the sliver of a trigger was slightly curved and there were threads on one end tom horse began screwing it into place below the breech why couldnt that have been built in joe said the indian took up the assembled gun and handled it admiringly same reason theres no protruding bolt this whole thing is constructed to disassemble into parts that any man could carry around while wearing an overcoat most of it would go into deep pockets the barrel would be the only thing thats clumsy youd have to suspend it from your belt or maybe by a strap under your shoulder hamp took another slug of the cognac and looked at his watch he said the governor and his committee ought to be showing up any time lets move this table over to the window while the others were doing that tom went to one side of the room and selected a straight chair he put the chair next to the end of the table which now stood against the middle window and took from one of the attachй cases a very light bipod rifle support it was of aluminum held in place by an elastic strap he slipped it over the end of the rifle and its attached silencer he said to the black how does it look now hamp hamp had his monoscope to his eye again wizard theyre filing onto the speakers stand everybody shaking hands and smiling at each other very jolly theyve really got a turnout the crowd must have come from all over the county the more the merrier joe growled bastards will have something to see this time hamp said now heres the setup one last time tom just to be sure the speakers stand is about twentyfive feet high old drive em out teeter stands way above the assembled mob so that they have to throw their heads back to gawk at him he likes to speak with a rail before him so he can lean on it and thump it from time to time somewhere along the line he must have seen some of the old historic films of mussolini hassling the wops from his balcony all right all right tom said impatiently bringing forth from one of the attachй cases a black rubber block in which were stuck three long pointed cartridges they were of small caliber but necked down from a large casing he pulled one round out and put it on the table next to him the brass casing gleamed softly in subdued light hamp was saying teeter doesnt like to speak directly into a mike instead he has two of them hooked into the railing to each side of him about two meters apart right tom muttered brushing the window curtain slightly to one side so that he could see up the street so i focus a meter beyond the mike nearest us hamp pushed his left hand over his mouth again wizard joe had stationed himself at the window behind where the indian was setting up his assassin rifle he said you better get your ass in a hustle here comes the chairman plenty of time tom said evenly hamp took up the small bottle of brandy now nearly empty and took a quick swig before setting it down on the table tom shot him a disapproving glance but said nothing the indian glued his right eye to the telescopic sight it had already been sighted in but he reached out delicately and adjusted the focus the chairmans face leapt into clarity before him the marksman took the nub of the bolt in his thumb and index finger and gave it a counterclockwise twist pulling the bolt back in its groove to reveal the trough for the long bullet he took up the cartridge and inserted it thumbed the bolt back home and flicked it clockwise smoothly locking it into place he settled comfortably into his chair pushed the curtain of the window back a little more open it he said softly hamp pushed the window up sufficiently to make room for firing the indian snuggled into position behind the scope eyepiece all right governor teeter last of the racist rabblerousers he murmured softly youve sounded off once too often on the outskirts of the teeming crowd which had gathered to hear teeter two blacks stood inconspicuously in the shade of an ancient live oak near the trunk from their distance the whiteclad speaker was hardly distinguishable but the loudspeaker system brought his words clearly enough and his fistshaking gestures of emphasis could not be misunderstood one of the blacks said softly old drive em out is in full voice today im beginning to suspect he doesnt like bloods without warning the figure on the speakers stand came to a shocked stiffening red blossomed out in a large blot on his white shirt he staggered for a moment and then slowly crumbled falling out of sight one of the blacks shook his head drunk as a lord he said the other surreptitiously brought a transceiver from his pocket activated it and said softly bullseye he put the communication device back into his pocket and said urgently lets get the hell out of here jackie in the rundown apartment hamp picked up the assassin rifle by its fore end its bipod still hanging free and took it into the bedroom he pulled the bipod off held up the aged mattress with one hand and stuck the gun and stand under it he smoothed out the bed neatly and returned to the other two joe said in deprecation it wont take them long to find that who cares hamp said its untraceable he picked up the rubber container holding the two unspent rounds and dropped it into a side pocket then took the small flask of brandy after offering it to both tom and joe zavalla who shook their heads he finished it lets drag ass he said he unlocked the door let them precede him and then relocked it they headed for the stairs unhurried as before theyd left the cane and attachй cases behind down in the parking lot they stopped before a waste receptacle stripped the gloves from their hands and dropped them in hamp also discarded the empty bottle and the unused ammunition after wiping them they got into their hovercar all three in front the black driving and unhurriedly left the parking area they emerged onto the main street and headed away from the park where the rally had been taking place even at this distance they could hear the swell of shouts and screams though almost drowned by police sirens couldnt have happened to a nicer guy said joe who was sitting by the window his vague smile on his lips i wonder how many men women and children have been killed as a result of his racist rantings they left the environs of new salem and headed at a moderate speed out into the countryside they passed a sign welcoming all to new salem salem tom said musing wasnt that where they burned all the witches yes hamp told him softly this time we reversed it and clobbered a witch hunter joe theres a bottle in that glove compartment but the indian beside him shot the black one of his looks from the side of his eyes and said quickly take it easy hamp the days not over we wouldnt want them to hang a drunk driving romp on you wizard hamp said but im not drunk you dont have to be theyd book you anyway if you showed any indication at all of drinking joe throw that bottle out joe took the halfliter of booze from the dash compartment and looked at the label sadly before tossing the bottle far off the road into a field of sweet corn for a while they drove along silently each absorbed in his own thoughts in the anticlimax of what theyd just been through joe said finally that was a good spot to pot him from howd you locate it hamp said not much trouble teeter always starts off his campaigns in new salem its the oldest town of any size in the state that apartment was ideal the renter lives alone and goes up to chicago six months of the year to work on some parttime job he hates the big city so he returns here for the rest of the year as it turned out we needed the place just when he didnt tom looked over at him howd we find out about it one of our whitey members came to town and hung around for a while in bars in the neighborhoods we were interested in he finally got to talking to this fellow they held silence for a while there was a certain tenseness in waiting for what they knew was to come the inevitable hamp said oh oh here it is road block up ahead were two state police vehicles barring the way there were also two police hovercycles of the seven officers two carried automatic gyrojet carbines the others bolstered side arms there were red lights flashing above the cars hamp said play it cool no temper joe and no wisecracks they came to a halt some thirty feet from the barricade two of the police troopers strolled toward them about twenty feet off one of them stopped and stood there his legs parted his holster unsnapped the second trooper came up to the drivers window and looked in at them hamp said his voice modulated whats the difficulty officer the state trooper said ill ask the questions boy now you three get out of there and line up against the side of this here car spread your legs and lean your hands up against it hamp said his voice still quietly even whats the charge officer joe had brought a pocket transceiver out flicked back the cover activated it and said we have been stopped by police and ordered from our vehicle evidently to be searched the police officers badge number is the trooper looked at him coldly he was a rawboned lanky type probably in his late twenties his uniform boasted all the glory of a hungarian brigadier he said who you talking to joe smiled a friend hamp repeated what is the charge officer isnt a warrant required to search a citizen dont smartass me boy the trooper said grimly he dropped his hand to his gyrojet pistol the black said still mildly my name isnt boy its horace greeley hampton and i consider myself acting under duress he opened the door of the hovercar and got out followed by tom and joe but not until joe had said into his transceiver the police officer called mr hampton boy contemptuously and made a gesture toward his sidearm reinforcing his demand that we be searched the three lined up against the car as ordered and the second trooper came up to help in frisking them they were thorough the second state policeman said as though disappointed theyre clean ranee ranee said go through the car while the other was obeying he said to hamp tom and joe okay you three lets see your id they handed over their universal credit cards which performed the functions of identity cards drivers licenses and everything else a prole needed for identification he looked at them carefully brought forth a police transceiver and read off names and identity numbers into it then asked for a police dossier check of the data banks he turned his pale eyes to them horace greeley hampton tom horse jose angel mario zavalla born in ohio colorado and texas all on guaranteed annual stipend he sneered at that an overly done artificial sneer whatre you doing in this state we are on our way through hamp said his accent still that of an educated man whered you just come from new salem oh you did eh what were you doing there we went over to see the rally listen to the governors opening campaign speech then whatre you doing here the crowd was so large that we couldnt get anywhere near the speakers stand besides there had been quite a bit of drinking some of the ah gentlemen in the crowd didnt seem to like our complexions at any rate we decided to return to where were staying wheres that joe said into his transceiver were being questioned although thus far no charge has been made and we have not even been told whether or not were under arrest our vehicle is being searched without our permission and without a warrant ranee glared at him but forced his eyes back to hamp who seemed to be the spokesman of this unorthodox trio hamp said were staying at the we shall overcome motel near leesville the washed out grayish eyes of the trooper tightened infinitesimally he looked at joe and said and thats who youre talking to joe smiled his constant smile thats right mr policeman sir hamp looked over at him and slightly shook his head the second trooper emerged from the vehicle he said grudgingly its clean ranee ranees police transceiver buzzed and he listened to the report on the police dossiers of the three his face less than pleased joe said in his communication device we have been checked out in the police data banks and have obviously been cleared however we are still being held without charge without warrant and ranee began to go red around his neck take that damned thing away from him he snapped to the other trooper who was leaning back against the car arms folded he came erect gladly and started in the mexicanamericans direction joe began to retreat backward saying quickly into his transceiver state police officer number has ordered my transceiver taken one of us is a black notify the nearest nat turner team one of us is an amerind notify the sons of wounded knee i am a chicano get in touch with the foes of the alamo notify our legal department notify civil liberties alert the reunited nations human relations the trooper was on him grabbing the transceiver away joe smiled and winked at him hamp his face very serious turned to ranee and said youre in the dill now officer the troopers face was suddenly wan and he was breathing deeply he looked from hamp to tom and joe then back again his tongue came out and licked dry lips all right he said okay you can go we have nothing to hold you on the governor was shot in new salem an hour or so ago he took in a deep breath its our job no hard feelings fellas joe smiled in that case fuzzy how about a donation for the antiracist league get the hell out of here ranee snarled he turned to the other trooper who was looking at him in surprise give them back that transceiver and their ids when the three had left the second trooper looked at his companion he said what the hell ranee you practically kissed their asses and they were driving right from new salem the other glowered at him howd you like somebody to toss a grenade into your living room those bastards never quit once youre on their list they dont care if it takes years sooner or later they hit you hamp tom and joe drove along in silence for a time letting the tension drain away until hamp turned to joe and said what in the hells a nat turner team and tom horse added or the sons of wounded knee damned if i know joe said grinning i made them up as i went along same with the foes of the alamo whats the old gag if thered been a back door to the alamo there would never have been a texas the we shall overcome motel was well done extending over quite a few acres it was completely surrounded by a high heavy barbedwire fence a strong steel gate spanned the dressed stone entrance and behind it several public buildings including a large store a recreation hall and a restaurant an autobar clubroom stood off to one side of these near a goodsized swimming pool which was crowded with swimmers and sunbathers mostly of dark complexion but with a scattering of whites in the center of the compound was a sizable grove of trees largely pines a person could wander into the pine grove find a bit of a clearing and spread out on his back to stare up at clouds or stars and feel so temporarily free the area around the little forest was devoted to mobile homes and campers of all varieties at present a small mobile town with an art colony theme some forty homes in all was temporarily parked en route to mexico and parts south not all proles on gas crammed themselves into miniapartments in highrise buildings in the cities hamp pulled up before the administration building dropped the vehicles lift lever and switched off the engine maximillian finklestein issued from the office and strolled over toward them he was a tallish sparse stoopshouldered man of about fortyfive as they emerged from the hovercar he came up and said how was the rally chumpals tom shrugged and said we didnt stay too big a crowd we heard there was a lot of excitement after we left somebody took a shot at the governor finklestein clucked his tongue imagine that was he hurt joe said we got the impression he was hit didnt you see it on tridi i was working max told him come on in and have a drink well check the news hamp said your invitation appeals to me strangely especially the drink part but i want to stretch my legs a little first me too tom said a little stroll before the firewater the three of them accompanied by max set out leisurely for the wooded area they entered the trees for the time holding silence after a couple of hundred feet they reached a small clearing the ground well covered by pine needles and leaves then in silent agreement they all stretched out on their faces in a starlike arrangement their heads close together their faces were to the ground partially into the needles and leaves even the best shotgun mike would play hell listening to them now max said softly what happened plumb center tom whispered the capslug shattered right on his chest and splattered red goo all over his shirt i could see his face go pale and his eyes pop he fainted the motel manager growled the loudmouth bastardll know it could have been the real thing might even rethink his racist campaigning if hes smarter than he is bigoted how tough were the fuzzies hamp took over the report also whispering into the leaves about as expected they hated it every minute of it and they hated us and our uppity ways but they werent about to stick their necks out theyll toss it all into the laps of the iabi theyve heard all the silly rumors about how tough we are they had no intention of becoming martyrs for a state cops pay finklestein said ive already got instructions for you you three will be under special observation the iabi isnt completely dull they might not dig up proof but theyll strongly suspect you of the burlesque assassination your dossiers will tell them youre members of the antiracist league you were admittedly present in new salem and governor teeter was an anachronism the last of the really allout rabid politician racists they know it was just a matter of time before we zeroed in on him theyll probably be surprised we didnt actually bump him off swell tom said into the leaves a note of extreme weariness in his voice so what do we do now you break up as a team none of you will continue to operate in this section max fished in a jacket pocket tom you go to southern illinois youre an unknown there go to a town named zeigler and report to the section leader heres the address he handed the paper over tom looked at it and said what do i do there max seemed surprised at the question i havent the vaguest idea he told the indian i understand that its a pretty backward part of the country fundamentalists high illiteracy rate youve seen it all before but i dont know what theyll have you doing you might as well take off no need for you to know where hamp and joe are assigned yeah tom said scrambling to his feet and stuffing the address into his shorts pocket he looked down at the other two hesitated for a moment then said gruffly hang loose chumpals they both looked up from the leaves and nodded the team hadnt operated together for very long but theyd been more than unusually compatible so long redskin joe said softly when the other was gone the remaining three returned their lips to the pine needles and leaves max said joe you head south for mexico city heres your contact he handed another note to the chicano mexico joe said ive never been down there what do i do no need for me to know but the way i understand it there seems to be an unlikely situation particularly in the big centers like mexico city and monterrey where all the best positions wind up in the hands of whites of spanish descent next in the highest job and power echelons are those with a high percentage of spanish blood mestizos they call them and surprise surprise guess whos the low man on the totem pole the fullblooded indian hamp growled how do they get around the computers supposedly selecting the best citizens for whatever job comes up max grunted at that undoubtedly the same way they do here the rumors continue that sometimes the data banks are jimmied rigged but the programmers know angles and that will probably be one of joes tasks joe sighed same old story he said fuck the colored races whats my cover the obvious one most nearly the truth youre on gas and cant find a job up north so since youre bilingual you head south hoping to use your two languages to advantage in getting work max hesitated a moment before adding youd better get underway too you never know the iabi could show at any time to pick you three up joe came to his feet he smiled at hamp warmer than his usual humorless smile nice knowing you blood hamp said feelings mutual companero luck joe left the two remaining readdressed themselves to the ground hamp said what about me max said your request for a leave of absence has been okayed he looked over at the black from the side of his eyes how come hamp theres a hell of a shortage of top men and from what i understand youre continually taking leaves wizard hamp said in deprecation but well have fewer field men than ever if you wear us down to the point where we lose efficiency ive been in the trenches too often in the past couple of months i need a breather i think ill spend some time in new york where do i report when im unwound max handed him a note to me as usual i havent the vaguest idea of what your next assignment will be however theres one item of business on your way back east a new contact a lee garrett who lives in greenpoint pennsylvania a new contact hamp said moderately indignant have i sunk to the level where youre using me for elementary propaganda headquarters seems to think that this one is a better prospect than usual a whitey not on gas better than usual education our local section isnt too toplevel so they want a good agent to make the initial contact with garrett max handed the black another note wizard hamp said coming to his feet and brushing pine needles from his shorts and jacket do i leave now like tom and joe max stood too why dont you come over to my place and well talk some shop and have a couple of quick ones tom and joe never did get that drink i promised them theyre dedicated the other snorted both of them hardly touch the stuff lead me to it as a matter of fact ive got some good french brandy in my luggage we can crack that max finklestein wondered vaguely how the other could afford a bottle of imported brandy it would take a month of gas credits to buy such a potable chapter two franklin pinell when the two corrections officers from the prison handed franklin pinell over to the court bailiffs in the justice department building he was still handcuffed to the heavierset tougherlooking guard while the second officer was getting a bailiff to sign the receipt for their charge the prisoner was freed of his cuffs the guard dialed the appropriate number on the shackles and then put his thumbprint on the tiny screen the titanium alloy handcuffs came away there he is he said obviously bored frank pinell supposed to be tough havent you got cuffs for him no the bailiff said we dont usually use them the prison guard looked the two court officers up and down the older one was pushing sixty much overweight and the second didnt look much more competent hes supposed to be tough the guard repeated a killer you fellas heeled we dont usually carry guns the other said frank pinell stood there rubbing the wrist that had been confined he looked at the prison guards emptily as they turned to leave be seeing you he said the one to whom he had been handcuffed snorted tack over his shoulder not where youre going chumpal when they were gone pinell looked at the bailiffs this way son the older one said and then added gruffly tough luck ive got a son your age the three of them ascended marble stairs to the second floor and then proceeded to the left down the wide corridor the younger bailiff said those types see too many crime tridi shows what good do they think it would do you to escape without a credit card you couldnt buy a stick of chewing gum or a ride on the metro not to speak of a meal you have no home and its a felony for any friend to take you in stop it stop it pinell said without tone youre breaking my heart he was twentyfive years of age looked surprisingly athletic as proles went was medium tall clean and neat even in less than top quality garb and his bearing would have passed muster in any upper class gathering his dark brown hair was worn full and combed directly back his eyes were a dark green and his rather long face had a scottish cast in less plebeian dress he might have been typed as a graduate student or a junior executive okay son the older one said here we are he opened half of a heavy double door and the bailiffs led their charge through before them the judge looked up from his desk he was dressed in his traditional black robes and resembled the older and kindlier of his two court officers that is he was about sixty overweight his face lined not with an immediate weariness but with one that had accumulated down through the years franklin pinell your honor the younger bailiff said yes of course james the judge looked at the prisoner be seated pinell then back at the guards please wait outside i believe you already have your instructions yes your honor the younger bailiff hesitated then said judge the corrections officers from the prison said pinell is reputed to be dangerous indeed john worthington looked at the youthful prisoner are you frank pinell hesitated then let air out of his lungs and said under the circumstances no he took the chair across from the judges desk very well that will be all james bertram the bailiffs left and the judge sighed studying the prisoner for a moment pinell returned the scrutiny his expression saying its your ball start bouncing it the judge sighed again and took up a report from before him he said i am afraid we have bad news for you franklin i expected it the judge ignored that looked at the report and said the legal computers have found you guilty and recommend deportation frank pinells face went blank deportation but ive got only one major the other was shaking his head your criminal dossier lists four felonies as a fourtime loser your sentence becomes deportation for life but your honor those first two romps were kid stuff i was only in my early teens but you served time for your offenses no matter how short as you did for your third ah romp the fact that your first felony amounted to no more than taking an unguarded hovercar for a joyride is beside the point you served several months in a youth detention camp and your second offense and third all right who can argue with a damned computer isnt there any way i can appeal not at this point the judge told him if you can claim new evidence later and it is made available to the data banks you can then appeal appeals are seldom successful the computers dont make mistakes franklin judges and juries used to perhaps but computers dont its a hell of a thing to call justice the younger man said bitterly being thrown out of your own country the judge looked at him in weariness and said what was it the old cynic asked come now the truth who among us would be satisfied with justice the fact is your fourth crime was the only really reprehensible one but it was homicide and under rather strange circumstances had that been your only felony you would not have been deported our penal system allows for rehabilitation even of murderers but with three other felonies on your record the computers opted for deportation i dont want to live anywhere except in the states pinell said unfortunately that is now out of your hands franklin you should have considered it sooner deportation makes sense from the viewpoint of the government some decades ago when the penal laws were revamped they found that it cost more to keep a criminal in prison than to send him to harvard as it is now the government will no longer be put to the expense of keeping you in prison or even on gas nor will you be free to commit new felonies upon serving your time or being paroled the older man put that part of it behind him and said you will be issued one thousand pseudodollars in the form of swiss gold francs you will be deprived of your universal credit card and you are forbidden ever again to enter this country what happens when the thousand runs out the other said his voice still low that is not the concern of the united states of the americas you make what arrangements you can in your host country frank pinell squared his shoulders all right what country are you sending me to to a certain point that is your decision obviously the advanced nations will not accept you however some thirdworld nations will take you under certain circumstances their situation is something like australia and the american colony of georgia when they were first colonized they needed population desperately so england allowed convicts to decide whether to spend their sentences in jail or to be hanged as the case might be or to become colonists proffedto here whats that got to do with here and now pinell said impatient at the older mans ramblings in some nations particularly in africa and indonesia even partially educated persons are in very short supply some of them upon gaining independence from the former colonial powers had no university graduates whatsoever no doctors no engineers no lawyers no one really competent to hold high government office later with the support of the reunited nations and the assistance of the more advanced countries they were able to send students to america and europe in hopes of alleviating this problem unfortunately the majority of such students chose to remain in the advanced countries or at least to emigrate to nations less backward than their own a facet of the brain drain in short so ive got to choose a country so desperate for even semieducated manpower that theyll admit killers as immigrants im afraid thats it franklin mozambique for instance or the seychelles where the climate is said to be excellent though the islands are rather small and isolated any place where thered be more whites more people i could speak the language with the prisoners voice had grown sullen the judge took up a sheaf of papers from his desk he perused it a few minutes before saying according to your dossier your schooling was far above average for these days and while you were never chosen for regular employment by the national data banks you have on several occasions held down minor shortterm positions this would undoubtedly make you eligible for residence in morocco or at least tangier tangier the judge his tone unhappy said a disreputable city immediately across from gibraltar on the north african coast although nominally part of the sherifian empire and subject to the sultan its an international zone where few laws seem to apply there is no extradition for instance and few taxes with the possible exceptions of nassau and malta it is usually considered to be the ah most wideopen city in the world many americans there the population is international youd find many englishspeaking residents however anyone seeking to rehabilitate himself would find tangier an unhealthy atmosphere i should think its reputation is rank indeed frank pinell grunted impatient again who said anything about rehabilitation all right ill take tangier pinell was kept in a detention cell in a highsecurity prison in new jersey only two nights before the plainclothes agents came for him they were typical of the breed lower echelon operatives of the largest police organization in the world unless the soviet complex held that honor the interamerican bureau of investigation was a product of its times which led to amalgamation of just about all areas of the productive or governmental systems in this case it applied to the police the allembracing iabi included what had once been the fbi the cia all military espionage and counterespionage services the secret service all state police and all local police forces each former group had a certain amount of autonomy but ultimately they were all a part of the great law enforcement octopus which was the iabi presided over by director john warfield moyer for more than two decades moyer had dominated the american police system like a colossus the two were inconspicuous young men of averages deliberately chosen to blend into a group average of height weight coloring facial characteristics and dressed to conform frank pinell had come in contact with them before particularly in the past two months since his latest and most serious fall they could all have been clones from one source when the cell door opened one of them said okay pinell get your things youre on your way he had two suitcases they were packed with all of his earthly belongings save the suit he wore it was a conservative suit government issue just slightly above usual prole standards even so it was as good as franklin pinell had ever worn they were also to issue him a thousand pseudodollars in the form of swiss gold coinage the judge had told him he had never had at one time such a sum there was something ironic about the fact that as a criminal deportee the state was sending him off in better shape than he had ever enjoyed as a free citizen he took up the bags and went out into the corridor saying you mean everything has already been cleared for me to emigrate to morocco tangier one of them said its not exactly morocco and as far as allowing you to immigrate theyd take jack the ripper in that town come on pinell im macdonald and this is roskin were your escort just for the record were under orders to shoot if you try to escape between here and the tangier airport my chumpals frank muttered and just for the record roskin added if you crack smart youll wind up with dentures macdonald brought forth handcuffs and joined his left wrist to franks right frank said for christs sake how can i carry my bags shackled like this you carry one of them under your left arm and the other by its handle roskin told him you didnt expect us to act as your porters did you if its too much you can leave one of them they probably dont contain anything worth having anyway whoever heard of a prole with anything worth owning hed flog it to buy synthobeer frank looked at him coldly even as he fumbled the smaller of the two suitcases up under his left arm and took the other in his left hand the weight of the two put him somewhat off balance he said i have a few family mementos my father wasnt exactly a prole macdonald grunted disinterest oh well he didnt seem to pass anything great along to you what happened to him he was shot to death frank said flatly are we or arent we getting out of this stinkhole dont press your luck smartass roskin told him leading the way down the prison corridor toward freedom at the long island shuttleport they were lobbed over to the international supersonic port which floated some twenty miles off the coast and from there took the next laserboost to a similar jetport stationed off lisbon a shuttlecraft lobbed them over to madrid next stop tangier while roskin was checking out their reservations macdonald and frank pinell waited in the terminal the iabi man said too bad you cant take time out to see madrid pinell great town for a fling prettiest mopsies in common europe you pick them up at chicotes bar where theyve got the biggest collection of guzzle in the world oh youd love chicotes theyve got a jog of chinese brandy going back to the ming dynasty something like a thousand years old maybe ill see that guzzle museum someday the other laughed nastily not you chumpal youll spend the rest of your life in taniger knocking back rotgut absinthe when you can afford it the asshole of creation tangier how big is it a few square miles before you can get up a good dog trot youre over the international zone boundary which is taboo then the moroccan police throw you in the slammer the dungeons in morocco go back to the days of harunalrashid not that youve ever heard of him calif of baghdad in the arabian nights frank replied he never got to morocco roskin came back with their reservations and hurried them up royal air maroc he said this airline youve got to see to believe flying carpets pinell muttered the flying equipment of royal air maroc was obviously secondhand from more prosperous lines but the oldfashioned jet got them there they landed at the shabby airport on the outskirts of tangier in the afternoon the three had been the only passengers from madrid save for two swarthylooking types both wearing red fezzes but garbed in european dress and wearing it as though it was a penance on the way down frank had heard them talking in some language he had never heard before he asked roskin about it what do they speak in tangier just about everything the other had told him begrudging the information mostly a rifian version of arabic but any native youre apt to have anything to do with usually speaks either french or spanish he snorted with contempt at his prisoner do you speak either i took some french frank said he didnt add that it hadnt been much to hell with these guys roskin removed the handcuffs at the foot of the aircrafts ladder and the three waited for a few minutes until the planes crew had brought their luggage only one customs examiner stood in the administration building frank put his bags on the long low table and at the others gesture opened them the moroccan official was two days unshaven had a stub of a cigarette in his mouth and though he wore a uniform it looked as though it had never been laundered since leaving the factory his shirt was unbuttoned two buttons he dug roughly into frank pinells things with dirty hands making no attempt at neatness he came upon a subminiature leicapolaroid camera which had once belonged to franks father and pocketed it hey for christs sake frank exclaimed take it easy roskin told him and just hope he doesnt see anything else he thinks is worth flogging seething inwardly frank held his peace his cursory exanimations completed the customs officer took up a piece of blue chalk and marked each bag with an arabic scribble then made a contemptuous gesture of dismissal he looked at the overnight bags that roskin and macdonald were carrying but the latter said something in french which frank didnt get and the moroccan shrugged and moved off this way macdonald said gesturing with his head toward an office door there was no identity screen on the office door the iabi men didnt bother to knock but simply pushed the door open and ushered their prisoner in the office beyond was as filthy as the large hall outside and the fat official behind the sole desk was almost as disreputable in appearance as the customs man he had a warm bottle of some orangecolored drink sitting to his left and from time to time took a swallow of it the day wasnt particularly hot but his round lardy face was oozing oily sweat the three came up to the desk and macdonald spoke in french then brought forth several papers and put them before the other the mokkadem took them up and looked expressionlessly at frank pinell for a long moment then down at the papers macdonald took from his pocket a small gold coin and put it on the desk the moroccan swept it with a fat hand into his top desk drawer and grunted that came from you the iabi man told his charge well settle later frank sucked in breath but said nothing it was their top all he could do was let them keep spinning it the moroccan official took up a rubber stamp and banged it on several of the papers handed two of them to frank and put the rest in his desk he looked up at macdonald then over to frank then returned to scanning the tattered pornographic magazine he had been perusing when they entered frank said you mean thats all thats all thats involved in my entering this country for good they turned and left as they went roskin said to him not quite tomorrow morning you go to police headquarters on the place de mohammed fifth and register theyll want to see your papers photograph and fingerprint you find out where youre staying every time you move you have to report your new address that brings us to my money frank said macdonald brought forth a booklet opened it and took a stylo from the pocket of his shirt sign this receipt he said frank scanned it quickly one thousand pseudodollars in gold swiss francs as he signed he said what do they use as a means of exchange in tangier they use currency roskin said in morocco its the dirham five dirham are approximately one pseudodollar macdonald returned his receipt booklet to his pocket brought forth some small gold coins and counted them out into franks outstretched hand theres your severance pay he said frank said i owe you one for that bribe you gave the official never mind the iabi man said amused lets say its on me that set frank back he looked down at the small number of swiss coins in his hand and looked at one to check its denomination how many francs to the pseudodollar he said scowling two roskin told him frank calculated quickly and looked up this comes to only two hundred pseudodollars macdonald said to his fellow agent hes not only an intellectual but a mathematician im supposed to get a thousand frank said his voice tight macdonald scoffed at him whatd you do with a thousand pseudodollars probably waste it go through it in a week as it is roskin and i will lay over in madrid on our way home and well hoist a couple of drinks to you in chicotes frank stared from one of them to the other you miserable bastards he said his lips going white he took a step forward the other two stepped back warily and roskins hand slipped inside his jacket macdonald said his voice low you know what the moroccan police would do if we shot you here and now exactly nothing they couldnt care less your type is a dime a dozen in tangier as frank glared roskin smiled over theres the exit to the taxi stand the fare into town is five dirhams dont pay more you cant trust these gooks the two iabi men turned and left him standing there frank pinell glared after them for a long moment there was nothing he could do sure once he got organized he could write a letter of protest to judge john worthington and a fat pile of crap thatd get him hed been silly enough to sign the receipt for one thousand pseudodollars hadnt he signed it before getting the funds in his hands he picked up his bags made his way to the cambio booth and exchanged fifty swiss francs into dirhams the moroccan money came in coins rather than paper currency from the money exchange booth he went on through the door to the taxi stand the driver was a small evillooking type with a dirty rag of an orange turban wrapped carelessly around his head the garment he wore looked like a seamless bathrobe made of brown homespun and there were yellow backless leather slippers on his feet frank looked in the window of the ancient cab even as he sharply slapped the hand of an urchin who was trying to pick his pocket he said do you speak english the cabbys shifty eyes took him in evidently deciding his potential fare was american rather than british he said i talk everything jack frank put his bags in the back of the small cab and sat up front next to the driver the cabby evidently wasnt accustomed to bathing frank rolled down the window and said take me to the cheapest hotel in tangier the other grinned at him displaying teeth like a brokendown picket fence the cheapest european type hotel eh jack the cheapest hotel period frank said definitely you ever slept in a caravansary jack very cheap one dirham a night you sleep on a pile of straw eh twenty other people in the same room eh donkeys and goats sometimes maybe even a camel other people are rifs down from the mountains to bring their things to the souk to sell eh very bad people some of these rifs stick a knife in you if they figure you got ten maybe twenty dirhams in your pockets frank sighed all right take me to the cheapest european hotel he said in surrender the cabby dropped the lift lever of the prehistoric cab and when they were aircushion borne tromped on the accelerator at first without result he kicked it viciously and they started up the american realized that the vehicle must be battery powered rather than using power packs or picking up juice from the highway obviously the gravel road wasnt automated however from what he had read morocco wasnt energypoor at least a third of the southern stretches of the country were in the sahara and in common with neighboring algeria the sherifian empire of morocco had been among the first to use major solar power stations with reunited nations assistance endless square miles of them had been built before the satellite solar power stations began microwaving energy down from orbit he had thought himself prepared for poverty of the north african variety but he wasnt he couldnt imagine any american being so prepared the thought came to him could parts of latin america have been like this before joining the united states of the americas from time to time they passed small communities consisting of singleroom dwellings made of wood scraps cardboard tin cans beaten flat small boulders and mud there was no pretense of streets or even alleys obviously no running water and garbage and refuse lay heaped in filthy piles often with naked children playing on their summits flies and other insects droned in such swarms that frank rolled up the window again despite the stench of his driver the cabby grinned evilly over at him not so good eh jack frank didnt answer after suburbs of such appalling filth tangier itself came as a surprise the part of it they entered was european in appearance rather than moslem that figured the french had once owned this town on the straits of hercules even before the international zone and the french might have loony logic but they didnt live in midden heaps the driver assumed the role of travel guide this is route de tetouan eh jack and this here we come into is place deurope they proceeded to the right and merged into what street signs proclaimed to be the avenue de madrid at least thats what the french proclaimed frank couldnt decipher the arabic scrawl they turned left on the boulevard mohammed fifth the city continued to improve and now there was considerably more traffic tangier had no restrictions on surface traffic from time to time they were even held up by minor traffic jams most of the cars and trucks seemed as elderly as the hovercab pasteur boulevard she the center of european town eh she just two streets up you like i think cheap hotel they turned down rue moussai ben moussair barely wide enough for two vehicles to pass and two blocks later pulled up before a sadly decrepit fourstory structure hotel rome the driver said expansively very cheap almost clean not much bugs eh jack frank looked out blankly where he said shes on second floor third floor fourth floor you dont pay more than ten dirhams eh luigi hes a crook he try to charge you more eh you cant trust italianos okay jack thatll be fifteen dirhams jack cheap all the way from the airport frank got out of his side of the cab brought forth his moroccan coins and handed six dirhams through the window the rates five dirhams and heres one more for a tip he said the other was furious fifteen you cheap yankee he yelled five frank said flatly and reached for the door to the back of the hovercab to recover his bags before he could get it open the vehicle surged ahead wrenching his hand from the doorknob and nearly knocking him sprawling his eyes bulging frank stared aghast at the hovercab careening up the street with his luggage he searched desperately for its license plate and could see none his eyes darted around to other vehicles parked in the street none of them had license plates evidently there was no such thing in the international zone of tangier he groaned audibly he knew nothing about the layout of this town he didnt know where he could find the police he didnt know the cabbys name and the taxi looked like every other one he had seen in this this ripoff mecca he stood there staring after it until the vehicle swerved around a corner and was gone from sight less than two hundred pseudodollars to his name and his every belonging stolen he finally took a deep breath and turned now he could make out the faded sign for the hotel rome it was over a drab wooden stairway the ground floor of the building was taken up by two stores which seemed almost identical they resembled in their window contents the general stores in american small towns of long ago selling everything from groceries to textiles and toys liquor nonprescription drugs shaving supplies and what not the lobby of the hotel rome was on the second floor only one window overlooked the street it was furnished with an aged reception desk keys openly displayed on a rack behind it and several thoroughly defeated chairs their upholstery looking as though wild animals had savaged it in one of the chairs snored an obese man as disreputable as the furniture hey the other opened first one eye then the other he brushed a fly from the top of his almost bald head and looked accusingly at the man who had awakened him what do bald fat italians dream of frank wondered who do i see about getting a room here me the other grunted somehow getting his bulk erect im luigi this place its mine frank said i want the cheapest room youve got luigi took him in his plump face expressionless you got no luggage you pay right now twenty dirhams ten frank said wearily fishing in his pocket for two fivedirham coins this way luigi said shrugging the room was on the same floor as the lobby it had one primitive electric bulb hanging from the ceiling one sagging bed one straight chair one chipped dresser with a drawer missing no bath nor running water not even a window there was a toilet down the hall but no bath there either seemingly the tenants of the hotel rome didnt bathe unless they managed a sponge bath out of the filthy lavatory crammed next to the toilet bowl when luigi was gone frank pinell looked about his room home at last he said acidly running a hand down over his long face in another part of town a stranger to frank pinell was speaking into his pocket transceiver he was saying he pulled in on the three oclock from madrid at the airport those sons of bitches macdonald and roskin pulled their usual little romp he got into hamads cab and hamari took him to luigis and was able to take off with his luggage he must be running scared by now it looks as though weve found our patsy chapter three roy cos roy cos looked out over the small shabby hall in baltimore with its pitiful group members of the industrial workers of the world wobblies in their own jargon inwardly he felt depressed and weary it was the same old story there were sixteen in the audience at least ten of these were either wobblies or sympathizers who had heard or read all that he had to say a hundred times they were there not to learn but to give him support another two or three looking bored had drifted in from the street out of mild curiosity or because they had nothing else to do another trio seated together at the rear with identical condescending sneers were hecklers come to give him a bad time only one stranger who sat in the last row on one of the rickety folding chairs looked at all like promising material he was a small man better dressed than the prole audience and he had a notepad on his lap from time to time he took notes but for all roy cos knew the man could be an iabi agent checking out just how subversive the speaker might be roy took in the tattered banners which the committee members had hung about the walls solidarity unite and the longest of them all peoples of the world unite you have nothing to lose but your chains roy cos knew that such signs had once read workers of the world unite but there were no workers any more for all practical purposes over ninety percent of the population was on gas two percent were affluent members of the upper class who did not worry about employment and five percent were actually all that were needed to produce an abundance of goods and supply the services of this automated computerized society and they the professional technicians engineers scientists doctors and teachers seldom thought of themselves as workers their pay was such that they identified with the upper class rather than the proles on gas roy cos a secondgeneration radical was in his early forties he was an outwardly average unprepossessing man faded brown of hair hazel of eye earnest of expression but projecting a hint that somehow he realized that life had passed him by and that his efforts were meaningless in the long run he was some ten pounds overweight too many hours studying too many hours sitting around tables arguing dialectics too many hours talking talking talking largely to people not really interested in blueprints of utopia he was saying and is this the final destiny of man the overwhelming majority living on the verge of poverty the history of the human race has been a hard and proud one since first our ancestors emerged from the caves we have fought upward and from the beginning we have been the thinking animals the tool users who first utilized fire we cannot know what early men first developed the hand ax the knife the spear the bow and arrow is unknown to us but each generation that came along added its contribution to human knowledge and we slowly acquired agriculture the domestication of animals the wheel the hoe the plow and as each generation emerged its geniuses now forgotten our knowledge grew the arts and the sciences began to emerge great one of the three cynical listeners called out so what get to the point roy nodded and went on the point is that all of these developments this accumulated knowledge down through the centuries is the common heritage of all mankind they are not the property of a few but of the race as a whole a modern automated factory is possible only because these tools were handed down to us over the centuries the products of modern society should be the common property of the race not of a mere fraction of it and if this is true where is justice today when a few live idle in luxury while the rest of us are forgotten as john ball centuries ago put it in a sermon to english poorer class rebels when adam dalfe and eve span who was thanne a gentil man the stranger made a note on his pad he was thin grayfaced probably in his midforties and roy largely directed his talk toward the man if you could make one convert at a typical wobbly meeting you were doing fine one valid convert potentially an activist would more than pay for an otherwise depressing evening he went on to explain the wobbly program organizing all presently employed workers so that they could use the only clout that really counted the control of production distribution communications when the question period came the chairman took over again no one seemed prepared to ask an initial question of the speaker as usual in such a case one of the wobbly members stood up and started the ball rolling he said since so few people support the wobbly program wont it take one hell of a long time for it to ever come about roy took over the podium again nodded and said good question and the answer is no not necessarily what counts is the correctness of the program the extent to which it solves our common problems our support can grow very quickly given a breakdown in the current system and an obvious need for change take the american revolution of for instance had you suggested to the average colonist in that he needed to throw off the rule of king george in favor of an independent union he probably would have taken a patriotic swing at you but the need was there and overnight a handful of farseeing men like tom paine sam adams jefferson pointed out the way the revolution wasnt long in coming one of the hecklers held up his hand when roy cos recognized him he came to his feet and yelled louder than was called for arent you people just a bunch of soreheads theres only so many jobs around these days the computers select the best men and women to hold them those that get jobs deserve the extra money the rest of us are lucky to get gas its a pretty good system when everybody eats regular and is taken care of even if hes not chosen for a job what the hell are you beefing about roy nodded and paused a moment before answering in the first place lets not give those computers more credit than they deserve science is great but it mustnt be a sacred cow computers can be programmed into shortcomings like what one of the hecklers called out his friends laughed backing him several of the wobblies seated down front turned and glared at them roy said well lets take a couple of scientists that the computers would have passed by two of their big requirements are a good education and a topnotch ability quotient thomas edison had only a couple of years of formal education he never got through grammar school the computers wouldnt have picked him for a job steinmetz was a hunchback cripple in spite of his iq and would never have gotten a high ability quotient much of which depends on physical attributes but science isnt the only thing lincoln had practically no formal schooling and wouldnt have been chosen winston churchill was a rotten student among writers jack london had very little schooling and was an alcoholic from his teens onward o henry poorly educated also had a prison record scott fitzgerald was a dropout at princeton and never did learn much grammar spelling or punctuation hemingway finished high school but certainly took no honors there lets face it few outstanding artists musicians or actors would stand up to the scrutiny of the computers no im afraid the computers are not yet programmed for judging the arts and we wobblies look forward to going further into the arts as well as the sciences millions of citizens could be employed in the arts there were few questions roy had been hoping for one or more from the notetaker in the back row you could usually tell the extent of a newcomers real interest by his questions following the meeting while the balance of the small audience drifted from the hall the membership gathered around to shake his hand and congratulate him as a national organizer he was used to the plaudits of his fellows who were unable to express themselves in public speaking so far as he was concerned the meeting was a flop and he could see that the chairman felt the same way not even the little stranger in the rear had remained when the other members had gone their way the chairman asked roy if hed like to come home with him for pseudocoffee and talk he was the local group organizer a good man but roy was aware of the fact that the mans wife was rabidly against the wobblies in fact was a militant member of the united church who considered all radicals slated for hell besides roy cos was emotionally exhausted his depression had been growing over a period of weeks no thanks jim he said i think ill get on to bed i have to take the vac tube to newark tomorrow for another meeting and you know newark the membership there is so apathetic they probably havent gotten around to hiring a hall ill wind up on a soapbox in the park and damned few people are out in the parks anymore yeah jim said only those who have no place else to go and screw well see you on your next trip around comrade roy said wearily jim for gods sake please please dont call me comrade i hate the word if you use it ninetynine people out of a hundred think youre a euro communist or some other reactionary bastard they separated at the door and roy cos headed for his thirdclass hotel his mind was empty the streets were deserted as usual at this time of night especially of the few vehicles that were allowed surface traffic he was surprised when two figures materialized to either side of him and he could hear the footsteps of a third close behind him his first inclination was to think it was three of the organization members who happened to be going in his direction the voice of the one to his right disillusioned him on that score it snarled we didnt like what you had to say chumpal roys mind raced for options but found none he continued to stroll at the same speed sorry he said it was what i believe he had been through this sort of thing before he expected a beating probably not bad enough to hospitalize him this time since they didnt seem particularly heated up but probably enough of a working over to keep him from the newark meeting the other said we reckon you need a little lesson in americanism your version of roy began but was interrupted by a heavy blow from the man on his left then another in his back even as he reeled sideways neither blow was crippling but between them they threw him against the wall of the decrepit building so that he banged his head against the bricks stars flashed before his eyes red heat bloomed in his brain and he began to fall the pain was such that he hardly felt the kick in his side the three were surging in babbling incoherently about their anger their frustrations their hate of the nonconformist all three were younger and in all probability in better shape than he his chances of meaningful resistance were all but nil he struggled to bring his arms up over his head unable to restrain a groan of pain though he tried more kicks came they werent pros and the beating was less damaging than it might have been his best bet was to wait it out curling into a fetal crouch to guard his head and groin but then came a shout and a pounding of feet halt get away from that man halt or ill fire cursing in surprise the three were off in as many directions panting he staggered erect and tried to assess the damages except for bruises there werent any his three assailants hadnt had the time for a complete mauling he brushed at his streetgrimed clothing with shaking hands he looked around down the avenue he heard another order to halt but unless his rescuer was actually willing to shoot he wasnt going to have much luck only a few doors down was the entrance to a prole autobar he staggered toward it still brushing his jacket just before he entered he straightened up as best he could but the attempt was needless the sorry little bistro was empty of customers he fumbled himself into a chair at the first table he could get to and for a time sat there catching his breath for all he knew the police officer would return and pick him up on general principles and before he could make adequate explanations he might wind up in the banger he might even louse up his schedule and miss the newark meeting he brought forth his universal credit card put it into the table payment slot and dialed a synthobeer he knew that his monthly gas credits were low and there were several days to go before next months deposit was credited to his account but he needed that drink largely national organizers of the wobblies had to be selfsupporting the membership made minor contributions to the national fund but since they were all on gas themselves and needed their credits for their own survival it couldnt be much the beer had come and he had taken his initial swallow before the newcomer entered the autobar looked around and then descended on his table roy cos brought his gaze up he had expected a uniform but the other was in ordinary garb then roy recognized him he was the notetaking stranger the grayfaced man couldnt have weighed more than fifty kilos he wore a wispy mustache in a day when facial hair was long out of style and his faded eyes had a perpetual squint he slid into the chair opposite roy roy said in resignation i thought you were an iabi man but thanks anyway you came up like the seventh cavalry rescuing the wagon train who me the other said in false innocence dialing for a drink he looked at roys beer you look as though you could use something stronger than that how about a whiskey cant afford it you mean youre not a cop no im a reporter and i can afford it he dialed for the whiskey his own credit card in the table slot roy eyed him what was all that about halt or i fire the other grunted sour amusement and fished a package of cigarettes from a side pocket if id shouted halt or ill write theyd be kicking my butt right now i figured theyd hardly hang around demanding to see my badge he stuck a smoke into his thin pale mouth and lit it with a lighter to roys surprise it wasnt marijuana but tobacco you couldnt mistake the odor of this forbidden narcotic roy said well thanks again you think you ought to be smoking like that in a public place theres nobody here but us what happened you know as much about it as i do i suppose it was those three hecklers who in the hell are you the other extended a scrawny hand forrest brown call me forry im from the local area tridi news stuff that you dont get on the national networks as they shook hands roy said youre a news commentator brown shook his head the smoke drifted up his face from the cigarette that drooped in his mouth making him squint still more just a leg man oh i go on video occasionally when one of the regular men is off but i never reached commentator level i suppose i wasnt pretty enough youve got to project personality to hit commentator level the center of the table had sunk and returned with the whiskey roy took a glass still shaky and said in defiance heres to the revolution and knocked it all back the gray little man nodded and swallowed a third of his own booze you think itll ever come at this rate roy ignored that and focused on his job again with professional ease you were going to do a story on the wobbly movement the other shook his head no actually i just stopped by your meeting from sheer boredom i had nothing else to do roy was bitter the conspiracy of silence eh its like pulling teeth to get any of our meetings or demands into the news but what should expect the news media are owned by the enemy but forry brown shook his head again you people overemphasize that oh it applies to a certain extent word from above is to not give too much coverage to any minority organizations not just your wobblies but the neonihilists the libertarians the luddites the gay libbers and all the rest but theres no taboo no conspiracy of total silence the thing is you people arent news nobody cares about your programs they want something exciting youre not exciting a good murder some scandal about the latest tridi sex symbol government corruption one of the bush wars in africa or asia even a hurricane or earthquake bring in more viewers than some yawner about a wobbly meeting attended by fifteen people but that isnt the big reason im not filing a story on you even after you were attacked by members of your audience if theyd killed you maybe somebody would have a story he took another cigarette and lit it from the butt of his last roy cos forgot his bruises temporarily and said damn it id almost be willing how can we present our program to the people if we cant get any media coverage the little mans grimace was sour wish i could help you but just this morning the computers spelled me down im surprised that i was able to hang on this long even as a secondrate legman in a backwater tridi area its not enough being selected by the damned computers for a job each year a new batch of journalism graduates apply for positions as you said in your talk over ninety percent of the population is unemployed we who have jobs try desperately to hang onto them and sometimes the experience weve accumulated helps out but sooner or later some new kid with a higher ability quotient steps into your boots he shrugged ive been expecting the axe for a long time roy cos had never held a job in his life not that he hadnt religiously applied each year he said in compassion im sorry what happens now do you get a pension or something from your tridi network the other snorted and finished his drink hell no i go back on gas theoretically i shouldve saved a portion of the pseudodollar credits i earned while i was working and invested them in variable basic government stock or one of the private corporations the dividends would supplement my gas he snorted again took his cigarette from his mouth and looked at it im afraid i developed some expensive habits lady nicotine doesnt come cheap these days the wobbly organizer took him in he had never met anyone before who was actually hooked on tobacco he didnt move in the circles that could afford it he also had the usual prejudice against the use of the poisonous weed roy said why didnt you ever take the cure brown laughed dryly because once you take it youre allergic to nicotine for the rest of your life i guess i didnt really want to be cured i like to eat better than you proles can afford like to drink better travel better i even took a trip around the world once and ive been in europe a couple of times free rocket shuttle fare as a newsman but the other expenses were largely on me you ought to see some of the bordellos they have in the east he sighed thats one thing theyll never automate knock on wood as a wobbly roy cos didnt approve of prostitution any more than he did of the deadly nicotine so underneath was a certain smug satisfaction when he said so now youre in the same position as all the rest of us you should join the wobbly movement brown ground out his cigarette and brought forth another not me he said what ive got to do is dream up some other manner of supporting my vices roy switched subjects knowing the unlikelihood of the exnewsman ever accomplishing that any idea how we could get more media coverage its a sore point with us when those old american revolutionists wrote the constitution and the bill of rights it never occurred to them that freedom of speech and of press and assembly would one day become meaningless in those days you got up in the village square or the town meeting and stated your beliefs if your program had merit it was probably accepted starting a newspaper was in the range of almost any individual or certainly of any small group but today unless you can get on tridi you simply arent heard freedom of the press is fine sure youre perfectly free to get out a little magazine and circulate it as best you can but who reads it a few hundred people most of whom already have the same beliefs you do freedom of speech is meaningless if all you can do is stand on the beach and shout your message to the wind forrest brown thought about it squinting through curls of smoke he said finally youve got to have enough money to buy tridi time but above all youve got to be newsworthy youve got to have something that makes people want to listen to you watch you great roy said sarcastically and how do i accomplish that the newsman half joking said start a religion become a tridi star take out a deathwish policy the wobbly organizer scowled at him what for youd have the credits to buy tridi time deathwishers are news everybodyd be in a tizzy wondering how long itd be before you got hit thered be standing room only at your hall lectures youd be out in the open and theyd come in hopes that theyd be there when the grafs boys or whoever got to you something like in the old days in spain and latin america where theyd pony up for bullfight tickets in hopes theyd see the matador gored to death what the hell are you talking about roy said whats a deathwish policy forry grunted and dialed another two whiskeys before lighting a new smoke off the old oh he said just a jargon term we use in the news game youve probably never heard it you have your life insured in return for having an international drawing account for a million pseudodollar credits continually at your disposal for as long as you live never heard of oh wait a minute i guess i did something in the news about six months ago somebody was blown up with a grenade or something his life had been insured for something like five million pseudodollars only a few days before i forget the details i dont usually follow crime news its crime all right forry said putting his thumbprint on the tables payment screen to pay for the new drinks his credit card was still in the slot the thing is so far the law hasnt been able to get at them its too complicated most of the insured are americans but you never sign the policy with an american company the outfit thats going to collect the benefits is usually based in the bahamas or malta or tangier or somewhere else where practically anything goes they shop out the deal to lloyds of london where theyll insure anything dancers legs a violinists fingers hell theyll insure an outdoor entertainment against loss due to rain so youve got four countries involved the insured is usually a citizen of the states the beneficiary is in the bahamas or wherever lloyds of london is in england and your credits come from switzerland for that matter you might say five different countries are involved since its said that the graf has his headquarters in liechtenstein now wait a minute roy cos said taking up his new drink and swallowing part of it for the first time in years he felt the itch of intrigue start at the beginning forry shrugged thin shoulders you sign a contract that grants you what amounts to an unlimited credit account for as long as you live if and when you die the beneficiary collects the benefits the company youve signed with pays huge daily premiums its a gamble as all insurance has always been since the days when phoenician ships set sail from tyre to cadiz for a cargo of tin the insurer was gambling that the ship would get back safely and the insuree was gambling that the ship would sink well in this case the insuree is gambling that youll die before the premiums paid mount up to more than the benefits hell collect when you kick off lloyds is gambling the other way that youll live so long that the premiums accumulated are higher than the life insurance benefits roy looked at him blankly but suppose you lived for years and you have a million pseudodollar account to draw on to any extent you wish hell the company thats the beneficiary would go broke paying the premiums plus your expenditures forry brown laughed shortly dont be a dizzard from the moment that policy goes into effect youre on the run some of the insured dont live the first day out roy stared then tried a tenative smile youre kidding of course yeah the grafs hit men are the besttrained pros in the world he usually gets the contract i understand roy slumped down into his chair jesus he said whod be silly enough to sign up for that the newsman let smoke dribble from his nostrils somebody who had already decided to commit suicide but couldnt bring himself to do it and decided he might as well go out in a burst of glory living in one of the biggest hotels in one of the swankest resorts in the world drinking champagne and gorging himself with caviar i can see that but nobody else would sign forry finished his second drink and said slowly you underestimate human desperation take some prole whos fed up with living right at the edge of poverty on gas he figures he might as well live it up for a few weeks or hopefully months frankly this guys a dreamer his chances of lasting for any length of time at all are just about nil most of them think theyve figured out some dodge to beat the odds some special gimmick they havent they cant now wait a minute roy said increasingly intrigued by one more example of the degeneracy of the present system what youre saying is that an assassin more than one id think forry put in is immediately sent after the person whos signed this contract all right what happens if the killers caught hes arrested of course and they throw the book at him but they cant prove anything except his own guilt none of the advanced countries have capital punishment any more if hes caught in america hes subject to deportation if they nail him in say common europe hes thrown into the banger for say twenty years but the graf takes care of his own who ever heard of one of the grafs boys spending much time in jail one way or the other hes soon out usually legally since the graf keeps the best criminal lawyers in the world but if not legally then illegally his escape is greased and he drops out of sight possibly to tangier where there are no extradition laws he remains on pension for the rest of his life unless they get him some local job one of the grafs big centers is tangier who the hells this graf roy cos said its a german title something like a british earl hes the boss of mercenaries incorporated the little man told him havent you ever heard of the graf no i told you i didnt bother with crime news but this thing fascinates me what are some of the tricks the victims try to pull to remain alive oh ive heard of various scams often theyll try to hole up in some manner so that the hit men cant get at them theyll rent the whole top floor of some luxury hotel and try to seal themselves in like howard hughes in the old days bodyguards and all but in those cases the assassin usually bribes one of the poor bastards hirelings to slip a cyanide mickey into one of his drinks or whatever once or twice it turned out that one of the bodyguards was a graf man curtains roy cos shook his head in amazement a million pseudodollars always available but suppose he spent that much in one day and then the next day spent that much again and so on itd be damned hard to do the newsman told him there are clauses in the contract hes not allowed to buy presents that cost more than two hundred pseudodollars hes not allowed to donate to any cause once a crackpot religious fanatic decided to sign up and donate hundreds of thousands to the united church but that wasnt allowed on top of that the company becomes your heir everything you buy reverts to them after your death you buy something expensive like a luxury car or a big house or jewelry and they take it over when you die roy shook his head id think the lloyds underwriters would get leery fony shrugged again like i said its a gamble to keep it that way the daily premium is sky high if the insured lives more than a few days lloyds wins as usual the computers of both the policyholders and the insurers have figured it out down to a hairline roy finished his drink thought about it some more shook his head again then he scowled and looked over at the other he said what was that you mentioned about my taking out one of these deathwish policies and fony brown said softly a million pseudodollars like i said youd have plenty to buy yourself premium tridi time every day until they got you and youd also be top news everybody and his cousin would listen in youd have your chance to put your wobbly message across such as no minority organization has ever had there was a prolonged blank silence until roy cos said finally where do you come in on this forry brown forry looked him straight in the eye squinting through his cigarette smoke somebodys got to run interference for you keep you alive long enough to do your thing and i need a job one that doesnt have to match the computers of the national data banks you must think im drivelhappy roy said in disgust no i think youre a dedicated wobbly and as things stand now youll spend your life trying to put over a message that no one hears have you ever read of sacco and vanzetti roy frowned vaguely a couple of early th century radicals thats right they were railroaded charged with a payroll robbery where two men were killed because they were philosophical anarchists they were sentenced to death you wouldnt believe the reaction that went up all over the world american consulates and embassies in a dozen countries were marched upon there were riots and demonstrations everywhere tens of thousands of letters of protest ranging from students to worldfamous intellectuals hundreds of petitions signed by hundreds of thousands american officials were astonished the president getting reports from his ambassadors is reported to have asked who in the hell are sacco and vanzetti but in spite of it all after going through all possible appeals they were executed a pause ill put it more strongly they were martyred i guess i have read something about it roy said vaguely still scowling the newsman brought forth his wallet and fished in it this is one of the final things bartolomeo vanzetti wrote he was selfeducated forry brown read softly from the tattered clipping if it had not been for this thing i might have lived out my life talking at street corners to scorning men i might have died unmarked unknown a failure now we are not a failure this is our career and our triumph never in all our full life could we hope to do such work for tolerance for justice for mans understanding of man as now we do by accident our words our lives our pains nothing the taking of our lives lives of a good shoemaker and a poor fish peddlerall that last moment belongs to us that agony is our triumph forry brown looked up from the clipping their deaths werent the end hundreds of articles about them were published for years bestselling books were written about the saccovanzetti case there was even a longrunning play on broadway and a hit movie film in becoming martyrs bartolomeo vanzetti and nicola sacco at long last put over their message decades later they were vindicated by the state of massachussetts they hadnt even been guilty across the table the eyes of roy cos were shining chapter four horace hampton horace greeley hampton looked about appreciatively at the minicity of greenpoint when he emerged from the vacuum tube metro station he had been in similar towns before but never this one located scenically in the rolling hills of eastern pennsylvania it was composed of four ultramodern highrise apartment buildings the condominiums of the st century each seemed approximately fifty stories in height twintowered and sheathed in aluminum and glass not as imposing as the hundredfloor apartment buildings of the big cities yet large enough to contain all the amenities an ultramarket automated kitchens parking areas theatres auditoriums sports arenas much of it lay in the several basement levels below ground the restaurants throughout each of the buildings would be in wide variety ranging from malay and polynesian to vegetarian by the way of every wellknown cuisine the world offered greenpoint offered all of the amenities far beyond those available to the highrises devoted to proles in the early days of the minicities there had been comparatively little class discrimination an ultracondo would house five thousand or more families ranging from proles on gas in apartments on the lower levels to the extremely wealthy in the rarefied heights in swank penthouses and terrace apartments the higher you ascended in the towering buildings the larger and more expensive became the apartments needless to say the more posh became the restaurants nightclubs and theatres around each of the four apartment towers of greenpoint lay a square mile of gardens lakes small streams carefully tended woods it was complete with bridle and bike paths sports and picnic grounds playgrounds sidewalk cafes and skating areas very attractive indeed greenpoint was a new development in the progress of the minicity hamp doubted that a single prole family was in residence not even in the lowest levels the only proles in greenpoint would be service workers commuting from other nearby towns private cars and even hovercabs were of course prohibited on the surface small electric buses wound slowly around the narrow roads that connected all points all buildings hamp looked again at his note checked a bus schedule on a bulletin board next to the entry to the metro terminal and waited to be taken to the william penn building it was late afternoon and he hoped to be in manhattan by evening this line of league work was strange to him in the years that he had been active in the organization he had never been utilized for making initial contacts with possible recruits he was aware of the continuing necessity of the work and the league system someone would attend a lecture and sign the card handed around at its end or someone would hear a league tridi broadcast and write in for more information or someone would read a league pamphlet or book and be moved to request a visit from a member for discussion but hamp had quickly risen from the ranks had been sent to the training school for field operatives and had participated in troubleshooting ever since but it would seem that lee garrett was a possible recruit worthy of special attention max finklestein had said the new contact was white which was easy to believe hamp doubted that there were many blacks or other racial minorities residing in greenpoint not that there would be any restriction theoretically the nations laws wouldnt stand for that but nonwhites would be made to feel less than welcome he entered the sumptuous lobby of the william penn building very well done in marble beautifully furnished and decorated in an early pennsylvania motif and approached one of the small bank of reception desks he sat across from the reception screen and said i wish to visit lee garrett i believe that i am expected your identity please sir the screen said hamp brought forth his card put it in the slot with his right thumb on the appropriate square thank you the mechanical voice said he retrieved the credit card and relaxed in the chair after only a couple of minutes the screen said you are expected sir apartment please take elevator seven eight or nine hamp stood looked about and located the elevators a few people in the lobby looked at him with mild surprise not only was he black but his clothes though a bit above the usual prole level were hardly of the quality most often seen in greenpoint he had expected such interest and ignored it elevator eight was empty he stepped in and said apartment please the elevators screen said your identity card please he put it in the slot pressed his thumb on the identity square of the screen thank you sir the door closed and the elevator smoothly began to rise he emerged on the tenth floor and arrived shortly at apartment its identity screen picked him up as he stood before it and the door opened he entered and found himself in a small entrada a feminine voice called out in here youll have to forgive me but im busy hamp shifted his shoulders in a shrug and walked into a living room he blinked slightly at its opulence the antiracist league had its wealthy members but there must have been few who lived on a higher scale than this one whole wall facing a terrace with a superb view beyond was glass the furnishings were a little on the ultramodern side and hamp was somewhat taken aback by its feminity it was hardly a mans room could this lee garrett be gay at the far side a young woman was busily stirring the contents of a crystal mixing glass she concentrated as though counting the exact number of turns of the long green swizzle stick in her hand she looked over at him as he entered and offered a dazzling smile i guessed that a martini would be in order right it wasnt an autobar and sitting on its top were an imperial quart of british gin whose label hamp recognized and a fifth of french vermouth excellent guzzle it sounds wizard he admitted uh my name is horace hampton i had an appointment with mr garrett ms garrett she said smiling again as she poured drinks into two cocktail glasses im lee garrett hamp stared hed had no indication from max finklestein that this new contact was a youthful blonde startlingly blue of eye immaculately turned out and frankly implausibly beautiful she wore a gold and red afternoon frock that would have cost half a years credit to a prole on gas her hairdo and her cosmetics were such that surely she had just emerged from a beauty salon or a dressing room of an advertising agency she strode over gracefully handed him one of the martinis and smiled again devastating him shall we toast the end of all conflict i cant fight that hamp told her they sipped hamp taking her in all over again not quite believing it in real life they just didnt come so downright pretty she said please be seated mr hampton ill have to confess that this is all new to me ive never joined any sort of organization before hamp sat on a couch and took another sip of the cocktail about eight to one he judged seven she told him my fathers formula he was a fanatic a perfect martini had to be made just so i believe he actually dropped one friend because the man insisted on putting in an olive rather than a twist of lime rind hamp said well i cant fault him on this formula lee garrett had seated herself on the couch with him now she leaned forward and put her half empty glass on the cocktail table before them she said tell me all about the antiracist league mr hampton ive read quite a bit of the standard literature this past month or so and im in complete agreement with your stated goals but it occurred to me that there must be restrictions on what you can openly publish how do you mean ms garrett he put his own glass down empty it had been a lifesaver he had put away too much brandy the night before and was now wondering if shed offer another she said oh call me lee after all if were to be comrades in arms we shouldnt stand on formality hamp said comrades in arms call me hamp what i mean is the league is no nambypamby organization but it certainly cant come right out and advocate force and violence thats illegal so it doesnt say that in so many words in the public literature is there other written material meant only for members not that i know of just what did you want to know about the league that you couldnt find in our books well she frowned prettily just about everything i suppose i mean tell me all about it you know im surprised at your interest why should you be concerned with racism he smiled to take the edge off his words back in adolf the aryans day you would have been considered the nordic ideal she thought about it finally coming up with well i suppose im a dogooder at heart and im developing a bit of guilt over all this she waved at the elegant furnishings when so many especially among minorities or in some countries where the colored are actually the majority have so little and suffer so much my father left me more than i need for the rest of my life but well i do nothing im fed up with my friends and relatives all in the same position i want to do something worthwhile hamp nodded its not an unknown reaction engels the collaborator of karl marx was a wealthy manufacturer the russian anarchist kropotkin was a prince norman thomas the american socialist was married to a very wealthy woman he grinned suddenly but they rose above it so tell me more about racism and how you we can go about ending it hamp took a breath and said you must realize that racism is one of our oldest american traditions the united states declared its independence utilizing some of the most noble language in the history of the fight for mans freedom in one hundred years later marked the last major battle between the whites and american indians the sioux won the battle but lost the war one century in that short span whole tribes disappeared many tens of thousands were killed outright many more died of starvation some went down before the white mans diseases measles smallpox and so on at any rate here was racism at its naked worst lee nodded her eyes serious then glanced at his drink good heavens im a terrible hostess could i give you a refill he handed his glass to her and she went over to the ornate little bar she brought the new ones in champagne glasses so that they were at least doubles hamp made no complaint she told him her voice very sincere i couldnt agree with you more in regard to the indians most white americans will concede the amerind got a raw deal now that its too late hamp said well but we actually invited chinese labor perhaps he thought she was testing him sure coolie labor back in the th century to do manual work on the railroads the discrimination was pretty tough among other things they werent allowed to bring over their wives and families under the oriental exclusion laws no women at all they resorted to all sorts of tricks to get around that the smuggling of chinese women into the united states from mexico was very common even jack london in his yacht the snark participated in that he saw the blank look on her face and added jack london was an american writer of the rough and tough school quite a radical damn good man those i like she replied and took more of her martini goon the chinese and later japanese were hard workers the whites in the western states especially california could see the handwriting on the wall soon orientals even when born american citizens were forbidden to own land the japs who were wonderful farmers got around that by leasing land for ninetynine years they become real competition to the united farmers multimillionaire whites living as far off as new york who were the first in the world to invent socalled factoriesinthefield these were farms of hundreds of thousands of acres tilled by wage workers using the latest agricultural machinery and fertilizer at any rate the japanese with their driving industry had just about achieved a monopoly in truck farming involving a great deal of hand labor when the second world war came along the whites solved this by having all japanese on the west coast rounded up and shipped to concentration camps their property went for sacrifice prices even after the war they never really recovered he took a sizable swallow of his drink and she got up to replenish his glass bringing what remained with her to the cocktail table in actuality she told him ive become most interested in you blacks and what youre doing to fight back i want to know what i can do to help hamp was feeling the soothing qualities of the drink now and stretched his legs before him in comfort well he said youve undoubtedly read most of it in our literature blacks were brought over as slaves at least a slave had comparative security as valuable property he was clothed fed sheltered and given some medical care after the civil war freed him he worked for pay and if he became ill injured or old he was fired and had no way of maintaining himself werent lots of whites treated the same way some he admitted but blacks could take it for granted by the s they began to revolt nationwide they held parades and rallies fought segregation in the courts the whole bit it helped but not enough by the s more teenage blacks were unemployed than ever to the point of fifty percent in some cities twice as many blacks as whites dropped out of school in their early teens she leaned forward so how do you expect to change that now hamp nodded took another swallow then leaned forward and poured more from the mixing glass he said the trouble was they were too polite too easygoing about their fight for equality they paraded and protested and petitioned and tried to vote for politicians sometimes blacks who supposedly supported their cause the politicians must have had many a private laugh including the black ones who were just as crooked as their white colleagues in short our people turned the other cheek rather than really fighting when such outfits as the ku klux klan came into their segregated areas to burn their homes schools and churches they most often ran in terror when some militant blacks were killed they did no more than protest to the police and the civil liberties union which gave them some support there was a shine in lee garretts eyes so how have you changed your program now he moved over slightly closer to her and looked into her face his own very serious now we fight back a tooth for a tooth as the good book says we no longer run in terror when the klan dons its silly white sheets and begins burning crosses today the klan hardly exists as an active organization theyre the ones who are afraid now weve combined with chicanes puerto ricans amerinds jews and so on and we fight on every level from the streets to the senate floor and we never give an inch in any field we return blow for blow every intrusion on our rights as american citizens and members in good standing of the human race you accept conflict she said he moved still closer to her his face slightly slack as though from the drink and put an arm around her shoulders at that she stiffened slightly yes he said we fight no longer do we bob apologetically and call all white men captain or say yes suh no longer do we step down off the curb when a white comes along well fight that to the death you mean youve actually participated in killing people who stand in the way of minority rights he moved still closer and scowled his surprise oh of course not a few extreme cases have taken place blacks who have returned gunfire that sort of thing but not league members we dont condone violence that would just give the enemy an opening a wedge to get at us he moved closer still she tried to maneuver away from him without being too obvious about it but his arm was a restraint around her shoulders she got out yes but you just said that now you fought back his dark eyes were hotly on her own blue ones now there was a slur in his voice that was uh figuratively speaking not literally meant she was breathing in short gasps as his left hand came forward and rested on her belly suddenly her eyes widened in fear and she pushed back violently dont dont she shrilled let me loose you nigger hamp stood up and looked down at her shrinking against the far end of the couch he laughed gone were all signs of his drinking she panted what are you laughing at you black bastard he rubbed the knuckles of his left hand over his mouth and laughing still said you make a hell of an agent provocateur ms garrett im afraid youre the victim of your own prejudiced beliefs you see one of the oldest wives tales is the one about blacks lusting for the fair white bodies of caucasians on the face of it its nonsense didnt it ever occur to you that possibly youre not attractive to blacks your fine blonde hair might lack appeal didnt it ever occur to you that blacks might prefer brunette beauty that perhaps your nose might be much too thin your complexion forgive me washed out perhaps all but repulsive if i had to pick the most attractive whites it would be the girls of southern italy and sicily of andalusian spain or greece brunettes with dark complexions but scandinavians no thank you i dont screw blondes youre disgusting she said contemptuously every word of this is being taped of course he laughed again preparatory to leaving i suspected it i always suspect it but you see ms garrett i have said nothing to you that isnt to be found in our literature our leaflets pamphlets and books you said that these days youre fighting back an eye for an eye and so forth he smiled at her all figurative ms garrett as i pointed out to you the league does not condone violence and now thank you for the excellent martinis and good day he turned and left on his way down to the ground floor he wondered who had sent her possibly the iabi or just possibly she might have been working on her own he had been poorly managed whoever had set it up undoubtedly they had thought that her obvious wealth and position would immediately gain her access to the higher echelons of the antiracist league where she could infiltrate and secure inside information he shook his head again they simply couldnt realize that the league although it had a scattering of white members wasnt particularly impressed by either their whiteness or money the usual militant in the league was better educated than most though often selfeducated and was dedicated disciplined and competent he retraced his way to the transportation terminal and retrieved the suitcase he had checked earlier he took the first centyseater scheduled for manhattans grand central terminal on his way he brought forth his transceiver and reported to the national activities committee the results of his contact with lee garrett he hailed an automated hovercab the only vehicle allowed on the surface in the city and dialed a renowned mens store manhattan was still a center for those who ignored the ultramarkets and resorted to privately owned swank shops there he quickly disillusioned the clerk who eyed his color shabby suit and battered suitcase saying im just in from the coast where ive been roughing it gathering material for my latest novel i want a complete utitfit in which i can walk out of here the very best of course oh yes sir the other said im sure we can accommodate you when hamp left an hour or so later he not only wore the latest in expensive mens wear but also had two new pieces of imported british luggage he had paid with an international credit card issued on a berne switzerland bank the boys carrying his luggage took everything out to the curb and summoned another hovercab for him he dialed and settled back his destination turned out to be one of the taller more impressive office buildings the island boasted the cab had been directed to a minor entrance on a side street he entered alone there was no doorman nor any other building employee nor resident to be seen he brought a key ring from his pocket selected a small silver key and opened the door of an elevator the elevator compartment without a command as to his destination accelerated not too quickly but for a lengthy period before reaching its ultimate speed he was able to adjust without bending his knees he emerged finally into a large office reception room which was unoccupied and strolled across it to a heavy door though metallic it was attractively well done to disguise its strength he opened it with another key beyond was a roomy office with four desks and beyond that a still more ample one with a single large desk he passed through both of the silent rooms and on into an extensive terrace apartment obviously at ease he made his way to a master bedroom where he put down his bags and stripped then entered the bath which had a connecting dressing room in the bath he used still another small key to open a medical cabinet from which he brought forth a hypodermic needle a small bottle and a jar expertly he loaded the syringe and injected himself he then sat before the dressingroom mirror and removed the contact lenses from his eyes revealing their natural dark blue he put the fingernails of his two little fingers into his nostrils and brought forth two ringlike metal spreaders which altered the shape of his nose he returned to the bathroom took up the jar he had taken from the medical cabinet and entered the shower stall when he had adjusted the spray to his satisfaction he began vigorously to shampoo his hair with dabs of the contents of the jar he entered the shower with black wiry hair and left it with darkish red hair considerably straighten and looking like a young athletes crew cut he checked in a mirror found that the injection hadnt begun to work in a white silk kimono and matching slippers he shuffled back into the living room and the extensive study he sat at the desk and flicked on the tv phone activating the stud which would prevent his own face from being transmitted punched two numbers and waited until the screen lit up he said to the subservient face there simmons i shall be in residence here in manhattan for an indefinite period please summon the staff immediately i wish to dine here this evening inform henri that i expect him to surpass himself i have been subjected to atrocious food for longer than i care to think about very good sir the face of simmons faded and horace hampton punched two more numbers the new face was that of an efficient businessman somewhere in his early middle years hamp said barry im back in the states here in manhattan have one of the office teams assembled include yourself and let me see ted and ah lester among other things well have to do some immediate work on the investments in lagrange five and the asteroid islands yes sir barry said sir something has come up i tried to contact you by every means but well with the usual results it seems we have a situation fraught with tell me about it when you get here hamp said brusquely whats the enjoyment in being a recluse if every senior member of your staff can get in touch with you every time he thinks an emergency has surfaced yes sir there was resigned disapproval in the others face hamp faded him off arose from his chair and stretched his shoulder muscles in spite of the time of day he went over to the bar and brought forth a bottle of stone age armagnac and a snifter glass he poured a sizable jolt then went over to the bookshelves searching for a moment before selecting a copy of cheikh anta diops the african origin of civilization in the original french and returned with it to his chair in the next half hour he went through a good quarter of the brandy several times checking with the mirror at the end of that period he was satisfied with what he saw the face that looked back at him was that of say a welltanned frenchman he went back into the study and again sat at his restricted phone screen he punched for a foreign call and then twice again the face that appeared was a twin of his own including dark blue eyes crewcut reddish hair and the welltanned face of a european playboy hamp said briskly jim im taking over for an indefinite time probably a month or so go to ground assume your usual identity ill get in touch when i need you the other grinned any suggestions you might try the malta retreat but be on immediate call youre the boss jim told him you slave driver the face of his standin faded chapter five franklin pinell frank pinell looked about the shabby windowless room of the hotel rome in the international zone of tangier ten dirhams a day two pseudodollars cheap perhaps for any shelter at all but with the cost of food his bankroll would melt away in short order it was late afternoon but hed had lunch on the jet with his two escorts and wasnt yet hungry the thing to do was to get out and start to make contacts if there were jobs to be had he was going to have to find one soonest he had only been here for a couple of hours but he had seen what poverty was like in the old old town of tangier and wanted no part of it seemingly there was no sort of government relief whatever for the poor certainly nothing like gas it was orientation time he must contact his fellow englishspeaking residents he went into the hall taking the key that luigi had given him locking the door behind why he couldnt say he had left nothing in the room he had nothing to leave on his way out he hung the key on the rack behind the desk on the face of it anyone coming along could have taken it down or any of the others and stripped the place but strip it of what he doubted that any of the other tenants of the fleabag had much more in the way of possessions than he had he walked down the rickety stairs to the ground level and looked up and down rue moussa ben moussair as drab a street as he had ever seen the cab driver who had stolen his luggage had told him that pasteur boulevard the town center was two blocks up he headed left reached rue goya turned left again he carefully checked his route having no desire to get lost two blocks up rue goya came into pasteur boulevard and the immediate change couldnt have been more definite its two or three blocks could have been directly out of a swank florida or southern california resort the cars many chauffeur driven were the latest from common europe the americas and the asiatic league the pedestrians were largely europeans with a sprinkling of orientals and a few north africans all seemed prosperous the suits of the men had been cut in london rome manhattan the clothes of the women in paris budapest copenhagen or los angeles the women were strictly tridi shows most of them could have passed as the latest sex symbols of the entertainment world or as fashion models every hair seemed to be in place quite a few tripped along behind poodles and pomeranians surprised by the opulence frank turned left on the boulevard and walked along slowly staring into the shop windows save for such centers as manhattan in his own country in an age when cities were crumbling frank pinell had seldom seen privately owned shops before his was an era of automated ultramarkets through which credit could purchase anything from a safety pin to a yacht but these that lined the main boulevard of european tangier were the purveyors of ultimate luxury clothing and shoe stores art galleries jewelry stores gourmet food shops liquor stores mingled among them were small intimate restaurants offering the outstanding cuisines of the world and even more intimate cocktail lounges on the face of it not all of tangier was povertystricken he stood to one side for a moment and watched the passersby an indian woman a red caste mark on her forehead went past in a golden sari he had never witnessed a more graceful female in his life a parisian by the looks of her went by complete with arrogant champagne poodle what had macdonald said about the madrid mopsies being the most beautiful in the world frank doubted it perhaps this girl wasnt a prostitute or even a mistress but if she was he wondered vaguely what she charged for a nights entertainment two men passed briskly attache cases in hand in business suits that looked as though theyd come from the tailors less than half an hour previously they had the healthy tanned barbered massaged look of the ultimately successful then an oriental girl tripped along in an offwhite silken cheongsam the slits at the outer thighs mesmerizing him he had thought the indian in her sari the epitome of grace but this lovely little creature looked like a chinese doll he looked up and down the boulevard wondering where to go and what to do all his impulses were to enter one of the bars and have the drink he needed his present finances didnt allow for alcoholic beverages certainly not at the prices that would prevail here a voice from behind him said cooee mate you look like a flashing lost soul dinkum you do could a bloke give you a steer frank turned sharply grinning down at him from a height of at least six foot four was a long cheerfully rugged type a spanking new australian bush hat pushed back on his head but otherwise as nattily dressed as the other males on the street somehow he looked slightly uncomfortable in his tailored afternoon suit indeed he was on the gawky side and obviously meant for the ranch rather than a citys sidewalks frank said what you look like a yank strewth a yank or maybe a canuck new in this barstid town dont want to be cheeky but you dont look like you know your way around whato frank said oh thanks fact is i just pulled in and dont know the ropes is there some place a neighborhood where americans hang out not just americans but anybody who speaks english he hesitated then stuck out his hand and said frank pinell and yeah american youre australian too right nat fraser bonzer to meet you frank his hand was huge dry as the outback and strong not as many yanks aussies or even limeys in town as youd bloody well wish you go crazy as a kookaburra for a fresh face or two youre permanent here frank said regaining his wellsqueezed and pumped hand too true oh my word and dont think i wouldnt do a bunk if i could crikey i havent had a contract for donkeys years now lets see a bar where the english speaking coves hang out well mate actually theres three theres the parade where the toffs take on their plonk he took in franks suit probably too rich for your blood whato frank said after letting air out of his lungs ruefully sounds like it im on a limited budget and i need a job the australian cocked his head at him going to be in this googly town for a spell eh frank could think of no reason for disguising his status im a deportee he said watching the others face to get his reaction there wasnt any nat fraser was going on as though he hadnt heard the confession then theres the carousel over on rue rubens not your cup of tea cobber what do you yanks call them gays i doubt you get your lollies that way no frank said whats this third one paul runds down on the grand socco thats the biggest souk in town and paul sells the cheapest plonk in tangier drink it and you wake up with the jumping joe blakes in the moring fair dinkum as a matter of fact cobber i was off in that direction meself when i bagged you looking lost if you dont mind ill tag along frank said bloody well told lets go they started up the boulevard frank looked up at his elongated companion and said do you think i might make a contact at this pauls bar nat fraser considered it with the two thousand swiss francs i suppose youve got in your kick from your flashing government id think you could wait it out until youre able to cobber up somebody who could give you a steer frank inwardly winced but said nothing about the fact that his thousand pseudodollars had melted down to less than two hundred at the end of pasteur boulevard they entered an attractive square largely lined with sidewalk cafes place de france the aussie told frank the sidewalk tables were well patronized largely by prosperous european types most of whom were reading newspapers moroccan waiters in red fezzes and baggy black pants like bloomers scurried around taking and delivering orders there was a superfluity of shoeshine boys they turned right down a winding street considerably narrower than pasteur boulevard had been the composition of the pedestrians began to change radically as they progressed they saw fewer people in european clothing and more in the dress of africa the near east and the orient the rue de la liberte nat fraser told him where the bloody twain meets you know east is east and west is west he gave running comment on races and costume there were growing numbers of rifs arabs berbers even an occasional blue man down from the mountains the name of the latter nat explained sprang from the indigo dye of their robes which when they sweated came off on their skins giving them an eerie look at least half of the women still wore the djellaba or haik with veil half the men wore the brown camelshair burnoose africa evidently changed slowly even in the st century and this is the grand socco mate cooee a fair cow eh ever see so many wogs in your life it was a large square packed with humanity and with a hundred different varieties of stalls flower booths food stands and herb stands hashish being among the other socalled herbs there were displays of vegetables fruits handwoven textiles yellow or white babouche slippers and a multitude of other commodities some seemingly desirable in the eyes of moroccans and some aimed deliberately to attract tourists there were still more of the arabs and rifs plus sailors up from the port and european riffraff from a score of countries donkeys seemed to be the means of transport no car could have gotten through the press of bodies odors of mint saffron and kif the north african cannabis mingled in the air rather than press into the souk the teeming native market they turned left and did their best to get through the crowded way the australian in front running interference it seemed one hell of a strange location for an englishspeaking bar nat was explaining over his shoulder pauls been here for donkeys years he said hes so warm in half a dozen countries hell never be able to leave owes something like a hundred and fifteen years in italy alone for smuggling and with his tb he wouldnt last six months in one of those cold damp wop nicks no extradition from tangier hell never leave oh my word interpol would grab him in ten minutes if he put a toe down in gibraltar they arrived at pauls bar there was a small faded sign hanging out in front inside it was dark and cool but hardly prepossessing there were six or seven stools at the bar three tables with chairs on the walls were pasted aged clippings about the proprietors exploits in the old days when he was allegedly a ranking lockpicker screwsman grifter and smuggler they were alternated with pinups from aged pornographic magazines from the ceiling hung a fishermans net and a ships wheel which doubled as a chandelier a vain attempt to give pauls bar a nautical decor there were only three people present one slumped at a table head on arms one seated dejectedly on a stool at the bar with a bottle of beer before him and the bartender himself automated bars seemed to be unknown in tangier at least in this part of town the medina as nat had named it the bartender had once been a larger man now he was emaciated his sallow face had a sardonic quality and he wore a motheaten vandyke beard tinged with gray he looked up when the newcomers entered and wiped the wellworn bar with a dirty bar rag uselessly he said cheers nat then looked at frank it seemed that in pauls bar one was introduced before being served nat and frank crawled onto stools and the austalian said paul meet frank pinell a new cobber in town from the states hes looking for a contact paul put a thin hand over the bar and shook hands however his eyes were narrow what kind of a contact he said it was the tone that bothered frank he said well i dont know just about anything i guess you warm paul rund said frank thought he understood what the other meant only in the states he said and then not particularly liking this added why paul leaned on the bar and said because this is a poxy town frank theres no extradition laws theres practically no laws at all but what there are get pretty well obeyed get it this is the end of the line for a lot of grifters theres no place else to go if they kick you out so were poxy careful not to foul our own nest get it we lay doggo thats the word lay doggo we dont take no scores here in tangier absolutely and the boys take a dim view if anybody tries it we dont want the present easygoing laws to be no way changed thats the dinkum oil nat said nodding but youve got it wrong paul gawd strewth pull your head in frank didnt come here to do a romp deported from the states he was the poor coves got to cobber up with somebody and get an angle paul evidently took the tall australians word for it he said good show just wanted to tell you the drill here frank you look like the type of sod whod pinch something here in tangier and put all our bloody arses in a sling whatll it be lads first drinks on the bloody house frank nat said make it a couple of storks paul he looked at frank as the bartender turned to serve them not up to aussie brew strike me blind but from what i hear better than you yanks are turning out these days it wouldnt have to be very good frank told him they make synthobeer from sawdust or something the two took their bottles of beer and glasses and went to the remotest of the three tables and sat down the beer glass wasnt clean but frank didnt give a damn he poured appreciatively it was the first drink hed had for several months and a lot of guff had been thrown at him in the past couple of days in particular not bad suds considering its made by ragheads his companion said downing his whole glass in one vast draught the cheeky barstids dont suppose to ever enjoy a shivoo in their whole narky lives oh my word no against allahs buggering rules frank didnt take much longer to finish his the aussie was right it wasnt bad beer at all probably still made from malt and hops he assumed instead of the crap being turned out at home these days for the prole palate nat said how about another cobber he came to his feet frank said all right but i ought to pay for this dont be a zany you cant afford to play the toff until you get yourself settled in been down on the bone meself in me time settle down cobber the aussie went over to the bar and secured another couple of bottles from the thinfaced bartender frank looked after him thoughtfully when he had returned and they had refilled their glasses frank held his up and said thanks nat mud in your eye nat said holding up his glass in toast fuck ireland they both drank and then frank said what did you say oh fuck ireland frank looked at him why the australians easygoing face took an expression of being put upon cooee cobber i dont know thats what we say in melbourne strewth frank said look here nat do you always talk this way i miss about half of what you mean nat fraser grinned a ruefulness there a bit thick eh always sets you yanks back i wasnt trying to cozen you frank chuckled the first occasion he could remember having done so for some time he said all right no harm done but lets keep it on a level where we communicate fair dinkum the american looked about the room then brought his eyes back to his newfound friend nat he said this doesnt exactly look like an employment agency in fact its obviously a lowclass bar where the towns less prosperous uh grifters i believe is the term paul used hang out nat looked around too taking in the other customers both on the seedy side too right he admitted shall we do a bunk you mean get out no frank told him whyd you bring me here nat the overlengthy aussie let his sunfaded eyebrows go up whato cobber you think i was trying to cozen you look frank said patiently im game but not everybodys i was walking along the street minding my own business suddenly youre there winsome as a pimp but you sure as hell dont act like one fifteen minutes later were in this dump why the australian went over and got two more bottles of stork beer and returned with them he was grinning you said you were a deportee he told frank as he put the bottles down so im the local recruiting sergeant cobber frank stared at him even while upending the bottle over his glass what is that supposed to mean had any military training at all no nat fraser looked disappointed dont twig anything about a shooter eh what did they nail you for cobber i didnt say that my old man was a gun crank had quite a collection i didnt see much of him but he used to get a kick out of showing me the workings of everything from capandball revolvers to new gyrojets what was i nailed for homicide the easygoing aussie took him in for a long moment frank said recruiting sergeant for what mercenaries incorporated frank scowled never heard of it the grafs outfit never heard of him either you mean professional soldiers of fortune thats the dinkum oil this is one of the big staging areas for many a contract the graf gets a contract and we put the operation together here in tangier i thought paul said you pulled nothing off here that tangier was sort of neutral ground the boys as he called them didnt want to foul their own nest fair dinkum we dont do anything here in tangier just recruit blokes who want to earn a little money and put the operation together the grafs sometimes got other operations going we crew some of them too arent as many bloody contracts these days as there used to be but some bush wars down south between all the dictators presidents for life and that whole mucking lot some in the far east too but we dont handle those operations theyre based in singapore and penang the grafs got his representatives there as well frank said soldiers of fortune eh hiring yourself out to kill for money there was disgust in his voice the ordinarily amiable aussie looked at him coldly what other reason is mere to fight cobber a soldiers job is to win wars if you pick that probloodyfession you wind up killing people usually other soldiers whove picked the same trade some of his exaggerated aussie slang seemed to have dropped away frank said the theory is that the usual soldier is fighting for his country hes doing his duty defending it too right thats the theory but its not the reality im not talking about blokes drafted during wartime they cant get out of it even if they want to but your professional soldiers are a bunch of hypocrites at least a mercenary can choose what side he fights on but your career soldier rights whoever the politicians tell him to look at the germans in the nazi war were they fighting for their country fucking well not they were fighting for that dingo barstid hitler and his gang frank was irritated by the others strong opinions he said even granting that doesnt excuse a mercenary fighting for whoever will pay him half a mo cobber ive never taken a contract for some rucking barstid like hitler or any other politician i thought was buggering up his country sometimes ive been offered contracts where i wouldnt fight on either side frank stood and said ill get another ah buggering beer nat said reaching into a pocket you ought to let me shout the suds why frank said im not a potential recruit no reason i should be freeloading on you at the bar while paul rund was getting the fresh bottles of stork the wizened bartender said signing up with the graf frank frank eyed him i dont think so do you know of any other jobs kicking around the other popped off the two beer caps then ran his thin fingers through his bedraggled vandyke you might get a berth on one of the boats not as many of them as there used to be but i heard sam mcqueen needed a couple of men what kind of boats paul rund looked at him as though he had hardly expected that question smugglers frank said for christs sake i thought you said there was nothing illegal pulled off in tangier the bartender said patiently smuggling aint illegal you buy a cargo of hashish or tobacco here perfectly legit and run it to one of the countries where its taboo get it and you sell it there so you havent broken any law in tangier smugglers are reputable citizens here get it the american shook his head and took up the two beers to his relief they cost only two dirhams apiece in pauls back at the table after they had both poured nat eraser said so youre not interested i suppose not look im not holier than thou in fact i suspect my father was some sort of mercenary possibly in espionage i dont know he and my mother were separated when i was a kid i didnt see him much he was usually out of the country i think at any rate he was finally shot on one of his trips i havent any desire to end the same way the other shurgged broad shoulders the grafs got other operations like i said maybe he could find a place in the organization for a nice presentable cove like yourself from what youve said so far about his operations i doubt it frank said finishing his beer he stood somewhat to his surprise he could feel the drink possibly stork was stronger than the gassy anemic american brew he was used to he said thanks anyway nat ill see you around too right cobber if you change your mind im usually here this time of night frank sent his glance out of one of the dirty windows it was dark out on the grand socco he hadnt realized theyd been talking for so long he left after waving to paul rund and stood for a moment before the door not a fraction of the teeming moroccans were still on the streets or in the souk evidently everything folded in the medina with the coming of night he made his way past shuttered stalls past steelbarred store fronts retracing his route as best he could he shook his head over the experiences of the past few hours no crime in tangier eh uhhuh aside from the iabi men ripping off eight hundred of his thousand pseudodollars the customs officer had lifted his camera his cab driver had stolen his luggage he had been offered a job as a mercenary despite his lack of experience and had been told he might land a berth on a boat smuggling narcotics he came to a street that might be rue de la liberte and headed up it it was too dark to make out the signs he thought the street should have had more pedestrian traffic and more lights than this the blow that struck him on the back of the neck took him completely unawares he felt his mouth sag open even as he crumbled at first he wasnt completely out but agonizingly paralyzed he could feel hands hastily going through his pockets turning them inside out two more shadowy figures came hurriedly to his side he tried to last but could feel no power in his limbs one of his assailants thoughtfully kicked him in the side of the head and then the fog rolled over him chapter six roy cos from greater miami they were lobbed over to the island of new providence by laser boost in approximately ten minutes roy cos strapped into his enveloping seat took a deep breath as acceleration loads mounted and said never been in one of these things before i wish i could say the same forry brown told him in his usual sour voice i hate the damn things roy looked out the small thick glass porthole at the unbelievable blue sea with its occasional frothed ripples of waves thats the gulf stream eh yeah forry told him it keeps the bahamas at a constant yearround temperature of between seventy and eighty in the shade george washington was one of the first tourists here he called them the isles of perpetual june below the wobbly organizer could already see small islands he said how many of them are there they had reached the peak of their arc now and for a few seconds were in free fall before their shuttle began the deceleration the little exnewsman said most people think of the bahamas as only the town of nassau but actually there are about islands and nearly cays and rocks his tone took on a cynical singsong parody of a tour guide scattered like a fistful of pearls in turquoise waters extending over an area of square miles roy looked over at him youve been here before eh thats right actually its one of the most beautiful resort areas in the world ah were coming in the shuttle landed at the windsor international airport and forry brown had a cigarette in his mouth before they started down the gangway jostling along with their fellow passengers roy cos hadnt experienced much in the way of natures charms in his fortysome years it cost money to seek nature out on the mainland and hed never had more than gas now his first impression as they walked in bright sunlight toward customs was one of flowerscented breezes even here at the shuttleport there were gaudy bahamian flowers purple and red bougainvillea yellow and red hibiscus pink white and red oleander royal purple passionflowers their mingling perfumes gave a subtle fragrance to the southeast trade winds not that roy cos knew their names beyond roses daisies and tulips he was lost in the world of flowers as his parents before him he was a prole born and proles seldom had gardens customs was the merest of formalities forry browns attache case and roy coss battered briefcase werent even opened however roys credit card which doubled as his passport brought up the eyes of the black man in the bahama immigrations uniform he said politely suh gas credits are not valid in the islands forry said mr cos is my guest he handed over his own universal card jolly well suh the other told him returning the exnewsmans credit card and then touching the brim of his cap in an easygoing salute they passed on toward the metro station where everyone seemed to be heading roy looked over at the other from the side of his eyes and said i didnt know that immigrations men could tell what type of pseudodollar credits were accredited to a universal credit card by just looking at it and what was that about gas credits not being valid you cant spend your gas outside the limits of the united states of the americas forry told him the government wants you to spend it at home why subsidize foreign countries by spending unearned credits in them the bahamas along with cuba are the only caribbean islands that dont belong to the united states the bahamas wont join because its more profitable to stand on the sidelines and offer gambling and offbeat banking practices such as numbered accounts and multinational commercial deals like deathwish policies anything goes in the bahamas they havent got the restrictive laws we rejoice in at home they figure any adult should be allowed to go to hell in his own way just so that doesnt interfere with anyone else ill be damned you mean you can even buy heroin here openly and things like tobacco yes the other told him ironically flicking his cigarette butt into a waste receptacle the metro system had probably been imported from the united states roy realized the vacuum cars had them into downtown nassau within minutes they emerged from the central metro station onto an avenue teeming with pedestrians and bicycles but even more devoid of cars than an american city would have been this was the downtown area the harbor immediately before them roys first impression was that the whole place was a museum only in historical films had he seen buildings which seemed to go back to at least victorian days forry looked around too a warmth in his squinting eyes he obviously liked the town he said continuing his tour guide lecturing this is bay street the main tourist shopping center its a free port no taxes so the tourists go hog wild over there is rawson square with the government administration buildings over theres the post office and that statues queen victoria the garden behind contains the public library and museum which dates back to and was originally built as a jail they turned left on bay street walking along as rapidly as ae shopping traffic would allow the buildings seemed completely devoted to tourist stores bars and restaurants roy said i wouldnt think theyd have much need for jails in a place like this his small gray companion laughed in its earliest days this island was a pirate center blackbeard himself built a lookout tower down the beach a ways after the pirates were kicked out the bahamas went into a depression until the american revolution when they became prosperous smuggling military supplies to the colonists then they went into the doldrums again until our civil war when they became the clearinghouse for sneaking cotton out to england and france and smuggling guns in to the confederates then another depression until prohibition when they all got rich running rum eventually they hit on becoming an allout any thinggoes resort area now theyve parlayed that up to include international banking and other criminal activities oh never fear theyve always been able to use a good jail here in nassau they turned down parliament street and shortly the shops gave way to small business buildings and private homes even business was housed in ancient structures the private homes were largely built of island limestone with upper porches that hung over the streets to protect them from the sun wide verandas had been built in graceful wooden construction with louvers to admit cooling breezes the wobbly organizer stared at something coming down the street he said i dont think ive ever seen a horsedrawn carriage before thats a surrey the other told him they hate cars out here you seldom see one except those used by government the newsman looked at a card he drew from his jacket pocket this seems to be the address it was a prosperouslooking business establishment in the victorian tradition there was a small bronze plaque which roy couldnt make out above the entry and a uniformed black standing before it the man touched his cap at their approach and held open the door they seemed to use more manpower here than in the automated states the interior continued the victorian motif with a few concessions to the tropics there was a pervasive britishness about it all roy had expected the company would be american with some affiliation to a sinister background such as the mafia forry brown seemed to sense what his companion was thinking and said this outfit is a subsidiary of one of the big insurance companies in hartford its multinational of course specializing in deathwish policies though it has some other farout bits of business going there was a sterile reception office presided over by a live receptionist plain of face her dull hair done up in an unfashionable bun she wore a washed out shapeless light dress forry said good morning mr roy cos on appointment to see mr oliver brettjames very good sir she clipped checking a notepad you are expected mr brettjames will see you immediately she did the things receptionists do speaking into a comm set saying yes sir a couple of times and then pressing a button she came to her feet saying this way please and led them down a short hallway she held open a door and bestowed on them what she probably thought was a smile roy and forry entered a moderately large office once again with a londonish feel stolid spotless cold mr oliver brettjames was standing behind an oldfashioned wooden desk he was tubby almost naked of scalp red rather than tanned his complexion more from bottles man the bahamian sun his smile was conservatively polite though he seemed surprised to see two of them mr cos he said thats right roy told him neither of them made a motion toward shaking hands under the circumstances it didnt seem exactly called for and you sir the englishman said to forry forrest brown forry said im mr coss business agent business agent well no reason why not i daresay be seated gentlemen shall we get immediately to business here is the contract it goes into effect tomorrow and here is your international credit card drawn on our swiss bank in beme each day as you undoubtedly know you will have one million pseudodollars at your disposal it doesnt accumulate of course but each day you have that amount available roy and forry had taken chairs in front of the desk forry said sourly scratching a thumbnail over his meager mustache suppose we read the contract before signing certainly old chap the briton said i merely thought that you were already cognizant of its contents in which case thered be no point in mucking around he handed a threepage sheaf of paper to each of them and then leaned back patiently in his swivel chair his two callers read what he had given them carefully forry had already dug up copies of the standard deathwish policy and this didnt deviate from it after a few minutes while they were still reading brettjames cleared his throat and said please take note of clause three you must understand that we will not tolerate frivolous expenditures that is suppose you decide to purchase a diamond or a painting if the price is over pseudodollars we will have an expert evaluate the item we do not expect to have you spending say pseudodollars on something which is really worth but we expect our specialists to check out the true value within reason of course the gem or painting as the case might be reverts to us upon your ah unfortunate demise forry looked up finally and said just how much does the policy pay off in benefits to you when mr cos ah passes on oliver brettjames stiffened i say that isnt really a concern of yours now is it forry took him in yes he said the details of this transaction will help me in supervising his interests the other didnt like it but he said finally our corporation will receive ten million pseudodollars in the way of benefits forry said gently and how much are the daily premiums that you must pay see here mr uh brown this is of no interest to we think it is the exnewsman said he brought a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and shook forth a smoke we either find out or mr cos doesnt sign he put the cigarette in his colorless lips and brought forth his lighter brettjames stared at him for a long moment but finally said the daily premiums are one million pseudodollars the grayfaced forry nodded as he lit up blowing smoke through his pinched nostrils clear enough you have to do roy in within ten days or you start losing money the signing of the contract was witnessed by the receptionist and another nonentity she brought in a young man who avoided roys eyes as he signed when the two witnesses were gone brettjames rubbed his hands together and said jolly well i daresay youll be returning immediately to the mainland where will you be staying forry looked at him flatly get serious he said do you think wed give you that much of a head start he put roys copy of the contract into his attache case when they had left the other pressed a button on his desk and four men entered one of them the young witness brettjames said youve got the photos the tapes and all the oldest of the four nodded yes sir very well get to work on both of them check out this forrest brown chap well want to know just where he fits in brettjames made a motion with his hand all right maurice tail them follow the instructions i gave you earlier as they walked back toward bay street forry looked at his wrist chronometer weve got over an hour before the next shuttle to miami we might as well eat blackbeards tavern is a good place right roy said immersed deeply in bleak thoughts they reached the shopping center and turned left the little exnewsman stopped at a shop and said just a minute i might as well stock up here the sign said solomons mines and they entered to find the store devoted almost exclusively to tobacco products roy muttered jesus christ in the states this shop wouldve been raided before it opened his companion ordered a dozen packs of russian imperial gold tip blacks and began stuffing them into his pockets a fraction of what they cost on the black market at home he said here stick these away he handed roy six packs wait a minute roy cos said indignantly suppose they nail me with them at american customs its a bad policy for a member of the wobblies a radical cant afford to be anything else offbeat it gives them a handle to get at you forry said impatiently they never search your person at customs unless youre a known smuggler or have a criminal record when they check you out in the data banks roy shrugged in resignation and distributed the six packages of cigarettes about his pockets as they left the shop the little newsman was tearing one pack open he shook out a goldtipped blackpapered cigarettee and said like to try one for gods sake do i look stupid you think i want to wind up with my lungs eaten away and my heart pounding overtime forry grinned theyve been denouncing alcohol for centuries but i notice youre not particularly opposed to taking a drink its only excessive use of alcohol thats condemned roy told him his tone righteous moderate use of alcohol has been a blessing to man since prehistory by christ you radicals are the most conservative cloddies going youre worse than the united church excess of anything will do you in drink enough water and youll drown they argued companionably deliberately avoiding the subject uppermost in both their minds blackbeards tavern turned out to be a cozy bar and restaurant with a small calypso band playing in the background surprisingly softly they took a table and a whitejacketed barefooted black was there immediately to take their order forry said with obvious anticipation native bahamians have their own food specialties that are hard to get elsewhere conch for instance a kind of shellfish well have conch chowder green turtle pie and baked andros crabs and black beer to go with it roy put down his menu and let the other do all of the ordering when the waiter was gone he said i think we were followed yeah i noticed that forry said forget about it the contract doesnt go into effect until tomorrow but dont forget that tomorrow starts at midnight meanwhile they most certainly dont want anything to happen to you before then that bastard tailing us is more like a bodyguard than anything else at this stage itll be something else if we see him tomorrow the waiter brought large mugs of very dark beer and shortly afterward the conch chowder they ate without joy stolidly going through the motions while lost in their thoughts it had been one thing planning this coup but getting down to the nittygritty in brettjamess office had brought home reality the contract was signed now and there was no going back as of midnight roy would have a price on his pelt again they avoided saying what was uppermost in both of their minds forry skated near it with funny how societies always seem to provide for the future by accident ever consider that maybe this bland food is preparing us for a dull future roy frowned at his plate it is kind of tasteless you mean were getting ourselves ready for an era of the blahs the little newsman said a slow dissolution maybe he nodded agreement with himself without necessarily deliberate planning society provides for the future in this case a future in which over ninety percent of the population became proles the big difference between proles and slaves is that the slaves had to work to maintain the upper classes but now machinery does practically all of the work and proles are real drones absolutely worthless roy said scowling how do you mean society provided for my future i didnt ask to become a complete drone it was foisted on me the newsman nodded again and put down his fork giving up the food for which neither of them had found enthusiasm youre an exception but over a century ago society was already preparing for the day of the prole most kids at that time were already spending more time watching tv than they were spending in school oh there were good schools in the united states such as mit johns hopkins berkeley caltech and so on and the good schools turned out possibly five percent of the college graduates of the time but the rest of the school system was a shambles kids got out of grammar school unable to read and write hell many of them graduated from high school unable to function as adults couldnt make out an application couldnt keep up a checkbook their reading was confined to comic books or strips in the newspapers or painfully wading through the sports pages they got their news to the extent they were interested at all from tv commentators i still dont see how that leads to society preparing for the future roy said scowling still this wasnt gospel as laid down by the wobbly movement our people were being prepared for becoming proles unemployables in modern society youve got to have a good education to hold down a job fine the five percent needed today got a good education its not necessary that the ninety percent have one in fact its a disadvantage an educated man unemployed is a potentially dangerous man he can think and question and act on the answers he comes up with our educational system was weaning our youth away from an aggressive approach to life taking the guts out of them preparing them for their future as proles roy said softly still in rejection so whats our future what lies ahead for us probably more of the same and the upper class will continue to get richer and smaller as it eliminates the lower levels of its own class who are thrown down into the ranks of the proles if their fortunes are lost by whatever means including being pissed away the wobbly looked at him thoughtfully he said his voice slow youre more interested in these things than youve admitted arent you forry how come you picked a wobbly on this project of yours why not a luddite or neonihilist or possibly a libertarian and why met forry brown tossed his napkin to the table and looked at his wrist chronometer we have to get going he said bringing his card from his pocket you werent my first choice roy i approached another national organizer of the wobblies before you he evidently wasnt cut out to be a martyr he turned me down chapter seven lee garrett gary mcbride entered the nuits st georges restaurant his eyes on his wrist chronometer he looked around hurriedly frowned and then went into the bar lounge lee garrett sat at a small table a glass before her she seemed not at all impatient he came up to her his smile just slightly drawn ms garrett of course he said he took in the glass with its light golden contents by george he said not a drink before eating the specialties of burgundy he took the tables second chair im gary mcbride she smiled brightly at him her almost unbelievably blue eyes taking in his male fashion model appearance not only was gary mcbride handsome in the best upper class tradition but he was dressed for the part his suit shirt and shoes were exactly what the youthful senior executive in manhattan was wearing not just this year but probably this week she said after shaking hands only a sherry tio pepe i should hope he said anything stronger or less dry would play havoc with ones palate she did a little laugh as though he were joking tio pepe is so dry it gives me heartburn then not another sip of that he told her severely andre would be desolate shall we go to our table he took her arm and led her to the dining room lee was dressed in green irish tweeds which would have denigrated any figure less superb than her own she looked very businesslike her simple white blouse and low heels very sincere the maitre d greeted them unctuously and led them to a table tucked intimately away in a small nook the decor was early french bistro reproductions of toulouse lautrecs posters aged advertisements of ricard pernod and a rheims champagne the room was moderately full of prosperous diners andre put menus before them brought forth a pad and stylo and looked inquiringly politely and most earnestly at gary mcbride gary mcbride said to lee the menu is in french shall i order please do she said putting down her own carte consulting with the headwaiter as he went very seriously indeed gary mcbride ordered as their first course oeufs en cocotte bourguignonne with a meursault to accompany it when the wine arrived andre again presided pouring a small amount into mcbrides tulipshaped glass he sipped it carefully after he tested the bouquet and thoughtfully pursed his lips andre murmured le vin est a votre gout excellent gary mcbride nodded and the headwaiter filled both glasses twothirds full eggs a la bourguignonne turned out to be poached in red burgundy and for a moment both were silent as they sampled gary mcbride said a pity to discuss business while eating my dear but i understand that you were contacted as planned by a member of the antiracist league lee nodded yes she said im afraid i muffed it not to worry my dear what went wrong i underestimated him he was a black welleducated what tipped him off i have no idea but he saw through me i suppose it was rather humorous he pretended to get somewhat tipsy and ah pretended to make a rather crude play for me his eyebrows went up t rape and revealed that i wasnt truly material for the antiracists he told me off very efficiently greatly amused i see then your cover is blown so far as the antiracist league is concerned im afraid so not to worry he said again ah the duck the canard a lorange arrived with the richebourg he had ordered and again went through the winetasting ceremony when the waiter had retired he said you were not alone the foundation has several ah agents making the same attempt to penetrate the antiracist league you were but one others it is to be assured will be more successful she said i wasnt told a great deal about the purpose of my mission actually in spite of my silly scene with horace hampton i am not particularly prejudiced so far as minorities are concerned i was rather surprised that the race research foundation was interested in infiltrating his organization i thought its research would be along other lines it is but one ramification of a much broader project you see lee the antiracist league is a racist organization itself i dont understand in much the same way that the zionists were she frowned slightly at him im not antisemitic either nor am i nor is the foundation were far above such ridiculous postures but there are most pertinent matters involved the antiracist league was not of particular import to us so long as it was active in the original fifty states alone the minorities they represent numbered but some sixteen percent of the population no great danger to our status quo however they are now ah beginning to spread into latin america and other areas of the new united states of the americas she scowled down at her plate i dont believe i follow you these new citizens have the vote lee there are enough blacks in haiti jamaica and even the guianas to assure that their senators and representatives will be represented in congress by blacks if steps are not taken its equally true for mexico central america and the parts of south america which are chiefly indian so the purpose of the race research foundation is ultimately to maintain the status quo to see that our people yours and mine do not vanish from the positions of power they now assume ah but here is the cheese i have ordered a selection of roquefort brie and chevre the cheese was accompanied by a bottle of rose danjou following which the waiter brought crepes de chapitre lee who had been silent and thoughtful through these culinary wonders said at one point but since my cover has been blown as you put it i am no longer of value to the foundation he smiled at her condescendingly well discuss it later in my office my dear when they finished the meal andre returned bowing unctuously again he said to gary mcbride ca vous a plu le repas monsieur mcbride ii etait superb andre the other told him grandly andre looked at lee et madam lee said mes felicitations au chef pour ses crepes us etaient commes des diners de george garin au chateau du clos de veuheot iiy avaient des autres nobles efforts merci madam andre bowed deeply and was gone gary mcbride gaped at her parisian french he said accusingly my father was in the diplomatic corps in paris i attended the lycee janson de sailly i also have spanish portugese and italian and can get along in german my russian is atrocious all russian is atrocious he smirked then saw irritation in her face or did i make a mistake she said evenly several never order such a wine as richebourg with such a dish as canard a lorange nor any other wine for that matter the acid of the orange sauce destroys the enjoyment of any great wine the sole exception is bouzy from the champagne district if you must order richebourg it is worthy of a much greater dish such as venison grand veneur or lievre a la royale i see he said coldly and what else none of the cheeses were from burgundy a brillat savarin or ripe epoisse would have been preferable and rose danjou a suspect wine at best is anathema to both burgundy food and any cheese and most certainly should never do for the crepes which were excellent as i told the maitre d by the way his french has a horrible brooklyn accent i see he said shall we go he stood tossing his napkin to the table she looked up at him why my one assignment for the race research foundation came a cropper i should have looked further into the whole thing before undertaking it if i had possibly i would have refused the job i was too thrilled at the prospect of actually being employed when the computer selected me to work for you mr mcbride now even if you did have some position i could hold down im not sure i would choose to be associated with such a pompous superior he grinned suddenly which completely altered his face he said good weve got some things to discuss she shrugged in resignation dropped her own napkin to the table and stood i cant imagine what she murmured at the desk he brought forth his card and placed it in the payment slot saying please add a twenty percent tip thank you sir the screen said as he was returning his credit card to an inner pocket he turned his eyes to lee and smiled again hows my french her face was expressionless only fair she said you seldom acquire a proper french accent outside france or switzerland i suspect that most of your instructors were americans the french are fanatical about accent i surrender he said taking her arm the manhattan office of the race research foundation was within easy walking distance and since it was located in the vicinity of new columbia university it made for a pleasant stroll they maintained silence during the walk and lee garrett was surprised at the fact that he was still amused this was a different gary mcbride gone was the affected front what in the world was this all about the fluffing of the job wasnt particularly important but what she had told horace hampton had been partly correct she was tired of the frivolous life and would have liked something worthwhile to do the manhattan offices of the race research foundation were modest in the outer office were three desks two women and a young man at them equipped with the standard vocotypers phone screens and library boosters for consultation with the national data banks all greeted gary mcbride by his first name which surprised lee she had expected a stuffy atmosphere at best he didnt bother to introduce her his private office turned out to be a room of warmth and informality he seated her in a comfortable chair before rounding the desk and taking his own place she still didnt know why she had come now that she had fluffed the hampton contact she couldnt see how she could possibly infiltrate the antiracist league gary mcbride smiling again picked up a sheaf of papers from the desk and said this is your dossier complete it reports that you attended the lycee janson de sailly one of the oldest private secondary schools in paris you were there for several years invariably top in your class she glared indignantly at him what the devil are you doing with that the dossier complete of any citizen can be consulted only by proper authorities for adequate cause you need the highest priority in the national data banks to he held up a hand and grinned his boyish grin at her exactly he watched suspicions chase across her face and then nodded we enjoy such a priority she was staring at him in sudden realization you knew all the time there in the restaurant that i spoke french guilty as charged but then why did you pretend to make such a fool of yourself before that that brooklyn frenchman he grinned once more lee the organization of which we are but one subsidiary makes every effort to recruit the best personnel practically every employment position filled in the united states goes through the national data banks computers the computers select the most suitable person available for each job he paused then winked but we get to the data banks before the government computers even begin their selections we skim the cream of the crop he could see her confusion he tapped the sheaf of papers before him lee the dossier complete is possibly the most comprehensive tally of a citizens life ever assembled it begins before your birth references going beyond your grandparents and from your birth every aspect of your life is checked health upbringing education sports accomplishments criminal record employment record travels and on and on among other things checked is your ability quotient your dossier builds profiles of your verbal and numerical abilities spatial ability memory speed of reflexes dexterity mechanical aptitude emotional maturity veracity sensory limits natural charm persistence neurosis powers of observation health and a few others she smiled depressing idea were all confronted with these confounded tests every few years that is if we have any interest in work or running for office maybe i shouldve refused to take them but whats all this got to do with he held up a hand there are a few things my dear that cant be tested luck for instance luck there is no such thing im afraid there is just as there is accidentproneness which also defies computer analysis even though you were given unbelievably high marks suppose that when i entered the nuits st george i found you wearing two left shoes or you were hunched up in posture or you were dressed in khaki shorts and a mans shirt like a prole suppose further that when subjected to a pompous superior i believe that was your term you were willing to accept him as your boss she laughed that was all put on you were testing me he grinned back and nodded if you hadnt the other qualifications we were looking for you might still have been employed somehow but we also wished to check your poise grooming physical attractiveness and sensibilities you passed with flying colors she looked at him levelly so if i passed your exam that goes beyond the ability quotient tests just what is this position you have in mind ive already bombed out as an infiltrator of the antiracist league the other leaned back in his swivel chair and was silent for a few seconds what do you know about the world club why i suppose what everybody else knows its the think tank to end all think tanks a multinational philanthropic organization which digs into socioeconomic problems confronting the world lagrange five and asteroid belt islands too for that matter he nodded but said its a great deal more than that it also keeps track of the population explosion resources pollution religion the tendencies toward the police state terrorism and racism for your ears only the race research foundation is a subsidiary of the world club that would be a shocker even to the most diligent news media expose experts she was wideeyed now but what has this got to do with me youve been selected to work directly under the central committee which likes a low profile for the media it doesnt exist she was too flabbergasted to speak he took up a stylo and readied it over a paper pad before we go further into that suppose we get the details of this interview you had with the black from the antiracist league his name horace hampton known as hamp gary mcbride flicked on a desk screen and said into it liz check out a horace hampton aka hamp of the antiracist league a black lee said i dont know his id number gary smiled at her he was a damned sight more likeable than he had been in the restaurant he said hes black a member of the antiracist league hell be one of their better men if he was your contact well have some record of him they did shortly his dossier began flashing on the screen from time to time he read out some extract to her seems to have some independent source of income since seldom uses all of his gas no criminal record though he is suspected of being one of the top troubleshooters of the antiracist league suspected in the slapstick fake assassination of governor teeter though thus far there is no evidence lee was taken aback by that he said that they were against violence gary chuckled as he looked mockingly at her thats what he said from what youve reported he knew that you were a plant what else could he say but he seemed sincere oh hes sincere all right he sincerely believes that extreme racists such as teeter should be dealt with gary mcbride still scanning the blacks dossier as he spoke to her grunted his surprise he glanced up at lee this is strange he said thats possibly the thinnest dossier ive ever seen especially when it comes to the criminal record she wrinkled her forehead how do you mean he has none whatsoever not even a traffic violation and as a result he has no fingerprint record he thought about it i think ill just forward the name of horace hampton to rome perhaps theyll wish to look further into this rome thats where the world club is based and thats where youre going my dear his smile was disarming that is if i can talk you into it chapter eight frank pinell a voice from a far distance was saying cooee wot in the flashing hell happened frank came alive to find groggily that he was sitting on the sidewalk supported by an anxious nat fraser who was hunkered down on one knee frank got out mugged two of them i think barstids the australian growled damned buggering ragheads a blokes not safe to walk up the street come on cobber we best get you to a sawbones never know might have some broken ribs they give you the bloody boot he got a long sinewy arm around the fallen americans body and up under his armpits i i think so frank got out trying to help himself erect my cars over here just luck i came along dont usually use this street rue dangleterre but i was heading up to panikkars place on cape spartel frank half staggered was half manhandled by his rescuer to the small sports model hovercar which was parked door open at the curb as he was wedged into the bucket seat he got out i cant afford a doctor dont be a bloody fool cobber let me worry about that the aussie slammed the door shut and went around the front of the vehicle to the drivers side and got in not by opening the door but by winging a long leg over the side slipping down into place he said as they took off up the wandering street its bonzer i did a bunk from pauls right after you left cobber a bit of luck eh in english frank said the rash of the cool night air was bringing him around the australian laughed and pushed his bush hat down more firmly on his head well be there in no time flat cobber and then the furll fly did you see them no not well couple of moroccans i think native clothes frank hadnt the vaguest idea what the other was talking about what fur would fly the streets werent well lighted but they seemed to have left the medina completely and were now in the european part of town the road climbed up heres the marshand nat called over to him the more money a blokes got in this bloody town the higher up on the mountain he lives frank felt the back of his head gingerly he had no doubts hed have a beautiful knot there in the morning he felt his ribs nothing seemed broken but you never knew he understood you could go around with a broken rib for weeks and sometimes not know it he searched for a handkerchief and came up with one about the only thing that his assailants hadnt taken he coughed and spat into it there was no blood they emerged from the town proper the houses were more widely spaced and reminiscent of the spanish colonial architecture of southern california and the older towns of mexico most of the villas were surrounded by pine and gum trees and now the road ran along a cliff with incomparable views of the sea and the spanish coast beyond frank said whered you say we were going he was feeling better by the minute my bosss digs hell have a sawbones there shortly afterward nat said cape spartel farthest west a bloke can get in africa frank blinked at the group of buildings they were approaching by far the most extensive estate they had passed they were surrounded by a wall of dressed fieldstone possibly six feet high wroughtiron uprights were planted at the top and the spaces between were entwined with vicious barbed wire they came to a halt outside a small fortress of a gatehouse also of fieldstone frank noticed that they had passed over a trigger plate in the road a guard came out he was wearing a beret what looked like a paratroopers combat uniform and heavy leather boots he carried a small submachine gun which he handled with the ease of a professional a bright light came on from the guardhouse and zeroed in on their faces there was a series of audible clicks and frank got the feeling that a tv lens was on them okay it was their needle they could thread it as they liked nat fraser said what o hercule the guard nodded at him but said nothing the light went out and in a moment the clicking sounds came again the automated steel gate swung open and the little vehicle slithered through the winding road that lay beyond must have been a full quarter of a kilometer in length they pulled up before an ornate entry and a young man dressed like the gate guard but bearing no visible weapon issued forth he approached smiled at the australian and said willkommen herr fraser he looked at frank questioningly nat said a new yank recruit i vouch for him karl is the colonel in he is expecting you herr fraser evidently the australian had called ahead on his transceiver on the way up frank hadnt noticed but he had been in no shape to be noticing things nat got out of the little hovercar the same way he had entered it over the side pushed his bush hat back on his head and went around to help frank out karl assisted seeming to find nothing strange about the appearance of the soiled and battered newcomer they got frank up the four stone steps and to the door nat took over completely there karl said colonel panikkar is in the study herr fraser too right the aussie said and helped frank down the short hall that stretched ahead there was an identity screen on the heavy carved wooden door almost immediately it clicked and opened beyond was the most impressive study frank pinell had ever seen by the looks of it it was a combination of library study and office bookshelves lined the walls floor to ceiling filled with leatherbound books of the old style tasteful paintings of both east and west were represented on the walls none of them modern but there were also steel files and on both of the two desks were the usual office equipment including a vocotyper on the smaller one the furniture was heavy and functional but in excellent taste only the battleship gray of the carpeting detracted from the otherwise impressive decor it gave a military effect behind the larger of the desks looking up at their entry was a man of possibly sixty square of face gray of hair and heavy mustache he was dark complexioned he wore traditional indian clothing including a black frocklength coat and jodhpurs he had a dignified military posture nat said this is the young yank i called you about colonel strike me blind but hes got the luck of the irish been in this buggering town no more than hours but a couple of the flashing ragheads set on him and leave him on the street with a broken block then he became more formal colonel ram panikkar frank pinell the colonel came around his desk to shake hands western style his face was indignant as he took in franks dirtfouled clothing and bruises he said to nat make your man comfortable nat ill be with you in just a moment the australian got his stillshaky companion into a chair the colonel said into a tv screen doctor could you bring your bag and join us at once in my study he then flicked a switch and commanded get me foud immediately he looked up at nat where did this take place on the rue dangleterre just up from the bloody grand socco the indian looked at frank just what did the hooligans get away with frank took a deep breath and said most important about two hundred pseudodollars worth of swiss gold francs and dirhams also my moroccan police papers which i got at the airport my pocket transceiver and the usual odds and ends a face had appeared on the phone screen a dark evil face crowned by an orange turban its owner would have had no difficulty whatsoever landing a part as a stereotype fanatic assassin on stateside tridi the colonel said his voice dangerously crisp assalaam alaykum foud the other answered his own voice careful alaykum assalaam ram panikkar the indian spoke rapidly in what frank assumed was arabic perhaps the colonel was pakistani rather than indian in short order ram panikkar turned back to frank and his australian rescuer your possessions will be at your hotel in the morning mr pinell and then to nat it was mustapha and jabir the dogs become bolder each month that passes he added with satisfaction i let foud know that your friend was under the protection of the graf a rolypoly little man entered from a side door the traditional black bag of the physician in his right hand he was a fussbudget pink of rounded face and wearing oldfashioned pincenez glasses on a bulbous little nose the colonel made introductions dr fuchs mr pinell mr pinell has been the victim of street desperadoes we thought it best that he be checked do you wish to take him to the clinic the doctor bobbed his head and said in accented english vevillzee the examination was comparatively brief the doctor hummed importantly as he worked he wound up very pleased with both himself and his patient ah was well he gave frank four pills with instructions for taking them assured all that frank was in good repair then shook hands all around said goodnight and left while this had been going on the colonel had gone to a bar along one wall and when the doctor had gone returned with three tall glasses containing the most excellent scotch frank had ever tasted as he handed the glasses around the colonel said i prescribe this as even more effective under the circumstances than the good doctors pills cheers gentlemen fuck ireland nat murmured but in spite of his light words the indian was frowning he took a small sip of his neat whiskey and said to frank two hundred pseudodollars i understood from what our good nat said that you had but landed this afternoon surely you have not already gone through eight hundred pseudodollars doesnt your ah former government issue each deportee a full thousand frank said bitterly my iabi escorts decided that such a sum would be wasted on me they handed over two hundred it seems that on their way back to the states they intended to lay over in madrid and blow the rest of it at uh i think a bar named chicotes where the whores congregate nat blurted indignantly and wotd you do mate frank looked over at him in disgust what could i do they were armed and i was completely out of my element and in a strange country i see the colonel said ominously and what other adventures did you have today frank told him about the cab driver and his stolen luggage the colonels dark complexion became even blacker with fury he said ominously again and what else frank shrugged it off the customs officer took a rather valuable camera that had been left me by my father im not sure that even i can do anything about that the colonel muttered he turned back to his elaborate tv phone dialed and said after a moment rafa ram panikkar in tangier tonight there should be two iabi agents in chicotes theyve shaken down one of the boys for eight hundred pseudodollars he looked up from the screen and over at frank what were their names frank said macdonald and roskin i dont know their first names look here but the colonel was back at his screen where he repeated the names he said i want the eight hundred back here by morning i also want them taught a small lesson not to be overdone you understand but i want them left in no condition to travel tomorrow you understand he listened for a moment then said yes two iabi men probably armed but this has been going too far i do not wish tangier to get the reputation of being wide open for extortion if you wish to check this out with peter windsor at the wolfschloss go right ahead i am sure he will agree with me he flicked off the screen thought a moment then dialed again a face must have appeared since he said samir i am speaking in my capacity as tangier representative of the graf one of your drivers this afternoon stole two suitcases from a passenger from the airport i make this perfectly clear samir i want those two bags here with all contents before the night is out no i do not know the name of the driver that is all samir he flicked off the screen again and turned back to frank and nat grim satisfaction on his face frank stammered i i dont know how to thank you colonel panikkar the indian waved a hand in dismissal you simply presented us with an opportunity frank tangier is possibly the most extensive center of the grafs operations we have no intention of putting up with smalltime local hoodlums bothering our people disrupting our activities frank said unhappily but thats the point colonel im not one of your people i told nat i didnt think that i could come in with you the other looked from frank to nat and then back again ah i didnt know that however it is your own choice of course we have no intention of coercing you nat would you see to refills for our glasses too right nat said heading for the bar the colonel said wryly and nat dear boy where in the world do you get those hats the aussie grinned back at him over his shoulder and touched the bush hat which it seemed he never removed even indoors me titfer he said had it shipped from sydney a blokes got to keep up appearances thats wot i say he returned to the others with an imperial quart of whiskey and poured for all the colonel snorted but turned back to frank i am rather surprised it would seem under the circumstances that you would welcome employment frank said unhappily its not that i dont appreciate your kindness colonel but i heard nat out and i dont believe id make a good mercenary the colonel shrugged and sipped lightly at his new drink he said the grafs activities are not limited to mercenary matters frank let me give you some background in the very old days such as when xenophon led his greek mercenaries to fight for cyrus of persia such matters were handled on a large and efficient scale but of recent centuries wars have largely been conducted by national governments with citizen armies along with such related matters as weapons procurement and so forth mercenary activities have been hit and miss professional soldiers of fortune would apply singly or in small groups for employment seldom were more than a few hundred involved often those that were found themselves ah holding the bag when the war was over and their side had lost they could only whistle for their hardearned pay we are changing that for one thing modern weapons are not easily mastered by uneducated peasants a congo bushman does not fly a rocket fighter plane frank nodded at that so today in the occasional wars that develop it is necessary for large numbers of professionals to be at hand in the underdeveloped countries would it surprise you to know that the graf can handle a complete action without going outside his own organization he can field a full disciplined division within a month and arm them completely including air cover from espionage preceding the actual conflict to getting money out for the officials of collapsing governments washing it depositing it in nassau or swiss banks and then spiriting absconding officials to safety to enjoy their ah loot or another service might be the removal of other politicians all of this is on contract so arranged that the grafs organization is always guaranteed its pay bonuses and insurance in case of death or disability the graf takes care of his own he grimaced in amusement and looked about the luxurious study as you see i do not live in poverty frank was frowning its hard to believe that this graf can field a completely armed division he has ten or twenty thousand men on his payroll nat chuckled and poured still more of the priceless scotch the indian smiled and shook his head no of course not he supports a permanent staff spotted about the world such as my operation here in tangier senior executives such as myself office workers and so on he also has on retainer between actual contracts a cadre of officers who can spring to duty within hours all experienced veterans he then has on call thousands of available infantrymen pilots tank men logistics specialists and so on ready to enlist at any time for any duration they are not on the permanent crew they usually exist on gas or its equivalent in the advanced countries between employments frank said youve suggested that you took on other contracts besides wars and revolutions panikkar nodded yes many last month we conducted a commando action which involved only twenty men one of our best officers a major shannon and nineteen veteran noncomsit seems that there was a halfmad dictator on one of the smaller caribbean islands his people overwhelmingly wished to join the united states but he understandably refused he and his family were vampires upon that islands population however funds were raised and the commando detachment was sent to take him out then you actually do individual assassinations the aussie chuckled again but stuck to his drink rather than joining into the conversation the colonel shrugged on occasion we see little difference morally speaking between entering into a fullfledged war or killing an individual but see here you are an educated young man you must have read of genghis khan one of the great military men of all time he rose from being a simple chieftain of a small nomadic tribe in central asia to conquer the largest empire the world had ever seen he destroyed whole civilizations he slaughtered millions of sedentary peoples so their lands could be devoted to his flocks only one thing stopped his hordes from engulfing europe he died now tell me my good frank what would the world have been saved had our genghis khan been assassinated when he was a young man frank was nonplussed the indian went on it goes both ways suppose your abraham lincoln had been suitably guarded against assassination what would have been the difference if this good man had lived on to preside over the reconstruction of your south it took a hundred years for the south to fully recover from your civil war frank said hesitantly your graf provides bodyguards i take it naturally he has the most efficient bodyguards in the world i hope so assassination is well hell it isnt civilized but it can improve civilization panikkar finished his second large whiskey take mahem dhu who recently proclaimed himself the mahdi in central africa never heard of him the mahdi is a figure of moslem mythology panikkar explained something like a messiah he is to return as the world is about to end unite all believers and destroy those who are evil it is a most primitive aspect of islam the last major leader who proclaimed himself the mahdi was mohammed ahmed in the angloegyptian sudan in the th century he called for a holy war and in a few years his followers overwhelmed an area half the size of europe slaughtering hundreds of thousands they beat the british army and killed general gordon but this new one frank said mahem dhu hes trying the same thing in central and northern africa he refuses to join the united church while many islamic sects are joining if he continues millions of uneducated blacks and arabs will die if he should be ah removed their lives will be spared and with the help of united church missionaries their countries will be rapidly upgraded i see your point frank admitted he pulled at his drink unhappily still nat fraser scoffed mate he said you bloody well told me that the yanks deported you for homicide whats the buggering difference you knock off some cove on your own or you do it for the graf for mucking good pay and you dont have to take a contract if you dont like it strewth ive turned down more than one frank looked back at the colonel i dont see what use id be to you im no soldier ram panikkar shrugged it off its not important frank sleep on it we might find you a position appropriate to your abilities seeing that youre a most personable and a reasonably educated young man he looked at his wrist chronometer but you must be tired after all your troubles today and you must be hungry he looked at the australian nat i suggest that you see that frank gets a good meal and then put him up for the night in one of the dormitories id suggest the noncom quarters tomorrow morning he can return to his hotel too right colonel nat said coming to his feet frank stood too and began his thanks but the colonel waved them aside smiling and returned to the papers on his desk without further words next morning driven to his hotel by nat fraser frank found not only his suitcases and the personal things that had been stolen from him by the muggers but a pile of swiss francs and moroccan dirhams atop the rickety dresser they totalled a full equivalent of a thousand pseudodollars slightly more than he had been robbed of after all he had owed the cab driver five dirhams and had paid luigi ten dirhams for room rent and had bought a round of drinks at pauls bar even his camera was in one of the suitcases the colonel had clout a vague thought came to him how had panikkar known he was staying at the hotel rome he had told neither the indian nor nat fraser chapter nine roy cos the shuttle from nassau to greater miami was brief and uneventful both men were so deep in their thoughts that roy cos didnt even bother to stare out the heavy glass ports at the sea and islets below obviously he was having second thoughts about this whole project how had he ever allowed the damned newsman to talk him into it forry brown squinted over at him and tried to rise to the occasion he knew very well what was in roys mind he even had a twinge of guilt about it but the whole thing was now irreversible he said you know the trouble with you utopians roy sighed and said no you wont like utopia roy sighed again and said there is no such thing as utopia as soon as you get to your goal theres a better one beckoning no science is more in a condition of continual change than socioeconomics utopian our revolutionary forefathers in thought they were creating a utopia they didnt fine forry said but whatever you call it most of you wont like it why because you all have a different picture of it vegetarians will picture the future society as one in which no meat will be eaten prohibitionists expect the end of booze but a good italian radical would be aghast at the idea that wine and good food including meat would be taboo nudists expect nudism puritans expect purity in petticoats at that serious straightlaced wobblies expect the world of the future to be very serious and very efficient but the easygoing ones look forward to a frivolous bangup time for everybody and the differences on the sex question are going to be wild ill bet the march toward complete promiscuity will continue but ive noted that most of the wobblies ive met are on the conservative side roy sighed once again and shifted uncomfortably in his seat wobblies dont believe that establishing our social system will solve all problems we only contend that it will solve a good many of the most pressing problems forry grunted and rubbed along his wisp of a mustache with a thumbnail i wish i could smoke in this flying sardine can he said what the hell ever happened to socialism i dont believe ive even heard the word for years scientific socialism stopped being scientific about a century and a half ago roy told him it got to the point where everybody was called socialist from roosevelt to hitler sweden was socialist so was russia not to speak of england which still had a royal family left over from feudalism it stopped making sense the only group in the states that would have been called socialists are the libertarians what do they want as compared to you wobblies to reform peoples capitalism or meritocracy we want to end it and establish a new system they want more gas for everybody better education better everything theyre reformers not revolutionaries he looked out the small porthole hey were coming in then in a lower voice did you notice that the man who was following us is on our shuttle i noticed they walked down the shuttles ladder their small luggage in hand and headed for the customs hall customs was the merest of formalities the twelve packs of illegal cigarettes went through unseen passed by customs they headed for the exit and were immediately accosted by two young men one in prole garments the other in a fairly presentable sportsmans garb the prole was big and square and on the rugged side the other was trimmer both were in their early twenties and both wore grim expressions forry looked at them warily but roy said smiling and extending his hand hi ron hi les i knew youd make it as usual a smile worked wonders on the face of the wobbly organizer forry these are the wobblies i told you about ronald ellison lester bates meet forrest brown forry nodded as he shook glad to see you fellas were being followed i spotted him the husky youth ron said i thought this contract thing didnt start until tomorrow morning forry said it starts at midnight but meanwhile theyll be wanting to know where roy is going where hell be when the contract does go into effect did you get a car les the better dressed one nodded right they left the administrative building and started out into the large parking area wheres the car forry said not in the parking lot ron told him we thought there might be somebody waiting for you to land just follow me mystified roy and forry let the other two lead the way they walked to the far end of the shuttleports administration building then entered a narrow alley between it and a huge hangar the drab narrowness gave the passage a sinister quality the little exnewsman said in protest what the hell he looked at their two guides suspiciously and then at roy roy said its all right if they say its okay then it is lead on les they hadnt gone fifty feet down the deserted alley before two others entered it one of them was the unknown who had tailed them from the time they had left the cices of oliver brettjames in nassau the other was a stranger they were pretending to be in deep discussion as if unaware of the four ahead of them in the narrow alleyway les ron roy and forry continued on their course the newsman nervous about their followers and then two more huskies entered the alley behind those followers ron said with grim satisfaction here we go he and les turned and watched expectantly as though ready to return the need didnt materialize the action that took place was brutal and brief one of the new arrivals had a short truncheon in his right hand the other seemed to have something metallic over the knuckles of his right fist with no preliminaries whatever they attacked in fifteen seconds the two who had been following roy cos were down on the alley floor arms over their heads in a futile attempt to protect themselves the newcomers lashed into them with heavy shoes kicking at ribs stomachs and kidneys jesus ron said in admiration if billy doesnt look out hes going to kill those funkers couldnt happen to nicer guys les growled forry looked over at roy cos you are an organizer he said in awe roy said i have my moments leaving their unconscious victims behind the two additional guards came up grinning as though embarrassed the first one said if either of those bastards are out of the hospital in less than two weeks ill turn in my merit badge in mugging roy said forrest brown meet richard samuelson and billy tucker forry said even as he shoof you gentlemen take your work seriously dont you dick samuelson and billy tucker were in the same age group as ron and les both sixfooters both around two hundred pounds they greeted roy cos warmly after they shook hands with the little newsman holy smog forry muttered if all you wobblies are like this why didnt you put over your damned revolution years ago lets get out of here before somebody else shows up the six of them hurried on up the alley glad i made it in time billy said i had to come all the way from denver had a meet there forry looked at him what kind of a meet wrestling the alley debouched on a small parking area for all but a few private cars were a luxury they came up to the limousine ron indicated and forry began to get into the drivers seat saying im the only one who knows where were going to ground but roy shook his head les is a racing driver he said simply the exnewsman looked at les bates thoughtfully and then nodded fine he said getting into the back seat instead get out on the highway and turn right les he said to billy i saw you give those two characters in the alley a quick frisk after they passed out did you get anything a shooter billy said satisfaction in his voice well as soon as we get out into the countryside you ought to ditch it we cant afford to be found by the police with an unlicensed gun if they coop roy up in some banger the grafs men will figure out how to get to him within hours if any of the rest of your boys are heeled think about that they looked at him respectfully even as les obviously expert at the wheel took them out onto the highway dick samuelson said yes sir meek as a mouse and brought out a compact black automatic holding it in a gloved hand to be tossed out a window billy dipped his hand into the side pocket of his prole denim jacket reluctantly and came out with a gyrojet pistol its a beauty he said with regret whoever those cloddies were they didnt skimp on equipment theyre probably employees of the graf forry said sourly dick samuelson hissed between his teeth then roy wasnt just whistlin dixie when he said that most likely wed be in thick soup eh ive heard about the graf ron said theres a car behind i think its a tail les grinned gently and snicked his gear selector i picked out this pile of iron myself he said belt up boys billy said to forry you still think we ought to toss these shooters out absolutely the newsman said the first time we turn a comer so they cant see you do it for all we know theyre police we dont want to take on a carload of fuzzies okay billy said get our asses out of here les grafs men or fuzzies theyre sure to be heeled shaking their pursuers was childs play for lester bates he was not only a racing driver but a very smooth one powering through the apex of every turn using every inch of the road it was only after there could be no doubt that they had lost their pursuers that les turned to forry where do you want to go forry gave directions and then after a time said that tavern there pull in behind it roy looked at him you dont mean were hiding out in a roadside bar the little man grunted amusement hardly thats just where we drop this car you know whats happened by this time whoever was following us has noted our license number and relayed it to either the police or some of their own organization so we switch i have a car stashed here the owners an old drinking buddy who can keep his mouth shut dick samuelson looked over at him as they pulled into the parking area even if the grafs hit men are working him over no not then forry admitted drawing deeply on his cigarette but ted doesnt know enough to tell them anything his instructions are to give them the truth we left a hovercar here and later picked it up leaving this one in its place they pulled up beside the vehicle he indicated les looked at it questioningly he said it has no license plates thatll make it conspicuous forry nodded on purpose ted couldnt tell anybody what the numbers were even if he wanted to well put the plates on shortly down the road a bit continually checking to see whether they had picked up new pursuers they finally made it to their destination it was an old house on the beach to the south of miami fairly well isolated undoubtedly it had once been the winter home of a wealthy northerner forry had les bates back the car into the garage so that it would be hidden from view but poised for escape the six of them went into the rambling onestory villa forry led the way to the living room roy looked about him howd you manage this forry said i rented it for a week using my international credit card ive got a few thousand saved up we wont use your million a day until after weve made our initial play we dont want them to zero in on us at this stage they all found seats in comfort chairs or on couches ron said on edge what happens now forry said in a minute one of you go up to the sundeck on the roof as a sentry but i want to talk to you first before the others get here what others roy said youll see forry told him he looked around at ron les dick and billy ran his tongue thoughtfully over his gray lower lip and said the question becomes how do roy and i know we can trust you i think his idea of getting wobbly members to act as his bodyguard rather than professionals was a good one in the past deathwish policyholders have hired professionals often they wound up getting hit by their own guards who were either bribed by the grafs men or were already on his payroll no offense intended but how can we know that one of you cant be gotten to if the bribes big enough silence when roy spoke his voice carried rocksolid confidence forry he said its a thing you wouldnt know about all of these boys are at least thirdgeneration wobblies they got their ethics at grandpas knee two of my greatgrandparents as well les said quietly roy continued ive know les ron billy and dick all of their lives their parents are personal friends when i was billys age i lived next door to his folks ive changed his diapers you see forry being a radical becomes a way of life practically all of your familys friends are wobblies you play with the children of other wobbly families your fun is mostly picnics or dances or other entertainments thrown to raise funds for the movement you attend meetings with your parents before youre old enough to understand what the hell that sweaty sincere guy with the microphone is talking about when youre old enough to notice girls the ones you can approach easiest are wobblies themselves probably one of the girls you grew up with if you have children theyre raised in the same tradition a sort of political ghetto the radical movement in the united states started in with the socialistic labor party the wobbly movement got going in mostly with socialists do you know how many generations ago that was think of it eight generations of us oh new recruits do come in not many i admit and sometimes wobblies drop out and stay out but largely our membership consists of people raised in the radical tradition forry he chuckled im beginning to suspect were starting to breed true young fellows like these four are born wobblies there goes your credibility forry growled just kidding of course but i selected these four because theyre thirdormoregeneration revolutionists and all personal friends of mine like their parents before them if i cant trust them i dont give a damn how soon they kill me okay okay forry brown looked around at the four one by one they all wore expressions of faint embarrassment with pride shining through roy said now ive got a question back in nassau you asked oliver brettjames how big the benefits to his company were when i die and how much the daily premiums he had to pay were why did you want to know forry brought a pack of his smuggled cigarettes from a pocket and took his time lighting up he said finally i wanted to know how much time we had before his company started hurting as of midnight tonight i start earning my way your publicity starts tomorrow ive already gotten in touch with my contacts in tridi news theyre all going to broadcast the story of the wobbly who took out a deathwish policy so that hed acquire the credit needed to spread his message oh yes tomorrow i start earning my ten thousand pseudodollars a day the longer i keep you alive the longer i keep my job it stops the moment you do les blurted ten thousand a day forry spread his hands why not theres a personal risk suppose i get into the line of fire when somebody takes a shot at roy or suppose somebody heaves a bomb that gets all of us besides what is ten thousand to roy he has a million on tap every day he can afford to keep his hired help happy by the way you four bodyguards will each get ten thousand daily dick samuelson growled youre one thing but we didnt get into this for money we dont want any pay roy cos shook his head at that he said no forrys right dick theres nothing in that contract that says i cant have a bodyguard and pay him as much as hes worth im not allowed to make donations to organizations political religious or whatever but you can squirrel your wages away when ive finally had it you boys can contribute as much to the movement as you like if i last long enough youll be rich i dont believe ive ever known a rich wobbly youll be in a position to make the biggest donations to the organization ever an identity screen bell rang from somewhere and all stiffened thats probably mary ann forry said getting up but we should have posted a sentry before this how about one of you fellows going up onto the roof make your own arrangements id suggest a twohour shift okay ill take the first shift billy said standing too with ron going along just for caution forry went to the front door of the villa and checked the screen he seemed to be satisfied the woman who came through looked every inch the office worker a little on the plain side though with a comfortably nice figure she was neatly efficient in appearance conservatively dressed and wore no makeup whatever she was in her late thirties and carried an attache case good evening forrest she said forry he told her were going to be seeing a good deal of each other under rather hectic circumstances in the days to come no need nor time for formality did you bring your things theyre out in the car i rented she said its automated so we can return it to the agency without any difficulty this is ron ellison he told her one of the team hell get your bags and you can pick out a room for yourself meanwhile come on back and meet the rest while ron went for her luggage forry and the newcomer went to the living room the men stood to be introduced and forry did the honors roy said isnt there a drink around here forry had stocked a fairly good bar while les was making the drinks forry told the wobbly organizer ive known mary ann elwyn for years shes a damn good secretary her pay will be the same as everybody elses ten thousand a day he smiled a small smile as she gasped enough to keep her honest well hope if we last the week out shell have enough to retire seventy thousand pseudodollars on top of her gas could equal a nice standard of living if you last for more than a week each day adds another ten thousand to her nest egg roy cos was frowning he said in complaint forry what the hell do i need with a secretary he sent his eyes over to the young woman not that i have anything against you are you kidding forry said to him when this thing starts you wont even be able to handle your mail if you last the first week out shell be needing stenographers to help her im highly experienced mr cos mary ann said briskly forry has explained the situation to me and my duties im not too keen on the physical danger but well ten thousand pseudodollars a dayshe hesitated for a moment then buys me a lot of courage roy made a gesture of acceptance its all right with me forrys the organizer of this scheme i suppose he knows what hes doing billy tucker came hurrying into the room his eyes swept quickly over the new secretary but then went on to roy cos he said roy theres a car coming down the road at least two men in it probably ferd and jet forry said putting down his glass and grinding out his cigarette we dont really have to start worrying until after midnight billy then this guard duty becomes serious he stood and headed for the door the younger man said after him yeah and i wish to hell you hadnt made us throw away those guns well see about that soonest the exnewsman said over his shoulder as soon as the publicity starts well put in a demand for gun permits through our law firm weve got a law firm on retainer too roy if they refuse to issue gun permits for the bodyguard of the deathwish wobbly a howl will go up thatll mean just that much more publicity he left the room to go for the front door billy went over to the bar poured himself a ginger ale and carried it with him to his post roy cos said to his brand new secretary do you know anything at all about the wobblies ms elwyn mary ann she said i knew practically nothing until forry brought up the matter of a temporary job she flushed then quickly added or maybe not so temporary with you i looked your organization up in the national data banks but im afraid that its not my cup of tea ive never been interested in political economy forry reentered followed by two newcomers both carried portable typewriters one a latemodel vocotyper and by the looks of the case the other an old electric roy and his three bodyguards stood for introductions and again forry did the honors roy looked at the two blankly not having the vaguest idea why either of them were present but forry took over first sending les for drinks for the newcomers and then for refills for the rest of them when all were seated again he said jet peters is your publicity man roy he used to work for one of the big cosmocorps a multinational corporation specializing in uranium but he was spelled down the same as i was by the computers a younger guy got his position roy could see that possibility the other was somewhere in his early fifties and looked both tired and cynical he was sloppily dressed a bit bleary of eye a tremor in his hands a drinker the wobbly decided roy said publicity i thought you were handling publicity forry i am the exnewsman said getting out his cigarettes again but i wont be able to handle it all jets an old pro hell come up with dozens of ideas that wouldnt occur to me hes got a lot of contacts too hell earn his ten thousand all eyes went to the second of the two newcomers who had been introduced as ferd feldmeyer he was not just overweight but almost obscenely fat like many fat men he bought his clothes too small so that he bulged in them he was pale of face thin of dirtblond hair and his small mouth seemed to pout ferd feldmeyer was less than handsome forry said ferd is your speechwriter speechwriter holy smog forry i dont need a speechwriter i do my own speeches usually off the cuff why this guy isnt even a wobbly so far as i know how could he write my speeches even if i wanted him to ferd feldmeyer might not have been much for looks but his voice was deep and had a ring of sincerity he said since forry approached me on this ive been reading up on your movement day and night including your own publications not just the material in the national data banks ill tell you something about political organizations and religions or philosophies for that matter you should be able to sum yours up in two hundred words if you cant somethings wrong with your movement right now i could sit down and tear off a speech for you that would give the wobbly position maybe better than youve ever presented it on top of that id drop in a little humor some good quotations and wind it up with a blockbuster of a gimmick ending thatd have them anxious to tune in to your next broadcast forry said reasonably youre not going to be able to give your standard talks off the cuff on tridi roy theyve got to be written out and youre going to have too many to write yourself youre not only going to speak often on tridi tv and even radio but were going to line you up for personal appearances lectures and so forth ferd and jet are also going to double for you as your ghosts roy stared at him my what thats one thing that nobody else can do for me die the former newsman said sorry roy poor choice of words i meant ghost writers if this publicity hits the way i think it will therell be calls for articles from all sorts of periodicals from all over the world maybe well even do a book he squinted his eyes and said thoughtfully that reminds me of something do you speak spanish no the little man turned his eyes to mary ann elwyn who had been sitting quietly primly her hands in her lap she had refused the drink les offered forry said make a note mary ann we need computer translators to put roys speeches into spanish french and italian the secretary quickly opened her attache case brought forth a stylo and notepad and scribbled away jet said how about russian and mandarin forry thought about that but then shook his head not yet for the time being the wobbly movement is aimed at the west maybe later if i understand the program correctly it might spread to the soviet complex and china okay roy i suppose so the wobbly said this whole thing seemed to be getting more and more out of his hands the ineffectivelooking little forrest brown was taking over with a vengeance thus far roy cos had precious little to do except to stay alive as long as possible forry spoke through the smoke that dribbled from his mouth wed better get down to definite plans like i said we start the publicity tomorrow we also wrap up the arrangements for the first tridi talk nationwide beamed worldwide from satellites when roys made that first speech the publicity will really hit hell be big news everybody in the country will be on the edge of their chairs waiting for the deathwish wobbly he broke off and looked at jet peters i think we ought to use that bit of business in our publicity the deathwish wobbly the revolutionist so sincere that hes willing to die for the chance of spreading it he looked back to roy and the others theyll be sitting on the edges of their chairs waiting to see how long itll take for the grafs men to get to you he ground out his current cigarette and took up the drink sitting on the cocktail table before him until the first tridi broadcast we wont show well not leave this house nobody here will use their credit cards on the off chance that the enemy might have connected one of us with roy ill pay all expenses as i did for renting this place with my card its an unnumbered account and they wont be able to trace me with it the moment we make that broadcast roy will begin to use the million pseudodollars a day available to him on his swiss international credit card and from then on were on the defensive but the more this pyramids the more publicity roy gets the better his chances are of avoiding the grafs hit men therell be mobs wherever he goes making it difficult for assassins to get through to him i hope a good many of those people are going to be on roys side hes the underdog and fighting against terrible odds theyll be out to get any assassins who turn up and these men of the grafs are pros not fanatics theyre not interested in making martyrs out of themselves thatll be one of the biggest advantages wc vc les bates looked at his wrist chronometer he announced four hours to go until midnight chapter ten lee garrett of all the major cities of the world only rome the city of the seven hills had not banned surface vehicles it wouldnt at least not in the older areas of town originally settled by romulus and his tribesmen glorified by augustus later made the center of the worlds most powerful religion it couldnt because old rome was a museum of three thousand years standing it would have been impossible to dig metros and underground highways the archeological world would have been up in arms excavations would have destroyed a multitude of buried ancient temples tombs arenas and fortifications going back as far as the etruscans these all lay ten to fifty feet below the surface someday to be dug out with loving care even the pressures of modern transport could not threaten to destroy the remnants of a tiny synagogue where once perhaps paul had given sermons a governmental building where caesar had issued his edicts an aqueduct which once supplied the water for the baths of diocletian however private vehicles were discouraged to the point where only the most powerful through wealth or governmental position were allowed their personal conveyances otherwise traffic was limited to emergency vehicles and to public cabs and buses it still amounted to considerably more traffic than was to be seen elsewhere thus it was that lee garrett found herself riding from the shuttleport to the citys center in a small taxi it had been some years since she had been in this wondrous city and she recognized a score of landmarks with a thrill destinatio signorina the admiring cabby had asked her his eyes indicating appreciation of her fine blond hair piled high on her head of her very unitalian blue eyes not to speak of her svelte figure the roman way of the male toward any girl with the least pretensions of pulchritude returned to her and she smiled remembering number via della pilotta she told him in impeccable italian he looked over his shoulder again but signorina the palazzo colonna is no longer open to the public not even on saturday mornings so i understand she told him they were passing through the piazza di spagna for centuries the center of the bohemian artist element with its medieval fontana dil barcaccia by bernini still watered by a roman aqueduct and with its famed scala di spagna known as the spanish steps by many tourists lee garrett smiled a church here a palace there a monument to some longdead emperor farther on they sped through the piazza di trevi with its baroque fountain where visitors threw coins to guarantee that one day they would return and shortly they pulled up before the huge complex that was the palazzo colonna once the most sumptuous of the patrician houses of rome lee brought her international credit card from her handbag and put it in the payment slot of the cab there were two uniformed young men at the entry looking in their red medieval garb something like the swiss guards at the vatican and bearing of all things halberds shafted weapons of the th century with axlike cutting blades beaks and terrible spikes lee amused remembered reading somewhere that the unlikely looking devices had been designed as can openers against armored horsemen she wondered if there was presently a horse in all rome not to speak of a man in armor one of them approached bowed and politely opened the cab door for her lee got out flashed him a smile and said i have an appointment with signorina duffroberts meanwhile i am not sure where ill be staying tonight could you get my bags and hold them for me somewhere he bowed again signorina garrett why yes your things will be taken up to your suite signorina thank you lees eyebrows went up slightly but her poise was built in so she had a suite in the palazzo colonna without doubt there would be a small plaque on the door reading lucretia borgia slept here or some such inside the entrance were four more young men in outfits of pages complete to satin berets with tassels atop they had been lounging idly talking among themselves but now one advanced for a sweeping bow very much in character the palazzo is not open to the public signorina im lee garrett she told him i have an appointment of course signorina he blurted if you will come this way signorina duffroberts awaits you she followed him up the impressive stone stairway to the vestibule years ago her father had brought her here to see the famed home of what had once been the most powerful family in rome popes had been born here and cardinals without number and kings queens dukes duchesses in the vestibule were paintings of several schools including van dyke murillo and lotto the way led them through the hall of the colonna bellica past the steps leading down to the great hall and then up another stairway almost as magnificent as that at the entrance to the palace the priceless treasures of the palace might have been expressed in tonnage then followed a series of coldly superb chambers each a museum of murals marbles and tapestries why would anyone choose to live in such a place but then they arrived at the spacious salon of sheila duffroberts there was no identity screen set into the magnificent carved door that would have been a desecration her guide knocked softly and then without waiting for a response opened the door and closed it behind her on her visit as a youngster lee hadnt been in this part of the rambling building in those days it had still been occupied by descendants of the colonna family and visitors had been excluded from the private quarters this room had obviously once been one of the minor salons now converted into a baroque office the furniture was of the fifteenth or sixteenth century with all the stiffly uncomfortable appearance of that era sheila duffroberts arose from her chair behind the desk she was a large woman physically but was built in handsome proportion she enjoyed the long limbs and proud carriage of an olympic champion her face was classical and she knew how to bring out her best features her hairdo cosmetics and jewelry were the products of experts basically hers was a severe face brightly intelligent rather than friendly and her smile was cool a cigarette dangled from the side of her mouth manstyle she was dressed in a slack suit which lee recognized as the latest style in common europe she approached lee briskly hand outstretched it proved to be a warm firm hand somehow projecting a caressing quality sheila duffroberts said throatily well my dear in spite of your photographs i didnt expect you to look quite so darling lee didnt quite know how to respond to that to cover the fact she looked at the desk and said marvelous it was done in sandalwood and was adorned with lapis lazuli amethysts and other semiprecious stones in the front it had twelve small amethyst columns and at the top gilt statuettes representing the muses and apollo seated under a laurel tree the other chuckled and said isnt it beautiful in a repulsive sort of way i couldnt resist had it moved in from the room of the desks one of the others there is possibly even worse its done in ebony with twentyeight ivory bas reliefs and the central relief is a copy of michelangelos last judgment a real monstrosity well get it for your office if youd like but do sit down darling youre lee garrett of course im sheila duffroberts feeling a little overwhelmed lee took the sixteenth century chair the other indicated she said yes ms duffroberts i was given instructions by gary mcbride to yes of course sheila duffroberts strode briskly around her ornate desk resumed her chair and touched a sheaf of papers before her ive been going over your qualifications very impressive my dear lee said what qualifications i havent the slightest idea what my duties are mr mcbride only told me i was to work for the central committee of the world club the other smiled her sparse smile and dispatched her cigarette in an elaborate ceramic work never meant by the artist who had conceived it half a millennium ago as an ashtray she said you were selected by our computers as my secretary darling lee let out her breath trying to disguise exasperation but what is your position what do you do what are these qualifications im supposed to have relax dear im the secretary she took another cigarette from a medieval gold and ivory box and lit it with a modern gold desk lighter one of your qualifications is that you dont need the job or any other job for that matter youre filthy rich dear lee looked at her blankly the junoesque woman said so are all our other upperechelon personnel if they were not born with such resources we make them available in short none of us is motivated by desire for money we already have money we are motivated by the dream what dream lee said still far out of her depth the other let heavy smoke flow from her nostrils the dream is to create a stable world lee its been dreamed before throughout history for limited periods it has even been achieved here and there in egypt for centuries in mexico by the mayans in china at least to a certain degree before the coming of the europeans lee said what do you mean by stability for the first time darling the human race finds itself in a position to achieve a stable unchanging society on a worldwide basis no national disorders wars or extreme poverty it sounds like quite a dream lee said skeptically i knew the world club was a nonprofit thinkfactory seeking solutions to current problems but i had no idea its scope was so allembracing frankly im having second thoughts it sounds well impossible its true that i want it to be something rational not a forgive me pipe dream the secretary of the world club chuckled throatily again lee darling do you approve of gas in the united states of the americas i think so i cant think of any other manner of dealing with mass unemployment brought on by automation and do you approve of the united states taking in any north or south american country that wished statehood i think it was one of the most intelligent acts my country has ever performed both were subtly engineered by the world club but thats ridiculous ive never even heard a rumor of such a thing sheila smiled i said subtly did i not first steps darling you see our basic desire is to maintain the status quo in society based on what now prevails in america and common europe however we are not really a conservative organization certainly not a reactionary one the world club is quite revolutionary in the broadest sense of the word it aims at a stable desirable world for the overwhelming majority it cannot be all things to all people but it can aim at making a stable society for the average person to do this we must align ourselves against subversive elements nihilist terrorists the wobblies in the states eurocommunists in common europe even the antiracist league but we are not reactionary i see lee said somewhat less doubtfully what are some of the other ills that the world club thinks it can solve the handsome amazon shrugged bringing all religions together under the leadership of the united church perhaps a universal language based on esperanto we already have a committee working on this meanwhile english is the nearest to a universal language that we now have elimination of differences in religion and language will help guarantee a world society which will last indefinitely english a universal language lee said i thought there were a billion chinese who spoke mandarin sheila chuckled in her humorless manner touche she said but most all of them are in china the problem of assimilating china into our world society will have to be held in abeyance for the time by the way are you a womens rights advocate in most ways lee nodded however i dont claim that women are equal to men in all respects the other looked at her sharply why not certainly women are equal to men in all respects for one thing lee said wryly they dont have as long a penis we can carry this chip on our shoulder to ridiculous extremes its like the contention that blacks are the same as whites in all respects nonsense one has a darker complexion than the other so far as women are concerned well there has never been a female heavyweight champion of the world a secondrate male pro would flatten the best female fighter who ever lived they simply have more upperbody strength on the other hand ive always thought the first astronauts should have been women were generally smaller and take up less space use less food and oxygen and on an average were more deft with our hands we seem to have more endurance under stress i wonder how the average man would hold up under a difficult childbirth the tall sheila eyed her you have one quality that doesnt come out in the computer reports the strength to state strong opinions darling do you have any other questions yes lee said definitely im surprised that both you and mr mcbride have revealed so much to me even before ive consented to take the position youve told me that most workers for the world club dont even know it exists but youve bared everything to me the other lit still another cigarette not quite everything dear she said dryly you must realize that our computers selected you above all others the computers seldom make mistakes in these things we are assured that you are the best person for the position and the computers are of the opinion that you will take it obviously it was required that you know what you are stepping into lee took a deep breath and said in resignation what would my duties be this first week to give members the chance to become acquainted with you since in this position you will be privy to many of their innermost decisions the committee is now in session and will be for the rest of this month most of them are now in residence these regular sessions are held twice a year theyre informal and consist largely of their sitting around two by two or in larger groups and discussing developments of the program not all are present at this session grace cabothudson who is rather old and infirm remained at her residence in north america sheila duffroberts looked at her timepiece but now my dear you must be tired and will wish to see your suite and freshen up and i have duties of course her eyes shifted slightly by the way there is to be apanous tonight would you be interested lee shook her head she wasnt shocked not in this age but she was somewhat surprised she said no im not interested in group sex the amazons brows went up lesbian no pity sheila said however perhaps in time youll change your mind which reminds me we have a staff of half a dozen office girls she took her lower lip in her perfect teeth some of them are quite darling there was a knock at the door and a man with the look of a welltanned european somewhere in his midthirties sauntered through he wore his red hair in a young athletes crew cut and his dark blue eyes seemed out of place in his dark complexion there was an easygoing sardonic quality in his smile sheila he said you are looking particularly brunhildic today have you been butchering male chauvinists with your broadsword again the secretary of the central committee snorted at that and said where the hell have you been jerry ive been trying to get in touch with you for weeks reclusing he told her easily havent you heard i am currently labeled the worlds wealthiest recluse and also its most eligible bachelor want to get married oops no of course not sheila snorted again and said this is lee garrett shes to be my new secretary lee mr jeremiah auburn mr auburn is a member of the central committee its youngest by the way how he ever got into its membership is a mystery to me mind how you speak to your superiors ms duffroberts he said amiably and then as he shook hands with lee wizard we meet again lee wrinkled her forehead i ive heard about you mr auburn but where did we ever meet im sure that i would recall a glint of laughter came into his eyes its an old ploy of mine im terrible at remembering people and women become so distressed when i dont recall their faces particularly if i once spent a long weekend with them in the bahamas or hawaii or wherever that i say wizard we meet again just to be sure he headed for an elaborate florentine cabinet which turned out to be a disguised bar how good of you jerry sheila said sarcastically it must be distressing to be such a ladykiller a distress youd love to share he said over his shoulder and then hmmm perhaps you do i hope you worry about that a lot sheila said obviously well used to his banter he called anybody else up to a bit of guzzle i just checked its twelve so you wont be considered a morning lush sheila asked for scotch but lee shook her head still uneasy somehow this man seemed familiar possibly it was his voice but she knew that shed never seen him there wasnt a woman in the world who could meet jerry auburn and forget about it the leading light of the rocket set for a decade he had suddenly reversed his engines and disappeared from sight in the tradition of howard hughes from time to time he would pop up in the news but largely he was as he had said a recluse lee couldnt imagine him being a member of the world club much less of its central committee he brought sheilas drink back to her held up his own darkish brandy and water and said cheers sheila old chumpal a new secretary eh what happened to the ultraefficient pamela im sure youll leam all about it she said and sipped lee just came in today wizard jerry auburn said looking lee over again he made with a mock leer you certainly pick them sheila sheila didnt disguise her impatience at that attractiveness and poise are requirements of employees who must meet the public the news media and so forth mr auburn as you very well know he finished the drink in one fell swoop and looked at his chronometer this is as good an opportunity as any for me to become acquainted with our beauteous ms garrett are you available for lunch ah lee why she said i havent even seen my rooms yet but im not really tired and we didnt eat on the shuttle from paris wizard he said then with sheilas permission ill whisk you off ill see you later this afternoon dear sheila told her dont forget about the uh party this evening if you change your mind out in the hall as they walked toward the staircase jerry auburn grinned and said has sheila already invited you to one of her versions of the partoust she looked up at him from the side of her eyes yes i went to one once theyre rather in the farout line in the roman tradition of nero not my cup of tea i love ladies one at a time and i dont like boys at all and ill leave the building of horizontal pyramids to the pharaohs mustve been unhealthy theyre all dead i notice she laughed we seem to share similar ideas she told him before realizing that he might misinterpret that he chuckled and took her arm as they began to descend the stairs without saying anything further on the subject of sex the pages at the door came hurriedly to attention as jeremiah auburn approached as did the guards with their halberds there was a beautiful sportster at the curb one of the extreme models from bucharest lee was moderately surprised when he ushered her to it and saw her seated on the passenger side you have permission to drive your own car in rome she said ranking members of the world club have their prerogatives lee having our central headquarters here is a feather in the caps of the city fathers they turned over the palazzo colonna to us about ten years ago do you know rome any preferences on where to eat i havent been here for years ill leave it to you wizard lets say the hostaria dellorso i believe its supposed to be the oldest restaurant in town dante used to live in the building he turned the corner and sped down the via battisti in the direction of the looming monstrosity that was the monument to vittorio emanuele as they passed it lee shook her head imagine leveling several acres of the roman forum to erect that thing my sentiments exactly he said so youre to be sheilas new secretary did she give you her song and dance about the dream lee looked over at him in some surprise she made rather a moving appeal for the goals of the world club a stable society in which most of historys problems would be solved jerry laughed softly did she discuss her final solution to the womens rights problem why no she asked how i stood on the question but we didnt go very far into it he said i suspect her goal is the reestablishment of a matrilineal society get sheila a bit into her cups and she begins to point out that women predominate numerically in the world but for all practical purposes are ignored in its governing for instance weve never had a female president of the united states i suspect that sheila wouldnt object to taking the job he grinned again i can just see a whole cabinet of lesbians lee said confused but what does motivate the central committee if not what sheila calls the dream he shot a look over at her even as he maneuvered through the narrow streets did our good sheila tell you anything about the composition of the central comitttee no not yet aside from you she mentioned grace cabothudson and what do you know about grace not much really isnt she supposed to be the richest woman in the world uh huh and what do you know about me well aside from the news media nonsense not much oh yes ive heard that you were possibly the richest man in the world jerry laughed outright harrington chase would hate you for that you mean that antisemitic texan who supports those ultraright wing organizations good heavens what has he got to do with it harringtons a member of the central committee my dear so is mendel amschel for that matter which sometimes drives poor harrington up the wall the viennese banker hes another one thats sometimes called the richest man why should mr chase object to him if you count his whole family mendel may control more wealth than anyone else the irony is that while hes a jew i doubt if hes religious at all ah here we are the hostaria dellorso was located in a medieval palace elegant and very expensive jerry auburn asked the maitre d for a private dining room and they were immediately escorted to the second floor sorry jerry said to lee there are still some who remember my face especially women unfortunately im seldom mentioned without that most eligible bachelor label being hung around my neck as though anybody bothered to get married anymore but even in a place like this it can be a hazard especially when radicals sometimes send a nut case to nice joints on the off chance that they can take a shot at some bloated aristocrat like me no wonder youre a recluse she told him in a low voice as they were shown into a luxurious private room the maitre d turned them over to a captain and bowed himself out the captain gave them menus and stood back his face stolid are you a bloated aristocrat too jerry said as they scanned their cartes i suppose so she sighed but not as bloated as you are im sure im not bloated enough for a nihilist to take a crack at me as you put it he looked over at her appreciatively and said bloat is not the word zaftig guapa sleek those are the words oh hush she said laughing when the captain was gone lee looked at him accusingly she said very well then if you dont have the dream why are you a member of the central committee he thought about that a moment probably to protect my own interests and all of the other members to protect theirs thats what motivates almost everyone you know their own interests she looked at him in disbelief sheila said that it was the world club which pushed through the assimilating of the united states of the americas in my opinion that is the outstanding political development of this century how did that protect your interests mr auburn he smiled mockingly at her and said with deliberate pomposity ms garrett the greater part of my investments are in multinational corporations almost all corporations of any size are multinationals these days staffed by the most competent people the computers can locate but we still have our cubas to deal with americans owned practically everything in basic cuban industry until castro took it over no buyout nothing lady the investors took some lumps why dyou think the cia financed the bay of pigs invasion to let us get our cuba back we feared allende in chile might take the castro route so allende was murdered and a military junta took over demolishing what was left of democracy in chile however we could never be sure that our properties were safe now ms garrett with the establishment of the united states of the americas they are safe and so are all the raw materials of latin america in return for a comparatively small amount of gas to keep the peons pacified she was inwardly upset i still say it was a wonderful step of progress wizard he said i didnt say that the central committee worked against the interests of the majority of people it was to the personal interest of washington jefferson john hancock and franklin to win independence from england they were all rich men but it was also a good thing for the poorer colonists as well she looked confused doubtful he grinned wryly and said believe me lee in taking all of latin america into the united states the multinationals didnt exactly lose money oh in some of the poorer countries and islands we drew blanks temporarily but how do we know what riches might lie under the jungles of say paraguay just imagine taking over such nations as brazil potentially almost as rich as the original united states not to speak of mexico venezuela and bolivia with all their unexploited raw materials we get contracts for highrise apartments for all the new recipients of gas and somebody has to get richer building roads public transportation communications systems power distribution systems believe me lee the multinationals did not lose money when the states invited latin america to join our union she said still arguing but the expense of putting all of those millions on gas your taxes have skyrocketed it surely must have counterbalanced he was smiling still no youd be amazed how cheaply a prole can be maintained from the cradle to the grave planned obsolescence has disappeared so far as the prole is concerned everything he consumes has been produced by the most advanced automated equipment he wears textiles that last damn near forever he lives in prefab buildings that can be erected overnight he eats massproduced foods manufactured largely in factories his entertainment is canned his medical care is computerized and automated as is the pitiful education he wants i repeat it costs practically nothing to send a prole from the cradle to the grave the waiter entered with jerry auburns cognac put it on the table and stepped back lee felt puzzlement but did not know why perhaps it was something subtle in the waiters movements suddenly jerry auburn knocked back his chair and spun his foot lashed out and upward with the grace of a ballet dancer and kicked the small automatic in the hand of the slim now snarling italian waiter the weapon struck the ceiling before falling to the side the waiter cursed in some dialect that neither of the two diners understood and snatched for something in his clothing jerry reversed himself his back to the other and lashed out with his foot again high the shoe connected with the chin and mouth of the attacker who was slammed back viciously against the wall behind him in a daze he slid down to the floor jerry did not see the automatic lee got out in a gasp where did you ever learn savate from the first guy who used it on me he said we bloated aristocrats learn fast dont we yes we do she said and displayed the automatic in her hand chapter eleven the graf on the eastern side of the rhine between the orisons and lake constance lies a tiny baroque toy of a country liechtenstein the last remnant of the holy roman empire and save for switzerland the only nation in western europe still aloof from the loose confederation called common europe it boasts a population of some and an area of square miles supposedly still a monarchy under his highness prince johann alois heinrich benediktus gerhardus von und zu liechtenstein und duke von troppau und jaegerndorf the prince had gone bankrupt a quarter of a century earlier and these days lived a rocketset existence on the proceeds of the outright sale of his country the buyer was graf lothar von brandenburg who now resided in the wolfschloss the schloss once a robberbaron stronghold had been built in the th century burned in the swabian wars of then last overhauled in the late th century the wolfschloss was a fortyminute climb by path northeast of vaduz the tiny capital of liechtenstein or a few minutes by modern road ending in a cablecar terminal which provided access to the castle the climb was forbidden to such tourists as still came to the country and the road was private unbelievably well patrolled there were various roadblocks along it liechtenstein had once owed its prosperity to tourism the winter sport industry and its many editions of colorful stamps since its acquisition by graf lothar von brandenburg it was no longer prosperous save for vaduz whose working population was largely employed by the graf himself tourism was barely tolerated certainly not encouraged and the ski resorts were either closed down or sparsely patronized the oncefamous art collection of the vaduz museum was now largely to be found in the wolfschloss the office of the graf contained no desk and had precious little else to resemble a business office one whole wall was of glass and looked out on an unsurpassed view of the rhine valley over part of the castles ward there was but one article of decoration a franz hals which dominated another wall the office presented an air of spartan luxury as it were austere but very very expensive this morning it was occupied by three people lothar von brandenburg at sixtyfive was still hale and in season skied each morning or hunted his extensive game preserves he also made a point of swimming thirty laps of the large swimming pool hed had installed in the courtyard of a schloss so extensive that a regiment of cavalry could have paraded there he was only five feet four but had a lean athletic build his short hair once blond was now a platinum white it was his eyes that were most remarkable the irises were of flecked smoky grey and they had no expression whatever went on behind the smokescreen nothing came through with few exceptions people newly introduced to lothar von brandenburg were uncomfortable about his eyes he dressed during the day in formal business wear complete with dark cravat although ties had seldom been worn for half a century his suits were invariably faultless though it was untrue that he never wore one twice still they gave that impression peter windsor was of a very different sort possibly twenty years younger than the man he served as second in command he was fresh of face lime green of eye handsome in the english aristocrat manner over six feet tall his lank body gave an impression of indolence if not downright laziness he being inclined to sprawl rather than sit from this graceful indolence one could easily reach a wrong impression peter windsor which was not the name with which he had been christened had come to the attention of the graf some twentyfive years in the past when the pinkcheeked lad gained a field promotion to brigade commander in a desperately closefought action in east africa most of the senior mercenary officers were casualties the graf had immediately drawn windsor under his wing knowing a good thing when he saw one the third person was margit krebs longtime secretary stenographer girl friday and brain trust of the graf her hair was black unlikely for a dane and her face was not scandinavian but broad with a wide chin and magyar cheekbones the kind of face that aged slowly indeed she could have passed for anywhere between thirty and fifty she invariably dressed in british tweeds during the business day which understated her marvelous legs and figure the graf lowered himself precisely into his favorite heavy leather chair and nodded to his two underlings margit peter he said even as he pressed a button set into the side of the chairs arm good morning chief peter windsor said and good morning herr graf margit told him a side door opened and a servant entered he was garbed in the medieval livery of a germanic court and bore a tray with coffee things all were of gold save the dresden cups the servant granite of expression put the tray on the small table about which the three sat thank you sepp the graf said and reached for the pot bitte sepp murmured then bowed and backed from the room peter as he watched the other pour said lothar if the organization ever goes broke we can flog this service of yours and retire in comfort i shouldnt wonder his superior didnt smile but said it was ever my boyhood ambition peter to start the day off having ones breakfast and morning beverage served on gold when all had their coffee in hand the graf turned his enigmatic gaze on his second und zo peter the days crises the tall englishman dressed with allout informality in sweatshirt slacks and tennis shoes had a clipboard beside him he took it up saying no real crises this morning chief he looked at the top sheet on the clipboard a contract has come through to have senator miles deillon hit one of his business competitors ah the american agricultural tycoon why bring it to my attention couldnt you have handled such a routine matter a senator eh and a major landowner at that it would be a doublea contract very lucrative peter nodded but there may be complications the older man nodded waiting peter said the senator has had his wind up for some time afraid of being kidnapped or worse by the american nihilists you know we supply his bodyguard three men per shift on a roundtheclock basis nine men in all yes and the complication the graf sipped his coffee holding the cup in a small womanish hand his british subordinate blinked i say we cant be hired both to assassinate a man and guard him from assassination why not peter put down his own cup of coffee and closed his eyes for a moment wellhe said the graf waved a hand negatively i assume that luca cellini in new york is supplying the guards if he fails in protecting the senator it will be a mark against his reputation in the organization i assume your hit men will come from the ranks of jacquess corsicans theyre the best very well if they are unsuccessful in their attempt jacques will be shamed luca and jacques are good organization men but we cannot put up with incompetence too many contracts inefficiently carried out would lead to a bad image and our competitors would take advantage i would dislike seeing either of these men go but business is business there are many young men with us who are anxious for promotion willing and ready to step into the shoes of either luca or jacques peter shook his head and made a mark with his stylo on the sheet of paper then folded it back to scan the next one ive still got much to learn in this field the graf said speaking of competitors it has come to my attention that our colonel boris rivas in paris is again taking measures to undersell us and provide a mercenary group for some chief in mali who wishes to overthrow a neighbor approach the colonel once more with a suggestion that he join with us peter said after making his note theres one small item that might be of interest one of these socalled deathwish policies we get several a day of course but this is an exception yes the older man said politely a chap named roy cos he took a standard contract with brettjames in nassau it seemed simply routine really peter this is a minor matter it has its element you see the clods disappeared dropped out of sight hasnt used the international credit card brettjames issued him nor for that matter his own american card the lads assigned to hit cos cant put the bloody crosshairs on him the graf frowned it seems to me that we had a similar case some years ago which eventually cost us quite a bit he looked over at margit who sat quietly hands in her lap refresh me on our position in this regard my dear fraulein margit said if the subject is liquidated within the first week of the contract we receive half a million pseudodollars however this amount is lowered to a quarter million if he is not liquidated within the following week if three weeks elapse before he is eliminated instead of being recompensed at all we pay a penalty of half a million pseudodollars for each day he survives indeed yes now it comes back to me he looked at peter windsor i assume that you have investigated have you come to any conclusion i checked this roy coss dossier complete he is a national organizer of the wobblies the graf turned his empty eyes to margit she closed her eyes and began to recite in an inflectionless voice a revolutionary group founded in by american unionists anarchists and socialists under the name industrial workers of the world or iww their program involved organizing workers into one big union which would take charge of the worlds economy by legal means for a time they grew rapidly but their anarchists began to advocate sabotage and violence around and the government was able to legally crush them by the s they had all but disappeared but not quite completely their goals and methods have changed until now they have few similarities to the old iww they contend that the means of production distribution and so forth should be democratically owned and operated by the people as a whole rather than being private property or in the hands of the state they believe that this would give rise to full employment and a new surge of progress peter snorted full employment with all the automation available theyre heading for the bend if theyre not already around it margit opened her eyes they seem to believe that the presentday proles now on gas should be put to work in the arts cleaning up ecology problems that sort of thing von brandenburg sighed very well the man is a revolutionist does this have any connection with his taking out a deathwish policy it doesnt seem consistent the tall englishman looked back at his notes hes beginning to get a bit of publicity dont you know the news media are making quite a story of it before these wobblies were seldom heard of his superior snapped to margit get through to luca cellini in new york and have him put his best people on this cos is to be hit absolutely soonest ja herr graf they spoke alternately in english german and french one might ask a question in any of these languages and be answered in another even occasionally in spanish italian or russian von brandenburg looked back at peter windsor how is that fracas in somalia progressing dormant however the sheik has put in an order for two hundred infantrymen and six hovertanks the british vickers model the graf looked at his secretary do we have them available at the gao depot margit said they can be available for shipping within twentyfour hours with crews peter shook his head where does the beggar get the funds for a contract of this size one would think there would be sweet fanny adams in his treasury from the arab union his chief told him and then speaking of africa what is the latest on mahem dhu i had an indignant call from the prophets man last night this fanatics movement is spreading like wildfire he wants the man to be taken care of immediately peter nodded its had its complications you know i put spyros kakia on it hes our best coverbuilder and analyzer spyros concluded that hitting the socalled mahdi wouldnt be overly difficult hes out in public constantly for all practical purposes without guards as befits a holy man but spyros sees no possibility of a successful hit i fancied that our only possibility was to locate a gull a patsy as the yanks call it ones turned up from the states chap named franklin pinell a deportee guilty of a homicide romp he was duped into selecting tangier for his refuge and that aussie nat fraser took over pinell was stripped of everything and then convincingly taken under the wing of ram panikkar with his usual efficiency a bit of a swine ram but unbeatable at this sort of thing pinell is grateful to ram and agreed to take the mahdi assignment his cover will be as a media man which will guarantee his access to mahem dhu hell perform the hit peter sighed unfortunately the fast chopper which is supposedly posted for his escape will never materialize the graf nodded acceptance those fanatical followers will tear him to pieces he frowned what did you say his name was peter looked down at his clipboard franklin pinell von brandenburg thought about it his smoky eyes nanowing he said finally what was the name of buck pinells son remember buck was always proudly bringing forth his wallet and insisting we look at his snapshots his righthand man thought back frankie he said the name isnt that common the graf looked at margit buck pinell was before your time fraulein but get me his dossier and that of this franklin pinell he looked back at peter windsor what was bucks real first name willard wasnt it he never used it i didnt know him as well as you did lothar what was it the news chaps used to call him the lee christmas of the st century yes the graf murmured we were young men together in the early days of the organization my best friend i suppose you would say who was lee christmas fraulein margit krebs had already activated the communications screen which sat next to her chair to order the required dossiers now her eyes seemed to film and she recited lee christmas most notable of the preworld war one american mercenaries operated in south and central america almost singlehanded he was successful in several revolutions and military revolts especially in honduras he would attain high rank in the new administration but inevitably step on the wrong toes and be dismissed often to flee for his life later he might return and participate in the overthrow of the government he had brought to power a lone soldier of fortune who owned a maxim or vickers machine gun could gather a handful of followers and defeat a central american army he was considered unique among the other mercenaries because he refused to fight on the side he thought in the wrong the graf laughed softly which brought peter windsors eyebrows up the other wasnt prone to displaying humor that sounds like buck he said it was his one shortcoming he came to his feet absently and went over to the huge window to stare out over the furstensteig path along the high ridge dividing the rhine and samina valleys the peaks reached six to seven thousand feet the highest in the leichtenstein alps the dossiers in printout dropped from the slot in front of the secretary margit took them up and quickly scanned them she said you were correct herr graf franklin pinell is the son of willard pinell their photos are even remarkably similar lothar von brandenburg said musingly and why was young franklin deported he had four felonies on his record the final one was decisive he shot a man to death why he refused to reveal that his victim was evidently unarmed shot down in cold blood the revelation didnt faze margit krebs the graf turned and faced peter windsor who was already eyeing his superior in concern he said find an alternative gobemouche to liquidate the mahdi peter stood one hand out in protest oh look here lothar this is a milliondollar contract we cant afford to flub it dont you know the prophet would be incensed this pinell chap seems to be a natural and i daresay it might take donkeys years to find another dupe the older mans expressionless smoky eyes took him in i will not condone the sacrifice of the son of buck pinell peter i didnt expect sentiment from you chief neither did i however i suggest that instead of the mahdi contract you send young pinell to paris have him remonstrate with colonel rivas who seems to be getting too big for his britches as buck would have put it let him accompany nat fraser on the assignment the australian is an old hand he can report how franklin pinell reacts to being blooded ill want a full report from him and then possibly well have bucks son here to the wolfschloss to gather our own impressions his second in command shrugged it off clearly dissatisfied and turned back to his clipboard now this dave carlton chap in new jersey has been poaching on our military surplus enterprises last week he sold one hundred skoda assault rifles to chavez that guerrilla in colombia who is attempting to arouse the colombians to throw off their affiliations with the united states of the americas chapter twelve the nihilists rick flavelle looked over at his sole surviving companion who leaned against the steel wall near one of the gunports rick said its damn quiet yeah alfredo said ever since they yelled for us to surrender and you told them to get fucked you know what theyre doing theyre bringing up something to open up this tin can hell rick said checking the clip in his gyrojet automatic theyd need a laser rifle hows your arm i immobilized it with a syrette but its sure as hell useless hows your side okay rick lied he carefully slid back the slide of his gunport and peered out there was nothing to be seen the steel pillbox in which they were making their ultimate stand was beautifully camouflaged in almost the exact center of the dunninger mountain resort home in a beautiful patio garden beautiful but on the shotup and bombedout side right now from the exterior as they well knew the pillbox looked like an innocent rock garden one had to scramble about it quite carefully to find the welldisguised door not to speak of the gunports rick said hows your ammo down to the last clip im too fucked up with this dead arm to throw the clip and count them you better click the stud over to single fire rick said the other made a face in pain and growled you think im a dizzard i long since did that rick brought his gun up and carefully brought the barrel to the gunport he squinted and gently gently squeezed the trigger what the hell you shooting at alfredo growled did you get him i dont know just keeping them honest i thought i saw something move you think the bastards might be gone the other laughed bitterly you think the fucking sun will rise in the west tomorrow why should they be gone weve had it whatever they want its sitting in their laps now i havent heard any fire from the other boys for ten minutes theyve had it what they want is dunninger rick said emptily he was the only one here when they came in all the family just left for mexico have you called him hell no hes down there in the bomb shelter probably shitting his pants damn this arm you know maybe cliff had some shells left rick looked over at the body lying still where it had fallen he had an assault rifle he said the ammo wouldnt fit either of our gyros alfredo snarled use your goddamned head get his rifle and when youve used up your rocket shells use his gun id get it myself but you can move easier rick nodded leaned his automatic against the metal wall and painfully made his way over to the fallen body there was little chance of enemy fire penetrating the two small gunports but he moved in a crouch instinctively the wound in his side wasnt helping any he could have taken a syrette to localize it but he wasnt sure of the effect he couldnt afford to have his whole right side paralyzed the inert cliff had no spare clips that stupid bastard dunninger had insisted that their uniforms be neat and presentable he didnt want them distracting the family and visitors with bandoliers of ammunition and grenades dangling from their belts so aside from the clips theyd had in their weapons the bodyguards had at most two spares they had largely used them up in the first moments of the assault on the dunninger home and from then on theyd had insufficient firepower to keep the attackers at bay it had been a ballsup from the start nobody had time to make his way to the little armory for more ammo rick worked his way back to his gunport trailing the assault rifle behind him his side was feeling worse by the minute he peered through the small port again he said trying to keep down their mutual fear and apprehension by talk what the hell happened anyway who are they the holy mother only knows if that stupid bastard luca cellini hadnt pulled the other four guys off we wouldve had a chance but eight of us werent enough especially with one shift sacked out when the sons of bitches hit rick said cellini was rotating them another four guards were supposed to show up for replacements yeah the other sneered bullshit its too much of a coincidence old man dunningers family leaves him alone here four of his bodyguards are relieved and next thing we know were all in the dill there must be twenty of the bastards out there they knocked off the dogs and three of the boys before we got wise were lucky we made it to this overgrown tin can with me covering for that fat cat dunninger listen theres not enough money in the country to pay for holding down a job like this rick said wanly you should have thought of that during the two years weve been on this cushy assignment yeah great but i wish luca cellini was here with us right now or better still the graf himself you know what we oughta do rick call out and tell em were willing to surrender if they wont kill us hell they dont want us they want old man dunninger his companion his side cramping up now looked over sarcastically sure al and then spend the rest of our lives on the run from the graf he doesnt like his boys to surrender and what happens if we do not only are we on the run but thats the end of any compensation any pension any further credits from him at all wed be back on gas and so far as im concerned ive got two kids i want to get through a good school two kids i want to leave a few shares of us variable basic stock so they wont wind up living on nothing but gas the rest of their lives oh great the other sneered two kids eh a regular oneman population explosion well im not that far around the bend rick i dont have any kids im on my own those guys out therell let us go they want the big shot hiding down in the bomb shelter not us screw the graf well worry about him when the time comes weve both copped one havent we what does he expect rick shrugged it off and peered through his gunport he thought he could hear something going on in the house what a sonofabitch of a pickled situation if the attackers were smart enough to just wait it out another hour he and alfredo would have stiffened up to the point that they couldnt resist anyway there came a heavy explosion up against the door that threw him to the steel floor of the small pillbox he landed agonizingly on his wounded side he lay there breathing deeply not sure he could move a thin piercing tone began a steady whistle in his ear he called out finally you all right al theyve got some kind of heavy weapon out there that was an explosive shell not just a bomb shit whaddaya mean am i all right i keep telling you weve had it yell to them toss in the towel another earblasting explosion whumped against the steel door it sagged inward oh jesus rick panted why cant those four new guards show up take em from the rear he struggled to work his gyrojet automatic around you stupid dreamer you alfredo got out theyre not coming weve been set up left holding the fucking sack the next explosion blew the heavy door off its hinges sent it crashing to the floor barely missing the fallen rick flavelle here they come alfredo snarled two prolegarbed fighters popped through the blasted entryway and jumped immediately to each side crouching they carried automatic shotguns on the ready alfredo swore brought up his gun with his one arm pulled the trigger widened his eyes at the weapons failure to fire pulled desperately again a shotgun blast tore his stomach away rick threw his weapon aside screaming im out of it dont shoot give me a break the first of the two approached him gingerly covered by the second grimed by dirt eyes wide with excitement and exertion he was a goodlooking young fellow in his late teens looking more like a student than a gunman he kicked ricks weapon even farther to one side and shot a quick look at the bodies of alfredo and cliff he stared down at rick and said why didnt you dizzards give up we werent after you we want that plutocrat dunninger youre just a couple of working men doing the best you can to make some kind of decent living yeah yeah rick panted thats it dont shoot the young gunman looked around at his companion call for the medic and ostrander the second one nodded and went back to the door and shouted its secure theres only one left and hes wounded wheres the doc a newcomer entered the breached pillbox and looked about making a face at the carnage he was middleaged and toted an oldfashioned assault rifle under one arm he looked down at rick and said wheres dunninger dont make us force you to tell rick was losing most of his sudden panic but was still breathing deeply he got out down in the bomb shelter over there the trap door he armed a doctor entered carrying a medical bag he was older gray of hair and obviously tired rick undoubtedly wasnt the only combat victim he had treated in the past hour of action he shot his eyes around dismissed the obviously dead pair and came over to rick rick said yeah hes armed to the one in command that trap door locked from inside i dont know ive never been down there the doctor said shut up let me look at you and knelt down next to the fallen bodyguard but the commander said is there any way of communicating with him from up here that phone over there hung on the wall shut up the doctor repeated fishing in his bag the commander went over to the phone examined it briefly put it to his mouth and ear and activated a stud on its side he said dunninger you might as well come on out of there or well have to blow you out and that might wind up plastering you around the walls no we wont kill you not yet not if your family ponies up the ransom dont be a dizzard dunninger of course we can get you out of there were here in the pillbox arent we stop trying to stall nobodys coming to your assistance this house is too far away from any other for the ruckus to have been heard and we have a scrambler blanketing all communications so come on out of there before we scrape you out he listened for a moment longer and then hung the phone back on the wall he looked at the steel trap door to the bomb shelter below two more civilianclad armed men had crowded into the small compartment they looked down at the doctor working on rick flavelle who had passed out the doctor said here you two men carry this fellow out to the chopper one of the newcomers grumbled why not let him die chet is dead and two of the other boys have copped one because were not butchers now get this man to the aircraft while the two were carrying rick out into the garden patio the trap door began cautiously to rise the three remaining gunmen trained their weapons on it the commander reached down and grasped the steel door and pulled it completely back on the steel ladder below stood an apprehensive man in his late middle years white of face lips trembling he was clad in swimming trunks come on come on the commander of the terrorists said the other climbed out fearfully and put his hands high over his head he saw the two bodies and winced the commander jerked his head come on this way harold dunninger said doing his best to keep a tremor from his voice where are we going to a hideout until we collect the ransom if we collect it oh dont worry dont worry about that youll collect it dont worry were not worrying either way they passed through the garden into the house and down the hall toward the front door everywhere were signs of the short battle that had been waged so recently including two bodies in uniforms similar to those of rick and alfredo outside a copter had landed on the extensive lawn the two gunmen who had carried rick out were hoisting him up into it more armed men in prole clothing were streaming from the house two of them with bandaged wounds they were in high good humor calling back and forth to each other banteringly the commander said one of you boys go back and get some clothes for this character cozzini bandage his eyes hes got a reputation as a sharpy when all had embarked the craft swept off the ground and reached for altitude the commander seated next to the pilot said evenly get out of here soonest it wont be long before one of those damned servants gets himself untied shouldnt be much more than an hour before the iabi is after us right the pilot said still blindfolded harold dunninger now in better command of himself and making an effort to control his trembling was pushed down on a hard seat in the copter at least thank god betty and the children were now safely in mexico and then the chilling thought came to him he and betty hadnt been getting along these days ever since she had found out about that ridiculous little harem hed been keeping down in the city the group sex thing betty was of the old school had even insisted on marriage but now they had been planning divorce and betty would have the reins of his fortune when it came to the ransom what was to prevent her from taking an uncompromising stand against the kidnappers refusing to meet their demands on his death she would inherit the whole fortune one of the largest on the continent damn betty had let him know in no uncertain terms that she hated him for what she called her betrayal the bitch didnt realize that shed lost what appeal she had possessed as a young woman now though pushing sixty he still had the sexual drives of a man in his thirties those bimbos he kept were only for occasional orgies nothing important as for the family he loved the two boys and had grown used to betty he hadnt wanted the divorce was still arguing with her about it but she was adamant oh god betty would she meet the kidnappers demands after all it was only money there was always more endlessly more where it came from the aircraft slid into a landing and again he was hauled pushed led blindly this point to that now he was in some kind of a building perhaps a dwelling nor did his captors utilize an elevator instead he was marched up stairs down a hall then pushed into a room a door slammed behind him harold dunninger stood there a while his eyes still bandaged but his hands free finally hesitantly he reached up and tore the blindfold away he was in a small bedroom it could have been a servants room in any of his own houses but no not even his servants lived in quarters as drab as these two chairs a table a dresser a bed an open door to a small bath on the bed lay some of his clothes including shoes whoever had snatched up the things had forgotten socks and handkerchiefs on the table was a plate of sandwiches which looked less than appetizing and a halfliter plastic of beer the furniture was less than new the rug on the floor wellworn there was one window but what looked like tar paper had been taped over it on the outside so that he couldnt have looked out without breaking the glass and he assumed that this would bring punishment for lack of anything else to do he donned shirt slacks and shoes they hadnt even brought him underclothing no tridi set not even a radio or books the pockets of his slacks were empty there came a gentle knock at the door and harold dunninger looked up apprehensive again before he could respond a stranger entered none of the kidnappers he had thus far seen had looked like desperadoes they had been dressed as proles but they hadnt been vicious in spite of the circumstances but this one was different among other things he was only about twenty and one had to look twice to realize that he wasnt younger he had what only could be described as a hesitant face polite well bred freshfaced as though he hadnt been shaving very long and far from aggressive his expression was almost apologetic he was welldressed in sports clothing and wouldnt have looked out of place with a tennis racket in his hand he said good afternoon sir harold dunninger stared at him who the hell are you the other flushed my names thomas spaulding sir he stood there almost like a waiter or a butler at attention dunninger continued to eye him he said finally well what do you want ive come to to be with you sir do you mind if i sit down its your jail the older man snapped somehow feeling relief at this development somehow gaining courage from the appearance of this inoffensive youngster he himself took one of the chairs at the table ill do what i can to make you as comfortable as possible under the circumstances the tycoon snorted in disgust comfortable under these conditions what could you do to make me comfortable anything within reason something to read something to eat besides those sandwiches perhaps something to drink beyond the beer there writing materials or would you just like to talk talk about what goddamn it anything you like sir im here to keep you company thanks dunninger said even able by now to mount sarcasm thomas spaulding looked anxious and cleared his throat perhaps youd like a bible or would you prefer a united church brother to talk to those ignorant bigots theres never been such a corrupt stupid religious movement in the history of the race im a catholic boy yes sir i remember now would you like a priest the cold went through harold dunninger and his face went slack after a long moment he said what do you mean would i like a priest young spaulding said i am not superstitious myself sir but i have no prejudice against those who are i thought i thought it was the custom of your faith to make peace with your god before he let the sentence dribble away the older man stared at him cold fingers walking down his spine finally he got out youre going to shoot me that leader of yours that one who talked me out of the bomb shelter he said you wouldnt kill me comrade ostrander knew you wouldnt be killed if the ransom was paid but i doubt if he promised anything more you have twentyfour hours sir if the fifty million pseudodollars is not forthcoming by that time i am afraid that that your life is forfeit fifty million pseudodollars yes sir comrade ostrander has already made the initial contact the ransom is to be paid into a special numbered account in tangier and there must be guarantees that no attempt will be made to prosecute anyone if such attempts are made you will be uh eliminated harold dunninger slumped back in his chair his eyes wide betty would never permit such a sum to escape her hands yes it was available but she would never not betty in spite of the fact that she had been bom into luxury and certainly had lived in luxury betty was a compulsive pennypincher she made a point of prowling the kitchen enraged if the servants opened a bottle of wine for themselves the allowance she doled out to the boys was a farce harold dunninger augmented it secretly each week her pennypinching was proverbial fifty million pseudodollars no never from betty even in the best of times harold dunninger said shakily ill take that drink yes sir young spaulding got up and went to the door opened it and stuck his head out obviously speaking to a guard stationed in the hall dunningers mind raced or tried to he had to get out of here somehow within twentyfour hours was this kid armed if so was there any way to take his gun and get through the guard which they obviously would have posted he closed his eyes and groaned harold dunninger was no musclebound hero hed let himself go to pot over the years hed never been much for sports even as a youngster and even if he was able to overwhelm spaulding there would be more of them beyond downstairs men trained and experienced with guns while he hardly knew enough to fire one he closed his eyes in sick dismay his stomach beginning to roil tom spaulding returned with a squat bottle and a glass and put them on the table before the captive dunninger shakily took off the bottles cap and poured it was a bottle of his own prehistoric whiskey it would seem that his kidnappers werent above looting he knocked back the spirits with a quick motion he had to make some sort of plans the young man had seated himself again and was looking in compassion at the captive dunninger said are you supposed to be seeing that i make no plans for escape the other seemed embarrassed well no sir it was my idea it goes back to the old british and french army days of the late th century all officers were gentlemen they came from good families aristocrats if one was to be shot in the morning a fellow officer was assigned to stay with him in his cell and well be with him take messages to his family or sweetheart help him make out his will if necessary talk with him possibly read the bible with him that sort of thing just well keep him company dunninger eyed him even as he poured another stiff drink whyd they pick you the boy looked embarrassed again i suppose its because i know you sir we come from the same background my father was a close friend of yours the older man was staring now youre pete spauldings boy why i remember you now tommy spaulding i havent seen you since you were about ten or eleven a thin little fellow always nervous yes sir i remember you too mr dunninger very clearly look call me harold the other said his voice had an edge of excitement now look tommy ive got to get out of here my wifell never pay that ransom never in a million years weve got to figure some way of getting me out of here the young man blinked and shook his head sadly im afraid thats impossible but look these people are killers theyre kidnappers mad dogs must be shot down on sight tom spaulding was still shaking his head in rejection no sir theyre idealists dont you know whose hands youre in were the nihilists we yes sir you must realize we dont have anything against you as an individual were opposed to the socioeconomic system you represent we are going to change it the tycoon closed his eyes once more and tried to wrench his mind into thought he opened them again and said desperately see here boy that sum your comrade ostrander demanded is ridiculous yes sir it was purposely made so to attract attention to your case itll never be paid but ill tell you tommy on my word of honor that if you can get me out of here ill give you five million pseudodollars all taxfree all deposited to your account no questions asked say in switzerland or nassau my word of honor sir the other said sadly you dont understand even if i did need the money and i dont it wouldnt interest me im a devoted member of the nihilists and though im sorry that you are in this position im dedicated to ending this social system im willing to participate in the liquidating of others if required to accomplish our ends dunninger glowered at him youre completely around the bend youre crazy i dont think so sir the worlds in need of change the overwhelming majority of the race is living in misery and degradation the tycoon said impatiently what the hell do you think youd replace our system with we differ on that question you see nihilists dont ever expect to come to power ourselves were basically antiorganization if you can comprehend that were against the status quo but we dont offer a definitive alternative system we believe production should be democratically owned and we believe in world government but not of the present systems dunninger groaned in the face of what he thought sheer madness but what do you think youre doing you assassinate people especially rich or powerful people you commit arson and sabotage whats that got to do with reforms youre nothing but terrorists no sir our basic goal is to spur the people into alternalives to capitalism and communism most people never consider the possibility of a basic change in their own system the system tells them that what prevails has always been and will always be they fail to realize that nothing changes as steadily as social systems dunninger was in despair youd prefer what theyve got in the soviet complex were against them both in the west production means are owned by a few private individuals in the east it is in the hands of the state to the rankandfile citizen it makes comparatively little difference in short were trying to goose the worlds population into thinking about change so youre actually willing to murder me to gain what you think are desirable ends yes sir we are the boy said simply its not fair ive never killed anybody in my life the boy looked at him and took a deep unhappy breath havent you maybe you never pulled a trigger but the blood on the hands of your social system is unbelievable millions have died due to pollution and disease brought about by your rampaging industry millions have died from poisonous foods and drugs that were continued because they made a profit why has cancer erupted geometrically over the last century and a half mr dunninger you dont even know how many deaths youve caused dunninger tipped up the whiskey bottle once again the boy was a wildeyed unthinking fanatic given time he might have been able to get through to him convince him how wrong he was how misguided but he harold dunninger didnt have time he had less than twentyfour hours now harold dunninger upended the bottle killing it can you get me another one of these he slurred chapter thirteen roy cos roys secretary mary ann publicity man jet peters and writer ferd feldmeyer sat in a row on a couch before the tridi screen in the luxurious winter villa of some absent northerner the variableimage tridi screen was set into the wall of the living room at the moment it was just large enough so that the people on lens were lifesize there were some uncanny attributes though the trio had been exposed to tridi projections all their lives the illusion was as though they could have spoken back and forth with roy cos and the others being shown the face of a wellknown commentator was smiling as though earnest sincere and ohsofriendly mary ann frowned her plain face impatient she said youve got the wrong station ferd thats ken butterworth i listen to his commentaries every day jet peters swigged at his highball sitting around waiting for the broadcast hed already had enough to still the characteristic tremor of his hands he said ken is roys announcer forry ponied up fifty thousand to get him for just a few minutes nothing but the best for roy cos that brit shyster in nassau will be sweating thirtyeight caliber turdlets at the rate forry goes through that million pseudodollars a day christ only knows what were paying for fifteen minutes of prime time on an international hookup the lifesize figure seated behind the desk said folks this is ken butterworth yours truly tonight i have a surprise for you if you follow the news at all you know that roy cos has gained instant fame as the deathwish wobbly roy cos a dedicated idealist is risking his life perhaps sacrificing it to bring you the message of the industrial workers of the world the wobblies mr cos is unsusal for a man with a message he doesnt insist that you subscribe to his admittedly radical view only that he be granted the opportunity to say it and allow you to make your own decisions roy coss life has been insured for an unbelievable sum so long as he lives he has a very large credit line unlike others who sign deathwish policies roy cos is devoting his credits to spreading his message his life expectancy might be measured in hours but tonight he will bring you his program of basic changes to our social system he plans further broad caststhe news commentator paused dramatically if he survives folks i present mr roy cos the deathwish wobbly ken butterworth faded out and roy came on lens sitting at i similar desk flanking him and behind stood billy tucker and ron ellison their faces alert their eyes periodically roaming ferds plump mouth seemed to pout what the hell are they doing there he said jet peters laughed one of forrys ideas to emphasize roys continual danger theyre in a little studio in one of the smaller tridi stations about fifty miles from here i dont know where theres not a chance that anybody knows where they are and even if they did they couldnt get into that studio but it looks authentic roy is being guarded every minute mary ann said even as roy started his talk he looks awful his face is too pale too heavy too ferd said put some of the cosmetic boys to work on him mary ann he needs to cut a sympathetic figure kind of romantic roy was reading his speech somewhat stiffly hed never appeared on the airwaves before the three watching had heard the speech a dozen times before and had all had a hand in its final polishing so they didnt bother to listen too closely jet said he needs coaching forry ought to hire a couple of actors to give him some pointers he looked at ferd where do we meet the rest of them after the broadcast search me ferd said he looked at mary ann mary ann said no thats why i had you pack ready to go were to meet roy and the others at a prearranged street corner ditch our car there and then go on i dont know where i hope the hell we dont get separated from them the publicity man growled ferd took a sip from his glass of beer well from now on the credits start accumulating he said in his fat mans voice now we come out from cover and start spending that money do you realize weve already made seventy thousand apiece weve been on the payroll a week and forty hasnt allowed him to use his credit card at all man when he does itll all hit the fan at once the secretary put her elbows tight against her sides in feminine rejection dont talk about the money were making she said it sounds ghoulish jet said to her where are we going to meet them on a street corner he scowled impatiently what street corner she was embarrassed forry told me not to tell anyone the publicity man didnt get it and said you mean he doesnt even trust us oh dont be a cloddy jet its not just us he didnt tell anybody where we were to rendezvous except me only one of us needs to know the fewer people who know the less chance there is for an accidental leak roy cos finished his talk and forry brown took over seated in ken butterworths place lending him a spurious celebrity the scrawny little newsman was more at home on lens than roy he said squinting his faded gray eyes thanks to all you people for listening as ken butterworth said roy will have more to say if he survives its rumored that the contract for his death his murder is in the hands of the legendary graf lothar von brandenburg of mercenaries incorporated in short its just a matter of time now roy cos and his staff are on the run but im going to let you listeners in on something we are not going to give advance notice of roys broadcasts instead were going to spring them at just about any time any place you might even keep your video recorders taping tomorrow or the next day just by chance you might come onto another wobbly broadcast if and when you do phone three of your friends who might be interested and tell them that the deathwish wobbly is again hurrying through one of his talks before the grafs killers can catch up to him a onebeat pause before forry delivered his clincher they just might catch him while hes on camera jet came to his feet and said ill finish packing my bags got some things ive got to cram into them he left the room mary ann looked after him thoughtfully forry on the tridi screen was continuing we applied to the interamerican bureau of investigation for protection and were ignored the only guards roy has are four friends fellow wobblies they are unarmed they applied for permits to carry weapons but were denied i suggest that any listener who is indignant over this get in touch with his congressman and senator demand that roys guards be allowed weapons the grafs gunmen will be armed to the teeth of course most of you do not yet support the wobbly cause i roy coss manager am not a wobbly but we all subscribe to the american tradition of fair play we all believe that this dedicated man must be heard before his inevitable fate overtakes him good night fellow members of the human race if you see us again all of us will have been very very lucky the screen faded suddenly mary ann was on her feet hurrying from the room she went down the hall to jet peters bedroom it was closed but there was no lock she pushed through and entered briskly the publicity man was standing in the middle of the room a pocket transceiver held to his mouth his habitually bleary eyes widened and for the briefest of split seconds it looked as though he was going to hide what he was doing but that was nonsense her eyes accused him silently he looked at her one of my publicity outlets i thought of one last thing i could plant in a mary ann said crisply no all evening long youve been trying to find out where roy is where we were to meet and where we were going dont be a mopsy he said contemptuously deactivating the transceiver and returning it to a side pocket i want to know to whom you were talking none of your goddam business i want to know too a voice said from behind her ferd feldmeyer stepped into the room mary ann said to him i passed his room earlier and saw his bags there on the floor he was already packed his excuse for leaving while we were still listening to the broadcast wasnt valid and now i caught him phoning somebody ferd looked at the publicity man wearily what the hells the matter jet wasnt ten thousand a day enough to keep you honest jet peters stared at him ten thousand a day dont be silly he wont last the next twentyfour hours especially after that broadcast roasting the contracting corporation and the graf you two ought to come in with me i was offered a quarter of a million pseudodollars tax free just for fingering him theyll boost that now if all three of us cooperate what some assholes will do for money feldmeyer said shaking his head i always thought you were a square guy in a sloppy sort of way peters you and forty and i have known each other for a long time you shouldnt have sold forry out you undoubtedly contacted the grafs people on your own they wouldnt have known how to get in touch with you or even that you were working for roy the other said in a quick rage poor cos is going to get it anyway what difference does a few days make well collect our ten thousand a day as long as he lasts and then when they get to him well get a bonus of maybe another half million from the graf when they burn him the graf never reneges on a deal no mary ann said bitterly and neither do i you cynical gob of snot ferd feldmeyer held out a hand no more reports peters give me your transceiver get screwed you fat jerk ferds eyebrows went up in his lardy face peters im twice your weight and ten years younger do you really wanta try me jet glared but finally dipped a hand into his side pocket and brought forth the communications device the speechwriter took it dropped it to the floor and ground it under his heel you stupid greedy bastard he said you not only dont get the seventy thousand pseudodollars but you wont get anything from the grafs outfit either he turned to mary ann lets go we dont want to keep them waiting carrying their bags mary ann and ferd piled into the car parked in the driveway in actuality it was jet peterss vehicle which bothered them not at all mary ann drove under way ferd feldmeyer growled the idiot didnt it ever occur to him that when the grafs boys finally polished off roy some of us might go too they might just toss a grenade getting us all then the graf wouldnt have to renege on the quarter of a million he promised jet there wouldnt be any jet to pay off mary ann said well at least we learned one thing he looked over at her still disgusted at the defection of his friend what its definite that its the grafs contract a hell of a lot of good that does us he said the grafs men are far and away the most efficient in their rotten business the corner where they were scheduled to rendezvous wasnt far the small tridi station couldnt have been many miles away forry wasnt telling anything he could withhold mary ann parked and within three minutes another car pulled up alongside them les bates was at the wheel forry beside him the rest were in the back forry called over hurry it up lets get out of here mary ann and ferd brought their luggage over and stuffed it into the large compartment of the limousine ferd crowded into the front with forry and les mary ann got into the back with roy and the three other guards taking a jump seat roy said where the devils jet ferd answered wearily he sold out to the graf mary ann caught him reporting evidently hed promised to finger you les took off accelerating rapidly damn forry said angrily i didnt expect any of the team to get the gimmes this soon they rode in silence for a moment les said to forry where are we going and forry said i dont know they all looked at him blankly he said impatiently dont you get it none of us knows where were going now so at least were sure that the grafs gang wont be there waiting for us anybody have any ideas one thing from now on we have to be more out in the open weve got to have as much security as possible but with roy available to the media hes got to give interviews issue statements keep in the public eye we can buy media time but that doesnt mean that we can ignore free publicity so any ideas for a time as they sped across the country all were blank billy tucker said hesitantly i was thinking in terms of getting a couple of mobile homes and keeping on the move just turning up from time to time for broadcasts roy objected then wed be hiding from the news people as well as the graf and wed miss all that free publicity forrys talking about and thats going to get your message across even faster than your own talks mary ann said dick samuelson said i hope the organization is grinding out our pamphlets fast enough to meet the demand they wont have to forry said but never fear profitmaking publishers will get into the act if theres a market before the next week is out youll see more material on the wobbly program than you ever suspected could exist but to get back to it where do we go ron ellison said hesitantly i know a big hotel in miami where theyve got a kingsize penthouse i worked there once ron told him i know the place it wouldnt take much to secure it theres only one private elevator with a steel door and theres another steel door at the only stairway the place was originally built with the idea of attracting south american politicians whod taken off with their countrys treasure or syndicate men or maybe tridi stars who wanted to get away from their fans forry said sourly there are quite a few places in southern florida of that type anything special about this one well yes ron said when i was working there there were three or four other wobblies besides me hotels are automated to hell and gone these days but youve always got to have some staff i get it roy said having our own people planted in the hotel means that much more security they might be able to spot something offbeat and report it to you thats right ron said nodding youd be surprised how fast gossip goes through a big hotel suppose one of the grafs men turned up claiming to be from the phone company and wanting to get into the penthouse for repairs the hotel electrician a chumpal of mine named larry would spot him in a minute either that or hed tag along with him just to be sure as long as he was in the hotel im sold forry said ron get on your transceiver and find out if that penthouse is available if so rent it in your name dont mention anything about roy or me say youll pay in advance daily but dont let on that you have endless funds say youre coming in tonight while ron was making arrangements forry said to roy if i know this type of hotel penthouse arrangement therell be a private entrance probably at the rear of the hotel ron will know well go in that way you and i will have scarves around our heads on the off chance that somebody who saw the broadcast might spot us we want to be organized in that place before our comingout party to the news syndicates right roy said he took a deep breath how long do you think ill last forry the other took time to light a smoke before answering he said trying to keep feeling from his voice i dont know probably longer than anybody thinks there are some aspects of this one that the grafs boys havent run into before in the past the suckers who signed the deathwish policies to have their fun and spend their credits did it in public nightclubs restaurants bars shops theatres they were sitting ducks were going to present them with a whole new set of problems they pulled up before the looming beachside resort hotel an hour later and were met at the private entrance by the manager monsieur pierre boucherer was a product of the best swiss hotel management school therefore a whiz at fawning he fawned he welcomed their party of eight with pure enthusiasm he saw nothing untoward in the heads of two men swathed in scarves he saw nothing untoward in the party insisting on taking up their own luggage to their extravagantly expensive skytop rental he would have seen nothing untoward if theyd all had live coral snakes for neckties he alone accompanied them to the penthouse it took two trips in view of their number the amount of luggage and the fact that the elevator was only mediumsize but at last all of them were gathered in the spacious living room jesus billy tucker said looking around taking it all in he had obviously never been in a luxury hotel apartment monsieur boucherer fawned even as he rubbed his gloved hands together and now how may i serve you forry still masked like a moslem virgin looked over at the bar he then sent his eyes around to his companions whats your favorite guzzle he said they looked at him in mild surprise for a moment but then medium dry sherry mary ann said whiskey said roy who was also still swathed but then no make that scotch yeah scotch ron said bourbon dick said real hundredproof sour mash me too bill said im a beer man but none of this synthetic stuff les said brandy ferd said running a small tongue over his fat lips french cognac cognac for me too forry said and then to the manager send up two cases each of sherry scotch bourbon and cognac and ten cases of pilsner urquell all of the best quality the hotel cellars provide the manager gaped at him blankly he said but sir the bar is automated either for individual drinks or by the bottle send up the cases forry said this penthouse has a kitchen of course and a large pantry deepfreeze and all of course sir i want it completely stocked within a couple of hours from your stocks on hand with enough food to last us a month or more the very best mind you monsieur boucherer was too taken aback to remember his fawning he opened his mouth to protest to declare the abilities of the hotels chefs but then closed it again yes sir he fawned and what else forry said this room is going to be converted into uh something of an office well want a half dozen desks and the standard equipment to go with them tv phones vocotypers library boosters for the national data banks all of this should be up here in the next couple of hours the manager blinked yes sir forry pressed on i understand that theres a stairway steeldoored at both ends leading up here i want the door at the other end kept closed and two hotel security men posted at it twentyfour hours a day they are to pass no one that evidently was not an unknown desire on the part of guests registered in the penthouse monsieur boucherer was able to make with a fawn again certainly sir two guards are to be stationed at the elevator as well twentyfour hours a day no one outside this party is to be allowed to pass without my okay my name is brown very good mr brown for the moment thats all ill see you in the morning about the credit transfer to cover all this it will be on a swiss international numbered account of course sir when the manager was gone the little exnewsman sighed and unwrapped his scarf roy cos did the same forry sent ron and dick to double check the doors les bates made a beeline for the bar calling over his shoulder for orders the others slumped into seats all suddenly weary roy said whats the idea of ordering all that guzzle and all the food for that matter mary ann nodded forry said anything we order tonight is probably safe its unbelievable that the bogeymen know were here but after tomorrow morning when we let it out where we are nobody in this team is to drink or eat anything that doesnt come from our private stock dont dial for drinks on the autobar dont have any food sent up from the kitchens from now on were poisonconscious also conscious of the fact that a bottle can be gimmicked with explosives take off the cap and wham yeah roy said in resignation from now on weve got to assume that anything that could possibly kill us will mary ann glanced over at him her eyes sad but she said nothing roy glanced at his diminutive manager what was that about you asking the iabi for protection and about the guns i didnt know youd requested gun permits for the boys i havent forry told him but it sounded good over the air bring home to the viewers the toughness of the spot youre in at that stage it was just as well the iabi didnt know where we were even if they did want to guard us theyre undoubtedly infiltrated by the grafs organization and wed have put ourselves on the spot and asking for gun permits for them would have revealed the fact that ron billy les and rick were lined up with you and that might have led to tracking us down if the iabi denied wed asked for protection nobody would believe them youre quite a machiavelli forry ferd wheezed les had served them drinks and they settled back in satisfaction they all felt the tensions of the past few days forry said taking out the last pack of cigarettes he had bought in nassau i hope that soapy manager can come up with tobacco as well ill have to order that too before the night is out thats all id need some doped cigarettes he looked over at ron you know this place better than any of the rest of us go around and decide what rooms each of us should have give roy the most strategically located one you know the one thats furthest from both of the elevator and staircase dick stood and walked over to the french windows that opened onto the hotels roof there was an extensive garden largely of potted plants a swimming pool a sun deck tables and folding chairs he said whats to prevent a chopper from settling down out there with a few of the grafs lads in it nothing forry growled were going to have to post a fulltime guard outside dick turned and looked at him theres only four of us forry nodded i know he looked at roy cos were going to need another four of your wobblies have you got four more like ron les dick and billy the wobbly national organizer sighed there arent as many of us as all that you know and were not all young unattached strongarm types and probably a lot of the membership dont even agree with what im doing all right forry said sourly but we need at least four more guards preferably familiar with guns guns what guns dick said bitterly just one of the grafs pros with a shooter could blow the asses off us all forry looked at him by tomorrow well have guns you can buy anything in this country if you have enough credit and as of tomorrow well be openly spending roys million a day as an oldtime crime reporter i have a few contacts gyrojets all right yes dick said happier now both handguns and assault rifles roy said ill get together with the boys and well try and pick four more guards he turned to mary ann and ferd and said howd the broadcast go over mary ann said well good and bad she glanced over at forry for one thing his presentation isnt too good his appearance is well poor a hero cant be pale and dumpy forry ran his eyes over the wobbly organizer who was grimacing and nodded i shouldve thought of that therere injections these days that can darken his complexion or we could use a sunlamp and we can have him massaged and dieted down to the point where he doesnt look so lardy hey roy said in protest they ignored him theres another thing ferd feldmeyer said that first speech was good enough perhaps it summed up the wobbly program but we cant just repeat it over and over again weve got to have fresh material like what dick asked in rejection i thought it was swell gave the movements stand exactly thats the point of the whole thing the speechwriter shook his head you cant just keep hitting the viewers over the head with a flat statement of what you want youve got to come up with new exciting stuff something to keep them coming wanting to listen in to future programs ron said but weve got nothing else to say ferd took another pull at his cognac then weve gotta find some exciting details almost anything thats a current issue something they arent doing right under this socalled welfare state take vd various drugs have been developed up over the years to combat venereal diseases first the sulfas they were tremendously effective when first discovered but in a few years new strains of gonoccocci had developed that were immune to sulfa then the antibiotics like streptomycin came along but the germs adapted to them and eventually thrived well suppose we put our scientists to work on a whole series of new antibiotics then on dday everybody in the country would take the new antibiotic whether or not they had ever had any venereal disease every man woman and child including the president and roman catholic cardinals later one of the other new antibiotics would be given everybody to nail the germs missed that first time and from then on nobody would be allowed into the united states of the americas until theyd had their antibiotics this is a halfassed description of an idea some researcher wrote and i may have some of it wrong but i know smallpox was eradicated i bet vdcowwbe great roy said but it has nothing to do with fundamental social change it could be done under any system but the thing is ferd said patiently to get to the people youve got to participate take a strong stand on everything from pollution and depletion of natural resources to ending war womens rights race problems and all the rest your stand should sound more sensible than anybody elses or else more godly and youve got to sound off about it louder and more insistently than anybody else if youre ever going to get a following thatll be how the identity screen on the door buzzed ron and billy popped to their feet thatll be the first load of food and guzzle forry said you boys supervise it roy and ill go into our rooms so that nobodyll recognize us im going to bed anyway roy said im bushed to hell and gone and ive got a sneaking suspicion that tomorrowll be a busy day he paused and added in deprecation ive got a suspicion that the rest of my life is going to be a busy day it was a halfhour later that a knock came at roy coss bedroom door he was lying on his back in bed in his pajamas hands under his head staring at the ceiling beside him on the night table was a drink he had brought from the living room it was untouched he looked at the door and said come on in mary ann was clad in a simple white nightgown and sturdy bedroom slippers she carried a halfempty bottle of scotch her hair had been combed out and her face glowed as if freshly washed or freshly made up roy said his tired hazel eyes puzzled hello mary ann something up he came to one elbow that should be my question she smiled and closed the door behind her her face had a flush which roy decided to his surprise brought a wistful beauty to her ordinary plainness mary ann elwyn would never be thought of as a pretty girl but her femininity was there now that she had discarded her brisk office efficiency she brought her eyes up and to his and the flush deepened i thought you might be lonesome she said her voice low roy stared at her plain mary ann might be but even the dreary nightclothes she wore couldnt disguise the healthy womanly body her breasts were high her waist taut her legs surprisingly long roy hadnt noticed those legs before it seldom occurred to men to scrutinize the mary ann equipment for a moment he couldnt remember when last he had bedded a woman it had probably been one of the wobbly members roy said after running a hand through his faded brown hair sit down mary ann she sat on the edge of the bed and again avoided his eyes he said look theres obviously no future in me if we happen to get caught up emotionally well i wont be able to feel grief she didnt say anything to that he said an edge in his voice i dont want charity mary ann she looked up at him then youre a fool i do roy im lonesome too he said quickly im not exactly the romantic type i know what i look like what i am those four boys guarding me are more nearly your own age and theyre all good healthy oh shut up she said she threw back the bedclothes and squirmed herself in beside him after tossing her bathrobe to the foot of the bed and kicking off her slippers im not interested in boys im interested in a loving man she flicked off the night table light and youre the most loving man ive ever met roy cos chapter fourteen frank pinell frank and nat fraser got off the metro at the odeon station and started up the street as in practically all large cities these days vehicular traffic in paris was at a minimum though pedestrians and bicycles occupied the streets even at this time of night in left bank still the home of artists and sorbonne students nat fraser looked over at his younger companion approvingly he said cobber you look like a regular toff in those new duds a little on the frenchy side gawdstrewth frank snorted at the tall gawky australian they ought to look good you ponied up enough credits to outfit me nothings too good for a cove working for the bloody graf nat looked up at a street sign rue monsieur le prince he read thats it frank said whos this colonel boris rivas oldtime mercenary mostly africa and near east last time i saw him was in yemen he had a contract there with some fifty commandos and a few hundred ragheads too bloodyminded by far for my liking cobber i was done on the bone but i did a bunk instead of joining up frank frowned now i really need a translation i dont go for finishing off women kids and old folks fair dinkum i dont rape killing civilians looting old boris gets his lollies out of it bad business if the situation pickles you might have to depend on those women and old coves hide you feed you if theyre lucky enough as to have anything to eat maybe nurse you if youve copped one he looked up at a sign over the doorway of a dilapidated building that looked a good two centuries or more in age hotel balcon this is it cobber just follow me bloody lead rivas is competition to the graf this is his last bloody chance he comes in with the mucking organization or the barstids had it and thats the dinkum oil you mean we uh shoot him the other grinned cheerfully more likely hed shoot us first cobber but were here under a bloody flag of bloody truce lets go the hotel lobby was no more impressive than the outside of the building it had the odor of long decay its lone occupant was a bent old man behind the desk obviously the concierge what rooms rivas in cobber the aussie said to franks surprise the old man spoke english top floor room too right nat said and made a gesture with his head get your arse out of here the oldtimer studied the set of nats jaw then scooted out a door behind his desk frank looked at him in surprise hes been paid nat said heading for the stairway there was no elevator the building was five stories high and nat fraser had obviously been in thirdclass french hotels before at each landing he pushed a button in the wall which turned on a low wattage bulb just long enough for them to reach the next landing the management of the hotel balcon did not waste electrical power on the fifth floor the pressing of the light button gave them just enough time to find room nat fraser knocked on the door and the hall light flicked off before the portal opened a huge black was there almost as tall as the australian and if anything broader of shoulder deeper of chest he was the blackest man frank pinell had ever seen actually ebony in complexion yet his face was more nearly european than bantu he was a beautiful physical specimen and his movements belied his size he moved like a black leopard nat said the colonel is expecting us the black opened the door wide without change of expression room turned out to be a small suite since doors were open it could be seen that there were two bedchambers and a bath the place was better furnished more comfortable than would have been expected of the hotel balcon the room they had entered was filled with chairs a table files piles of papers maps and correspondence behind an old metal desk sat colonel boris rivas rivas sat straight in his chair his posture military his face was dark and somewhat oily so that he looked more like a greek or turk than a frenchman his black hair was streaked with gray and looked as though it could use a shampoo he was on the brawny side and wore his civilian clothing uncomfortably his dark eyes gleamed dislike but he said in passable english sit down fraser he looked at frank sent his eyes over to nat again but then brought them back to frank whom he took in at greater length and who is this he demanded nat had taken one of the comfort chairs crossing his long legs frank sat down in the other the big black leaned against the wall and watched them his face still expressionless the australian pushed his bush hat to the back of his head and said the arrangement was that there be two of us and two of you fair dinkum this is frank pinell one of the grafs newest boys frank our cheeky cove behind the desk is colonel boris rivas who bloody well promoted him to colonel nobody seems to know thats enough provocative talk fraser the colonel snapped and this is sergeant sengor long ago of the senegalese airborne commandos my righthand man and bodyguard the colonel brought his eyes back to frank and said you wouldnt be related to the late buck pinell would you there is a resemblance frank wrinkled his forehead and said my fathers name was willard he was a mercenary frank said uncomfortably could be i was very young when he died and i was told very little about him if youre the son of buck pinell im surprised to see you in the employ of brandenburg pinell was a man the graf is a wolf nat said cooee whos giving with the mucking provocative talk now rivas ignored him ive always suspected that graf lothar von brandenburg was responsible for buck pinells death pull your head in the big australian growled a fine bloke you are to throw such narky nonsense around youre crazy as a kookaburra if you think the graf did buck in they cobbered up with each other when they were both no older than joeys he looked over at frank i never met buck pinell meself before me time gawdstrewth but if he was your father he was a wowser from all they say the colonel hit his desk a double rap in impatience shall we get on with it he said you contacted me for a meeting very well what do you have to say i warn you i will not be intimidated by brandenburgs cheap threats nat fraser grinned at him the graf wouldnt spend his bloody time on a cheeky zany like you rivas peter windsor sent us strewth the mucking message is simple enough for a dingo to get it through his block the mercenary business is too bloody small for any competition so windsor says this is your last mucking chance you and your whole bloody outfit are invited to join up with mercenaries incorporated boris rivass dark face went darker still he made little attempt to conceal his rage or else windsor thought youd know nat said easily fraser you can take this message to that pig windsor i am in control of all contracts in this part of common europe i shall continue to be i am not afraid of the graf his organization hasnt handled a sizeable mercenary operation for years his contracts these days are almost all individual hit jobs which of course are more in keeping with his talents sergeant see the gentlemen to the door boris rivas pushed out of his chair and made his way over to his improvised bar where he sloshed a sizeable drink into a highball glass adding no mixer to it before knocking it back without speaking further to the french mercenary nat fraser came to his feet and made a gesture with his head to frank lets do a bunk cobber this bloody arse is asking for it strike me blind if he isnt the sergeant his face still empty of expression opened the door for them when they were gone the colonel still in a rage snarled to his guard well see about nat fraser the lickspittle that windsor scum has his gall sending two of his gunmen to try and intimidate me me why ive seen more combat than brandenburg and windsor put together he sat down again at his desk and angrily dialed on his tv phone when the face appeared he snapped in french now captain bois get over here with as many of your lads as you can assemble within a few minutes to man my hotel the graf has thrown down the gauntlet well have to confer im getting in touch with major dupres and captain flaubert as well theres a possibility that we might have some trouble with that australian swine fraser the face on the screen was that of a thin man somewhat bucktoothed and now looking cautiously unhappy what did fraser have to say dupres informed me that you were to meet with him peter windsor demands that we ally with the graf in a subservient position without doubt captain bois said still cautiously and what did you tell him i threw him out of course fraser that is but now im alone here with sergeant sengor i think wed better move some of the lads into the hotel just to be sure one doesnt know what that murderous frasers orders might be the thin man shook his head sorry boris youre not big enough to go up against the graf he tolerated small organizations such as ours in the past while recruiting our best men but now contracts are too few and far between for him to allow competition hes amalgamating every mercenary group still outside the ranks of mercenaries incorporated traitor the other shook his head again and his tone was apologetic i talked it over with flaubert weve both had offers from windsor to go on the grafs fulltime retainer with promotions im afraid were taking the offers boris i suggest that you make your own peace with him hed probably promote you to brigadier brigadier you ass he hasnt had a brigadesized contract since the others face was rueful even as it faded from the screen boris rivas was livid he came to his feet again went back to the liquor and repeated his performance of a few minutes before he said to the impassive black get a drink sergeant and returned to the desk sengbr went over to the bottles poured himself a small gin and returned with it to his place against the wall near the door rivas flicked on the phone screen again and dialed when the face appeared it was that of a coarse middleaged man who looked as though he was half drunk in fact even as he sat there before the screen he lifted a glass to his lips rivas snapped whats the matter with you nothing well confound it get over here with any of the men you have in mat bistro with you were having a fracas with the graf and his pigs i know the word is all about town the colonel stared at him spread by whom by bois and flaubert among others they said that youre washed up boris theyre signing with brandenburg and what do you think henri the colonel snarled in a high rage the other took another drink ive stopped thinking i cant afford it peter windsor hasnt approached me if he doesnt by the weekend ill offer him my services if he doesnt want them it looks as though im retired the face faded and rivas slumped back in his chair for a long moment finally he got up and poured himself another drink a smaller one this time carrying the glass with him he went over to one of the curtained windows he said to the black turn off those lights the sergeant brushed his hand over the switch at the side of the door rivas stood to one side of the window and pushed back the curtain a few inches across the street he could make out a figure standing in a doorway he let the curtain back and for a moment leaned against the wall breathing deeply he knocked the drink back and threw the glass across the room shattering it against the far wall his hand went beneath his coat to emerge with a small gyrojet a silencer attachment on its muzzle come on sergeant he muttered its you and me now well go to ground and start recruiting for our counterattack that scum brandenburg doesnt know what fighting men are he hires lads to do his dirty work hasnt been in action himself for decades i just wonder how impregnable that wolfschloss of his really is the sergeant opened the door peered up and down the dark corridor then let the colonel precede him they hurried down the stairway the colonel pressing the light button as had nat fraser at each landing and at each landing they shot glances up and down the hotel corridor the lobby was empty this way rivas snapped out the back to the alley they went behind the desk and utilized the same door that the concierge had disappeared through on nat frasers orders they went down a dark narrow corridor to the portal leading out into the alley the colonel gun in right hand cautiously opened it and peered through the alley was dark very black and led to the left it had no lights at all one end led out onto the street the other was a culdesac blocked by a high brick wall on each side the walls were blank and tall the only light came from the street fifty feet away the door through which they emerged was at pavement level the alley was cobblestoned going back to the days of napoleon the little as they emerged into it two figures entered from the street cautiously half crouched damn the colonel snarled we cant afford a shootout here the flics would lay it at my door back back the other way but then he slowly as though with great care leaned forward and went down onto his knees he coughed softly then leaned forward again and put his hands on the cobblestones in front of him the gyrojet pistol clanged to the paving he slowly bowed his head as though staring in fascination at the cobbles before him there was a splashing sound his arms and legs seemed to give way at the same time and he fell forward into the puddle of his own aortic blood nat fraser and frank pinell came up tucking their guns back into holsters beneath their coats they stared down at the body a fourinch combat knife handle protruded upward from the body of boris rivas the australian looked up at the sergeant and nodded be with you in a meejum minute sengor he turned and led frank who had been staring at the fallen man in dread fascination twenty feet down the alley nat said his voice unruffled and unhurried you do a bunk back to the hotel and get your things ill stay here with the wog and do the necessary your orders are to go to vaduz in liechtenstein and to the wolfschloss thats the grafs stronghold youre to contact peter windsor there i wont be seeing you again cobber not this time he stuck his right hand out it was bonzer getting to know you frank frank pinell ignored the hand and looked into the others face coldly he said his voice even i wont shake hands with you fraser youre no friend of mine you and panikkar had it all worked out to set me up for that mahdi job anybody with a brain in his head could see that it was a oneway trip i dont know what happened or why but at the last minute this peter windsor or somebody else on the grafs staff diverted me to this instead i played along with you for a while fraser just to see what the hell was going on but i never would have taken that mahdi job it was suicide the big australian nodded he took off the bush hat reset the brim then returned it to his head what you says the dinkum oil cobber sorry it was out of my mucking hands i have to take whatever orders they give me you see theyve got a lock on me he turned and went back in the direction of the sergeant who had the body of boris rivas under the arms and was hauling it back into the dark hallway of the hotel frank took the rocket shuttle from paris to zurich then a vacuum tube to buchs on the liechtenstein border the vacuum tube line crossed the tiny principality on its way to vienna but didnt stop in liechtenstein there was evidently no shuttleport nor even an airport frank began to get the idea of just how small and remote this country was when he had to take a surface bus to complete his journey there had been no customs inspection at the border that was taken care of in vaduz itself he didnt spot any police but the bus station had an official look about it and there were several men lounging about clad like those stationed at colonel ram panikkars fortresslike estate in tangier berets commandotype uniforms and paratrooper boots they carried gyrojet carbines as naturally as though they had been bora with them in hand none of them paid any particular attention to frank who was the sole passenger debarking at vaduz there was a desk with a sign reading customs and immigration and carrying his own two bags he made his way to it the young man there dressed in civilian garb rather than a uniform looked up at franks approach he frowned slightly and said in english after taking in the newcomers appearance im afraid you have made a mistake sir liechtenstein is not a tourist country there is nothing particular here to attract visitors if you hurry you can return to the bus which makes its next stop in feldkirch in austria you can take the vacuum tube from there to innsbruck or frank said thanks for the wholehearted welcome but im here to see mr peter windsor at the uh wolfschloss whatever that is the others voice became more brisk i see may i see your identification frank brought forth his international credit card which had been given him by colonel panikkar in tangier he had wondered at the time if it was a forgery but evidently not he had drawn on it for credit when traveling without any difficulty he wondered how many pseudodollar credits he had to his account an international credit card as always doubled as a passport the customs man glanced at it and then put it in a slot in moments a voice from the desk screen spoke in german the official nodded and handed it back to frank he must have pressed a button with either hand or foot since one of the uniformed men came up the customs man said escort mr pinell to the wolfschloss he is to see mr windsor at the donjon right the other said and took frank in he lifted one of the two pieces of luggage and said this way frank followed him out to a small parking area and to one of the several jeeps there they put the bags in the back and climbed into the front the other looked as though he was probably american and spoke like it as well he must have been roughly franks own age but had a toughness about him somewhat reminiscent of nat fraser as he started up he said first trip here thats right frank said bore you shitless unless youre quartered up in the schloss not bad up there whats a schloss castle frank said american his guide hesitated momentarily before saying canadian i guess that makes you an american these days been here long the other looked over at him briefly then turned his attention back to the road without answering it would seem that questions werent good form locally though the canadian had asked the first one it was an excellent road they had passed out of vaduz in moments frank said i work for the graf too at least i think i do that didnt seem to lower any barriers they went on frank look up shortly and said for christs sake the driver grinned looks like something out of a fairy story the first time you see it eh frank had never seen a castle before save in historical tridi shows he had no idea that they could be this large the wolfschloss was built atop a small mountain even the lower foundations were a thousand feet above the valley floor it brought to mind an actionfilled movie revival of the last century depicting the good guys storming the alcazar in segovia they had used catapults small primitive cannon battering rams and finally scaling ladders it had been on the gruesome side with the defenders pouring melted lead and boiling oil down on the attacking forces the good guys had finally taken the castle by storm but frank had wondered ever since what sort of soldier would be idiot enough to be first man up one of those scaling ladders he had never expected a castle to be as large as the looming wolfschloss he wondered if it had ever been captured in the old days he didnt see how it could have been before the advent of heavy artillery along the road since they had left vaduz they had passed guard houses and on two occasions concrete pillboxes heavy automatic weapons projecting from their slots but they had been stopped only once and then briefly the guards were obviously acquainted with his guide now they pulled up before an ultramodern building with two heavy steel cables extending from its interior up to the schloss there were ten or twenty other vehicles in the parking area they got out each carrying a bag and headed for the entry there were two guards there armed with the usual gyrojet automatic carbines stationed to each side of the metal door and one who by his shoulder tabs was obviously an officer wkh a sidearm in a quickdraw holster when the two approached the guide gave an easygoing salute to the officer and it was returned just as offhandedly the guide said to frank your identification frank handed it to the officer who looked at it briefly handed it back and said go on in mr pinell youre expected welcome to the wolfschloss the metal door slid to one side into the thickness of the wall then slid silently shut behind them they were in a moderately large room steel of walls ceiling and even the floor which was however carpeted six armed men studied the newcomer one of the seated officers held out his hand without words and frank handed over his international credit card again there was a faint buzzing sound and the officer looked at him coldly two of the guards hurried over the other two covered frank less than casually now the officer said youre carrying a shooter thats right frank told him the two guards frisked him quickly and came up with his stubby gyrojet with its attached silencer it was put on the desk of the examining officer that worthy said dangerously you mean youve got the gall to try and get in to see mr windsor armed for christs sake frank said mildly impatient it was issued to me by nat fraser in tangier nobody told me where to hand it in the officer looked at him for a long moment then down at the gun its one of our models he muttered he flicked on a desk screen and spoke into it in german the officer finally looked at franks guide and said take him up colin while this was going on two of the other guards had taken franks luggage opened both bags and gone through them frank got the feeling that they were being electronically scanned at the same time his guide colin said this way mr pinell they went through another metal door and into what turned out to be the cable house proper it looked like the waiting room of a small shuttleport there were unupholstered benches and chairs and a small bar at which a pretty young blonde in a feminine version of the everpresent commando uniform presided there were two more guards at their ease here and three civiliandressed boredlooking men all carrying very ordinarylooking attache cases the ceiling was only partially roofed and the double cables which were attached by heavy links of chain to the floor extended through the opening in only moments a cable car came sliding into the room and descended into the slot built for it into the floor one of the guards went forward and unlocked its door two passengers emerged one a tall welldressed black carrying a very large briefcase the other an efficientlooking middleaged woman who looked spanish or italian they headed for a door other than the one frank and colin had utilized the three other men one an oriental entered the cable car frank and his guide got in too the car was rectangular with rounded corners and modest windows by the looks of them none of the windows could be opened and frank suspected that the glass was bulletproof as frank took a seat the guard outside locked the door and they took off with a slight lurch climbing at a sharp angle though the swaying gondola remained horizontal frank stared out a window in fascination beneath them were scrubby hardy trees and massive jagged boulders occasionally with wiry grass from time to time he could spot a zigzag trail ascending the hill it looked as though it hadnt been used for years and from time to time there were indications that it had once been wider perhaps a narrow road in the distance were spectacular snowtopped alps he looked over at colin and said scowling puzzlement you mean that this cable car is the only access to the uh schloss surely it cant be supplied from a gondola of course not the other grunted the guide was slumped back in his seat not bothering to look out he had obviously made the trip many a time in ten minutes the cable car swung into an aperture again and settled on its skids into another slot frank could see through the windows only a small portion of huge castle wall partially brick partially massive stone before they passed into the interior a guard unlocked the door and all issued forth the three other passengers hustled off they left the waiting room of the terminal by one door and colin led frank through another the steel room into which frank was ushered was similar to that below but not identical for one thing there were ports in one of the walls which evidently overlooked the cable car ascent before each of them was mounted heavy weapons of a design frank had never seen before even in films there were six guards on duty here and once again two officers their shoulder tabs looked more impressive than those the two below had worn he went through much the same procedure as before he was electronically searched and his credit card was checked out then handed back to him righto corporal the bored officer said youre cleared for the donjon yes sir colin said saluting in the offhand manner that seemed to apply to these professionals this part of the castle had been reconstructed recently on the other side of the metal door through which they exited was a modem though militarily barren corridor which couldnt possibly have dated back to medieval times it extended only fifty feet or so before they were confronted by another heavy portal which automatically opened for them onto a vista which made frank gasp before him lay an immense area more like a park than the courtyard of a looming fortress a park devoted largely to sports from where they entered frank could see an enormous swimming pool at the far end with scores of bathers both men and women enjoying the place nearer were a dozen tennis courts also well patronized and nearer still a fairly goodsized putting green largely patronized by older types there were also practice courts for basketball and jai alai between them were pleasant walks extensive lawns neat as a golf green fountains and gardens spotted here and there to the right however was also a copter landing pad and on it two aircraft one a heavy cargo carrier the other a fighter weapons protruding from apertures frank realized then what his guide had meant when hed answered that the cable car wasnt the only manner of supplying the wolfschloss one had to look about the walls the battlements the projecting turrets the round towers at the corners of the walls with their conical tops to realize that this was indeed the interior of a castle centuries old not bad eh colin said the graf must have spent a mint doing the enceinte up like this he led the way enceinte frank said the ward the other told him the open area inside the walls it came to frank that the wolfschloss must house the population of a small town the buildings snuggled up against the heavy stone walls were sufficient to provide all the needs of thousands the closer frank looked the less medieval it seemed he could make out antiaircraft guns missile launchers mortars and machine guns he said with a touch of sarcasm one small nuke and thats the end of the whole works colin looked over at him as they walked straight down about half a mile are the bomb shelters youre as safe here as youd be in the octagon in greater washington id hate to dig myself out afterwards you wouldnt have to there are tunnels leading off to exits more than a mile away the wolfschloss couldnt take a fusion bomb maybe but it could take a helluva lot where are we going frank said to the donjon whats a donjon the keep that tells me a lot in the old days it was the final defense it was where deathwish world igj everybody retreated when the walls were breached now the graf and his staff live there frank could see the keep the highest and the largest of the towers it was a castle within a castle and must have been one hell of a disappointment to come up against in the days when you had nothing more than a crossbow sword and battleaxe he was apprehensive about what was to come in his confrontation with peter windsor the grafs front man one thing was certain there was no line of retreat for him if something went wrong there was no possible way for him to get out of the wolfschloss even if he had been armed chapter fifteen the graf as frank and his guide drew nearer to the keep its true size became ever more impressive by the time they drew up to its sole entrance he realized that it was as large as some apartment buildings before the entry were stationed four uniformed guards and an officer gone was the easygoing air frank had come to associate with the mercenaries of the graf these five were alert and efficient colin came to attention and saluted the officer who responded just as snappily and then eyed frank franklin pinell sir colin said crisply on appointment to see mr windsor your identification sir the officer said holding out his hand frank gave him his card at this rate the thing would be worn out before too long the other examined it carefully returned it saluted frank with the same snappiness and said youre expected sir the ancient medieval door had long since been superseded by a massive steel one built into one side of it was a smaller door just wide enough so that two persons could have walked in side by side it now slid open colin said to frank this is as far as i go mr pinell im not cleared for the donjon good luck frank went through the door and was again surprised as he had been by the parklike effect of the enceinte the basic medieval aspects of the keep had been retained the stone walls and narrow apertures were still there the floors were still flagstone otherwise the ground floor of the keep seemed an ultramodern office building there were a score or so office workers in the lobby walking briskly here or there papers in hand they ranged in age from franks early twenties to sixty or more but most both men and women were on the youthful side some were uniformed some not frank approached the first of the desks mildly surprised that it wasnt automated behind it sat a sharplooking young blonde who would have done the reception room of the largest multinational corporation in manhattan proud she smiled encouragingly frank said franklin pinell to see mr peter windsor your identification please she took his card put it into a desk slot and scanned the screen before her she returned it to him and said perkily youre expected sir elevator one the three elevators were numbered in gold number one seemed somewhat more ornate than the others frank stepped in there was no order screen nor any other manner that he could see of activating the compartment he shrugged the door closed and started upward and continued upward it would seem that mr peter windsor was officed in the higher reaches of the keep eventually it came to a halt and he emerged into an office containing four desks and four very busy workers it was quite the swankest office frank had ever been in including that of ram panikkar in tangier it was difficult to realize that he was in the nerve center of a castle going back to the days of richard the lionhearted one of the clerks got up from her swivel chair and came toward him briskly smiling in the same pert manner as the receptionist below she was dressed in what frank thought must be the latest from paris she said brightly fraulein krebs is expecting you mr pinell if youll just come this way he said i was to see peter windsor yes sir she said leading him across the room to a door which was lettered margit krebs in gold evidently he was going to see fraulein krebs whether he liked it or not the identity screen picked them up and the door swung open the girl said mr pinell and stepped back the office inside was luxurious to a point that frank had never witnessed even in the most lavish tridi shows withal it managed to project a touch of femininity it could never have been taken for a mans room above all it radiated wealth frank was no art expert but recognized impressionist paintings when he saw them there were two on the walls he had no doubt whatever that they were originals behind one desk sat a serious studiouslooking young man and a woman of say thirtyfive behind the other her strikingly handsome face was difficult to estimate she had beautifully dark hair wore tweeds that couldnt disguise a very good figure and her smile was efficient but her eyes those eyes had a predatory look as they ran up and down frank taking in his face his frame he had a feeling new to him it was usually the man who looked at a woman in such a way as to mentally undress her estimate her capabilities in bed now he felt as though positions were reversed did fraulein krebs do this to every man she met she said franklin pinell even as she rounded her desk and came toward him with her hand outstretched weve been looking forward to meeting you he shook and murmured some amenity wondering who in the hell we could be why in the world would a bigshot in mercenaries incorporated want to see him surely there wouldnt be anyone in the organization lower on the totem pole than frank pinell he had been astonished at the reception he had been getting all the way from vaduz to here the inner reaches of the keep margit krebs said crisply that will be all kurt the young man at the desk stood clicked his heels and said ja fraulein krebs and left when he was gone margit said leaning her buttocks back against her desk and what do you think of the wolfschloss he managed a small grin and said flabbergasted i had no idea of the size of these european castles nor the excellent condition some of them are in she nodded at that and smiled theyre not all so large of course and lothar spent a considerable sum in renovating this one like i said im flabbergasted how many people live here it varies from day to day but right now there are counting you six left yesterday on assignments but four others returned he blinked at her she laughed and said i have total recall which is one of the reasons i am lothars secretary you see some items involving mercenaries incorporated cant be written down with me on hand lothar doesnt need written records of such items the records are in my head lothar she cocked her head a bit to one side lothar von brandenburg the graf oh he cleared his throat actually ms krebs i was instructed to see mr windsor im not sure why margit she told him in the inner circles were informal ill take you to peter right now hes expecting you and is rather on the curious side she turned and headed for a door opposite the one by which he had entered for a moment he looked at her blankly inner circles was the competent efficient handsome fraulein krebs suggesting that frank pinell belonged to the inner circles of mercenaries incorporated she obviously had made some mistake but how could anybody as sharp as the secretary of the graf be that far off and why should the notorious peter windsor be curious about meeting frank pinell he shook his head and followed her they went down a short corridor and without knocking she pushed open a door and strode in briskly more hesitantly frank followed the office beyond was almost identical to that of fraulein krebs in size but there was only one desk and the feminine element was missing the wall decorations were of a military nature including paintings of war scenes and a flag which was holed in various places by what looked suspiciously like gunfire and including a submachine gun which was racked in the manner that sportsmen display their shotguns or rifles behind a somewhat battered and littered desk sprawled a lanky man a report of some kind in his hand he wore tennis shoes without socks khaki walking shorts and a khaki shirt its sleeves rolled up franks first snap judgment was that the other couldnt be much older than himself but later realized on seeing the wrinkles at the side of the eyes that peter windsor projected an air of youth that wasnt there he was almost twice franks age margit said briskly this is frank peter ill check with lothar she turned and left sit down dear boy windsor said and then as frank was doing so yes i can see the resemblance you could only be the son of buck pinell frank said you knew my father not too well really saw him off and on for a few months id imagine i dont think that he really fancied me if the truth be known i didnt know him much myself i was too young and he was away most of the time what was he like the other thought about it sending his limegreen eyes ceilingward he murmured finally slowly a sort of dashing chap he liked combat i shouldnt wonder some men do you know they live for the excitement he liked nothing so much as to find what he considered a just cause and then fight for it he didnt mind making a profit at the same time but for him the enjoyment was in the combat for myself and for the graf i think it has always been purely business buck fought for causes we for money he wasnt really cut out to be a soldier of fortune you know how do you mean from what ive come to understand he was a mercenary the englishman nodded he was a soldier but i fancy that the fortune part of it wasnt of uppermost interest frank didnt know if he quite understood that or not the other put down the report hed been perusing took up another and rapidly scanned it he said and how did the boris rivas affair come off last night exactly as you had it set up everybody close to the colonel had been bought even the concierge at his hotel and his longtime bodyguard poor bastard never had a chance peter windsor said coldly never give an opponent a chance if you can avoid it pinell take every opening you can every advantage in that manner youll live longer rivas had his chance he was a bloody fool for not coming in with us there was no use mucking around with him when he refused frank said i suppose that senegelese sergeant of his will get a good position with mercenaries incorporated now peter windsor shook his head at him no hell be paid the amount promised and sent on his way if hed betray rivas how can we be sure that he wouldnt betray us given the opportunity the graf never welches on his commitments but on the other hand he demands loyalty frank said very evenly how did the ethical code apply to me i was to be sent on an impossible mission its unlikely that i could have escaped the englishman shook his head again at the time dear boy you werent actually a member of the organization in the same sense that our exuberant nat fraser or colonel ram panikkar are however you were offered a sizeable sum a hundred thousand pseudodollars desposited to your account in the bahamas before you were to leave for central africa upon the success of your mission you were to make your escape and enjoy the amount in whatever manner you saw fit very well where was the betrayal if you accomplished your assignment your pay was awaiting you frank said softly the colonel told me there was to be a chopper available for me to escape in not that i was to be on my own peter windsor raised eyebrows and said he did he wasnt authorized to make such a pledge ive always thought panikkar a bit of a swine ill have to take this up with him it wouldnt do for the chiefs reputation to have such items bandied about there was a faint humming at one of the desk screens and peter swung his feet down to the floor thats the graf now come along frank frank stood and as he did so his eyes came upon the racked submachine gun a keepsake from the old days he said the englishman said dryly i havent used it for some years but its still kept loaded he led the way strolling casually out a rear door and down a short empty hallway to an elaborate double door the screen on it picked him up and half the door opened they entered the grafs informal office was impressive so was the graf he stood at the ceilingtofloor window which framed the rhine and its valley his hands in the coat pockets of his immaculate business suit he was staring out his face characteristically expressionless on their entry the shortstatured graf turned and for a long moment stared at frank frank feeling uncomfortable came to a halt and simply remained on the spot the spry old soldier approached and looked him in the face with open candor the american was taken aback by the smoky grayflecked irises of the others eyes and more so when lothar von brandenburg put his womanishly small hands on his shoulders the graf sighed and said yes you could only be bucks son youre buck as i first knew him many years ago when we were both ah callow youngsters he turned to one of the oversized couches and lowered himself saying sit down franklin peter windsor cleared his throat and slumped into one of the chairs crossing long legs nonchalantly he said he does look like buck at that i told him so frank found a place and joined them still without the vaguest idea what he was doing here the graf said we were somewhat surprised when your arrival in tangier was reported there was no point in pussyfooting around frank had already decided there was no retreat he said i couldnt have been much of a surprise it was already set up i suspect that the two iabi men were in on it possibly even judge worthington back in the states certainly the cab driver and the two muggers in the medina in tangier first came nat fraser as implausible a knight in armor as ever came down the pike he took me to your colonel panikkar who lavished good will on me supposedly putting me deeply into his debt he gave me strong arguments for taking an assignment for you i might look young and ah callow as you put it but im not as much a fool as all that it was a suicide project actually i wouldnt have taken it but panikkar didnt know that i played along just to see what the hell was going on but it was called off from your end before i ever turned it down whats got me wondering is why the graf remained silent through all that now he nodded peter windsor said because we discovered that you were the son of buck pinell dear boy frank hadnt taken his eyes from the graf he said boris rivas claimed you might have been the cause of the death of my father the old man nodded again then for once rivas spoke the truth i was the cause of your fathers death franklin frank stared at him the graf said it was my fault but i did not kill him franklin your father died in my arms after saving my life he sacrificed himself to rescue me he was my best friend and i his i have not had many friends in this life franklin his last words were to put your life in my care the young american took long moments to assimilate that finally he took a deep breath and said you didnt seem to do much in the way of carrying out his request the graf said it was taken out of my hands your mother was fanatically against me and all i stood for she had been violently against your fathers ah profession when my representative approached her she absolutely refused to allow me to participate in your raising she refused to accept any of your fathers extensive earnings as she had always refused while he was still alive the relationship between your father and mother was not a close one franklin she was contemptuous of him she only continued to allow him to visit occasionally because he was your father and you loved him your mother was a good and compassionate woman with whom buck pinell was deeply in love she refused to marry him though he wished it their affair ended when she discovered your fathers way of life but my mother is dead now the grafs usually expressionless face registered surprise i didnt know that i should have kept a closer check on you as the years have gone by but still i hadnt wished to interfere with your mothers plans for your education and upbringing it was the only thing for which she would draw upon your fathers accumulated fortune and even then frugally i had planned to make contact with you upon its completion its completed now frank said flatly i see and the employment computers didnt select you for a position in whatever field you had selected thats correct in any of the fields i selected why not the graf said bluntly because there are jobs in our economy for only about five percent of the population but the fault is largely mine i switched subjects too often i started in aviation but after a few years i could see that it was becoming so highly automated that there were going to be practically no positions available so i switched to space and spent a few years cramming so that i might be chosen to go to lagrange five or the asteroid belt but then the government began cutting back drastically on new space expenditures so drastically that it was all but impossible to get out to the space islands so then very well i can see your problem so when you finished your schooling you were unable to find employment actually ive never quite finished it though it became more difficult after my mothers death and my source of income was cut off she never gave me access to my fathers resources hating them as she did im not even sure that she could have i dont know what the legal arrangements were since then ive largely been on gas however ive held a few small jobs out of the ken of the computers in between i continued my studies as best i could the graf leaned back in the couch you might consider a position in my organization franklin peter windsor had been listening his eyebrows a little high obviously much of this was new to him but he learned best by listening frank pinell who had been gaining confidence over the past fifteen minutes shook his head at the old mercenarys words he said i have certain reservations nat fraser and colonel panikkar gave me a rundown on the position you assume on the things you do in your uh organization however i suspect that toward the end at least my father might have had some of the same reservations what did they call him the lee christmas of the st century ive read a little about lee christmas i wonder if he ever went in for outright political assassination possibly not i checked on this early american mercenary after fraulein krebs gave me a bit of his background the other day he was an uncouth uneducated man a railroad worker i understand before becoming a soldier of fortune undoubtedly he had the usual prejudices of his time and his upbringing the grafs voice was becoming a bit impatient see here franklin you must realize that mankind accepts the fact of killing his fellow man under acceptable circumstances what are acceptable circumstances is the bone of contention even the assassin can become a hero given circumstances let us take a few examples from the history of your own very aggressive nation davy crockett jim bowie and colonel travis heroes of the alamo were not texans they were american adventurers mercenaries the alamo was not garrisoned by texans it was garrisoned by men of many nations sent to that part of mexico to seek their fortunes with their guns the flag that flew over the alamo was that of a troop of new orleans volunteers how many true texans were there i do not know but certainly crockett was not one of them he had been a representative in congress from tennessee i didnt know that frank murmured the graf went on a group of american mercenaries during the first world war formed the lafayette escadrille a pursuit squadron in the french air force by american law this should have deprived them of american citizenship instead as soon as the united states entered the conflict they became heroes and their squadron became part of the american forces the flying tigers who fought as mercenaries under chiang kaishek against the japanese before pearl harbor these men were all highly trained pilots from american army navy and air force schools and they flew the latest in american fighters they were paid for each plane they shot down with american money funnelled to china but they were mercenaries and became american heroes instead of losing their citizenship so much for mercenaries let us consider assassins suppose that in my own country the general staff had been successful in assassinating hitler would they not now be heroes the young american was unhappy he said panikkar and nat fraser gave me similar arguments they didnt convince me peter windsor said lets face reality man kills his fellow man for profit dont you know take the owner of a colliery the mine is unsafe because he has ignored expensive safety devices it caves in and fifty of his miners are buried alive indirectly he has killed them for profit is he ever brought to trial i fancy not he is a pillar of the community the graf said but enough of this for now you must be reynolds with dean ing tired franklin well meet for dinner no need for you to make a decision at this time evidently he had signalled somehow since sepp the liveried butler materialized bitte herr graf he said bowing sepp the elderly mercenary said this is mr franklin pinell see him to his suite i suppose his bags have been delivered by now and see that he is assigned a valet ja herr graf sepp turned to frank mr pinell frank nodded at peter windsor came to his feet and followed the stonefaced servant out a side door in the medieval stone corridor along which frank followed sepp the elderly servitor said politely if i may say so sir you resemble your father remarkably so everybodys been telling me you knew my father i had the honor to serve with him in two campaigns sir sepp said his voice politely inflectionless before i lost my leg involuntarily frank glanced down and now noticed that the servant limped lightly frank said i had gathered that the graf made a policy of granting suitable compensations for his wounded men shouldnt you be living in comfortable retirement somewhere well yes sir but you see i am wanted by both interpol and the american labi i am safe here that you are frank smiled from what ive seen of it this castle has many attributes of a resort shouldnt you be able to retire right here they had reached a heavy wooden door and for a moment the servant stood with his hand on the knob for the first time frank saw a slight expression on the others usually immobile face it was ruefulness he said i suppose so sir however the herr graf is used to my service and besides it is of interest to be here in the center of things he opened the door and they stepped inside franks luggage lay in the living rooms center the suite was spacious an extensive living room with ornate wooden furniture a bedroom with an enormous canopied bed a large bath and what frank assumed was a small study he was again surprised at the art of whatever interior decorater had redesigned the donjon of the wolfschloss the man had been a genius in merging the old and new that the rooms were those of a dark ages castle was obvious but they were modern in the best sense of comfort that they had once been cold damp and grim could easily be imagined but not with the modern conveniences added the suite was absolutely palatial it is satisfactory sir sepp said with polite anxiety at this height in the keep it had undoubtedly never been necessary to continue the narrow bowmens apertures that prevailed on the lower levels the windows were spacious and looked out on a picturesque setting of alps glaciers streams and the upper reaches of the rhine frank shook his head its a beautiful suite sepp what was this about a valet ill assign you helmut sir a very reliable servant what do i need him for the old soldierturnedbutler seemed a touch surprised why sir hell do for you something like a batman an orderly sir frank sighed it would be an advantage to have somebody who could show him the ropes he didnt even know his way around the corridors he said all right but tell him the less i see of him the better sir helmut will never intrude unless summoned is there anything else sir frank looked around there was even a heavy wooden bar which looked handcarved set up against one wall i suppose not he said thanks sepp not at all sir i was always a great admirer of your father sir in the fracas in which i lost my leg he carried me over a kilometer through enemy fire to the nearest field hospital he coughed before adding although he was wounded himself frank couldnt think of anything to say to that and the ramroderect old man turned to leave when he reached the door and was about to open it he hesitated momentarily then half turned and said dont trust any of them mr pinell chapter sixteen frank pinell in the grafs informal office lothar von brandenburg was saying to his aide what do you think of him peter peter said slowly frank seems a straightspeaking young man adequate education all that sort of thing the graf looked at him you seem to have reservations well not really but you seem to accept him rather wholeheartedly he is frightfully young to be taken into our inner circles the older man gave one of his rare gray smiles without humor he is older than you were when i first met you peter the englishman waggled a hand in rejection perhaps we went to different schools we shall sound him out further at dinner but meanwhile i am quite impressed the graf told him ram panikkar and that australian fellow didnt hoodwink him for a moment meanwhile let us be about the days developments where is margit it wasnt a question that needed an answer margit entered immediately obviously having been summoned she said briskly lothar peter and took her chair peter said theres one item chief on which we should get cracking this roy cos who signed a standard deathwish policy in nassau the wobbly organizer yes of course i thought we notified cellini in new york to put a couple of top men on him jolly well windsor said in disgust but our mr cos is still with us and brettjames who sold the contract is screaming like a chap with the blue spiders cos and his business manager a forrest brown are spending money like autumn leaves on the wind ordinarily the poor bloody clods who sign these contracts have neither the imagination to spend a fraction of their million pseudodollars a day available nor to avoid our people they usually go on a drunken womanchasing binge in some expensive resort they take the most posh suites and they buy dear god do they buy the graf eyed him in incomprehension but what does this cos fellow do hes spending right up to the hilt each day on prime tridi time for his lectures hes also renting huge auditoriums for his rallies and hiring a large staff of bodyguards and aides such as publicity men and speech writers margit said cant he be reached through bodyguards or other employees windsor shook his head not so far we had a publicity man lined up but he was discovered the bodyguards are all trusted wobblies and the attempts to bribe them into defecting have all met with violence but thats not the only difficulty his message is beginning to get over for a century and a half the few radicals of the united states have been a laughingstock nobody bothered to listen to their demands for fundamental changes dont you know but now the proles caught up in the emotion of his plight are beginning to consider his program ive heard from two members of the central committee of the world club this man is a potential danger to the overall program they demand that he be liquidated posthaste the graf said notify cellini to drop all else and concentrate on this man why cant he be picked off by a sniper from a distance because wherever he goes there are mobs around him not just bodyguards there are eight of them now but his staff and thousands of gawking curiosity seekers most of them at least partially in his favor a hit man cant get near him without running into considerable danger and from a distance there are so many people about him that a man with a rifle cant get a clear bead on the sod the graf said impatiently that is for cellini to solve peter and that brings up the matter of the world club how did the operation against harold dunninger work out completely as planned a really good show nils ostrander deserves a bit of a bonus the mercenary head looked at his secretary refresh me on the details fraulein margits eyes went vague she recited harold dunninger international tycoon candidate member of the central committee of the world club and until his recent death considered most likely to be admitted to the central committee upon the retirement of grace cabothudson he belonged to the socalled liberal element in the central committee which includes such people as jeremiah auburn fong hui and mendel amschel who wish to see the forming of a world state based on more democratic principles than most the liberal element is opposed by such members as harrington chase john warfield moyer and the committees secretary sheila duffroberts also of course by such candidate members as the prophet of the united church and yourself it became necessary that harold dunninger be eliminated to increase your chances of being nominated a full member of the committee obviously it could not be handled in the usual manner or suspicion would immediately fall upon mercenaries incorporated so our mole in the nihilists was instructed to kidnap dunninger and hold him for a ransom of fifty million pseudodollars with his life forfeit if the ransom was not paid the graf interrupted speaking to peter windsor suppose he had paid the ransom then the nihilists would have had no escuse to execute him peter yawned and said we looked into it thoroughly he was on the outs with his wife dont you know and she was in control of his interests in his absence we were quite certain that she would never pay such a sum she didnt hes dead and the killing laid at the doorstep of the nihilists the graf thought about it and finally nodded in agreement very well i understand that the central committee is in session in rome you will go there as my deputy peter and exert what pressure you can to have me entered as a full member into the committee i assume that your strongest competitor for the honor will be the prophet windsor said thoughtfully dont you think it would be better chief if you went yourself youve been a candidate member for years but none of the committee have ever met you youd throw more weight if you attended i shouldnt wonder the graf grunted contempt of that opinion peter i have not left the wolfschloss for twenty years the last time i did three separate attempts were made on my life the last nearly succeeded no ill stay here keep in mind that the prophet will also be represented by a deputy he has no intention of permitting a rumor that he is so worldly as to belong to the world club is there anything else peter said one other item that ordinarily i wouldnt bother you with a black named horace hampton who seems ah an enigma he is an active member of the antiracist league in america and indications are that he will soon be raised to membership in their national executive committee this antiracist league has come under the scrutiny of the world club so long as they were confined to north america alone they could be largely ignored but with the central committee about to take steps to expand the united states of the americas these militant antiracists take on a new posture how do you mean the graf said impatiently the next step in the erecting of a world state is to invite australia and new zealand to join the unitui states of the americas the computers conclude that if invited they will join perhaps great britain and ireland will be next in all four countries there are few minorities so the antiracists are no difficulty however offering membership to still other nations poses a problem suppose india is approached if the antiracist league were to infiltrate and influence india her votes would swamp the new united states of the world what has all this got to do with horace hampton he is one of the more intelligent and aggressive members of the league sheila duffroberts has given us a contract on this mystery man i strongly suspect that the national data banks have been corrupted to the point of his dossier being a fake margit said musingly it isnt the easiest thing in the world to infiltrate the american national data banks no it bloody well isnt peter said and it seems unlikely that an organization as short of funds as this league could do it the graf said so we have a contract on the man very well have it executed peter looked at him chief it occurs to me that we might send young pinell to deal with this beggar the older mans eyes narrowed why because the boys inexperienced youve obviously got plans for him very well he handled himself well on the rivas assignment to the extent that he was needed at all but it would seem to me that he needs a bit more blooding no particular hurry but it will give him an opportunity to learn something about the organization hed have to work through our local representatives in the states of course ill consider the matter said the graf very well if thats all ill see you tonight at dinner dismissed margit krebs and peter windsor came to their feet and headed for the door in the corridor as they headed for their own offices margit looked up at the rangy englishman she said softly you didnt mention to lothar that this horace hampton is considered the most efficient field man in the antiracist league and very dangerous as compared to our frank he said if you thought so why didnt you say something to the chief to that effect possibly just to find out what youre up to peter dear she eyed him mockingly you couldnt be getting second thoughts about buck pinelfs son could you peter for years now youve been second man in mercenaries incorporated undoubtedly youve expected to take over when the graf either retires or dies whos better suited to take over the reins but lothars in a position to turn over the whole organization to this stripling if he did an outfit that has taken half a century to build could go down the spout overnight then where would you and i be margit old thing she reached the door of her office and stood there for a moment considering it how do you stand he demanded i dont know she said evasivelyperhaps youre overestimating lothars acceptance of frank perhaps he grunted and went on she looked after him and thought to herself peter is beginning to wonder if the graf isnt getting too old for the job perhaps a touch of senility id hate to be in the crossfire if it came to a showdown margit my girl youd better start considering on what side of your own bread the butter is on dinner that night was another revelation to frank pinell in a day that had been full of them the baronial hall in which it was held was one flight up in the keep from the offices and suites the whole floor was evidently devoted to the grafs living quarters frank had entered the palatial living room attired in the dark suit which helmut his newly appointed valet had laid out for him there hadnt been much of a choice he had bought two suits in paris on nat frasers suggestion and several pairs of shoes all the clothing he had brought with him from america he had discarded also at frasers suggestion but now he realized that he had made a mistake the graf peter windsor and margit krebs were all in evening wear margit looked stunning and ten years younger in a simple black silk affair that brought out the pale perfection of her scandinavian skin she wore but one item of jewelry a matched string of pearls whose deep pink luster was obvious from across the room the three were seated about a cocktail table sipping drinks and chatting as frank came in the graf looked up and frowned but then said please give us the pleasure of your company franklin sit down the graf added smoothly we always dress for dinner franklin but i assume your travel clothing is limited frank said ive never worn so much as a tuxedo not to speak of tails you dont when youre on gas you know forgive me it skipped my mind that you didnt inherit your fathers fortune yes sepp the butler leaned forward slightly and spoke to his master in german ah the mercenary grunted dinner is served margit with his secretary on his arm followed by peter windsor and frank he passed through the double doors into the dining room compared to the refurbishing of the rest of the keep the dining hall had hardly been touched by the genius of an interior decorator frank could well imagine the old days when some longdead duke princeling or archbishop had held forth here his closest henchmen would be present with their women wassailing about a huge round table while minstrels and clowns provided medieval entertainment as scurrying servants brought on heaping platters of food and huge mugs with foaming beer mulled wine or subtle mead the table however was considerably smaller than that which must have prevailed in the old days it would have seated eight at most the setting was on the awesome side so far as frank was concerned he had never eaten with more cutlery than knife fork and spoon never eaten by candlelight and most certainly had never eaten off gold the graf sat at one end of the table margit at the other and peter and frank across from each other it came to frank that peter windsor was a changed man in evening dress after his informal sports garb of the day now he looked as though he had been bom to wear formal evening attire a matinee idol couldnt have been more at ease in it sepp presided with two footmen also in livery behind each chair no more than two sips were taken from a wine glass before it was instantly refilled it was all on the thick side so far as frank pinell was concerned it got thicker as the meal progressed he recognized exactly two of the dishes presented or at least the ingredients one was a potato dish which would have been hard to miss and one a delightful scallopbased fish course he made the mistake of commenting on the scallops ah the graf said pleased you mean the coquilles saint jacques parisienne it is one of alberts specialities he will be overjoyed to know you approve peter said after sipping at his chablis albert is one of the three best chefs in common europe frank its a privilege to eat from his kitchen i should think frank said you mean to tell me that one of the best three cooks in europe works here for just the three of you id think he could get a job in any restaurant in the world the four of us now his host said magnanimously fortunately albert is in no position to tender his resignation margit said dryly liechtenstein is somewhat like tangier in that there are no extradition laws and since albert made the mistake of killing his wife he sees fit to remain as lothars chef poisoned her to be exact peter said blandly frank looked down at the morsel of scallop on his fork and closed his eyes in sorrow there were eight courses in all with eight wines winding up with a dessert which margit told him was nesselrode pudding with sabayon fruit served with a slightly chilled sauterne largely the dinner conversation consisted of the graf expounding on his dreams and turning on what small charm he boasted in order to win the younger man over both margit and peter seemed surprised at the extent to which he revealed top secrets of the innermost circle of mercenaries incorporated it would seem that lothar von brandenburg was most certainly now considering frank to be a member of that circle in which case it was the most rapid promotion the organization had ever seen all of the servants save sepp spoke nothing but german and the table conversation was in english the graf had said you are acquainted with the world club franklin while still on the oxtail soup just slightly frank said isnt it an organization of economists philanthropists and international dogooders seeking solutions to worldwide problems that is the facade we present to the man in the street the other said satisfaction in his voice we frank said mercenaries incorporated is represented in the highest echelons of the world club that surprises me i pictured the organization as a group of oldtimers with more credits than they know what to do with supporting a lot of foundations peter windsor gave a snort of amusement the graf said i expect within a short time to be nominated to the central committee which consists of but ten members and has the ultimate say in all of the world clubs policies i didnt even know they had a central committee frank admitted youre not supposed to dear boy peter said the graf shot him an impatient look before turning back to frank he said the real goal of the world club franklin is world government a world that has become one under the aegis of the club obviously such a united world will no longer have wars and frank interrupted but then what would happen to mercenaries incorporated it seems to me that your organization depends upon a multitude of antagonistic nations you should be supporting nationalism not trying to do away with it the graf smiled his gray smile its a farseeing man who is able to accommodate inevitable changes franklin sooner or later there will be world government when it comes about i wish to be part of its direction not a leftover from the past this new world government will still have police still have armed forces frank interrupted again why armed forces the old mercenary nodded at the question to keep the peace contrary to popular belief the first need a state has for an armed force is not to fight foreign enemies but the potential enemy within as an example take latin america before it amalgamated with the united states they spent billions annually building up then armed forces though there hadnt been a major war in south america for a century and a half those arms were to keep their own people in subjection so in the future armed forces will still exist i will be at their head frank looked at him in open skepticism margit said the first steps have already been taken frank the formation of the united states of the americas the world club is already secretly agitating in australia and new zealand for them to apply for admission into the united states for a long time now those countries have been closer to america than to england and the rest of common europe frank looked over at her candlelight did nothing to detract from the charms of margit krebs she flashed sloe eyes at him aware of their impact he made a mental note of her obvious availability then turned back to his host if the united states of the americas eventually becomes a united states of the world wouldnt the iabi become the international police force the graf waved that aside saying its true that john warfield moyer a member of the central committee foresees a united world in which his iabi will be the sole police force but his organization has been a farce since before the fbi and the cia were joined together an organization of clowns headed by clowns compared to my own moyer will be taken care of in good time frank thought about it he said slowly then youre in the process of phasing out your mercenary activities in expectation of becoming legal under this new world regime thats one way of putting it peter said lothar von brandenburg said you are beginning to have second thoughts about my organization frank perhaps what about these assassinations though such as the mahdi the only thing that will make sense under a world government is a state religion the united church under the prophet backs the world club the fanatic who calls himself the mahdi stands in the way of the amalgamation into one of all the worlds religions im afraid he must go others too of course always remember franklin that a comparatively few key figures can change history the example of somerset maugham comes to mind in his earlier years while working for british espionage he was sent to petrograd to sabotage the bolshevik revolution he wrote later that if he had been sent two weeks earlier he might have accomplished his task and the revolution would never have taken place how would he have done this he probably had in mind the assassinations of lenin and trotsky and perhaps of a few others of the old bolsheviks the american said grudgingly i suppose in some respects youve made your point under some circumstances assassination can be called for but what happens when someone approaches you with a proposal to kill someone who doesnt deserve killing the graf raised his eyebrows he put down his glass of wine my dear franklin we are pragmatists not mad dogs our interests are not only money suppose for instance that mercenaries incorporated was approached by an enemy of the prophet as i told you we support the united church in its efforts to join all organized religions into a single worldwide state church ending once and for all conflicts between faiths very well not only would we refuse the contract but we would inform ezra hawkins the prophet about this foe of his so that he could take steps to protect himself by hiring mercenaries incorporated to eliminate the enemy frank said peter windsor chuckled youre catching on dear boy following dinner they sat for a time in the living room over coffee and cognac the talk drifted in deference to frank to stories involving his father the graf carried most of the conversation since his relationship with buck pinell had extended over years but peter windsor was also able to contribute a few anecdotes most of the stories were of a humorous nature and it came to frank that combat veterans seldom talked much about actual combat itself when it was shop talk yes something involving business at hand but not as light conversation perhaps amateurs might brag of their exploits under fire but professionals no and you couldnt get much more professional than lothar von brandenburg and peter windsor when the party broke up margit offered to conduct frank back to his suite the winding corridors and stone stairways of the keep took some learning and under the influence of the wines during the meal and the generous brandies following it frank wasnt sure he could find his way unaided the graf looked tolerant peter amused as they said their goodnights on the morrow frank was to be assigned a guide to show him the wolfschloss in detail as they strolled along the stone corridor frank decided that nicety wasnt called for he said your rooms or mine she looked up at him from the side of her eyes i thought youd never ask yours you might never find your way bck to your own suite in the morning and that was the full extent of their courting then preliminary love play margit was a businesslike woman in her sex life as well as her secretarial work in fact she was as straightforward a woman as he had ever bedded and at his age frank had seldom gone without horizontal refreshments when he had desired them in his bedroom she had stripped with flattering haste and had pirouetted exactly once to show off the womans body saying like me before sliding into the emperorsized canopied bed his voice was on the thick side as he told her yes climbing out of his own clothes good heavens she said teasing him is that for me yes he said hoarsely already rampant not for margit krebs were new variations of the worlds oldest theme she took her sex straight and lustily somewhat surprising frank who had expected unique desires on the part of this sophisticated wanton perhaps that would come later he decided as he performed for her for the present his lady wanted immediate basic action and wanted it again within minutes after they had both reached rapturous climax he began to wonder if he had known what he was getting into so to speak later as they rested both staring up at the rich creamcolored canopy above he said only partly in humor and what is a nice girl like you doing in this kind of work she followed along whats the classic answer to that just lucky i guess come on come on on the face of it youre the junior member of the staff that runs the toughest organization on earth why would a woman like you want to hold down such a job with your obvious ability you could get top positions anywhere so why be the notorious grafs secretary she looked at him strangely its where the power is i dont understand the graf is the single most powerful man in the world darling not the wealthiest not the one with the most political clout but the most powerful others may not always realize that but he is why because he holds the life of every other living person in the palm of his hand he thought about that for a long moment before saying but thats him not you the graf doesnt operate in a vacuum she told him patiently there is no such thing as a oneman dictatorship hitler stalin mussolini mao were the heads of teams without the team around them they wouldnt have been able to cope the same with napoleon and alexander the great alexander would have been nothing but a headstrong alcoholic youth had it not been for nearchus parmenion and other leaders trained by his father philip true enough the empire broke up upon his death when the team started fighting among themselves but while they were still a team with him at the head they were invincible so it is with the graf he does not stand alone making all decisions he has a team im part of the team you might be too that quieted him she said a quirk of amusement there i should warn you about lothar i think perhaps hes getting a bit tired of peter who isnt quite as young and pinkcheeks as he used to be that came as a surprise you mean hes gay she laughed what is your old american expression hes as queer as chicken shit not my cup of tea he said gruffly youve already proven that darling though i do hope that youre up to proving it again she reached over to stroke him intimately frank said wizard but hold it for just a little eh you mean that literally she said wickedness in her voice youre a sexpot did anyone ever tell you that yes he frowned again and said what ever happened to my fathers estate from what you people say he must have been a partner for something like twenty years when he died my mother refused to take anything except enough to educate me on what happened to the rest why i dont know darling she frowned as well and i should know im supposed to know everything connected with mercenaries incorporated chapter seventeen lee garrett when lee garrett reported to the office of sheila duffroberts early in the morning of the day after she had arrived it was to find the amazonlike secretary of the central committee of the world club already deep in work a cigarette half an ash dangled from the side of her mouth and the smoke from it spiraled upward sheila looked up did her sparse smile and said good morning darling i rather expected you to return here after your lunch with jerry auburn yesterday do sit down lee took the indicated chair and said apologetically we ran into some difficulty by the time it was ironed out i felt exhausted and mr auburn took me back to my suite difficulty he was attacked in the restaurant by a waiter apparently a nihilist ive read about them of course but she shook her blond head good heavens i didnt know it had gotten to the point where they were attacking prominent people right in the open the other at last noticed the length of her cigarette ash and tapped it off into her improvised ash tray her eyes narrowed nihilists the bastards are really getting out of hand just recently they kidnapped one of our candidate members of the central committee and shot him when his wife couldnt pay a fifty million pseudodollar ransom something simply will have to be done what happened it was terrible the man was about to shoot jerry mr auburn from behind but something made him turn and well jerry knows savate and what the hells savate a method of fighting with the feet an old french sport with some aspects of karate jerry disarmed the man and had kicked him unconscious before the others arrived the manager of course was extremely upset he said that the waiter was a new man who had only been there for a few days he called the police of course sheila shook her head trust jerry to come up with something like that fighting with his feet undoubtedly hell report on it later with almost all of the central committee in rome we cant afford to run chances of assassination which reminds me were to have a party tonight all of the central committee members and candidate members will be present it will give you an opportunity to meet them and for them of course to get an impression of you in the ballroom beginning at nine lee frowned candidate member she said yes you see there are but ten members of the central committee plus myself as secretary most of them are rather elderly so at any given time there are as many as a score or so candidate members waiting to be made full members upon the death or retirement of any of the present incumbents one of the matters to be handled at this session is such a promotion grace cabothudson hasnt been active for some time so she is being asked to retire to the position of central committee member emeritus and a new member will be appointed in an angry movement of a wellmanicured hand she took up another cigarette and lit it before going on and its ten to one that it wont be another woman male dominance still prevails in the central committee youd think that at least half the members should be female but no the male ego we still have with us she snorted then well be that as it may dear ill see you at the party tonight have you met any of the other members besides jerry i havent had the opportunity i mentioned you to fong hui who has just rocketed in from hong kong hed like to meet you fong is the only oriental central committee member though there are candidates from japan india and indonesia when did he wish to see me this morning sheila duffroberts touched a button on her tv phone almost immediately a door leading to the back opened and a girl bustled through she was a tiny thing smaller than lee garrett and absolutely dwarfed by the junoesque sheila she was a bit on the plump side which didnt detract from her vivacity sheila said lily palermo lee garrett lee is to be my new secretary lily darling to replace pamela but you girls can get to know each other later right now id like you to take lee to fong huis apartment the old fuddyduddys expecting her right away lily said and to lee my you must have spent a fortune on that hair lee came to her feet and said to sheila see you at the party then goodo darling sheila said already back at her work as they started down the corridor redundant with art as everywhere in the palazzo colonna lee said touching her hair believe it if you will but its my own and i do it myself its lovely lily told her and giggled you should have been at tьepartous last night you would have been the hit lee made a moue group sex turns me off she said the other looked at her from the side of her eyes im surprised that sheila is taking you for her secretary then lee shrugged it was rather thrown at me without my having much to say about it though frankly this whole world club thing has its fascinating aspects oh its the most wizard job you can imagine youre right in the middle of the most important goings on in the world youre really on the inside lee said idly whatever happened to pamela the girl im taking over from i dont know she was awfully nice kind of a little serious even more dedicated than most irish and she still talked with that soft brogue they have what was her last name mcgivern she wouldnt take anything from anybody not even sheila theyd argue hammer and tongs maybe thats why sheila let her go the little girl was silent for a moment as they rounded a turn in the wide corridor then she said quietly sheila never fires you from any of these jobs she might transfer you to some other position somewhere else but shell never fire you why not the other wasnt quite happy at the question well i suppose if the computers selected you in the first place you have more than usual ability and the central committee doesnt want to waste it besides she hesitated for a moment youre in on so many topsecret matters that they wouldnt like you to blab them around she rolled her eyes i can just see somebody who once worked for the central committee sitting down and writing a book about it lee thought about that she already had several new things to think about this morning for one she had gotten the damnedest impression that sheila had already known about the attack on jerry auburn before she had told her but then it was sheilas job to know everything that happened pertaining to the central committee members lily brought them up to an imposing door similar to that which opened into sheila duffrobertss salon once again there was no identity screen she knocked briskly then reached down for the bright brass knob she smiled brightly at lee said see you later dear turned and tripped briskly away lee entered closing the door behind her she blinked in surprise at the large rooms decor she had stepped from a roman renaissance corridor into a chamber which should have been eight thousand miles away in a chinese palace or mansion of the ming dynasty one had no doubts whatsoever that all of the exquisite furnishings all of the art and even the rugs were genuine antiques the whole room belonged in a chinese museum there were two occupants an old man behind an intricately carved ebony desk and a girl certainly not over twenty wearing a sleek long yellow highcollared cheongsam she was kneeling upon a dais plucking a thin mandarin melody from a jong resting on the floor before her her slim fingers played over the instrument as though caressing a lover the old man was frail with a wisp of a white beard and a bald head poised forward on his long neck with great natural dignity and grace he wore the redtasseled crystaltopped cap and the navyblue gown of the scholar lee said formally after bowing may i trouble your chariot my name is lee garrett his aged eyes took her in for a moment then the slightest of smiles appeared on his yellowish parchment face my chariot is untroubled pray take an honored chair i am totally unworthy the unworthiness is mine he told her my office is favored by your visit lee sat across the desk from him and said it is a poor womans delight the office shrinks in humble shame before your footsteps fong hui shook hands with himself keeping his delicately tapered fingers well within his long loose sleeves the chinese girl who had been playing the jong stood and trotted toward a rear door she turned without speaking bobbed several bows and left fong took lee in again the faint smile still in his eyes i suspect that you would have been capable of going through the formal greeting of years past in the original mandarin lee garrett acknowledged the compliment only awkwardly mr fong my father was a diplomat when i was a young girl he was stationed for two years in the peoples republic in peking he was an ardent linguist and always insisted that the family study the language of the nation to which we were posted such talents will be welcome in the position ms duffroberts tells me you are to occupy he smiled faintly again and let his eyes go about the room undoubtedly you are surprised at both my office and my attire i have always been a great admirer of the art and culture of the celestial empire mr fong his thin voice held a touch of exasperation and i have long been displeased by the increasing domination of the western culture but i wage a losing battle the culture of the west sweeps everything before it its modes of dress its food its manners and mores an accident of history gave the european and north american powers domination over the world for at least the present so that the habits of the west have prevailed to the detriment of other cultures not necessarily inferior as to dress without doubt the chinese cheongsam and the indian sari are far more flattering to the feminine figure than the awkward garb of europe and throughout the world now all cities are beginning to look like cleveland ohio while such architectural gems as angkor wat in cambodia and kyoto in japan are now no longer anything but museums on a grand scale lee said i agree with you mr fong even rome now has its seven hills surrounded by skyhigh condominiums and highrise apartment buildings for the antlike existence of the proles the slums of the welfare state he was obviously enjoying her company my dear he said you seem wise beyond your years perhaps some evening after adjusting to your new atmosphere you will honor me with your presence at dinner my chef is from shanghai i am overwhelmed mr fong i consider chinese cuisine the worlds finest the old man touched his wisp of white beard and said and now my dear tell me what are your impressions of the world club she said hesitantly i am somewhat overwhelmed its scope is much greater than i had thought i am inclined to wonder whether it has bitten off more than it can chew the problems seem insoluble to me he nodded when i was a boy confronted with my youthful unsolvable problems and in despair my father once said what were you worrying about last year at this date and i saw on reflection that all my unsolvable problems of that time had indeed been solved or lost relevancy the same might be said to apply to the longrange troubles of man this is the year what were our difficulties one century ago in in those days savants were aghast at the worlds problems surely they would never be solved but let us ask the question again suppose that an american in the year was to look back a century to and consider the problems of that time the indian wars were not quite over custers forces had been destroyed only ten years before and geronimo had kept the southwest in a state of siege labor troubles were paramount the anarchists at their peak the haymarket bombing killed seven wounded sixty the american federation of labor was not yet strong america was in an unprecedented state of growing pains the robber barons of industry were taking over the country wholesale immigrants were swarming in to the point where nearly half of new york city couldnt speak english to the dismay of the earlierarrived anglosaxons lee laughed softly i see what you mean by the problems of had all been solved or disappeared and so is your suggestion will be the problems of our time by he smiled in return but then became more serious tell me my dear what do you think of our sheila duffroberts she said carefully i dont know her very well as yet she seems very capable the old man nodded i am afraid that she is too prone to take on authority which should remain in the hands of the central committee with the assistance of its candidate members though i defer to the majority in retaining her as secretary he hesitated nor do i think that she should participate in the sometimes differing currents of the world club he must have caught the puzzlement in her eyes and said in amusement did you think that all was accord in the central committee my dear happily it is not if it were i myself would withdraw a frozen program is seldom a valid one certainly not over a period of time it was one of the prime weaknesses of the marxists back in the th and th centuries marx and engels did their work as early as the first part of the th century their communist manifesto written in predicted an imminent breakdown of capitalism and a proletarian victory a century later the capitalist system had changed and was stronger than ever marx and engels had died but most of the socalled marxists continued to follow them as though no changes in political economy had taken place as though such developments as fascism and the state capitalism of the soviet union had never raised their ugly heads at any rate there are conflicting opinions in the central committee of the world club and i to a degree welcome them when two minds meet both learn something an einstein cannot meet with a moron and exchange opinions without both learning something however little the american girl said but what are these differences in opinion i had gathered from sheila and jerry auburn that the goal of the world club is world government he smiled his little smile again it is but there can be varied types of world government so you have met our debonair jeremiah auburn he is a young man with depths not immediately perceived by some indeed there was considerable difficulty in nominating him to the central committee however his father before him was a member and such ah oldtimers as myself and grace cabothudson were adamant in vouching for him the three of us have similar views pertaining to the nature of the world state to come we had hopes that candidate harold dunninger who also had somewhat similar views would replace her upon her retirement unfortunately he was recently murdered by the nihilists opposed to our view are john moyer of the american iabi who i suspect sees the future government as a police state and harrington chase with his strong racist beliefs who undoubtedly sees it as a government of whites over the rest of humanity some of the candidates such as lothar von brandenburg i am sure see the future government as a dictatorship while ezra hawkins of the united church probably desires a theocracy ah yes my dear i am afraid that there are conflicting currents within the ranks of the world club lee said thoughtfully i can see that there must be ramifications that never occurred to me the faint sound of a muted gong came from the inner depths of the apartment and the old man smiled ruefully i am afraid that my physician reminds me that it is time for my nap the american girl stood immediately i must thank you for wasting so much of your valuable time on one who is so ignorant of the great problems resting upon your honorable shoulders the pleasure my dear is mine you are to fill an important post privy to the innermost developments of the world club one cannot know the future but perhaps one day you may even succeed to the position now occupied by ms sheila duffroberts lee bowed formally said with your permission mr fong and turned and left behind her fong hui sighed softly old his clay might be but he still had an eye for a superlatively pretty girl lee garrett puzzled out the route to her own suite only twice losing her way through the rambling twisting corridors of the palazzo colonna inside it she carefully locked the door before going into her small office she checked the time on her wrist chronometer then put her shoulder bag on the desk top she activated a secret compartment in the leather purse and brought forth from it a device like a ballpoint stylo she pressed a stud on its side and began moving slowly about the room pointing the gadget here there and particularly in the vicinity of electronic devices such as the tv phone after thoroughly going over the office she returned to the living room and resumed her activities as she approached the apartments second tv phone sitting on a small table against a wall her device began to buzz faintly her eyes widened in suspicion and she approached closer the buzzing increased she nodded to herself and then continued about the room she finished the living room and continued her task in both the bedroom and the bath but she found no more electronic bugs she deactivated her device returned to her office and replaced it in her shoulder bag extracting from the same secret compartment another device she also took up her pocket transceiver she went back to the living room on her way pulling a thin antenna from its place in the flat metallic box of her device which looked something like a small cigarette case she placed it next to the tv phone and pressed a stud it began to hum faintly she sat down on the couch turned on her transceiver flicked the scrambler button and dialed the answering voice came almost immediately lee said hurriedly ill have to make this quick theres a bug in my suite i have the muffler on but heaven knows what would happen if some monitor was checking manually so briefly everything is going better than we could have dreamed of i am the secretary of sheila duffroberts the secretary of the central committee i am meeting the ten members one by one by one so far i have found more division among them than we had known grace cabothudson is to be replaced the graf and the prophet are top contenders for her position both will add to the extremist element in the committee a thin faraway voice spoke from the transceiver then she said hurriedly i must go there is to be a parry tonight which ill attend meanwhile check this if you can a pamela mcgivern an irish girl was the former holder of my job i dont know what happened to her but i was indirectly informed today that once one takes a job this close to the central committee one doesnt quit obvious question where is the mcgivem girl the voice spoke again and lee said ill be very careful im a little afraid she switched off the transceiver hurried over to the muffler and deactivated it as well then took it back into the office and hid it again chapter eighteen jeremiah auburn it soon came to lee garrett when she attended the party in the ballroom of the palazzo colonna why sheila duffrobertss position was so important the committee itself was undoubtedly the most informal presiding body of a large and influential organization of which she had never heard sheilas office held it all together present at the gettogether were nine of the ten central committee members about a score of candidate members and another score or so of prominent supporters and employees of the world club who had not as yet attained central committee rank but were knowledgeable of its secret nature and headed various of the foundations research groups pressure groups and lobbies all were in formal dress but that was as near as lee could see to it being a formal affair she would have called it a cocktail party at most the buffet was one of the most elaborate she had ever seen and lee garrett had attended many an embassy affair there were tobacco fumes in the air as well as those of cannabis men predominated by far she noticed a dozen other women most in their middle years and most gave the impression of being the wives of male members one wore a golden indian sari but otherwise all were gowned most expensively in the latest styles two of the men wore arab garb but all the rest were in european dress though at least half were of dark complexion including one very black man who unlike the others didnt seem at ease in his black tie and tails for a moment as she surveyed them she wondered about the conservatism in mens dress formal attire had changed precious little since the days of abraham lincoln sports and daily wear yes evening wear no a guest at a reception given by woodrow wilson probably wouldnt have looked out of place here tonight when she first entered there were as many servants present as guests tending bar and the buffet carrying drinks and canapes running the errands waiters run but very shortly after she arrived they seemed magically to disappear to her surprise then the realization came those present were not in a position to be overheard for the balance of the evening the guests helped themselves to the buffet and the abundant drinks at the two bars she recognized only a few people sheila duffroberts of course and jerry auburn and fong hui who inclined his bald head in salutation when their eyes met across the room was nils norden an unconventionally jovial swede who had been pointed out to her though thus far they hadnt met no this was no formal party merely a gettogether of the bigwigs of the world club they stood or sat about the ballroom of the renaissance palace chatting arguing debating sometimes friendly sometimes in heat and in groups of anywhere from two to eight most seemed to make a policy of circulating around joining one conversation for a time then drifting on to another individual or group sheila had suggested lees presence as an opportunity to meet not only other members of the central committee but the other influentials of the world club as well for the moment she didnt quite know where or how to begin but then from across the room jerry auburn waved to her he was standing with sheila duffroberts who was dressed in a stunning brightblue evening gown which surely must have been designed with only her in mind with them was a stranger who bore a fragile handkerchief with which he daintily touched his lips after each sip at the champagne he carried lee approached hesitantly wondering if the wave had meant she was to join them and jerry beamed at her he held a highball glass in hand and by the darkness of its contents it was either straight spirits or nearly so his shining eyes and flushed face indicated that the drink probably wasnt his first when she came up to the others jerry waved his glass in a gesture of welcome and said honey meet carlo brentanto carlo this is lee garrett sheilas new secretary a knockout which you wouldnt recognize though sheila does sheila who had a brandy glass in hand murmured throatily you look stunning in that gown darling carlo brentanto said in almost a lisp incantato and bowed over lees hand gallantly jerry said carlos been explaining that the gays should inherit the earth certainly they should have a greater say in its governing the italian told him coolly after all my dears they have been outstanding throughout history it is ridiculous that there isnt a single homosexual in the central committee jerry took a pull at his drink and said well we have our imposing sheila sheila snorted over and over the homosexual has proven himself down through history carlo argued after daintily sipping can you think of anyone more outstanding in the military and in government than alexander the great caesar frederick the great and many more prominent than plato man has reached his heights when the homosexual was most widely understood the golden age of athens the renaissance here in italy tolerated but not exactly in power jerry said off hand the only governments i can think of that were ruled by the gays were sodom and gomorrah and they came to a fiery end ive always wondered what it was they did in gomorrah lee murmured you name it they did it said jerry sheila gave her curt little laugh and said im gratified to see you have a sense of humor darling the italian fluttered the hand bearing his handkerchief and said oh all of you are quite hopeless i think i shall go over and join the admiral i have no doubt youll try sheila purred he left and the three of them looked after him for a moment jerry said how in the hell did he ever get into the candidate class actually hes quite brilliant and the brentantos are the wealthiest family in italy sheila told him what was it you wanted to talk to me about jerry before he interrupted us he finished his drink and said oh yes when i asked you yesterday what had happened to pamela mcgivern you said that id undoubtedly hear later i havent in fact ive asked a couple of the committee and none of them seem to know though chase managed to mutter that it was good riddance i dont believe that our pamela was capable of hiding what she thought about his racist leanings sheila said she was becoming quite impossible its one thing my being somewhat of a minister without portfolio in the central committee but after all she was only my secretary and there was no reason for their putting up with her opinions jerry cocked his eye at her minister without portfolio eh i didnt know that was how you regarded yourself sheila i thought you were more like a man friday youre sure that youre not beginning to take on responsibilities beyond those the committee had in mind sheilas silent irritation was only partially concealed he said now what happened to pamela i for one liked the girl and so did fong hui among others i dismissed her giving her a bonus of fifty thousand psuedodollars without consulting anyone eh i didnt think it necessary after all she was my secretary i originally employed her on my own without consulting anyone what happened to her where is she now sheila frowned slightly i wouldnt know perhaps she returned to ireland perhaps he said he looked at lee neither of us has a drink should we go on over to the bar and remedy that situation thank you lee said and turned her eyes questioningly to her superior sheila did her bleak smile and said run along dear and do meet as many of those present as you can youll be working with all of them later jerry took lee by the arm and led her to one of the bars which had been set up in the ballroom immediately across from the buffet tables for the moment it was unoccupied he dropped the curt air he had assumed with sheila duffroberts and said what will it be champagne one of the candidates has his own vineyard near rheims he provides us with the best vintages that will be fine mr auburn jerry he told her ill stick to cognac there was a long row of ice buckets each with a bottle of sparkling wine he selected one which had already been opened took up a clean glass and poured for her then took up a halfempty bottle of impressivelooking brandy and renewed his own glass with a generous charge she had been right save for two ice cubes he was drinking his spirits straight lee winced at the idea of putting ice in good cognac she said cheers and sipped at her wine it was certainly as good as any she had ever tasted a small thin slightly hawknosed dignified elderly man came up and poured himself a glut of sherry he nodded at jerry and looked questioningly at lee jerry said mendel this is lee garrett sheilas new secretary shes a bit bewildered undoubtedly because she didnt know the central committee was composed of such farout folk lee this is mendel amschel a committee member and once my fathers closest friend im charmed my dear the newcomer said taking her hand i dont know why but one never expects surpassing beauty in a girl who must also be surpassingly intelligent and competent why you old goat jerry protested i saw her first lee was fully aware of the identity of mendel amschel reputedly the head of the richest bank in common europe although his name seldom appeared in the news you flatter me jerry the older man said smiling gently at the girl however if i were twenty years younger youd still be sixty jerry said you dreamer gentlemen gentlemen lee protested isnt the code duello still legal in italy if you must fight over me right jerry said the bois at dawn ill get peter windsor to second for me i see him over there talking to the archbishop competent man in a fight i understand but dont turn your back on him you might get a knife in it even though you thought he was on your side the banker raised his eyebrows at the younger man i suspect when it comes to a vote to replace our grace cabothudson you are not likely to opt for the graf jerry said testily i doubt if the original founders of the world club ever expected professional killers to be represented in the central committee i discussed it with harrington the other said he pointed out that most of the former mercenary activities of lothar von brandenburg are now becoming phased out but that there will always be a need for espionage and ah strong men even in a world state jerry dismissed that opinion its true mercenaries are on the wane wizard but the graf is expanding into other lines personal assassination hasnt been so prevalent since the days of the borgias hes simply computerized it the viennese banker scowled at him questioningly isnt that largely a matter of gossip and rumor every homicide in the world is being laid at the door of the mysterious graf yes jerry looked thoughtful and that reminds me i wanted to see peter windsor and ask about the death of harold dunninger hes the one i would have voted for to take over graces seat on the committee rather than either the prophet or the graf so would i have my boy amschel said but the nihilists who seem daily to become more bold got through his defenses i wonder jerry said at any rate i want to talk with windsor you two get to know each other see you later when the younger man had gone amschel sighed and said our jerry auburn is considerably different than i remember his father he smiled slightly perhaps it is the generation gap after all i was fredric auburns contemporary jerry seems a bit precipitous i wince at his confrontation with the grafs representative he turned his eyes from the retreating jerry and brought them back to lee i imagine everyone is asking you what you think of the world club well yes she told him carefully my first reaction is that the central committees plans seem to be somewhat premature though i support them is the world ready for a universal government ready or not he said with a touch of resignation in his voice it is the only answer today the world is on the precipice of disaster what is the old britishism the chickens have come home to roost the slowly developing problems of the past three centuries have now reached a head lee demurred oh come now the world is comparatively dormant at present there are no real immediate crises we havent known a major war within the lives of anyone now living he shook a thin finger at her my dear it is astonishing how quickly matters can develop when conditions are ripe consider the spring of when everything seemed stable the kaiser was securely on his throne franz joseph of the austrohungarian empire on his the sultan ruled the powerful ottoman empire and the czar of all the russias had recently celebrated the th anniversary of romanoff rule five years later there was no major monarchy in europe save england and capitalism itself had collapsed in russia the largest nation of the world no my dear comparatively overnight world institutions can radically alter given the right or perhaps i should say the wrong conditions she took a full lower lip between perfect white teeth then and you think such conditions exist today yes he looked about come my dear let us find a place to sit down my friend fong hui tells me you are an interesting young woman frankly i was sorry to see pamela mcgivern leave but if it was necessary at least we seem to have found a competent replacement would you like me to fill your glass no she said no i have plenty she followed him to a fifteenthcentury couch set against one of the large chambers walls when they were seated she said and what do you foresee in the nature of this new world state what kind of government will it be i get the impression that there is considerable difference on this among central committee members he conceded the validity of that yes there is some of us wish to continue the type of democracy that now prevails in the united states of the americas she sipped again at her wine frowning slightly you advocate a twoparty democracy with both of the parties controlled by a power elite he smiled his little dry smile again yes i am a product of my class and my age my class owns the socalled western world believe that they should govern it benevolently of course and maintaining all the liberties that man has achieved perhaps half of the central committee and even more of the candidate members concur and the ordinary citizens including the proles they are still to have the vote yes of course my dear why not it keeps them happy to think that they have the ultimate say every four years we put up two candidates and let them take their pick what could be more democratic than that you must realize that even at the height of the empire the roman proletariat had the vote they usually sold it to the highest bidder of course but they had it the proles my dear we shall always have with us they are the masses who labor at the undesirable jobs when labor is needed or fight as common soldiers in times of war they are the nonentities the world has passed them by a typical example is the peons of latin america now assimilated into the united states of the americas uneducated untrained they were pushed from a burro society into one of electronic computers they wont adjust nor will their children like the roman proletariat they must simply be fed and otherwise taken care of by the state as cheaply and efficiently as possible and forgotten about but there are exceptions among them there surely are many exceptions of course and they must be found and encouraged thomas edison was born in poverty and had only about three years of grammar school but he was a genius andrew carnegie came to america as an immigrant and fought his way upward into the highest ranks of the powerful oh yes there are many exceptions the ancestor of harrington chase who founded the chase fortune was an oilfield worker in texas lee shook her head and put her empty glass down on a small table beside the couch i had always thought the world club to be composed largely of economists whose research was supported by wealthy philanthropists the international banker was obviously amused dont exaggerate the contributions of economists my dear they are highly overrated compared to us the pragmatic if there was ever a group to which the question if youre so smart why arent you rich applies it is the economists economics arent as complicated as all that but the economists tnythologize the subject there are exceptions but most of them go through life as secondraters teaching writing books that few read and even fewer understand or selling their services to governments or the powerful they make their way with gobbledygook terminology but practically never do they get rich even a fivepercent advantage on knowing what way the stock market was going to go would make them wealthy but they simply dont know karl marx himself that analyzer of the capitalist system lived and died in poverty did you ever hear of a rockefeller a dupont a getty or any other founder of the great american fortunes who was an economist lees smile was inverted i am afraid that you are making a cynic of me mr amschel the smile he returned was thin i hope not my dear you are far too charming to succumb to cynicism however take as an example the monetary crisis of the last century every economist in the world was working on the problem of the collapse of international money there was not enough gold or any other precious metal in the world to back the needed mediums of exchange all nations particularly your united states simply began printing paper money which had no value since it represented nothing inflation was rampant inflation of course is not a matter of prices going up but of the value of money going down the united states with a two trillion dollar a year economy faced disaster because it had issued perhaps four hundred billion dollars worth of paper without backing did the economists solve the problem no it was solved by an obscure speculative writer i didnt know that oh yes he proposed that the government in taxing the two hundred top corporations of the united states take ten percent of the taxes in the form of their common stock this was amalgamated into what was called united states basic common a sort of gigantic mutual fund its shares of course paid dividends based on the combined dividends of the corporations the stock was placed on every stock exchange of the world to seek its level each year the government added its new common stock taken in the form of taxes to its u s basic common anyone who had dollars could turn them in for basic common in short the money of the united states now called pseudodollars since there was no gold behind them was now backed by the american economy the banker made a little snort it wasnt long before all other developed nations followed the lead the world now has valid currencies halfway across the room jerry auburn was interrupted on his way to seeing peter windsor harrington chase his inevitable glass of bourbon and branch water in hand waved him down the american tycoon was a stereotype of the cattleman or oil entrepreneur who had flourished in the old southwest he differed little if at all from his progenitors a henry ford or a joe kennedy might have come from roughandready toughandtighteyed schools but in two generations their descendants were attending ivy league universities and had become ladies and gentlemen who conducted themselves as aristocrats americas new nobility but not the chases harrington chases fief was a ranch enveloping two large counties overlapping in texas and oklahoma larger than the areas of several northeastern states big and ruddy of face his bulk no longer called for his riding his famed palominos but he usually still affected riding boots and a kingsized cigar even when police were in the vicinity was always in his mouth he also jerry knew invariably ordered steak and potatoes in the most celebrated restaurants with apple pie and ice cream for dessert with chase as usual at a central committee session was his closest associate john warfield moyer for some twenty years director of the iabi a squarecut man in his late fifties moyer with his bulldog face shaggy brows and cold accusing eyes looked every inch what he was a highranking police officer in his case the highest ranking in the world chase said with an overriding joviality hold on jerry oldtimer jerry auburn came to a halt albeit reluctantly something up harry he knew perfectly well the other hated that name he nodded at moyer hi fuzzy he said inwardly pleased at the directors wince harrington chase hefted his glass up and down a couple of times pontifically weve been mulling over the replacement of grace cabothudson now that shes let it be known shes resigning jerry said i had been inclined to dunninger until somebody got to him never cottoned much to harold myself chase said pompously kind of a goddamned liberal show me a liberal and ill show you a man on the verge of a coyote eurocommunist but at least he was a white american just like us three moyer looked at jerry a policemans look what do you mean somebody got to him those nihilist subversives shot him when his people wouldnt pay the ransom his wife must have thought they were bluffing so they say jerry nodded which leaves the field more or less left to ezra hawkins and lothar von brandenburg two of the most unlikely candidates for a seat in the central committee i could imagine harrington chase puffed out his cheeks at least the prophet is a godfearing christian a white man and an american we americans ought to stick together we wouldnt want to see a slanteye like lyeyasu suzuki or a nigger like sri saraswate on the committee jerry took him in its never been proven that the prohpet can read or write supposedly the top echelons of the world club are composed of highly intelligent welleducated men and women not superstitionspouting demagogues look boy us americans have a manifest destiny to run this world its in the cards but unless we hold the cards well wind up with the wogs taking the pot the younger man regarded him doing little to disguise his contempt harry he said do you realize that half the united states population is below average in intelligence the billionaires eyes all but popped in indignation thats a damn lie he rumbled jerry shook his head in pretended despair your american chauvinism does you little credit harry of course half of every population is below average and the other half above average what do you think average means the oilman sputtered then took a heavy slug of his bourbon moyer said obviously getting it before his colleague did whats that got to do with the prophet being elevated to the central committee auburn it seems to me that having a man of god in our number makes good sense the fact that the majority of us are among the worlds wealthiest rubs some people the wrong way especially the liberal intellectuals the prophet heads the biggest church in the world and every day it gets larger jerry turned his gaze to the iabi head and did it ever occur to you as a fuzzy that the number of crimes in a city each year is proportional to the number of churches there the other stared at him you must be around the corner auburn the more churches the less crime jerry shook his head in sorrow on the face of it fuzzy the larger the town is the more churches there are and the larger a town is the more crime there is harrington chase said angrily youre getting away from the point jerry the point is we dont want any more kikes like meyer amschel in the central committee and no more chinks like fong hui jerry said well see about that when it comes to the vote harry in my opinion amschel and fong may be on the oldish side and overly conservative but theyre two of the best weve got and now excuse me i want to have a few words with windsor has it ever occurred to either of you that the graf is so afraid of leaving that castle fortress of his that he always sends a deputy to represent him what kind of a committee member would he make if he never bothered to attend sessions before the arrival of jerry auburn archbishop willy beck and peter windsor had been hitting it off jolly well as the englishman might have put it the grafs righthand man now in impeccable evening wear was a far cry from the languid easygoing young man of the wolfschloss now in the view of his peers he presented himself as the british aristocrat straight of posture clipped of voice his companion was dressed in black and wore the reversed collar of clerical tradition they were approximately the same age approximately the same height but there the resemblance ended save for goals willy beck a lifelong evangelist who had first taken the stump at revival meetings in the american bible belt at the age of fourteen had the sanctimonious face of his trade long expressionless save for a sadness which tugged at the heartstrings of his feminine followers indeed his face had been compared to that of lincoln before the beard his voice was soft with a depth of sorrow similar to that of an undertaker his railings against the evils of drink and tobacco were his trademark which would undoubtedly have led the faithful to goggle at the manila cigar he now held in one hand and the glass of that most delicate though strong of spirits hungarian barack in the other the archbishop was saying yes you are quite correct the prophet foresees once the world state has come to power the reestablishment of the holy office the inquisition under a more inspiring name of course heretics must be rooted out at this point it is quite impossible but once the united church has become the state church of the world government matters will be different since the days of socrates the organized religions have found that to be the ultimate truth but now at this point we must rely on other means to confound our godless opponents and that is why the prophet sees the need for greater cooperation between our two organizations peter windsor said sipping at his scotch you put it most interestingly your excellency in what manner do you think the united church could be of use to us in most of the presentday branches of the united church my son we follow the rite of confession perhaps a judicious leader might be reluctant to reveal his secrets but often the same restraint does not apply to his more devout wife it is astonishing the information that is revealed in the confessional booth especially if encouraged by a trained confessor information that would be priceless to an organization involved in espionage bloody marvelous peter windsor said lost in admiration of the possibilities and in return the archbishops face was sad alas my son in this sinridden world the true faith often has what would seem insurmountable obstacles raised by the followers of the adversary such enemies of the united church would feel the wrath of the heavens who knows what might befall a strong official of some false faith who exhorts his fellows to refrain from cooperation with our holy cause chaps such as the mahdi i wouldnt wonder peter said indeed our sainted leader ezra hawkins spent long hours in prayer before coming to the reluctant decision to remove this limb of satan from the scene so that his deluded followers might at long last see the true path to salvation long hours in prayer peter said musingly i say do you chaps really find time for that sort of drill willy beck sighed peter sometimes i am inclined to think that ezra takes himself a bit too literally in his role of prophet it does not do for a religious man or a politician to believe too much in his own propaganda the more one knows his religion the less he believes if he is a pragmatic man peter accepted that pursing his lips however the prophet is shall we say no longer young and history tells us that it is often a devoted follower of a great prophet who finally witnesses the flowering of the new religion it was not jesus who founded christianity as we know it but paul and mohammed never saw islam spread beyond arabia it was the secondgeneration moslems who conquered half the known world a point well taken my son and who can tell what the good lord has planned for the future but tell me how is the health of the graf these days the englishman shook his head regretfully i am afraid that lothar is aging rather rapidly dont you know sometimes he seems to make rather illconsidered decisions archbishop beck shook his head also in sorrow not long for this world then however undoubtedly when he goes to his reward there will be more youthful hands to take the reins of his worthy organization peter windsor fixed his green eyes on the other mans face for a long calculating moment before he said perhaps we should talk this over in more detail in the near future i suspect that matters are coming to a head faster than some of us realize it was then that jerry auburn came up recently refilled glass in hand dark blue eyes with a faint glaze he said not quite slurring hi peter done in any poor cloddies of recent date hi willy saved any good souls lately all souls are good my son the archbishop said unctuously you ought to know you must get a wide variety of them the united church will take anything into its ranks down to and including animists the archbishop was sadly forgiving he said softly in my fathers house there are many mansions we are all one in the loving eyes of god be he called jehovah allah brahma maya or the great spirit jerry said taking another healthy pull at his drink or artemis and pan for the sake of the various witch cults youll adapt to anything to suck another faith into the united church if the aztec religion was still in existence youd allow them to cut out the hearts of a few thousand victims each year if the canaanites were still with us they could throw their firstborn into the flaming bronze maw of baal surely my son this is not a subject upon which to jest there was sorrow in the voice of the prophets righthand man but his eyes were narrow and cold i wasnt kidding jerry said the archives dont record what longdead con man first dreamed up religion and put ninetenths of the human race on the sucker list but he must have been a genius the archbishop said his long face expressionless i am neglecting my duties as the representative of a candidate member of the central committee i must pay my respects to harrington chase his devotion to the united church is well known only last week he contributed a million pseudodollars if youll forgive me when he was gone jerry said to peter windsor i hate to see you two getting together peter said oh willys all right i assume that most of us in the world club are either agnostics or atheists but well always have religion with us and id rather see the united church on our side than have it oppose us sometimes i wonder what our side is jerry said he fixed his eyes on the tall britisher have you heard about the attack on me yesterday the other looked worried yes i did jerry jolly good that you were able to thwart the beggar yeah wasnt it what ive been wondering about was who fingered me what do you mean dear boy i mean that it seems unlikely that cloddy went to all the trouble to get a job at the hostaria dellorso just to take a crack at the first wealthy customer to come along if he had he would have polished someone else off long before i arrived on the scene its the most expensive restaurant in town and theres a fistful of millionaires and top politicians there every day no he was waiting for me somebody had tipped the nihilists off that it was my favorite eating spot id just got in to rome the same day and he was waiting peter looked distressed whats your point old chap all of a sudden the nihilists seem to be taking an extraordinary interest in members and candidate members of the central committee it was only a few days ago that harry dunninger was knocked off by them back in the states if he hadnt been sure as hell the central committee would have nominated him to full membership with him eliminated it looks as though either the graf or the prophet has a much better chance if id been knocked off both of them would have the chance i dont follow you i think youd better try jerry auburns eyes had lost their alcohol sheen and were now very level the englishman shook his head really old boy i dont know what youre talking about your people had the contract to guard dunninger when the nihilists raided his estate four of the guards had been pulled off weakening resistance so that overwhelming the defense was a cinch now what i want to know is what contracts you people have with the neonihilists peter windsor flushed in indignation he said strongly really auburn your suggestion is inadmissible jerrys voice was winter cold im asking you if you have contacts with the nihilists if you tell me no and through my people i later find out that you have your organization is mud in the world club chumpal remember that im a member of the central committee all by myself i can blackball the graf from ever becoming a full member i think i could throw enough weight to have him tossed out of the world club entirely and that would hardly fit in with your plans would it windsor now see here jerry peter windsor said hurriedly youre getting off onto the wrong foot of course the graf has infiltrated the nihilists along with all other subversive organizations a great deal of our work is espionage we infiltrate everywhere especially into organizations having any sort of political connotations so whos your head mole in the nihilists the other stared at him we havent one we have several plants among them but theyre not of enough importance for us to go to any great extent to infiltrate them its just a matter of keeping the sods under observation had we gotten news that poor harold dunninger was to be kidnapped we would have immediately informed him the graf after all is a loyal candidate member of the central committee jerry auburn took him in for a long cold moment well see about that he said he finished his drink with the stiffwristed motion of the practiced drinker turned on his heel and headed for the bar leaving the englishman staring after him boiling anger in his pale killer eyes lee garrett gave up at about one oclock in the morning she had done her best to make acquaintances as ordered by shelia duffroberts and had met perhaps a dozen of the members and candidates she had spent the last half hour in thecompany of nils norden from what she had gathered the scandinavian tycoon was on the fence so far as the divisions within the organization were concerned if chase and his colleagues were the right wing of the committee and jerry auburn was on the left wing then nils norden must be thought of as the center not that shed discussed the world club with him to any extent largely he seemed interested in conducting her back to her suite and to bed by this time she had learned the layout of this part of the palazzo well enough that she had no trouble finding her way to her quarters she sighed her weariness kicked off her shoes picked them up and headed for the suites interior her bedroom in mind to get to it she had to pass through the living room she was surprised to find the lights were on then she spotted jerry auburn sprawled on the fifteenthcentury couch his feet shoes and all up on one arm of the priceless antique his inevitable glass was on a low table within easy reach he looked up at her what is the meaning of this mr auburn jerry he said if were to become lovers we must forget formalities lovers she dropped her shoes onto the floor and slipped her feet into them if you came here to he held up a weary hand please no indignation i never rape girls ive never had to in fact sometimes they rape me she snorted and ran her eyes over his sturdy athletes body itd take quite a mopsy to rape you my friend i rape easily a flaw in my character he explained swinging his feet around and to the floor sit down lee i have something to ask you im tired she said i want to go to bed but she sat taking one of the antique chairs which was more comfortable than it looked it would have to be so do i he told her earnestly but well get to do that later he pointed at the phone the one she knew was bugged her eyes widened when she saw sitting next to it a muffler similar to the one she had utilized nobodys listening in he said reaching over and picking up his glass i dont know what youre talking about she got out he took back some of his drink you know everybodys been telling me that this evening he told her peter windsor for instance however youre reporting to someone whom dont bother to deny it honey we often monitor the quarters of new employees on the off chance that theyre an attempt to infiltrate the world club youd be surprised how many elements would like to know its inner workings by chance the monitor in this case is an old family friend indebted to my late father he reports to me first and sometimes im the only one he reports to at any rate honey he tells me that your bug was muffled for a time obviously he couldnt tell me whom you called nor what you said but he was aware of the muffler so what is a nice girl like you doing with a sophisticated piece of electronic equipment and who were you calling to report what she glared at him angrily even while her mind raced my mother she got out finally he closed his eyes in pain and pushed his left hand over his mouth oh come on now honey she said challengingly my mother is rosamond brice he cocked an eye at her i know rosamond brice or did she doesnt look old enough to be your mother and whats more she doesnt act like a mother shes been in more beds than ive been in automobiles and when she comes to town the local distilleries put on an extra shift lee went to the bar and poured herself a drink from the first bottle that came to hand she took down a quick snort and made a face absinthe she poured some water into it and returned to her chair she said defiantly my mother and father werent married but for a time they evidently had a somewhat hectic love affair for some reason she agreed to have a baby by the time i came the affair was waning mother couldnt bother with me i interfered with her good times but father wanted me and raised me we loved each other very much after he died i became friends with rosamond although were worlds apart as a rule when i told her i was to work for the world club she told me that theyd probably bug my rooms and gave me a muffler so that we could talk without being overheard she knew about mufflers because she always uses one shes afraid of jealous wives sweethearts or whoever listening in on her calls to lovers he looked at her for a long disbelieving moment she came to her feet and said oh hell come on i suppose this was inevitable come on where he said to the bedroom im going to rape you a little chapter nineteen roy cos roy dreaded getting up but that feeling of dread was now a daily occurrence he couldnt bring himself to face the coming day how long had it been now a couple of weeks more than that at least he was giving the bastards a run for their money one of the newsmen had told them that oliver brettjames in nassau had been fired by the outfit issuing the deathwish policy roy had signed up for evidently the cosmocorps executives blamed the englishman for not spotting potential trouble in the offbeat roy cos and his manager long before this they had begun losing money on the deal not only were the premiums eating them up but the socalled deathwish wobbly was spending his million pseudodollars per day at an unprecedented rate how many people did he have on his payroll now over twenty roy supposed counting the stenographers down in the offices on the floor below a payroll of more than two hundred thousand pseudodollars a day if he wasnt feeling so damned depressed he might have laughed imagine roy cos spending over a million a week on his staff mary ann on the pillow next to him said doing her best to keep the anxiety from her voice something wrong darling he looked over at her mousy of face mary ann elwyn might be but a mouse of very special attractions it was the first time in his life that hed had a deep involvement that went beyond mere sex no not really he told her she looked at her wrist chronometer youre supposed to hear that tridi singer this morning for the united church broadcast yeah he said staring up at the ceiling what was his name again stevie summers hes the current big thing in nostalgia folk song revivals roy sighed and said hows forry getting along with the hotel manager she laughed shortly hes reversed the flow of crap you might say the first few days guests were moving out wholesale when it was learned that the deathwish wobbly was staying here evidently they expected the whole new tropical hotel to be bombed flat or something but that didnt last thrill seekers zeroed in wholesale one of rons friends who works in the lobby says the manager is turning down bribes that run up to a thousand pseudodollars for reservations same old story thousands of silly dizzards would give thenright arms to be on hand when the grafs men get to you i mean if she added contritely sorry he ran a weary hand back through his shaggy faded brown hair nothing to be sorry about he told her he dug around for something else to postpone getting out of bed howd that girl check out the one who got in with the reporters yesterday shes evidently what she said she was a celebrity hound she wanted to see you in person wanted to try to get your autograph the guards shook her down just like everybody else and she had nothing remotely resembling a weapon so they let her through supposedly she was a reporter if she could get past all of our security so could somebody else he said bitterly wed better go and check out this stevie summers darling all right he swung his legs out over the side of the bed ignoring his bedroom slippers he went over to the chair where he had thrown his clothes the night before and began to dress mary ann got up too and went to the closet the prole clothes she brought forth were as similar to his own as possible she looked over at him roy cos had lost the extra ten pounds or so of weight and now looked drawn rather than pasty of face the sunbaths on the roof which forry brown had insisted upon had wiped away the pallor it came to her that roy must have been quite goodlooking as a young man twentyfive years of inadequate diet and exercise hadnt done him any good nor had the long hours of sitting around small drab rooms arguing political economy night after night forty brown and ferd feldmeyer were in the living room with three of the guards who bore short stocky gyrojet automatic carbines dick samuelson in particular carried his with a practiced ease it had turned out when the weapons were first procured that dick had spent a hitch in the skyborne commandos and hed taken over the duty of instructing his less knowledgeable wobbly colleagues in their use also present was a rather vaguelooking young man somewhere in his early twenties he bore a guitar and was looking both impatient and bored his fans might have swooned over him roy decided but he looked like nothing more than a gangly kid forry dressed identically to roy and looking somewhat ludicrous in prole attire squinted through tobacco smoke at his employer he said this is stevie summers i promised him five thousand to sing one song as a preliminary to you roasting the prophet it aint the money the singer said i hate that sapsucker roy nodded went over to his desk and took up a little red pamphlet thumbed through it to the page he sought found it and handed it to the boy this is a book of old iww songs he said this is the one i wanted you to sing it was written by one of the early wobblies joe hill who was executed in utah for a crime he didnt commit because he was a radical you sing it to the tune for the old hymn in the sweet bye and bye gotcha the boy said he looked over the lyrics for a moment then began to strum and sing to roys surprise the singers voice though soft grasped with appeal longhaired preachers come out every night try to tell you whats wrong and whats right but when asked how bout something to eat they will answer with voices so sweet you will eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky work and pray live on hay youll get pie in the sky when you die and the starvation army they play and they sing and they clap and they pray till they get all your coin on the drum then they tell you when youre on the bum you will eat bye and bye in that glorious land above the sky work and pray live on hay youll get pie in the sky when you die workingmen of all countries unite side by side we for freedom will fight when the world and its wealth we have gained to the grafters well sing this refrain you will eat bye and bye when youve learned how to cook and to fry chop some wood twill do you good and youll eat in the sweet bye and bye the boy ended with a bang on the strings looked up and grinned after that the prophetll want to crucify you thats the idea roy said hes lined up with the other side we want to make that clear he looked at the folk singer that old radical song is kind of primitive as propaganda goes but it wont put you on anybodys shitlist will it the prophet throws a lot of weight with me it doesnt make any difference hell have to stand in line if he wants to take a crack at me stevie summers shook his head the kids i sing for dont go for this holyroller fling so far as were concerned he can bugger himself with a wood auger by the way my old mans a libertarian ive heard a couple of your bleats on tridi your two organizations oughta get together theres been some talk about it roy nodded forry said we better get ready for that press interview he took young summers by the arm and led him to the door going over details about the broadcast roy sat down at his desk and looked unhappily at the pile of mail before him he thumbed quickly through it there was nothing from anyone he knew all strangers he said to mary ann you want to go through this and spread it around to the girls for the standard answers by the way how come i havent met any of the stenographers mary ann came over from her own desk carrying a letter she said ferry doesnt want them on this floor two of them are wobblies but the others are outsiders for all we know the graf might be able to get next to one of them its just as easy for a woman to take a crack at you as a man roy shook his head but said i guess youre right whats that she put the letter down before him its from wobbly headquarters in chicago billy tucker who was also dressed identically to roy cos said oh oh i was beginning to wonder when wed get a kick from the agitation committee some of those speeches ferd has been writing for you arent exactly the standard message the wobblies have been making for the last century or so roy ripped open the envelope and quickly scanned the letter ill be damned he said ive been promoted from national organizer to a member of the agitation committee he looked up at mary ann thats our executive committee headed by the national secretary he wants me to attend a meeting being organized by synthesis what in the hells synthesis dick samuelson said he was lounging against the wall next to the door to the corridor his carbine under his right arm roy grunted and said a new outfit thats trying to get all the radicals together the whole shebang libertarians nihilists wobblies the antiracist league everybody but those eurocommunist slobs the door buzzed samuelson readied his gun and checked the identity screen it was forty brown the newsman came in followed by ferd feldmeyer who was carrying a sheaf of papers the speech writer like all the others of the team was in prole dress identical to that worn by roy it had been one of ferrys ideas the whole team dressed exactly alike as they invariably moved in a tight group whenever they were in public a hit man at any distance at all would have his work cut out telling which one was roy roy had protested particularly in the case of mary ann but she had overruled him as with the grossly fat ferd and the kingsized billy tucker there was small chance that even a myopic assassin would confuse her with his target but the whole crew of them being dressed alike wouldnt help him any forry noticing the letter in roys hand said what spins ive been made a member of the agitation committee they want me to attend a special meeting thats being held in an attempt to amalgamate all radical groups thats out no more public appearances forry told him sourly from now on ive made arrangements for your broadcasts to be made from right here the fuzzies stationed at your last rally picked up two armed men before they even got near enough to you for our boys to be needed next meeting thered be more than two and its just a matter of time before one or more of them gets within firing range from now on you dont leave the new tropical hotel you dont even leave this floor roy said ill have to attend that synthesis meeting if the national secretary wants me to screw the national secretary let him represent the wobblies hes expendable youre not youre the deathwish wobbly and youve put your message over more widely than all the rest of your outfit put together since it was first started roy shook his head feeling tired all over again i appreciate what youre trying to do forry but im a member of an organization not just a oneman agitator i take orders from our elected officials just like billy and dick here do the little newsman shrugged angrily but gave up and fished a cigarette pack from a jumper pocket ferd feldmeyer tossed his sheaf of papers on the desk before his employer heres the united church broadcast i played it the way you said stressing the fact that the wobblies have nothing against religion per se since a mans relationship with his god is his personal business but when organized religion intrudes on politics its no longer a matter of religion theyre as vulnerable as any other political organization roy cos was quickly scanning the speech he said you used some concrete examples the roman catholic church during the middle ages in particular islam shintoism in japan and all other religions that have supported classdivided society down through the ages sure sure feldmeyer said running his obscenely obese hand back through thinning blond hair practically every large church once it got big has supportd the status quo and the prophets united church is no exception dick at the door reported the rest of the boys have finished shaking down the reporters okay let them in forry said there were a score or so of reporters and photographers they were followed by three more of roys wobbly guards who stationed themselves alertly about the walls of the room while the newsmen found places most of the reporters had been here before roys press interviews were daily affairs as were his sessions with freelancers doing special articles the senior of the newsmen a wrinkled veteran who was moist of eye from prolonged battles with the bottle said what spins roy roy cos seated behind his desk said im still here don whatre my odds today the bookies are giving evensteven that you get it today two to one that the grafs boys get you by tomorrow four to one the next day eight to one by the next don told him mary ann winced her face looked sick jesus forry said whatre the odds that he lasts the week out don said flatly a hundred to one against the word is out that the grafs getting uptight about this he likes to operate on the qt publicity isnt his forte the insurance companies are probably giving him the prod too all this publicity about the deathwish policies is giving them a black eye people all over not just in the states are getting indignant it pretty well shows that anything goes in this profitoriented world the multinationals are completely without morals a man is put in a position where he cant make a real living and then coerced into giving up his life in return for a few days of hedonism yeah the pressure is increasing on the multinational insurance companies on the swiss banks on lloyds of london any outfit thats got a finger in the pie roy said his smile working the usual wonder on his stoic face well make a wobbly out of you yet don the old reporter looked at some of the photographers and said why dont you guys wait until the interviews over before getting your pix you just get in the way when were trying to tape for tridi elitist one charged amiably and sought a chair forry said no special releases today chumpals fire away if youve got any questions for the deathwish wobbly one of them called out roy whats your stand on world government its in the air these days youve probably heard that the congress has invited australia and new zealand to join the united states and it looks as though england and ireland will get the same invitation roy said we wobblies are in favor of world government but cant see much advantage to it so far as the proles are concerned so long as classdivided society is retained wed just continue to be in the same undesirable spot subsisting on gas world government under an industrial democracy would be desirable but under the status quo it would merely give the powers that be better control of us instead of having dozens of countries each with its own special conditions its own rules and regulations theyd have all of us under the same thumb another reporter held up a hand and said after youve taken over are you wobblies going to continue to use the computers to decide whos going to work at what jobs roy cos touched the end of his nose and frowned he said slowly what youve got to understand is that wobblies are advocating an industrial democracy itll be up to the people to decide such questions as that we might come up with our ideas on how it should be handled and then when the new order has taken over the people might say screw that and vote in something else the questioner laughed and said well what is your personal opinion how would you vote roy said yes id be in favor of continuing to use the computers to select who should have what job however there are some angles we dont expect to put all of the population back to work at production theyre not needed to produce all the products and services necessary for society thats where we differ from the luddites they want to destroy technology so that the whole work force can go back to production thats ridiculous after a million years or so man has finally solved the problem of producing all the articles we need now we can settle back and enjoy our longing for leisure true leisure is not wasted its not only an opportunity to loaf man must spend this leisure intelligently not sitting before tridi screens sucking on trank pills or drinking synthobeer another reporter called sure but youd be up against the same trouble we are now there simply arent enough jobs to go around the computers cant find jobs where there arent any roy said a bit impatiently what i just said was that we dont expect to put everybody back to work at production and services but such jobs arent the only kind of employment everybody physically and mentally capable of working studying or participating in the arts and sciences can be found a place be you ever so humble the computers should be able to find something for you to do the biggest consideration being that its what you like to do if youve got a leaning toward one of the arts then they wont have you cleaning up the environment while roy continued to field questions one of the stillphotographers sitting on the sidelines waiting his turn yawned and said to his neighbor thats an interesting box youve got there an oldtimer what is it a holo or lite holo the other said the first one yawned again and said i dont believe ive ever seen you here before who are you working for the other ran his tongue over his lower lip international the editor sent me over for a few shots for the first photographers face had frozen his voice was louder like shit you are im representing international and ive never seen you before billy tucker dropped his gun and lunged across the room sent roy cos sprawling from his chair and landed atop him behind the desk his arms spread his huge wrestlers body completely covering the smaller man one of the tridi cameramen brought his rig crashing down on the head of the false photographer who reeled dropping his camera ron ellison came charging up from where he had stationed himself against a wall reversed his stubby carbine and clubbed the man another one of the reporters in advance of his fellows stepped in close and drove his fist into the interlopers solar plexus the others came up largely getting in each others way son of a bitch one of them snarled don the veteran looked at his tridi photographer who had sacrificed his camera in the initial attack you stupid cloddy he said thats ten thousand pseudodollars worth of box howre we going to explain it to the office forry brown rubbing his thin fist over his scraggly mustache while staring down at the fallen man said absently the deathwish wobbly will pick up the tab plus a bonus of five thousand he then looked at ron how did this bastard get by you ron said defensively hes not armed we shook him down like everybody else real thoroughly he hasnt got so much as a pocket knife the photographers were all recording the scene particularly of the fallen man the shattered camera beside him and of billy tucker and roy now emerging from their place on the floor behind the desk the hulking billy looked shamefacedly at the shambles mary ann said possibly hes like that girl yesterday wanted to see roy in person talk to him get his autograph the reporter who had originally started the ruckus by denouncing the nowunconscious intruder said yeah possibly let me take a look at that damned camera of his he said it was a holo he doesnt know his ass from a holo in the ground ill pretend i didnt hear that don said as the other scooped up the camera under discussion from the floor while all watched he fiddled with it the back came away whatever the complicated juryrigged device inside was it had nothing to do with holo cameras for crissakes let me see that forry rasped taking it from the others hands he stared at the insides turned the instrument over to check the lens he said in wonder this isnt a camera its a dart gun the darts fired by springs and comes out through the opening where the lens is supposed to be ill be damned don said you gotta admit the grafs tricky when all these boys were firing away at roy flashing lights and all this bastard could have fired his dart without anybody noticing it it might feel like nothing more than an itch and royd scratch it and sure as hell the poison wouldnt work until our phony photographer here was already on his way out of the building safe as a pig in shit roy shook his head wearily sighed and said to ron couple of you boys get him out of here and turn him over to the fuzzies down in the lobby forry said tell them that our lawyers will prefer charges if we can get him to admit he was hired by the graf well sue lothar von brandenburg through the world court not that itll do any good directly but itll be one more bit of damning evidence against the whole establishment don said well do up the releases from that angle forry come on chumpals lets get out of here this is news when they were gone dick said roy the partys getting rough two people in two days penetrating our security maybe we ought to go to ground again hide out somewhere roy shook his head again in the first place theres no place to hide theyd find us sooner or later in the second place thered be no more broadcasts no more publicity were just beginning to get the message over we cant stop now ron said did you see how those news boys lit into him they got to him before we could that slobll spend a week in the prison hospital if hes lucky forry squinted his eyes through the dribbling smoke of his inevitable cigarette its a good sign he said the press has been sympathetic from the first hell its been firstrate copy since we first made our news releases but now theyre really rallying around he chopped out a cynical laugh can you imagine some of those tough bastards beginning to accept what roys saying its early in the day for it roy said but how about a drink i could use one that dizzard almost accomplished what he came for mary ann looked at him in alarm you dont mean that he fired a dart at you no but i was nearly squashed to death under billy here as ron went over to the bar to take orders there came the blatblatblat of a copter outside dick samuelson took up his automatic carbine and went out through the french windows to threaten it off it wasnt anything new since the word had gotten out that the deathwish wobbly was stationed in the new tropical hotel penthouse aircraft undoubtedly hired by rubberneckers had circled almost daily roys team had decided that the threat of a commando raid on the part of the grafs men wasnt very likely the invaders would have been at a considerable disadvantage now that roy had augmented his guard to eight wellarmed men they would have been mowed down as they attempted to disembark besides in the shootout roy would have been able to escape along with mary ann and the other noncombatants of the team taking their drinks they paid little attention to the guard who had gone out on the roof and was shaking his weapon at the aircraft until ron blurted jesus christ dicks down the three guards in the living room dropped their drinks to the floor grabbed up their guns and headed for the roof garden on die double dick was sprawled out on the terrace in agony he called weakly sniper on the roof opposite his face contorted and he passed out billy and les ran for him grabbed him by the arms and pulled him back toward the penthouse bending double to present as small a target as possible ron upended a heavy wroughtiron patio table and knelt behind it steadying his gyrojet on its edge he traversed the roof opposite with rapid fire emptying the clip with one burst he slapped the side of the gun so that the magazine fell away and fumbled in a pocket of his prole jacket for another dicks two rescuers hauled him into the living room where the others were standing to each side of the windows out of the line of fire billy and les dragged their fallen companion to a couch and got him onto it billy his face pale snapped hes hit bad doctor mary ann her usual prim efficiency slipping squealed and dashed for the phone on her desk she banged the activating stud and screamed doctor doctor immediately in the penthouse emergency emergency ron bending double as his companions had came hurrying back from the rooftop garden hes gone i think he blurted breathing deeply he stared at dick sprawled on the couch roy forry billy and les were all hovering above him trying to get his jacket off trying to staunch the flow of blood he said it mustve all been a putup that chopper came over to draw us out the guy on the roof was waiting dicks about the same size as roy and of course we all dress the same where the hells that doctor forry grated one of the new guards opened the door and stuck his head in what the hells going on he said his eyes bugging when he saw dick theres a doctor out here let him in for christs sake roy said dicks been hit hes bleeding all over the place the doctor came hurrying in he was in a white jacket and carrying the standard physicians black bag he was a dignifiedlooking type gray of hair weary of face as he headed for the fallen man those gathered around dick samuelson made way for him even as he crossed the room he snapped his bag open and began to fish in it billy roared hes no damned doctor and made a flying tackle the newcomer dropped his bag and smashed into the floor hitting full on his face the wrestler swarmed onto him expertly snagged an arm and pressed it behind and up the back ron scooped up the bag and stared down into it he reached inside and brought out a small gyrojet hideaway gun holy smog he said a shooter the other guards came pressing in from the corridor guns at the ready billy hauled the fake doctor to his feet and slugged him mercilessly in the face shattering his glasses and bringing blood another doctor forry blurted at mary ann who had abandoned her phone and was standing both fists to her mouth her eyes popping in distress have the manager come accompanying the regular hotel doctor goddammit dicks still pumping his life out she got back on the phone forty said to billy in disgust how in the hell did you know he wasnt a doctor billy tucker who was still manhandling his victim aided now by les who was no gentler looked slightly embarrassed i dont know he admitted just instinct i guess they all looked at him the wrestler said uncomfortably he got here too soon besides he looked too much like a doctor forry closed his eyes in weariness give me strength he muttered roy who had settled down in his chair behind his desk said emptily take him down to the lobby billy you go too les turn him over to the fuzzies same story as that photographer ferd feldmeyer was over at the bar pouring himself a fresh drink he said wed better call the press boys back this makes a bigger story to hell with publicity roy snapped take care of poor dick first a half hour later the place was reasonably cleaned up the faithful guard dick had taken a side wound happily the slug hadnt been explosive as was so usual these days and had gone completely through according to the hotel doctor there was little fear for his life only a protracted stay in the hospital forry said hell continue on the payroll like everybody else ron looked at him youre damn right he will ron was the only guard in the room for the time billy was out on the roof on the off chance that either the copter or the sniper might make a return performance the others were in the corridors or stationed at the entries everybody was uptight feldmeyer shook his head until his lardy jowls wobbled he said what motivates a cloddy like that suppose hed got his gun out and shot roy wed all have been on him like a ton of bricks he didnt have a chance of making a getaway forry grunted when the graf cant find anybody else to take a chance theres always the john wilkes booth type kicking around that you can steam up to do the job think of all the international fame that would accrue to anybody who finishes the deathwish wobbly besides one way or the other the graf will probably have that fake photographer and the phony doctor loose within six months with his kind of money and muscle you can do almost anything in this world in spite of all the excitement roy hadnt dispelled his earlier despondency he took a pull at his third drink though they hadnt had lunch yet he said his voice reflecting his inner despair dick might have been killed the others were seated around quiet in their own inner thoughts ron looked over at his chief quickly he said rejection there of the others obvious thoughts dick knew that we all knew we were taking a chance when we signed up youre the only one not taking a chance he hesitated before adding you dont have a chance roy but youre in here pitching what would you expect us to do were just as avid wobblies as you are roy cos shrugged that off it was a mistake he said deep weariness in his voice what goods it done i dont see the multitudes swarming in to join the wobblies there are some mary ann said trying to keep obvious compassion for her lover from her voice roy looked at forry rather than her yes he said most of em are crackpots trying to get in on the act we dont need crackpots we need devoted militants theyre not all crackpots ron said and it takes time to make a good wobbly a lot of study a lot of background no theyre not all crackpots roy said some are undoubtedly iabi men ordered to infiltrate us and act as agents provocateurs some are probably in the pay of the graf getting in where they can do the most damage whats the old russian adage when four men sit down to talk revolution three are police spies and the other a damn fool he was still looking at forry brown you and your story about sacco and vanzetti forry lit another cigarette from the butt of his old one they wanted to get over their message by being idealists the american people heard their message but rejected it which is undoubtedly what they should have done anarchy didnt fit the countrys needs all right you wanted to have the chance of getting over the wobbly program youre doing it now its up to the program if the majority of the people think its good theyll support it if they dont they wont whats your beef roy his tone was sour roy nodded tired still they havent accepted it ron said they havent had time roy for chrissakes its only been a couple of weeks or so his chief ignored that saying you know what the trouble is always in the past when there was a fundamental change in the working the people were driven to it usually by hunger and despair the french revolution the russian revolution the chinese before that all the way back to the slave revolts in rome led by spartacus but we dont have any hunger now in the welfare state gas takes care of everybody not on a very high level but nobody starves nobody goes unsheltered or unclothed and medical care is free the proles today are largely what marx used to call the lumpen proletariat he expected them to side with the enemy when the chips were down and our lumpen proles are lumpen indeed go into any autobar in the slummiest part of town and say anything against the government and youll have a fight on your hands one of the platitudes they have is their slogan it was good enough for daddy and its good enough for me ron said uncomfortably not at his ease in arguing with the older man he admired so much you knew all that before we ever started roy its admittedly a long road but if were right sooner or later well win so far as im concerned and maybe dick itll be later the deathwish wobbly said bitterly chapter twenty jeremiah auburn when jerry auburn awakened it was to find lee garrett next to him up on one elbow she was frowning puzzlement he grinned his eyes glinting amusement and said did i put up a valiant enough battle for my honor i wouldnt want the word to get out that i was an easy lay what he said when you raped me last night she was frowning still ignoring his sally of humor im still wondering where ive met you before at first i thought it was just your voice but now i seem to find facial resemblances to someone ive met somewhere have we he laughed yes for a short time but not under such circumstances that i ever expected to wind up in your bed honey in fact i lied to you told you i didnt think blondes were he chuckled again someday maybe ill tell you about it right now you wouldnt believe me anyway dont be cryptic jerry but he dropped it and his voice became serious he said im going to be leaving today lee ive got some things to do in the states besides that i dont think id win high marks in a roman popularity contest right now after that attempt in the restaurant id rather be on my own turf she nodded at that i heard a few rumors last night that you havent been exactly ingratiating yourself among some elements in the world club but then of course you were a little drenched no he told her definitely i knew what i was doing and i was doing it deliberately i dont like the present drift of the world club and i want to bring certain things to a decision at any rate i want you to get in touch with mendel amschel and fong hui and let them know that if it comes to a vote on a new central committee member to get in touch with me through you im going to give you the number of my tight beam transceiver youre not to tell sheila or anyone else about this but i work for sheila duffroberts i cant he interrupted her and she works for the central committee and amschel and fong and i are members of that committee so you work for us above and beyond your obligations to sheila i suppose youre right she hesitated then said jerry what happened to pamela mcgivern the girl who preceded me i dont know he said grimly its one of the things i intend to find out he got out of bed and went to where he had so hastily disrobed the night before he gathered up his clothes and headed for the bathroom lee looking after him thoughtfully it occurred to her that though shed had several brief affairs shed never before met a man with whom she might have considered a more permanent relationship but then she snorted in selfamusement he was jeremiah auburn for years the leading igniter of the rocket set obviously if hed gotten to his age without more prolonged alliances he wasnt interested in one she wondered all over again where she could possibly have met him before as he had now admitted his decision made to return to the states jerry auburn faded out of rome as inconspicuously as he had appeared he didnt even bother to pack a small bag all his requirements could be met on his personal air yacht he drove out the appian way to the international shuttleport and directly to his kingsize airliner on the way he had alerted the captain of his arrival and the fact that he wanted to be airborne immediately a skeleton crew was always aboard so that ordinarily he could have taken off immediately however the balance of the crew of eighteen including the stewards was undoubtedly quartered at the shuttleports international hotel and would be aboard as soon as he was the flight was uneventful he sat in the main lounge staring unseeingly out one of the larger ports at the sea far beneath what he had told lee wasnt exactly correct it wasnt just a matter of wanting to bring things to a decision they were coming to very basic decisions and jeremiah auburn was a highsurvival type he wished to be out in front directing matters along the path he favored he had a steward call ahead and have one of his limousines available when they landed and to alert customs to pass him through without the necessity of his going to the administration building it was his standard procedure vips such as jeremiah auburn could be met on their private aircraft and not be bothered with the inconveniences suffered by the common herd in such respects the st century differed not at all from the centuries before it wealth and power had their privileges the limousine sped him to manhattan and through its deserted streets arrogantly remaining on the surface rather than taking the underground highway they pulled up before the minor entrance on the side street behind the towering office building which was his destination he entered the building fishing in his pockets for his key ring and the small silver key for his private elevator the elevator sped him up to the highlevel floor he used for his personal offices and living quarters while he was in residence he emerged into the reception room and nodded at the dazzlingly smiling girl at the desk oh good afternoon mr auburn she gushed rising weve been expecting you sir wizard he told her brusquely tell barry wimple ill see him in my quarters in five minutes yes mr auburn she simpered for christs sake he thought inwardly lets not be too damned effervescent as he pushed his way through to the office behind it was staffed with two neatly suited accountant types and two gorgeous efficientlooking women who could have landed tridi parts portraying brisk secretaries of upperechelon corporation executives they were all deftly at work when he entered whether makework or not he didnt know they all stood and chorused smiled greetings and he nodded back while striding across the room he had a suspicion that if hed said miss jones come into my apartments i want to lay you not one of the four would have blinked an eye and miss jones would have trotted after him he had a dozen such staffs in half a dozen countries throughout the globe simmons was waiting for him in the living room ramrodstiff subservient just to the correct point not sickeningly so welcome home mr auburn he said jerry looked around the lush room did you think this was home he growled he headed for the bar adding over his shoulder i came without luggage check to see if all my needs are available tell the chef whats his name here henri that ill probably dine in the apartment tonight alone yes sir of course yes its henri sir hes anxious that you taste his new dish based on shad roe wizard jerry said taking up a cognac bottle from the bar and pouring into a glass generously the butler faded jerry sat down on a couch put his feet up on a cocktail table and took a pull at the drink barry wimple entered from the door that led to the offices he was the epitome of the senior executive jerry auburn sometimes wondered if they took courses in grooming at new harvard business college he had never seen a senior executive who wasnt groomed to his teeth he suspected that the others clothing bill was greater than his own welcome back mr auburn wimple said was your trip to europe satisfactory jerry regarded him coolly how did you know i went to europe the other looked at him in distress why mr auburn captain wayland of your air yacht recorded it in his report jerry made a note to do something about that he didnt like anybody at all to know where he was at any given time but obviously wayland had to make reports on his expenditures costs of fuel landing fees and so on he said barry i want you to get a few heavies in here when im in residence heavies mr auburn hard types guards and i dont want you to hire them from mercenaries incorporated ive got reason to believe there might be a contract out on me get them from some competitor of the graf his new york office head blinked at him a contract you mean but sir thats ridiculous who could possibly want you not everybody loves me like you do barry so six guards i want them here this afternoon inconspicuously and i want them to shake down anybody who comes to see me this afternoon yes preferably but especially tonight is lester here yes mr auburn and ted meer as well as you instructed lester was a carbon copy of barry wimple fifteen years younger one glance marked him as an efficient supercilious wasp who would wind up a millionaire by middle age almost without trying jerry nodded at his greeting and said lester i want you to find out who is the head of mercenaries incorporated in north america have him here this evening tell him that the meeting is confidential im assuming that new york is his base of operations lester stared at him blankly a touch of dismay there mercenaries incorporated sir you heard me if theyre here and they should be there must be some manner of contacting them start earning your pay damn it dont you know any upper slot news people or someone in the iabi either should know wimple cleared his throat i have a niece who is married to a captain of detectives in the interamerican bureau of investigation mr auburn that ought to do it anything else pressing on the agenda barry his senior aide said theres a representative from the lagrangists waiting to see you sir when the order came for your limousine i took the liberty of informing him that you were to be here this afternoon and that you might work him into your schedule hes on his way of course if you havent the time lagrangists jerry said you mean from lagrange five what does he want he wouldnt say sir he wanted to discuss it with you face to face he was upset when i told him that you had retired and seldom devoted time to business matters anymore jerry grunted send him into my office when he arrives i dont believe ive ever met a real space colonist before brief me barry how much have we currently got invested in lagrange five and the asteroid belt islands two hundred and twelve million and ah some change mr auburn largely in the satellite solar power plants jerry grunted again that much all right you two get going ill see the lagrangist in my office and the mercenaries incorporated bastard here in my quarters both as soon as theyve arrived and remember barry i want the new guards to frisk them before they see me the two left as they crossed the outer office lester said to his higherup hes a tough sonofabitch wimple looked at him from the side of his eyes id probably be the same if i had inherited a few billion jerry auburn was idly looking at some reports he wouldnt ordinarily have bothered with when the man from lagrange five was announced he hadnt known what he had expected among other things possibly an older man than this if the other was an official representative from the space islands ian venner was disgustingly healthy looking he must have been exactly the height and weight that the insurance statistics averaged out on a man of his age he was a sunfaded blond sharp blue of eye with a good mouth on the wide and dry humorous side and a strong chin he looked as though he either owned the place or didnt give a damn who did sit down mr venner jerry said even while sizing the other up just venner the newcomer said crisply we dont use the term mister in lagrangia jerry said why not it is derived from the word master and i dont wish to be anyones master any more than i want someone else to be mine jerry refrained from twisting his mouth in amusement what can i do for you venner the space federation is desirous of buying out your holdings in space auburn ive been sent to make initial contact man you dont waste words what federation i dont usually handle this sort of thing i have aides who make business decisions in which i seldom involve myself i didnt even know there was a federation in lagrangia the other nodded not as though he approved of jerry auburns divorcing himself from the details of his enterprises but as though he had already heard of the fact he said recently a looseknit organization has been formed to represent the united needs of lagrangia and the belt islands jerry scowled united states of the americas common europe the soviet complex the reunited nations or a combination of two or more or all of them no the federation represents only space colonists actually living in space we have no other affiliations dont be ridiculous jerry growled every island in space is controlled by either some earthside nation the reunited nations or by consortiums of multinational corporations his visitor was shaking his head times are changing one by one were buying out private interests in lagrangia and the asteroids and most of the new islands are colonized from the older islands but have no political ties to them or to the original nations which first founded them jerry was staring at him now this was absolutely new there wasnt much news about the space projects any more they were being played down drastically as budgets were being cut on the space program still he should have heard of this he said you mean to tell me that up in space you people get together and build a new island that has no affiliation whatsoever to earthside private enterprise or to any specific nation thats correct were tired of misguidance from ah earthworms earthworms the lagrangist wasnt without humor he laughed lightly and said an old joke jerry said but buying out my interests in solar power and such where the hell would you get the credits one of my executives just informed me i have over two hundred million in investments in space the other agreed to that from the first pay in space has been astronomical compared to that earthside and frankly there is comparatively little to spend it on we dont particularly go for ostentatious living conspicuous consumption we have no desire to keep up with the joneses or have a larger house or boat in those islands large enough to have suitable bodies of water than our neighbors i dont mean that there are any rules against it but we simply dont do it we pile up the credits some of the more energetic among us began to put scientific and industrial space developments to work for exports artificial diamonds for instance now we have enough money to buy out earthside interests and uh i believe the term you use down here is to nationalize them why jerry said blankly his visitor sighed for one thing you earthworms are usually unable to identify with our problems you send instructions that are ridiculous considering the situations that apply often you send directives to expand in some direction in which expansion is pure nonsense or refuse to divert funds to some effort which is absolutely necessary its something like england running the thirteen colonies from three thousand miles away the british had no conception of the problems that faced american colonists jerry auburn was astonished he came to his feet and made his way over to his office bar his face in thought drink he said the lagrangist said you wouldnt have any reman riesling would you top earthside wines are one of the few things we havent been able to duplicate in lagrangia were working on it he added quickly i have some jerry murmured still in his other thoughts he filled glasses and returned to his desk extending his visitor the dry white wine after settling back into his chair and swallowing some of his brandy he said so the space colonists are attempting to cut ties with mother earth some mother the other said wryly more like a stepmother how do you mean earth has from the beginning only exploited lagrangia and the belt islands almost all the profits are funneled back to earth rather than being used for continued expansion of the space program a corporation wants immediate dividends not uh pie in the sky a century from now we have a different view weve got a different dream jerry was becoming increasingly intrigued so youre having trouble with earth such as the other took another sip of his wine appreciatively he looked at the multibillionaire and said almost all funds for the space programs have been cut to ribbons its practically impossible for a top scientist or technician from whatever country to get permission to migrate to the space islands even ordinary folk are highly discouraged from leaving for lagrangia or the asteroids whenever we make a scientific breakthrough in the islands we immediately rush the details earthside but of recent years the earth nations do not reciprocate they keep their discoveries to themselves why should we do that venner shrugged and frowned before answering were not sure maybe were going too fast in the islands the earthside powers are afraid well upset the boat come up with changes that will threaten the status quo were contributing to future shock with a vengeance sooner or later almost every earth institution will be threatened with change as a result of developments in space probably true jerry thought about it before saying these new developments of yours what kind of political system have you dreamed up were experimenting with a halfdozen alternatives the other flashed a grin of deprecation none of them very similar to anything now prevailing earthside ill be damned jerry said then look with emigration being deliberately discouraged how are you populating these new islands of the federation the other looked him straight in the eye partially from natural increase we still like kids in the space colonies but even more so from the original islands jerry looked at him quizzically wouldnt the original islands take a dim view of losing their inhabitants in that manner ian venner wasnt fazed some of them do especially in the belt id think the soviet complex would send the kgb up en masse they do and they defect for that matter so do the iabi men and those from the common europe interpol while chasing felons whove run to lagrangia my own never mind he finished smiling to himself jesus jerry muttered ill have to have my people do me a brief on this i had no idea he scrutinized the lagrangist again how are racial problems in lagrangia and the asteroids what race problems jerry was impatient you know conflict between the races blacks whites yellows the man from lagrangia was just as impatient auburn he interrupted when youre out in deep space and something happens to your suit you dont give a good goddamn whether the person next to you is black yellow or green death only comes in one color in space all humans cooperate or they die we pay no more attention to a persons race than his religion if he has any which he most likely doesnt jerry said come again venner was still impatient thats one of the reasons were on the shit list the prophet has been pulling out all the stops when it comes to space colonization he found out about twenty years ago that there wasnt a single church in lagrange five and demanded that he be allowed to build a united church mission in our island one obviously we couldnt care less so he built it and manned it but nobody came eh jerry auburn was amused oh we all came once in fact some came back again for the second time for laughs good grief auburn any emigrants to the space colonies are screened to hell and gone not for just competence in their line of work but for intelligence education ability quotient how many of them do you think can believe in the religious mythologies of the jews the christians the moslems the buddhists the shintoists or any of the rest and if we tried to teach the genesis account noahs ark and the rest do you think any of them would swallow it sorry jerry got up and went over to the bar to refresh their drinks he returned with them and said i begin to see why you people are getting uptight so youve been rather quietly acquiring all private investments in space that you can get your hands on as fast as you can finance it but why approach me directly why not resort to various stock exchanges and buy up a controlling interest in auburn space development incorporated ian vernier said its a question we debated however your grandfather was one of the first to invest in lagrange five and he did it with no strings attached he didnt make quick initial profits and keep them earthside for two decades he reinvested all income from space back into the projects when he died your father continued the policy and he didnt use earthworm directors he was the first to have sense enough to appoint experienced lagrangists usually secondgeneration colonists nor have we had any interference from you since you have inherited the auburn interests so we decided in all fairness that we should consult you without the bullshit you did it thats a fact jerry auburn said he thought about it for long moments during which time the other held his peace he sipped at his brandy until the glass was empty then put it down and turned to one of the screens on his desk he flicked it on and when a face faded in said barry make arrangements to sell all our interests in auburn space development to the space federation i have a gentleman here in my office named ian venner from lagrangia go over the details with him youll have to relay this to central and to sillitoe in london and flaker in berlin but first buy what common shares you can and add them to our holdings you turn over barry wimple gaped but jerry flicked the switch again and turned back to the equally gaping lagrangist venner said but look we make a policy of paying cash when weve accumulated enough credits to swing our latest acquisition this was to be the largest thus far we dont want to be saddled with paying interest for no interest jerry said flatly im turning my space properties over to your federation he stood and extended a hand perhaps someday youll be able to do a favor for me meanwhile you can use those credits youve accumulated the hard way to buy up some other properties the move is on venner to create a world government if such elements as the united church are in control of that world state you people are going to be in the soup youd better make yourselves as independent as possible as soon as possible the lagrangist still in something of a daze shook hands he said hesitantly which was out of character for him i dont know what motivates you auburn but i assume that youve thought this out and i can assure you that the federation is most anxious to grant that favor jerry smiled suddenly no racism in space eh the other was mystified thats right there hasnt been from the beginning when ian venner was gone jerry went back to his living room got a double brandy from the bar and spread himself out on a couch he remained there for a couple of hours staring unseeingly out the huge window which overlooked manhattan from time to time he got up to replenish the glass at one time he said aloud what in hell am i doing in this position and ten minutes later he answered himself i was born into it it had grown dark outside by the time the identity screen buzzed on the door leading to the offices he sat erect and looked over it was lester jerry said yeah a slight slur in his voice mr luca cellini is here sir send him in the door opened and an alertlooking stranger entered in his late thirties he could have been one of jerrys staff so far as appearance was concerned he was dark of complexion in the sicilian tradition clean and handsome of features sharp of eye he took the room in completely in one quick sweep then turned to its occupant jerry got up and went over to the bar for still another drink saying over his shoulder sit down cellini youre the grafs local man the newcomer seated himself in a comfort chair and crossed his legs adjusting his beautifully tailored trousers he said thats right mr auburn and for both hemispheres of the americas what can i do for you jerry came back reseated himself on the couch and viewed the other he said finally what would you take to sell out the graf luca cellini stared at him for a long moment then he said first of all nine lives like a cat jerry said nothing took a sip of his drink cellini leaned forward a bit mr auburn he said i dont want to antagonize you i know who you are and i know how much weight you can throw even the graf wouldnt want to antagonize you however ive been working for lothar von brandenburg for over twenty years one of his scouts brought me off the streets when i was a kid ive been with him ever since he even sent me to school now im settled in the organization the pays good more than i could ever have expected with my background in short mr auburn i owe the graf hes been more than a father to me jerry took another pull at the drink without removing his eyes from the other he said slowly the grafs a hasbeen mercenaries are rapidly becoming a thing of the past and so is selling arms to wouldbe revolutionists already latin america once a lucrative field of operation for you is now part of the united states and sealed off from your operations and thats just the beginning world government is on the way when it comes there will be little use anywhere for mercenaries and illicit arms sales hit men for the death wish policies will be gone since such policies will be illegal with a world state therell be a great falloff in bodyguarding and assassinations since most of them are international and there wont be any nations the graf is hedging his bets trying to get into the upper hierarchy of the world club so hell have a place in the new scheme of things you rankandfile employees will largely be dropped so looking out for your own interests youd better get out while you can luca cellini had not worked his way up to his present standing in the grafs organization by being slow he said mind if i smoke jerry shook his head the new yorker took out a gold cigar case and from it drew a panatela the end had already been pierced he brought forth a gold lighter and lit the long cigar carefully he said i couldnt sell out the graf hed get me no matter where i tried to hide just as easily as he gets those deathwish policy suckers few of them last a week jerry nodded taking back more of the drink that he didnt need his eyes were already shining in the characteristic way they did after a halfliter of spirits he said try this wed arrange a shootout in which you were involved youd supposedly take a couple of hits and the ambulance would haul you off to a clinic owned by a doctor on my payroll hed operate on you making a few impressivelooking scars and possibly taking a half inch or so out of one of your shin bones so youd be left with a noticeable limp when you were released from the clinic the doctors report would read that you were ninety percent disabled possibly one of your kidneys shot away or something my people know how to do it youd report to the graf or peter windsor or whoever you report to that you have to retire so you go to some island paradise like samoa and settle down living the good life in retirement on whatever pension the graf settles on you and especially the sum i give you you stay there at least until mercenaries incorporated is gone from the scene possibly lothar von brandenburg as well possibly you spend the rest of your life where youre not apt to run into any of your present associates so the question is still what would you want to sell out the graf luca cellini was staring again and breathing deeper now he said could i have a drink his host motioned with his head toward the bar cellini went over to it and poured himself a triple from the same bottle his host had used he swallowed part of it and returned to his chair he said one million pseudodollars taxfree and untraceable jerry nodded in agreement very well as you leave lester will make arrangements with you to deposit that amount to whatever account you prefer i assume that you have at least one secret account in nassau tangier or wherever cellini nodded i know you dont welch mr auburn i trust you what did you want from me what happened to harold dunninger he was kidnapped by the nihilists when his wife wouldnt pony up the ransom they hit him i know what was in the news how did you set it up the other moistened his lips i was supplying his bodyguards there were twelve of them four on a shift i pulled four of them off at the crucial time supposedly rotating them the orders came from windsor the nihilist who pulled off the kidnapping was one of ours weve had him planted with them for years he placed the ransom amount so high that there wasnt a chance dunningers wife would pay it wed checked her out to make sure whats the name of your mole in the nihilists nils ostrander new subject what happened to pamela mcgivern cellini shook his head never heard of her jerry thought about it for a moment then accepted that and said what else has been going on under your jurisdiction weve diverted all our best men to hitting the deathwish wobbly who jerry scowled roy cos a screwball radical who took out a deathwish policy instead of blowing the credits coming to him like all the rest hes devoted it to buying prime time so he can sound off against the system hes surrounded himself with a flock of guards all devoted to him and we havent been able to get through hes scheduled to show in a couple of days all the screwball outfits are getting together in chicago for what they call a synthesis meeting hes supposed to represent the wobblies i guess i have heard about him jerry said his voice deeper in its slur now his eyes brighter he was obviously at least half drenched in booze what else nothing much they sent over a new man from the wolfschloss cellini looked up thats the i know jerry said the grafs fortress in liechtenstein goon kid named franklin pinell cellini growled its not the way the organization usually operates windsor said to cooperate with him one hundred percent handle him with kid gloves grafs orders jerry eyed him whats he supposed to do hit a spade named horace hampton evidently never heard of hampton jerry auburns face froze all of a sudden he didnt seem quite so influenced by the drink hed been putting down why he got out damned if i know theres a contract on him why we couldnt have handled it is a mystery to me routine stuff after a moment jerry said anything else cant think of anything wizard go out to lester hell cover you with all that weve agreed on the executive came to his feet looked at the man who had just bought him then without further words turned and headed for the door jerry finished his drink went over to the living rooms small desk and sat down before the screen there he flicked it on and said ted meer when the face of his aide appeared he said check as deeply as you can on these men first a franklin pinell all i know about him is that hes young has recently been in europe including liechtenstein and is connected with mercenaries incorporated evidently on a high level second roy cos the socalled deathwish wobbly third a nils ostrander of the nihilists evidently one of their more militant members possibly connected with some of their more flagrant operations and oh yes who are we currently using for our private investigations in common europe his aide said were still using pinkerton international mr auburn very well get them to put allout effort into checking a pamela mcgivern an irish girl recently employed as a secretary by the world club at their headquarters in the palazzo colonna in rome she disappeared about a week or so ago this is crash priority meer i want results immediately yes sir jerry auburn flicked the screen off sighed and went back to the bar in the morning he had a raging hangover he went into the bathroom and got a bottle of soberups from the medicine cabinet shuddered and took one still in pajamas he went into the living room and stretched out on the couch after touching a button set into its armrest simmons entered immaculately correct he took one look at his employer and said sadly yes sir wipe that goddamned superior longsuffering look off your face and bring me about a gallon of italian expresso yes sir the butler left jerry auburn went through the agony of the steppedup recuperation from overindulgence when he at last felt semihealthy he groaned took himself over to the desk and flicked on the screen ted meer appeared looking weary as though he hadnt been to bed the night before jerry said nastily why in the hell dont you take pep pills when youve got a siege before you he knew that his aide had an aversion to stimulants but was in no mood to sympathize yes sir the other said well what have you found out we have the dossier complete of roy cos as well as his activities of the last weeks since he has broken into the news the material is on your desk we have drawn a blank on nils ostrander it is obviously an assumed name the iabi is on the verge of arresting him in connection with the kidnapping and death of harold ounninger but thus far has insufficient evidence with which to operate there is a vague hint that higher ups are protecting him though that would seem impossible shit it is jerry muttered go on franklin pinell was recently deported from the united states after four felony sentences the last of which was a homicide he was sent to tangier but he never reported to the moroccan police he is the son of the late willard pinell known in mercenary circles as buck pinell the elder pinell in partnership with lothar von brandenburg founded mercenaries incorporated over twenty years ago present location of franklin pinell is unknown jerry said hes here in the states if hes a deportee undoubtedly under an alias and with false papers put the pinkertons on his trail what about pamela mcgivern there hasnt been sufficient time for much of a report save that she has not returned to ireland her family lives in dublin they havent heard from her for a month jerry thought over what he had been told for a few moments then said keep at it if anything important breaks get in touch with me immediately keep digging on this franklin pinell and get some background on his father buck find out everything you can about him especially his relationship with lothar von brandenburg he hesitated then went on i also want to check out a lee garrett including all the dope you can get on her father and mother who evidently werent married shes currently in residence at the palazzo colonna in rome and has the job formerly held by pamela mcgivern check for any hankypanky there might have been in her being selected by the computers for her job there i dont want a cursory report on this i want deep digging its extremely difficult but not impossible to jimmy the computers or the data banks yes sir ted meer said anything else mr auburn no ill get in touch ted jerry turned off the screen and ran his hand over his facial stubble he thought some more then reached for the screen again touching the stud that would deactivate the video he dialed slowly remembering the digits max finklesteins face appeared frowning at the fact that his own screen was blank who is it he said rubbing the end of his armenian nose in irritation hamp jerry said horace hampton how the hell do i know its hamp max said irritably the last time i saw you we had our faces buried in the leaves behind the we shall overcome motel with tom horse and joe zavalla somethings wrong with my damn transceiver all right the other said what spins hamp im tired of being on leave what do you want me to do youll have to check with national headquarters hamp im not running you anymore ive been promoted to the national executive committee im being sent up to chicago to represent the antiracist league at the synthesis meeting jerry blinked this was better than he could have expected his mind racing he said ive heard a little about that meeting max some of it disquieting i want in max finklestein said why puzzlement in his voice as muscle among others roy cos is going to be there and so is nils ostrander i know about cos but whos nils ostrander the nihilist who engineered the kidnap killing of that multimillionaire harold dunninger theres an off chance that the iabi might try to pick him up at the meeting max said suspiciously how in the name of christ do you know sticking my ears out ever since this roy cos character has been sounding off everybody and his cousin have been talking about the different radical organizations not just the wobblies but all radicals the idea of fundamental change is in the air max considered it he finally nodded and said all right ill check it out with the executive committee but theyll undoubtedly okay it each organization is allowed two delegates you might as well be my partner suppose we meet there wizard jerry said see you max he cut the screen then flicked on the video again and the switch for his harassed aide ted meers face came on jerry said one more thing ted plant a news story and i mean really plant it so that nobody who listens to the news at all could possibly miss it the story is that horace hampton an alleged suspect in the recent attack on governor teeter will be present representing the antiracist league at the synthesis meeting to be held by radical groups in chicago his aide said yes mr auburn that name again horace hampton damn it take some pep pills he flicked off then immediately back on again he dialed and almost immediately his own face was there on the screen he said hi jim what spins his double grinned at him i still think ive got the best goddamn job in the world jerry laughed you probably have at that you chronic hedonist i do all the work you have all the fun and between us were jeremiah auburn okay jim youre to surface again immediately this time drop the recluse bit go to one of the gambling resorts monte carlo or nice drop a hundred thousand or so at roulette or whatever enough so that itll be picked up by the news people and have society commentators asking whether jerry auburn is coming out of seclusion to rejoin the rocket set got it jim said great back to the high life do i need to know what its all about no not necessary jerrys face broke into another fond grin just be sure to remember the names of people you meet and what you did with them especially the mopsies you might lay you damned screwing machine well have to get together again one of these days jim and bend a few elbows its been a long time since weve sat across a table from each other and tossed back a few theres something weird about getting drenched and sitting across from you yourself tell me about it jim said the last time i didnt recover for days and it wasnt just because i was looking at my own face jerry laughed and flicked the screen off touched another switch this time barry wimples face came on jerry said ill be leaving town again barry dismiss the staff you and ted and lester check into central of course i dont know how long itll be before im back this time his senior executive was aghast but mr auburn ive got a dozen toppriority matters thats what i pay you for barry jerry said brushing aside the others complaint the decisions are up to you and the rest of your boys when you start making bad ones its your ass meanwhile i want the staff cleared out of here before noon yes sir the old man said unhappily jerry turned him off then slumped in his chair for a moment and took a deep breath before heading for the master bedroom he passed through it into the dressing room went into the bath and to the medical cabinet which he opened with a small key to bring forth a hypodermic needle minutes later he returned to the dressing room he sat down before the mirror pulled out a drawer and took up the small box containing his colored contact lenses doc jekyll meet comrade hyde he muttered chapter twentyone horace hampton horace hampton looked up at the lanky stoopshouldered man who hovered over his table in the automated bar grinning down at him thought id find you here max finklestein said its the nearest bar to assembly halls hi max hamp said have some of this synthobeer how did shakespeare put it weaker than womans tears or something they ought to stick it back in the horse not up to your usual standards eh the older man said even as he slid into a chair opposite the black he put his credit card in the tables payment slot and dialed for a mug of the brew hamp looked at him whats that supposed to mean old chumpal the center of the table sank down to return with the beer max took a drink of it then wiped the coarse foam from his lips it means that usually you drink more expensive stuff than the proles have to put up with the others look turned quizzical how do you know ive been checking up on you wizard and whatve you found that youre not exactly a downandout nigger subsisting on gas max grinned at him in deprecation thats the trouble with you kikes hamp said nosy max finklestein said i was sitting around one day minding my own business when the thought came to me that the antiracist league was in better funds than it should be most of the membership consists of minority elements whod contribute a lot to the cause if they could but they cant theyre largely on gas somehow the organization never seems to lack sufficient funds though so purely out of curiosity i began checking on the source of the larger donations that come through and guess what i found i know what you found hamp said he finished his beer and dialed another max said why all the secrecy why not just openly donate it in one lump sum instead of here and there in dribbles hamp sighed and said because im of the opinion that a race a nationality or a social class should finance its own emancipation you mustnt hand somebody freedom on a platter suppose i came out and gave a million pseudodollars to the antiracist league in a flat sum then the membership as a whole would stop their pathetically small donations as meaningless but its not meaningless for a man to give up his guzzle his sometime extravagance or his occasional splurge for a cause he believes in its not meaningless for him to sacrifice its part of his fight for freedom quite a speech max said whered you get all this money hamp or is it a secret are you a bigtime crook thats all the organization needs in the way of publicity one of its most active members turning out to be a crook hamp sighed come off it max its according to what you mean by crook i suppose yesterday i tuned in on this deathwish wobbly who were supposed to get together with tonight according to him the whole upper class is composed of crooks their wealth has been stolen from the useful workers so youre upper class i suppose so its a long story max the other looked at his wrist chronometer weve got time hamp sighed again it starts with a slave down in south carolina pod hampton i havent a violin to play so ill skip the details of the hard time he had when he finally lit out he took old massas silver with him in fact the kind old massa was on the rich side and some of the socalled silver was gold pod managed to get it and himself up to boston and there he swore a great oath understand he wasnt going to spend any of his ah illgotten gains on himself instead he was going to invest it and use the proceeds to fight for freeing his people at that time there was no valid organization putting up such a fight he thought the abolitionists were a bunch of impractical dogooders a bunch of starryeyed whiteys who beneath it all believed that blacks really were inferior and should be pampered like children by those who were good of heart rather than being exploited as slaves he continued to invest the money railroads mainly when he died both the securities and the dream went to his oldest son who if anything was even more solidly antiracist than the old man he managed the investments some land in the socalled great american desert really paid off but didnt spend much of it on himself during his lifetime the civil war took place but it didnt take any genius to see that the freed blacks werent much better off than they had been as slaves and there was still no organization that seemed fit to turn the money over to those were the boom times of industrialization and the money was still largely in railroads it grew it grew still more under his son and along here somewhere it became obvious that not spending any of it no longer made sense the fortune needed fulltime management office employees and so forth the next son dropped railroads and went into automobiles max whistled softly hamp went on after dialing still another synthobeer these sons all continued the dream they were devoted to ending racism theyd progressed beyond the point of fighting for black rights alone they were also smart enough not to throw the fortune away on lost causes they were hanging onto it until the right time and the right organization came along the fortune was kept as secret as possible and they led very simple lives while managing it remember they were smart one by one as new developments such as radio the airplane and later electronics came along they got in on the ground floor for instance one of them helped launch ibm back in the s that would explain it without the other stuff said max and along in here came a new development it wasnt practical to live like misers while hoarding a fortune that would one day be used to end world racism to manage a modern fortune youve got to be educated in top schools youve got to have the correct social and financial contacts which are often the same people in short youve got to move in the right circles its all part of the great fortunes game a rockefeller a mellon a rothschild cant operate out of a sleazy flat in harlem at any rate max im the current holder of the purse strings and the antiracist league is being doled out all the funds i feel it can handle at this point max was eyeing him ill be damned he said that fortune must be kingsize by now it is hamp said dryly and the present descendant of pod hampton still has the dream max said but for christs sake you shouldnt be risking yourself carrying out extreme assignments for the organization hamp looked at him flatly i refuse to finance activities that im not willing to take on myself if indians like tom horse and chicanes like jose zavalla are willing to take the risks they do so is horace hampton max nodded acceptance of that stand right he said i assume you want me to keep this to myself if i thought you couldnt i wouldnt have told you hamp said max looked at his wrist chronometer again i suppose we ought to get going the synthesis committee has rented a small hall for the meeting only delegates are to be admitted and their bodyguards as they stood hamp looked over at him questioningly max laughed i assume nobodyll have bodyguards besides roy cos that rule was made with him in mind from what i hear they average two attempts on his life a day the poor bastard they headed for the door yeah hamp growled every hit man in mercenaries incorporated has zeroed in on him they went out onto the street and headed for the assembly halls a commercial building devoted to a score of rentable halls ranging from a large auditorium to small lecture rooms that would hold audiences of fifty or so max was eyeing his companion strangely how do you know he said hamp covered just guessing it makes sense its not just that insurance conglomerate that wrote the deathwish policy now poor cos has everybody and his nephew down on him the united church the government of every country in the world that fears revolutionary change the world club god knows who else hes the sorest thumb to show up for many a year max said frowning why the world club the black shrugged they want a world state but under their wing not the kind hes agitating for as they got nearer to the building in which the meeting was to be held the crowd began to manifest itself there were several police cars lights flickering above them a police ambulance and a contingent of uniformed police stationed across the street from the entrance to the halls there was also one tridi unit mounted atop a truck and a couple of hundred curiosity seekers gawking among them were twentyfive or so teenagers of both sexes each carrying a childs baseball bat these latter were dressed identically in prole clothing sweaters and denim shorts hamp said not much of a turnout when you consider cos is exposing himself id think thered be thousands max said cynically the news media has been given orders to play down the deathwish wobbly they cant ignore him entirely news being news and the fact that he might get burned any minute but theyre trying to ease coverage on him and especially this meeting every radical organization going no matter how zany is on roy coss bandwagon whether he wants them or not everybodys beginning to have second thoughts about whether basic changes ought to be made in the worlds socioeconomic systems even in the soviet complex and the peoples republic of china they came up to the entry to the halls just as two heavy limousines slid quickly to the curb immediately before them cos max grunted four men gyrojets swinging from their hips in quickdraw holsters sprang from the first vehicle and immediately dashed back to surround the second one each of them at a corner their hands rested on their guns and their eyes were never still as they scanned the crowd not excluding the police or the tridi crew two of the doors of the second limo opened and three more guards erupted they immediately stationed themselves between the car and the entry and they too had their hands on pistol butts the teenagers with the baseball bats pressed closer between the guards and the building entrance two more men got out of the second limo and looked up and down the street one apprehensively the other as though resigned max said jesus is that the deathwish wobbly colorless looking little guy isnt he forry brown was saying inside lets get inside damn it i dont like to be out in the open like this roy cos grunted and they headed for the door the guards crowding around them now roy coss manager hesitated and looked at one of the kids with the baseball bats who the hell are you he said the boy saluted with his bat were the junior wobblies sir come to help protect comrade cos he wielded the bat as though it was a field marshals baton roy cos looked at him junior wobblies he said there is no such organization if there was i would have heard of it the boy wasnt fazed he looked to be about seventeen man sized but with a teenagers awkwardness weve organized on our own comrade cos we havent had time to get in touch with the national organization for their approval theres fifty of us here surrounding the building if any of these professional mercenaries show up well give em hell ron grunted in disbelief and his hand tightened on his gyrojet but forry shook his head let them alone he said the graf doesnt have any teenagers in his outfit his need is for experienced professionals he clapped the boy on the shoulder carry on kid yes sir hamp and max had joined the wobbly contingent as they entered the building three of the guards going ahead max said to roy cos were the delegates from the antiracist league roy shook hands i suppose you know my name he said and this is forrest brown my business manager max finklestein and horace hampton max introduced them the meetings on the third floor forry said nervously lets get going ron and les got into the elevator alone and rode up to check out the way the other guards packed around roy and forry waiting roy looked over at hamp wanly and said a helluva way to live the black nodded the other was right the elevator returned on the third floor ron and les were waiting the whole group proceeded to a hall down the corridor from which sounds were emanating they were evidently a bit late two members of the synthesis committee were at the door checking credentials roy cos on the face of it hardly needed them but he went through the motions of proving himself a delegate from the wobblies max presented a letter identifying himself and horace hampton the meeting was a bore doomed to failure from its inception the synthesis group which had proposed it was obviously sincere in its desire to unite all the radical elements but as hamp whispered to max finklestein sincerity alone was dull as dishwater there were perhaps thirtyfive present including the synthesis committee the bodyguards and various delegates the leading representatives were those from the wobblies the nihilists the luddites and the libertarians in addition to the antiracists the other delegates were from splinter groups and some splinters from splinters there was even one representative from an organization evidently unknown to the others called technocracy incorporated going at least a century and a half back the technocrats opted for a world government dominated by scientists engineers and technicians he wasnt quite booed down a table in front of the hall acted as a rostrum and each delegation was called upon to give the program of its organization roy spoke for the wobblies max finklestein for the antiracist league a nils ostrander for the nihilists and a blowsy woman named bertha holtz held forth for the libertarians who evidently carried high the banner of the new womens lib and that of the gays as well after these four stars the splinter groups each had their turn turns that dealt almost exclusively with hairsplitting hamp and max had seated themselves next to roy cos and forry brown the guards being strategically placed about the room all standing with their backs to the walls hamp spotted nils ostrander who sat next to a younger very earnestlooking man whose suit was by far the best of any of those present he also spotted the other person he was looking for an athleticlooking young fellow in his early twenties the chairman had introduced him as the sole delegate from one of the smaller organizations back east of which hamp had never heard and suspected that no one else present had either by the time each organization had had its say the chairman was looking distressed indeed downright unhappy he said did anyone else wish to speak hamp stood and said i wouldnt mind doing a little summing up he was invited to the table and stood in front of it rather than behind he looked over them sighed and said this meeting is a farce and i suspect that by this time most of us realize it its been a farce because its purpose is unobtainable the organizations here cant get together because they dont stand for the same things i cant figure out what some of you do stand for everybody here is against something but damn few are for anything coss wobblies at least have a program whether or not its valid but the nihilists proudly announce that they havent all they want to do is tear down the present social system without having anything definite to replace it the libertarians want to reform the present welfare state by granting more gas for all proles by pushing through still further rights for women and gays they arent interested in complete change just reform the luddites want to turn the wheels of progress backwards they want to destroy modern technology and return to the days before automation and computerization when all of the labor force was needed in production distribution and services the trouble is that you cant uninvent things any more than you can unscramble eggs we of the antiracist league have only one thing in common with the luddites our interest isnt in overthrowing peoples capitalism and neither is theirs neither is it the interest of the libertarians in fact in the ranks of antiracists are some who are wealthy and have an interest in maintaining the status quo save on the racial question you see none of us stands for the same thing we cant unite the audience stirred some muttering among themselves nils ostrander the delegate from the nihilists was on his feet angrily thats defeatism quite a few of us stand for the complete dismemberment of the welfare state we ought to get together to pull this rotten system down more mutterings and still more agitation the saturnine max finklestein was looking at his companion in amusement hamp said deliberately ive done a lot of wondering about the nihilists you are a continuation of the terrorists of the late th century such as the symbiosis army here in the states and the sekigun the socalled red army of japan and similar groups in germany and italy antiestablishment but prowhat and given the viewpoint of those who opt for the status quo you serve a very definite need whether you want to be or not you serve as agents provocateurs the assassinations and kidnappings laid at your door serve to turn sincere people of good will away from any movement that proclaims the need for fundamental change people are repelled by what you do in the name of radicalism which puts a chip on their shoulders about all revolutionary groups including the wobblies who foreswear force and violence and want to make their changes through legal means in short youre the kiss of death to all the movements represented here tonight if there was no such organization as the nihilists it would be to the interest of such outfits as the united church the iabi the world club and for that matter mercenaries incorporated to start one they use you to louse up the image of anybody advocating change thats a lie ostrander yelled in indignation is it the black said emptily let me give an example recently the multimillionaire world club man harold dunninger managed to get himself on the shitlist of the united church as well as in the bad graces of some of the higherechelon members of the world club names harrington chase moyer of the iabi and lothar von brandenburg the graf who was anxious to take the place scheduled for dunninger in the top ranks of the world club obviously it wouldnt do for dunninger to be eliminated by one of the grafs men so the job was delegated to the nihilists and the blame put on them thats a lie you bastard i o it isnt ostrander you engineered it yourself youre a mole in the nihilists an agent of the graf the nihilist delegate was gaping at him his face white only partially in anger his younger companion seated next to him was eyeing him strangely hamp shrugged in contempt you pretended it was a kidnapping to raise funds for your organization but you put the ransom so high there was no chance of it being met then you killed him per orders of the graf i dont have the proof with me here tonight but now that ive made the charge i have no doubt that your fellow nihilists will look into the matter the black flicked a hand at the chairman to indicate that he was through and returned to his chair forty brown looked at him amusement on his wizened face you really throw the shit in the fan dont you roy cos was looking thoughtful you know he said i think youre right hamp ive often wondered about what motivates those nihilists theyre just too far around the bend to be true hamps talk had been the finish of the meeting it broke up into squabbles everybody standing as they argued max said mildly what happened to our friend nils ostrander billy tucker had come up worried about the way the gathering was now milling around he said i just saw him light out arguing with that kid with him shouldnt we get out of here hamp said to roy id like to talk to you a little more could it be arranged roy cos said were staying in a suite at the drake just for the night why dont you come over with us right hamp told him but just a minute i want to say something to someone here hurry it up forry brown told him scowling i dont like roy to be exposed to so many people for so long and weve still got to ran the gauntlet in the street by this time the words probably gotten around that the deathwish wobbly is inside this building and there might be a few thousand rubberneckers out there with a few of the grafs men sprinkled among them hamp made his way across the room and confronted one of the delegates who looked as though he was preparing to leave hamp said looking directly into the mans eyes hello pinell i understand youre looking for me the other was too young to be very adept at covering but he tried he said the names merson and i represent your names franklin pinell jerry interrupted flatly and you were sent by the graf and peter windsor to hit me youre the son of the late buck pinell cofounder of mercenaries incorporated who has an account amounting to some fortyfive million pseudodollars in a bank in berne frank pinells eyebrows went up in shock he said how the hell would you know a thing like that i own the bank hamp said now look i want to talk to you but i have something else on the fire right now where are you staying at the drake but wizard thats where im going right now in fact maybe ill register myself ill see you later tonight what name did you say you were going under merson frank said weakly see you later hamp returned to where roy and forry and the bodyguards were waiting forry ever suspicious said who the hell was that hamp granted amusement a guy the graf sent to finish me off maybe ill tell you about it someday some of the delegates were still arguing out in the hall as the group of them headed for the elevator max said to hamp ive got some things to do tonight including a report to the executive committee ill meet you in the morning great hamp told him ill register at the drake the guards took over again at the elevator billy and ron went down first to check out the lobby when the elevator returned the five remaining guards plus roy forry hamp and max all crowded in so did several of the other delegates two of them still arguing forry began to remonstrate about their coming along in this elevator load but roy shook his head wearily and the little exnewsman shrugged it off halfway down roys business manager gave a startled cough max darted a look at him for christs sake he blurted whats wrong the small mans face was wet and shiny and gray of color he had both of his fists clamped tight against his chest his jaw was going up and down as if he was trying to say something that wouldnt come les blurted hes having a heart attack two of the guards grabbed the stricken man by the arms supporting him the elevator came to a halt at the ground floor and the group emerged hauling forry brown with them they headed for a chair hamp yelled at the top of his voice a doctor get a doctor from that police ambulance across the street forry browns eyebrows were high his eyes bulging as though in surprise his jaw continued to move soundlessly and even as they lowered him into the chair he passed out two whitejacketed young men red cross bands around their arms came hurrying in with a stretcher they expertly snaked the stricken man onto it and trotted from the lobby with him ron said ill go along and followed after les was the first to recover from surprised confusion he said to roy lets get out of here theyll take him to the hospital theres nothing we can do and meanwhile for all we know there are a couple of the grafs boys waiting outside roy nodded dumbly hamp said under the circumstances well have to call off our gettogether but the wobbly organizer shook his head no if weve got anything to say to each other we might as well do it theres no guarantee ill last the night the six remaining guards stationed themselves around hamp and their charge as the body of them moved out the door and made a beeline for the limousines roy hamp and billy got into the rear of one two of the guards into the front then the three remaining got into the lead car hamp looked out the window the crowd had grown considerably larger and the teenage kids with their baseball bats held it back very businesslike a halfdrunk prole waved one hand high and yelled ray for deathwish wobbly yeah roy muttered as they took off tbe bodyguards of the wobbly national organizer had their parts down pat by this time they moved with precision and cool efficiency the limousines smoothed up to an entry in the area of the drake hotel the three in the lead vehicle popped out and scouted the vicinity two of them going into the hotel then the three returned to the second limousine and stood alert while its occupants emerged then all moved into the hotel and took the service elevator all of coss basic crew were accommodated in one large suite hamp was introduced to mary ann elwyn and ferd feldmeyer and roy went over to the bar while les told the secretary and speech writer what had happened damn feldmeyer said his plump little mouth looking petulant those cigarettes how bad did it look bad billy said in disgust he passed out but the medics were there immediately nowadays they ought to be able to do something a man no older than forry usually doesnt die from his first heart attack roy had knocked back a first drink he said looking at ferd had he ever had one before not as far as i know ive known him for years and he never mentioned any heart trouble when the drinks had been distributed roy cos looked over at the black he said well we should hear about forry within the hour meanwhile what did you have in mind hampton hamp half emptied his glass he said as you know im from the antiracist league thats my prime interest i wondered what you thought of the world club the story is beginning to surface that theyre in favor of establishing a world state theyre behind bringing all of latin america into the united states and now australia and new zealand i suspect that the common europe countries will be next and i also suspect that such nations as spain portugal and italy will line up overnight and the rest soon after hell even commie countries beginning with cuba and yugoslavia wouldnt be far behind roy said and the black regarded him questioningly it would seem to me that under a world state racism would disappear roy shook his head very emphatically why suppose we had a united states of the world why would that end racism it hasnt been ended in the united states so far sure if it was a world government under the wobbly program thered be no reason for racism but under the status quo suppose the world club took over and made the united church the state religion the prophet does precious little to hide his antisemitism that reactionary harrington chase is hand in glove with him the jews arent about to join up with the united church like so many other smaller religions are most of them these days are agnostics or atheists and wont support any organized religion those who are still orthodox cling to the faith thats held them together for three thousand years so the prophets down on them and if his outfit ever becomes the state religion jews will be in trouble hamp didnt like that but he accepted it he said thats only the jews roy made a gesture of contempt itd be a lot of others too racism isnt an accident its deliberately fostered in a class society when there arent enough good jobs to go around then its handy for a ruling class to have the proles fight among themselves supposedly the reason the blacks cant get decent jobs is because the whites take them all and whites say they cant get jobs because the blacks are moving in on them or the chicanes or the orientals or whoever divide and rule keep the proles at each others throats so theyll never sit down and figure out that they have a common enemy hamp said in disgust you people have onetrack minds whatevers wrong you blame it on the socioeconomic system thats where the blame usually is roy said obviously too soulweary to want to argue the proles go out to fight their war division by division one division carries a banner inscribed pacifism another womens lib another all power to the workers councils another down with racism another clean up the environment end pollution and on and on none of them seem to see that basically its the same war and that if they unite their divisions theyd have an army instead of going out separately and down to defeat hamp said probably a good simile but now we get to the real reason i came up here tonight that deathwish policy of yours are there any provisions restricting your travel roy looked at him and shook his head none at all i can go anywhere in the world that i want i wasnt thinking about the world i was thinking about lagrange five or better still the asteroid belt islands all of them were gaping at him now hamp said to roy look basically youve done what you started out to do youve brought to the attention of the whole world the program of the wobblies people are digesting it whether or not theyll buy it is another thing im inclined to doubt it as it stands now your time is probably limited to hours the grafs hit men are the most experienced on earth and now i believe theyre all concentrated on you all of them in this country at least so you take off from the space shuttleport in new mexico for space station goddard there you transfer to a shuttle headed for island one of the lagrange five project from there you take the next ore freighter to the asteroid belt select an island most suited to your needs and spend the rest of your life there probably bankrupting whatever damned company signed that deathwish policy of yours billy said doubtfully though liking it okay but then he doesnt get the message over hamp glowered at him damn it hes already got the message over but he can continue spouting his propaganda from the belt all he has to do is tape his talks and beam them back earthside for broadcasting besides that hed have lots of time on his hands he wouldnt be leading the life of a hunted animal he could write a book about the wobbly program he could turn out a raft of pamphlets and articles good grief mary ann said her eyes wide she looked at her lover who was still staring at the black man there was hope in her face hamp said urgency in his voice dont you see youd be safe out there among other things there are no hit men flitting around on the islands it takes all the clearance in the world to get into space at all and it takes a full year for a spacecraft to get from lagrange five to the asteroid belt which is halfway to jupiter if one of the grafs men tried to get through to you theyd have him spotted months before he ever arrived and hed be well aware of the fact that even if he did get through and did you in thered be no way he could get safely back lagrangists are a rough and ready lot billy said if roy goes les and i go too and probably ron just to be sure mary ann nodded and so do i roy took a deep tired breath and said none of us goes he turned his eyes to hamp thanks for the good intentions but the restrictions on going into space are endless youve got to have some ability that they need out there youve got to be a scientist or some kind of technician or highly experienced worker in construction or electronics or whatever i dont have any such ability and i doubt if any of the rest of us here do one of their strictest requirements is that you have an iq of at least i dont you have to have a far above average ability quotient i dont id be a parasite out there even if theyd let me come which they wouldnt all eyes went back to hamp mary anns were sick as though he had overfed a false hope thats where i come in hamp said he brought forth his pocket transceiver activated it and said information put me through to ian venner of the lagrangia asteroid belt federation he is now in new york as their representative he waited long moments for the connection to be put through silence permeated the suites living room there came a tiny voice from the transceiver and hamp said venner this is auburn im calling you about that favor sooner than i had expected he paused then said good i am in the company of roy cos perhaps you have heard of the deathwish wobbly yes thats him i want him and several of his friends to become space colonists in the belt they wont meet your usual requirements they will undoubtedly remain for the rest of their lives unless some very basic changes take place here earthside he listened for long moments then said wizard oh venner i consider your obligation to me now terminated thanks and goodbye he switched off the communicator and looked back at roy he said softly if you can make it to the shuttleport venners people will take over there the wobbly organizers lips were pale it was then the phone screen buzzed mary ann in a daze went to it she said blankly its ron at the hospital billy got it out first hows forry but mary ann was listening shaking her head as though in disbelief finally she switched the screen off she turned back to them and said simply he didnt make it and then it wasnt a heart attack it was murder it couldnt have been roy blurted i was right there mary ann said emptily something long very thin very sharp something like an antique womans hatpin stuck up through the diaphragm perforating the heart and flooding it with blood he would have yelled les said in utter disbelief she said maybe but from what the doctors told ron at first hed only feel mild discomfort and especially if he had any lung or stomach or digestive disorders he wouldnt particularly have noticed the pain but then the pressure would slow the heart down until it stopped hed feel faint breathless dizzy as though hed had a small aortal attack hed be dead in five minutes roy said emptily it was meant for me hamp stood up and looked at the wobbly organizer no it was meant for forrest brown the guards were too tight around you its gotten to the point where the grafs men are out to get anybody associated with you anybody helping you he looked at roy coss secretary including ms elwyn thats why youd better make a beeline for that shuttleport in new mexico cos roy cos stood too and said whats all this to you hampton i dont even know you certainly youre no wobbly but youve gone far out of your way to extend a life id given up hamp tossed his head brushing it off youre a man cos and i believe in a man having a chance to have his say what was the quote of voltaire i disagree with what you say but will defend with my life your right to say it a lot of your program doesnt come through to me for one thing i think youre out of the times maybe up there in the belt youll learn some things and update what you stand for and maybe just maybe theyll learn some things from you chapter twentytwo jeremiah auburn hamp stood before the identity screen on the hotel door and looked at it sardonically the door buzzed open and he entered the room was on the small austere side considering that this was the ageold prestigious drake frank pinell was seated watching a news commentator now he took in the chocolate features of the newcomer without expression without waiting for an invitation hamp went over to the autobar and dialed himself a double brandy he brought the snifter glass back and settled himself into the rooms second chair frank reached over to click the screen off but hamp said no just a minute whats he saying the commentator was saying and if the victims identification is genuine the notorious luca cellini long suspected by the iabi to be lothar von brandenburgs top representative in the americas has been shot to death on the streets of new york ill be damned hamp said peter windsor is even more efficient than i thought the younger man had been staring bugeyed at the commentator now he shakily reached out and turned down the audio he sucked in air before saying to the black you know peter windsor yes one of the most competent snakes this side of the garden of eden how he learned that cellini had sold out ill probably never know sold out frank said i i was just talking to him a few days ago yes i know hamp said taking an appreciative sip of his cognac he was how i found out that windsor and the graf had sent you to finish me off frank said a touch of irritation in his voice if you knew that why in the devil have you come here arent you afraid ill carry out the assignment no hamp said why did they send you im not too clear about the details evidently it was more or less a standard assignment somebody in the world club wanted you eliminated hamp stared at him the world club wanted horace hampton eliminated yes if i understand correctly theyre becoming increasingly conscious of the part the antiracist league might play when the world state begins to embrace thirdworld countries but why me im not even a member of the executive committee just a field worker if i have it right there are some strange angles to your dossier complete youre kind of a mystery figure youre also said to be the antiracist leagues most efficient man somebody figured that if half a dozen of your key members were eliminated it would be considerably easier to control the organization ill be damned hamp said thoughtfully he finished his brandy went back to the autobar and dialed another he looked at his reluctant host want a drink its a pleasure for me to be knocking back guzzle that the graf will eventually pay for beer frank said hamp dialed the brew brought it over and resumed his own place frank said cautiously why did you think i wasnt a danger to you because youre a fake when i told you i own the bank your father used in berne i wasnt joking i own controlling interests in various other banks as well when cellini told me youd been sent to hit me i had you checked out and then your father as well all right great but why do you say im a fake you were deported picking tangier tangier is the biggest base of mercenaries incorporated outside liechtenstein anybody wanting to make contact with the organization couldnt do better than to go there you were deported because you had supposedly committed four felonies and the legal computers automatically ordered your deportation what do you mean supposedly frank said his voice flat the first two felonies well they were probably genuine certainly the first one back when you were a kid kind of a kids prank which turned sour but the third one and the fourth nope you faked them the murder the crime that made it definite that youd be deported you didnt commit you confessed to it but you didnt do it the way my agents reconstructed the thing you hung around in the most rugged area of detroit possibly the toughest big city in the country during the most dangerous time of night for a period of weeks eventually you found what you were looking for a fresh corpse you set the stage for getting the blame and you got it guaranteeing deportation hamp took another pull at his brandy youre no killer pinell it was all a scheme to get next to the graf and it evidently worked out even better than you must have hoped frank glared at him why would i do that hamp shrugged it would seem obvious that you want to get your hands on that money your father left fortyfive million pseudodollars isnt chicken feed not a poultry sum as the expression goes the younger man ignored the pun and said sullenly i had no idea it was that much it wasnt originally but its been sitting there in berne for almost twenty years invested in swiss giltedged securities its my money frank said i didnt even know about it until my mother told me on her deathbed she hated the very thought of the stuff but she hated the graf even more and didnt want him to get his hands on it im my fathers only living relative my mother suspected but had no proof that my father was killed by the graf the last time she saw him he hinted that they were on the outs with each other my father it would seem didnt like some of the new fields into which brandenburg was expanding my father was a soldier of fortune not a hit man the black eyed him questioningly why didnt you just go to switzerland and demand your inheritance its tied up in some complicated way i dont understand evidently my father was on the way to change that when he was killed im not sure about the details but i suspect that the graf is part of the complication if lothar von brandenburg could get his hands on that money he would the sonofabitch is just about bankrupt now his overhead is astronomical with your fathers money he could retire or do just about anything else he wanted to do thats what ive suspected damn it i think there must be some kind of requirement that both of us must appear or sign something before either can get his hands on the amount so what the hell are you doing tailing me around by the way didnt windsor tell you im supposed to be a little on the dangerous side youre a bit inexperienced when it comes to taking me on i dont think peter windsor is in on it i dont think the graf has told anybody about it not even margit krebs his secretarial thinking machine frank finished his beer and put the glass down the graf put on a big show of friendship welcomed me with open arms as the son of his best friend the implication is that im now one of the inner circle and theyre breaking me in to the workings of the organization and this is your first uh assignment eh not exactly they sent me along with one of their top operatives to see a competitor named rivas in paris he was invited to join up or else he turned down the offer mentioning in passing that he thought the graf was responsible for my fathers death what happened it would seem that windsor or somebody had bribed all of rivass people out from under him his bodyguard knifed him to death hamp looked at him in surprise and you participated in a thing like that his tone turned sardonic a nice cleancut boy like you frank flushed listen he said im not as much of a milksop as you seem to think as far as im concerned rivas was no better than nat fraser the hit man who arranged his death nor peter windsor the graf nor any of the others i didnt mind seeing him killed at all not at all he was a professional dealer in death he was the type of man that i would have no moral reserves about seeing killed or given the circumstances doing it myself hamp pursed his lips and chuckled before getting up and heading for the bar again another beer he said no thanks frank said nastily and you act as though youre half drenched already the complaint has been made before hamp told him dialing another double brandy but i can still operate and ive heard that story before the younger man told him in sarcasm sometimes from drivers who explain that they can drive better when they have a couple of drinks in them famous last words before they plow into a tree youre on the death list of the most dangerous people in the world and here you are getting drenched hell even i could take you and as you so nicely explained im inexperienced dont try it hamp said mildly taking a pull at the double brandy but now we get to the nittygritty what were you doing at the synthesis meeting if youre not really interested in doing chores for the graf i had to go through the motions frank said all fed up with the conversation i had to look as though i was trying to get to you for all i know some of peter windsors other people were there they were hamp told him what the hell did you mink you were going to do to put over your act i dont know the other said i was trying to play it by ear hoping something would come up that would enable me to report back admitting failure but for some good reason i have to stay in the game supposedly in the grafs good graces until i can find out whats going on i havent the vaguest idea so far what kind of hold he has on my fathers fortune hamp thought about it some more he said finally the reason the graf was willing to send you after me was that he wanted to get something to hold over you some lever that would help him persuade you to do whatever has to be done to get his hands on your fathers fortune if youd killed me as ordered then hed have had his lever he knocked back the remaining brandy in one gulp and added i just dropped in to let you know i was onto you and to warn you to stay off my back so now ill what the hell was that what was what that news commentator what did he say i havent been listening play it back the last couple of minutes all right frank shrugged pressed the replay buttons and turned up the volume he missed the first sentence or so the commentator was saying the famous rocketset leader of recent years turned recluse indications are his sports car left the road either forced off as suggested by the french authorities or out of control as a result of overindulgence in alcohol or narcotics at a party he had just left executives of the farflung auburn empire have thus far issued no statement wall street in the city london and the common europe bourse are expected to react heavily in the morning horace hampton staring unseeingly staggered to his feet and headed for the autobar he demanded of the other play that back again from the beginning frank pinell his expression denoting complete lack of comprehension obeyed the commentator said flash from the french riviera the multibillionaire playboy of this century jeremiah auburn died today in a car accident near nice when switch it off hamp yelled frank obeyed staring blankly the black sank back into his chair he swallowed the drink in one gulp jim he said meaninglessly so far as the other was concerned what the hells the matter frank said shut up the black sat there staring unseeingly jim he muttered oh hell jim why was i such an asshole i laid you wide open to that murderous bastard windsor what the devil are you talking about frank said shut up frank pinell twisted his mouth in resignation and got up to get himself another beer he hadnt the vaguest idea what had floored his visitor evidently some bigshot playboy had a traffic accident in southern france so what he didnt follow the social news by any means but he had vaguely heard of jeremiah auburn one of those upperclass characters who would spend five thousand on a bottle of wine laid down during the time of degaulle frank had never paid more than five dollars in his life for a bottle of wine and then he was splurging at long last hamp shook his head as though in despair and got up and went over to the rooms small desk he sat down in front of the phone screen and deactivated the video before dialing the face that faded in on the screen looked as though it had recently received a great shock hamp said barry this is auburn the eyes widened in absolute disbelief but but on the news i just i know i know so did i a case of mistaken identity undoubtedly now this is what i want you to do refuse any comment to the news media whatsoever for the time being above all dont let it get out that i am still alive to nobody understand well yes sir and then a touch of suspicion there how do i know this is really you damn it you know my voice besides who else has access to this phone number i yes sir there was relief in the tone now wizard now i want you to send captain wayland and the plane to pick up two men here at the chicago north side airport he is to fly them to europe and the crew is to take their orders as though they were my own the mens names are horace hampton and franklin pinell they will make only one stop in new york mr hampton will leave the aircraft just long enough to go into the city and acquire some uh equipment at my headquarters there have a limousine waiting for him at the airport is that clear yes sir a mr hampton and a mr pinell thats all barry ill get in touch with you shortly meanwhile mums the word he flicked off the phone and turned back to frank pack your luggage he said the other had been completely flabbergasted by the phone talk he hadnt any idea whatever of what had gone on he said why hamp went back to the bar and dialed another drink he said were going to liechtenstein to see the graf and my old chumpal peter windsor the younger man ogled him are you out of your mind probably but your orders were to get horace hampton wizard youve got him hes going back to the wolfschloss with you the autobar delivered a full liter of french cognac hamp took the top off and applied the bottle directly to his mouth he then retopped it and handed it to frank put this in your bag i wont be taking any luggage frank was still gaping at him bringing you back to the wolfschloss now i know youre completely around the bend hampton that place is a fort you cant get in carrying any kind of a weapon and once in theres no way of getting out the graf will have you by the balls and probably me as well hamp shook his head no your story is that i had something interesting to tell you and wanted to relay it to brandenburg himself and ill have the most powerful weapon in the world to take into that fort what i tell you they search you all ways from tuesday both electronically and physically my weapon comes in a checkbook come on lets get out of here wayland will be at the airport by the time we arrive the pilot checked their identities with care obviously somewhat taken aback by this assignment however there was nothing to fault them he handed back the international credit cards saying with a frown to hamp havent i seen you somewhere before i doubt it hamp said laconically ive never been there yes sir wayland said touching the visor of his cap in an informal salute what are your orders aside from the stopover in new york fly to the airport nearest to vaduz in liechtenstein yes sir thatll probably be in austria and while were on the way call ahead and have a vehicle waiting for us with any clearance that might be required to enter liechtenstein yes sir ill check that out gentlemen shall we go aboard to frank pinells absolute surprise the black seemed to drink himself sober on the flight across the atlantic the bar on the huge aircraft was more elaborate than any frank had seen anywhere and was presided over by a uniformed bartender and two stewards to serve hamp kept them earning their pay frank found himself a stateroom and slept almost all of the way to austria he had a suspicion that he was going to need all the rest he could get he didnt like the prospects for the morrow when he rejoined his companion it was to find him sitting in the same chair in the main lounge whether or not he had gotten any sleep at all frank couldnt tell if anything he looked less under the influence of the liquor he had been drinking than he had back in the room at the drake there was a new shift of bartender and waiters waiting on him even as frank seated himself the chief steward entered and said respectfully we shall be landing within the hour gentlemen hamp looked down at himself i suppose i ought to have a change of clothing he said he was dressed in a cheap suit just above prole quality the chief steward said but sir we didnt pick up any luggage for you the other gentleman yes but you came aboard without any bags at all the black came to his feet he said sourly i suspect that mr auburns things will fit me the steward goggled mr auburns things hamp eyed him werent your orders to take my instructions as though they were those of your employer himself why yes sir wizard ill go and check out his clothes hamp started for the corridor which led down to the aircrafts staterooms the chief steward still looking distressed called after him the master suite is at the far end of yeah yeah hamp muttered at feldkirch it was found that there were no difficulties involved in driving the sports hovercar that was waiting to take them into the tiny principality they took off frank driving hamp next to him with brandy bottle in hand taking an occasional nip from it when they reached vaduz and began driving out the road to the wolfschloss which loomed before them on the mountain top hamp said youd better call ahead and tell them were coming from what ive heard about this place you run a chance of getting your ass shot off if you approach unannounced dont you know it frank told him bringing out his transceiver he went through the routine of dialing the special number peter windsor had given him when the englishmans easygoing face appeared on the tiny screen it was to express surprise frank he said i say this isnt an overseas call where are you coming up on the schloss frank told him then well you completed your mission in a way frank said ive got hampton with me that made peter windsor blink frank redirected the transceiver so that the face of hamp was shown to windsor he said dryly peter windsor meet horace hampton and then before either of the others could speak im coming down the road toward the cable car terminal peter do you want to clear me through of course dear boy come immediately to my office in the keep be seeing you old chap cheers his face faded still expressing bewilderment first hurdle hamp muttered he put the halfempty bottle in the glove compartment reserve supply he said we might need it later if there is a later frank said glumly they were approaching the first roadblock a concrete pillbox with three armed men before it frank began to pull up but they smiled and waved him on hamp said this inner circle you mentioned that youre now being admitted to whos in it besides the graf and windsor the only one ive met if there are any others is margit krebs the grafs secretary and data bank hamp looked over at him frank said shes got complete recall and keeps most of his secrets in her head nobody else is in this inner circle not that i know of when theyre having a conference the butler sepp is sometimes around and they dont seem to care he told me my father once saved his life and warned me about all three of them sounds like quite a chummy crew hamp said how long before we start talking to the graf if they see us right on through possibly twenty minutes or so wizard the black said and reached into his jacket he brought forth a container which looked something like a cigarette case opened it and took out a hypodermic while frank looked at him in dismay wordlessly hamp rolled up his left sleeve and expertly took the contents of the hypodermic into his arm he then threw the syringe out the window frank said bitterly fer chrissakes hampton isnt all that guzzle enough thanks for reminding me the other told him and opened the glove compartment for a pull at the bottle there they pulled up before the cable car terminal and got out of the vehicle met immediately by a smiling officer he saluted and said welcome back to the wolfschloss mr pinell im lieutenant lugos mr windsor has instructed me to see you to the donjon he looked hamp up and down frank said this is mr hampton my luggage is in the back theres a gun in it yes sir well take care of it the lieutenant turned and led the way horace hampton seemed only mildly interested in the routine of being admitted to the wolfschloss the identity checks the searches the cable car ride and didnt even seem particularly interested when they entered the enceinte in the direction of the towering keep lieutenant lugos was walking ahead and frank said from the side of his mouth you act as though youve been here before the other shook his head no but i had some of my agents check it out once they got good video sequences even inside the keep on the lower floors not up in the living quarters of the graf one tried and didnt make it the younger man stared what happened to him peter windsor happened to him he was caught tortured put under scopolamine and of course spilled his guts how do you know windsor dropped a hint to me the next time i saw him happily the others had gotten away before the captured one could inform on them our chumpal peter evidently was more amused by my curiosity than anything else i suppose the wolfschloss has been infiltrated before they had no more difficulty in entering the donjon than theyd had at the cable car terminal five minutes after lieutenant lugos surrendered them to the guard at the keeps massive door they had entered the office of peter windsor the grafs righthand man was characteristically lounging in wellworn sports clothes behind his desk his feet up on its surface he grinned affably and said as he stood i say pinell youre full of surprises he looked at hamp and frowned slightly havent i seen you before somewhere people keep asking me that hamp said i must look like some celebrity peter windsor shrugged no point in mucking around hampton what was your idea in coming here doesnt make much sense really i thought id explain that directly to the graf hamp told him his eyes went around the room in curiosity not missing the submachine gun on the wall i dare say thats a good idea windsor said lazily coming to his feet come along you chaps lothar is expecting us he led the way down the winding corridor to the grafs office when they entered the spacious office of lothar von brandenburg it was to find the graf and margit krebs seated in the same chairs as during franks original interview to top it after offhanded introductions during which no one made any pretense of desire to shake hands peter windsor slumped into the chair he had utilized on the first occasion frank had met the inner circle frank and hamp sat too on the same couch but at opposite ends for a few moments all was silent as hamp took in the three of them and they returned the compliment the graf said finally to be candid this confrontation surprises me i havent the vaguest idea what you had in mind franklin he turned smoky expressionless eyes to the black nor you sir will one of you explain he looked back at frank and added not of course that i distrust your judgment and discretion my boy of course not peter said dryly hamp said i came to make a deal the grayflecked uncanny irises turned back to him indeed please develop it i am always interested in deals wizard hamp said his dark eyes took in the short elderly mercenary and they were almost as unreadable as the old mans brandenburg he went on finally youve got a tiger by the tail youve built up an empire and now you cant abdicate youre just on the verge of being dead broke and you cant get out from under the upkeep on this pile of rock alone must be astronomical and thats not counting your other establishments scattered around the world and it doesnt count the compensations and pensions youre under obligation to keep up one of these days youre going to miss a payroll when you do well the people on your payroll are the most dangerous killers in the world what rot peter drawled silence peter the graf told him without looking in his direction he said to hamp since nothing that is said in this room this morning will ever go beyond its walls we might as well be completely free what has given you cause to believe me less than ah solvent my interests are widespread so are mine hamp said flatly i have sources and i have my common sense besides mercenary use has been declining for decades so have clandestine sales of arms the citizens of smaller nations are in revolt against their governments so far as military purchases are concerned theyve had a bellyful of it for a century or so theyre also getting a bellyful of assassinations and terrorism all sorts of inquiries are going out about you and your activities and this roy cos affair is almost sure to wind up with deathwish policies declared illegal on a worldwide basis especially if and when the united states becomes the united states of the world to sum it up your business is melting away brandenburg i see the graf nodded agreeably i am amazed at your interest in my affairs but let us delve into it a bit further would it surprise you to learn that my plans include joining the upper echelons of the world club and participating along with my organization in the world state the grafs emotionless voice held a touch of smugness hamp shook his head definitely no not after last night and not on top of harold dunninger the old mans voice was now ice what about harold dunninger its come out that you were behind his kidnapping and death that you wished this candidate eliminated so that you would be able to assume central committee membership but last night you went too far the graf looked over at margit krebs scowling what happened last night peter said quickly i was going to bring that up at our morning meeting lothar he cleared his throat i fancied that youd be surprised jeremiah auburn has been reported killed in a vehicle crackup on the french riviera an accident i imagine no accident hamp said and the central committee isnt going to stand for one of its members being coldly murdered for opposing you your name will be mud in the world club brandenburg the old man hadnt taken his eyes from his top aide why wasnt i informed about this he demanded i told you chief i was going to bring it up this morning dont you know a bit of bad luck wasnt it windsors eyes went from his employer to hamp and then quickly back again youre not taking this bloody fools word against mine are you hes obviously up to something but the silly ass has put himself into our hands well show him what the drill is around here a bit of scopolamine and well find out what hes all about you must think me a dolt peter the graf said coldly all his languid pretenses were gone peter windsor shot to his feet his face in a fury he turned red and stalked from the room the graf said to margit who had been sitting quietly through all of this our peter seems a bit impetuous these days fraulein id noticed it she said without inflection the graf turned back to hamp you mentioned a deal i confess i havent the vaguest idea of what you might have in mind hamp said frank here was left a sizeable estate by his father its in the hands of a berne bank almost fortyfive million pseudodollars in the form of immediately convertible securities first you will cooperate in securing the inheritance for him the graf gave one of his humorless chuckles i have never heard of such a thing he turned to margit have you fraulein but margit failed to take the cue yes she said deliberately her eyes seemed to glaze slightly its provisions are that the fortune be turned over to franklin pinell when he reaches the age of thirty until that time he would be able to acquire it only with your permission both of you would have to appear in berne to testify if he should die before reaching thirty the fortune goes to various american charities if you should die before he reaches thirty then the fortune reverts to him as soon as he has reached twentyone which of course he already has done for once the graf lost his aplomb he glared at her started to speak and then stopped himself he turned back to hamp and said firmly that doesnt sound like a deal to me herr hampton hamp said thats just the beginning is there a drink around here frank groaned low protest but continued to hold his peace he was almost completely at sea somehow the graf must have signalled since sepp materialized at a door leading to the back he bowed and said bine herr graf the mercenary head looked at hamp who said cognac preferably frank sucked breath in and groaned again the graf said a bottle of the grand champagne cognac the vvsop sepp and a glass bitte the servant bowed and turned his limp barely perceptible he wont need the goddamn glass frank muttered while sepp was gone margit looked at hamp strangely she said for some reason i get the impression that your complexion is lighter than i had at first thought hamp said offhandedly few american blacks are fullblooded we have been interbreeding for centuries one of my grandmothers was a scot before that i have no idea how many of my ancestors were at least partly white but your skin she said frowning that will be all fraulein the graf growled sepp entered with an ancient squat bottle and a glass centered on a gold tray he set the tray on the end table next to the couch on which hamp sat the cork had already been removed hamp poured with satisfaction sepp bowed and withdrew hamp sampled the aged cognac with his nose and sighed damn good brandy he said sipping frank rolled his eyes upward in appeal to greater powers lothar von brandenburg said coldly and now sir we come to the balance of your deal it was then that peter windsor reentered the room he carried his submachine gun with all eyes upon him he took a chair one that dominated the room that would hardly seem necessary peter the graf said i jolly well hope not chief but i dont like these two the graf shrugged it off and looked back at hamp wellsir hamp said when frank receives his inheritance i will turn over to you fifty million pseudodollars with it you can settle down in switzerland or wherever else you choose and announce the ah bankruptcy of mercenaries incorporated and your retirement i would suggest that you take along a dozen or so of your best men although in switzerland you should be quite safe for centuries avidly sought politicians and others have retired there in highsecurity villas and lived their lives out in safety fifty million pseudodollars take it or leave it hamp said pouring more brandy the mercenary head scoffed i have never even heard of a black anywhere in the world who commanded that amount of credit peter looked at hamp and said you look paler as though unbelieving and i still think you look like somebody ive met before and your voice too he let the sentence dribble away the graf said please peter do be quiet well sir this last to hamp hamp reached into his pocket brought forth a folder and tossed it to margits lap a numbered account in the grundsbank in geneva check the balance margit her face unrevealing as usual while on duty went to a set of drawers against the wall and opened one of the top ones her back was to them there seemed to be no question but that the graf was in a position to check the balance of even a numbered account after a few minutes of pregnant silence she turned and said the account is considerably higher than the amount mentioned the graf much of his commanding presence erased said breathing deeply what else confound it i know there is something else oh yes hamp told him putting down his glass he bent forward and removed his contact lenses his eyes which he directed at peter windsor were a dark blue surprise surprise he said show me a bathroom and ill get the black out of this hair it looks even prettier reddish the englishman goggled jeremiah auburn he croaked they were all staring now his complexion was that of a tanned southern european he fished up into his nose with the nails of his little fingers and brought forth two oval spreaders of metal his nose losing its broadness but the news broadcasts and the reports from my operatives windsor got out the graf roared what in the name of god is going on jerry looked at him with all the emptiness of death in his eyes he took up the brandy bottle as though to pour again but before he did he said the man who was murdered on the riviera last night was my brother james auburn you asked me what else this is what else i want the man who ordered the death of my twin peter windsor was on his feet he sneered are you out of your bloody mind he flicked the safety stud on the gun and held it at the ready but now he turned to his employer of many years you would have taken him up wouldnt you you would have sold us all out for his fifty million well thank you very much but im taking over youll be washed up with the world club but that wont reflect on me theres still chase and moyer wholl back me and sheila duffroberts who has more say about what goes on in the central committee than anyone else it was she who got together with harrington chase and suggested the elimination of that mcgivern girl and then auburn here shes with me if i finished you off now lothar i can blame it on auburn and pinell and the organization wont question it his eyes left the red face of the enraged graf and went to margit who had been sitting through it all her face noncommittal where do you stand fraulein with me or with this hasbeen sod i can use you in taking over margit cleared her throat softly very dramatic peter and ordinarily id have to think about it perhaps but as things stand that gun is inoperative he chopped out a vicious laugh an old trick margit old thing but it wont work its loaded all right i check that out every day or two i checked again just before i came back in here youve taken your stand you bloody fool margit said mildly i didnt say it wasnt loaded i said it wasnt operative i didnt like to see the thing around so i had sepp take out the firing pin some time ago peter windsor swore and pulled the trigger and then stared down in dismay at the unresponding weapon the graf was on his feet spry for his age he turned and dashed for a small cabinet set up against the huge window which dominated the whole side of the room he grabbed for the top drawer but peter tennistrim bounded after him and even as he went reversed the gun the graf spun a small gyrojet pistol in hand too late windsor crashed the gun butt into his solar plexus sending him reeling backward and into the window and screaming shrilly through it in a shower of shards his thin screams unbecoming to one of the grafs image continued as he plunged downward sepp came into the room quietly an antique mm luger in his right hand he took in the scene his germanic face politely questioning still playing the obsequious butler peter snapped sepp cover these two he waved his disabled submachine gun at frank and jerry sepp turned to margit krebs and his eyebrows went up fraulein he said shoot him she said flatly he just killed the graf hell do the same to us given the chance peter windsor yelled no even as sepp brought up the automatic and shot him exactly once in the middle of the chest frank walking like a robot went over to the window through which lothar von brandenburg had plunged for the briefest of moments he looked out over the superb view of mountain peaks and river then his eyes went down he shook his head in nausea pulled in air deeply and said hes splattered all over the side of the swimming pool five feet farther out and he would have landed in the water jerry auburn still bore the brandy bottle in his right hand margit krebs efficient as always went to a wall and pushed back a curtain behind it was a microphone she reached up and touched a switch she said very crisply now hear this now hear this margit krebs speaking the graf is dead those of you near the swimming pool can see his body peter windsor is also dead they killed each other now hear this now hear this the graf for reasons of his own has had the wolfschloss mined within the hour the schloss will go up he has thrown the switch time is short but with discipline and complete following of my instructions we can all be saved the cable car is totally inadequate for evacuation in such short order it will be utilized only by the guards and crew who have been in control of it all others will descend into the bomb shelters and then through the tunnels to the countryside women and the more elderly will use the elevators to the bomb shelters all in good physical trim will use the stairs the hospital will be evacuated all patients and medical staff will use the freight chopper to escape the small jet will be reserved for the senior staff that is all remember cooperation and discipline will enable us to evacuate completely any deviation from my instructions will mean disaster we will rendezvous in vaduz for final severance pay and distribution of other funds coming to you carry on she turned back to the others jerry looked at her thoughtfully are there such bombs no but i had to clear them out of here before they got the idea of looting will they believe you yes she said ive been in this job for ten years and i have never lied to any member ive built up an impeccable record of confidence now im calling on it theyll be shocked when i dont turn up at that rendezvous in vaduz she looked at sepp youd better start packing our ah luggage were heading for tangier no extradition there and interpol will be after us by tomorrow we should be able to take eight large bags we four can carry two apiece down to the jet were not in too much of a hurry we want everyone else cleared out of the schloss before we cross the enceinte carrying those bags you might start with that gold tray with the brandy sepp for gods sake dont forget any of the paintings small enough to go into the bags forget the others no matter how valuable ill go to the grafs private rooms and to the wall safe i know the combination the impassive sepp stuck his gun back into his clothing and taking up the gold tray left the room jerry said to her how do you know that any of us can fly a jet she was unperturbed frank here told us that he had studied to be a pilot jerry was looking at her in puzzlement he said why did you make the choices you did she shrugged it was all falling apart you were right the graf was all but bankrupt i found out very early in my relationship with lothar that in this organization one looks out for oneself very well i have looked out for myself had your offer gone through i might have gone along the graf would probably have taken me into retirement with him as it turned out when peter went berserk i had to play it by ear she turned and left frank glared at jerry auburn you damn fool suppose that gun hadnt been jimmied wed all be dead the other grinned at him a glint in his blue eyes sometimes you have to take chances when i saw that gun on his wall i decided that it was useless sooner or later here in the sanctum sanctorum of the graf somebody would have done something to it besides in narrow quarters like this you can often take a man with a gun before he can finish you off why did you think i asked for this bottle of guzzle he grinned again im a crack shot throwing a bottle frank pinell took a deep breath all right he said how did you pull off that skincolor change the other shrugged for a long time weve had chemicals that can change complexion either lighter or darker ive known blacks who passed that way and i once knew a white news reporter who circulated among blacks getting inside information hard for a white man to acquire he turned himself darker no big thing frank said all right again then windsor got what was coming to him so did the graf i get my inheritance margit and sepp get to loot this place which should enable them to retire i suppose what is there for you jerry the other shrugged it off for me theres always the brandy bottle he said reaching down for it aftermath when jerry auburn stopped off at lee garretts suite in the palazzo colonna she was gathering her things preparatory to a central committee meeting she flashed him a smile and said hello darling so youre back sheila was afraid you wouldnt make it where have you been he smiled back at her which would have been difficult not to do lee garrett as always was radiant he said i was just checking out a few things a few things like the american national data banks honey you still make a lousy agent provocateur spy or whatever she stiffened and then stared at him at first uncomprehendingly then slowly it dawned why why youre that what was his name hamp hamp something or other of the antiracist league but he was a black and youre white she was completely confused he grinned at her actually im kind of gray he said over the generations ive become so racially mixed i dont know what i am except that im rabidly antiracist but to get back to the national data banks it seems that you had a boyfriend a pretty close boyfriend which makes me a little jealous of course since ive been planning on a permanent relationship with you lee and it seems that he had a ranking job in the data banks why i dont know what youre talking about like hell you dont girl of my dreams the fact is that youve got a nicely high iq and ability quotient but not quite that high she stared at him dismayed he said your boyfriend jollied around with the equipment so that you were a cinch to be sent here to rome for a job with the world club i doubt if even you expected it to be quite as good a job as this though now come on honey what are you really doing here and who was it that you were really reporting to and dont tell me your mother she was defiant it was my mother shes as opposed to the world clubs meddling as i am and as strongly as my father was he fought it all of his life and neither my mother nor i am satisfied about the way he died that took the smile from his face they were at it that far back eh so what was his case against us he wasnt entirely against eventual world government but he was opposed to it being under control of a handful of western billionaires plus a highranking police bureaucrat and a religious fakir he was of the opinion that such a government would stifle healthy competition which is the source of much progress he was absolutely appalled that a state church was being considered not to speak of mercenaries incorporated as a possible world police at any rate mother and i schemed to have me infiltrated into the world club to keep an eye on developments and possibly help expose them jerry ran the back of a hand over his mouth ruefully maybe were not as far apart as all that he said she was still confused but you were a member of the antiracist league still am honey however some time ago it seemed to me that the world club might offer a quicker way to end racism so i got into it too as a matter of fact i belong to various other outfits one of them is africanbased theyre fighting racism there against whites theres quite a bit of antiwhite bullshit going on in parts of africa then he murmured something that made no sense to her pod hampton i wonder if you ever dreamed what the hell you started when you ripped off that silver he looked at his wrist chronometer but wed better go to the meeting as they walked the corridor to the conference room he looked over at her and said how was the news of my supposed accident on the riviera received at first we were upset she told him we were all aghast she hesitated except possibly sheila chase and moyer but then of course your announcement came through that it was all a case of mistaken identity he grunted they reached the central committees conference chamber and a page opened the door for them inside all the rest were already seated around the heavy oaken table they were chattering among themselves two or three more heatedly sheila duffroberts looked up from her papers and said tartly well jerry late as usual i see jerry auburn slid into his chair while lee took her place next to the committees secretary he said this will be the last time that will irritate you ms duffroberts the majestically proportioned woman looked at him frowning what do you mean by that the buzz about the table fell off as the committee members turned their attention to the two jerry said evenly the body of pamela mcgivern has been discovered after you fired her she began motoring home to dublin she was overtaken by a car driven by professional assassins and run over a mountainside this type of killing seems to be the latest thing among the pros these days at any rate the corpse was hidden but inadequately thats terrible sheila said seemingly shocked it certainly is jerry told her it looks as though our pamela knew too much so she was turned over to the mercies of peter windsor and his boss the graf all eyes were on him now a beginning of alarm in those of harrington chase and john warfield moyer jerry said both windsor and the graf are now dead and mercenaries incorporated dissolved i was present and heard their last words the amazon secretarys face was ashen jerry auburn went on by central committee rules any three members of the committee can remove a secretary members mendel amschel and fong hui got together with me before this meeting and we duly removed sheila duffroberts she was on her feet in fury she turned blazing eyes to chase and moyer who sat side by side are you going to put up with this she demanded the big southwesterner was glaring at jerry it seems precipitous the rest of us have not been consulted jerry said completely at ease the case of pamela mcgivern is not unique harold dunningers kidnap death was also engineered by peter windsors men and that attempt on me which resulted in the death of my brother in short ladies and gentlemen we have narrowly missed imposing on mother earth a world police state a state more ruthless than any in history if only because of its universal scope mendel amschel said quietly to sheila duffroberts and now if you will leave if any changes are made in our actions involving you you will immediately be informed she stormed from the room the international banker turned his eyes back to jerry auburn and now if you will go into the various matters you discussed with mr fong and me earlier today jerry made himself still more comfortable in his chair he looked around at the committee members one by one if you will excuse the youngest member of this body taking so much time i will excuse myself by pointing out my recent escape from planned assassination because i was opposed to certain tendencies recently developing in the world club i was also ah active in removing the late lothar von brandenburg and it was my agents who discovered what happened to pamela mcgivern go on nils norden the swedish industrialist said impatiently jerry said it has been pointed out that the central committee is composed almost exclusively of males of whites of westerners especially americans and totally of the wealthy thats as it should be chase boomed his voice belligerent is it jerry looked at him we meet today to elect a new member to replace grace cabothudson i suggest that we replace not one but four of our membership i am of the opinion that our goals have shifted from the founding days of our organization and that we should return to them a world state i think desirable but not under the domination of the world club we should return to investigating the possibilities of the future and even making recommendations but forswear any attempt to come to power ourselves thats nonsense the usually taciturn moyer blurted who could be more capable than ourselves to govern a world state who are we to say the chinese murmured softly i propose jerry said that we invite a representative of the space federation of lagrangia and the asteroid belt islands to join the central committee it is ridiculous to divorce them from earthside affairs secondly i suggest that we invite a member of the wobblies preferably a woman since we are so short of female members the wobblies chase boomed those subversives those halfassed radicals theyre against everything we stand for thats why we ought to invite them in to get opinions other than our usual conservatism thirdly i think we should have a representative from the antiracist league we are talking about a world social order and surely the socalled colored races are in the overwhelming majority now i know youve blown a fuse auburn chase shouted a representative from the antiracist league hed undoubtedly be a black weve already got a kike and a chink on this committee and thats too much now youd invite a nigger that ran across the grain with even the usually conservative nils norden you can be repulsive when you really try chase said norden fourth jerry pressed on we should have another woman representing womens rights theres still a great deal to be done in that direction especially in the more backward countries that will eventually be part of the new world society the chunky moyer said his voice reasonable central committee rules allow for only ten members on the central committee so that it doesnt become unwieldly only one is resigning our respected grace cabothudson where is the space for all these nominees of yours auburn i propose that three of us resign who chase blurted still red of face i suppose you are thinking of me well think again jerry was cool i propose that the three be harrington chase john moyer and myself if such resignations are not immediately forthcoming i shall go further into the details of the deaths of harold dunninger pamela mcgivern and the attempt to assassinate me silence fell and continued for long moments finally the heavyset chase pushed himself to his feet he growled to moyer done come on john lets get the hell out of this madhouse theyve gone completely around the bend when they were gone there was still long silence but then why you jeremiah it was fong hui his voice typically gentle i have always thought of you as a dependable younger member of the committee too many of us are elderly jerry looked over at the aged chinese because my honorable friend had i not offered my own resignation then undoubtedly chase and moyer would have fought and then everything would have broken into the open and possibly the new world club would never have seen the light of day indeed the ojd one would have probably gone under he looked off info an unseen distance and added his voice low frankly im a mixedup sonofabitch and you want to know something else i suspect so is everybody else that is everybody whos trying to make rhyme or reason out of this world weve got on our hands today meyer amschel said it is with regret that i accept your resignation jeremiah however it occurs to me that perhaps you have some suggestions on those replacements for our suddenly depleted members jerry nodded at that and came to his feet i strongly suggest that ms lee garrett though with us for such a short time be appointed secretary to replace duffroberts she seems to have the qualifications lee sucked in breath in surprise further jerry went on to represent the space federation ian venner who is at present in new york i have no suggestion for the representative from the wobblies since i am not very well acquainted with their organization and of course i can hardly recommend a representative for womens rights though i suggest she be an oriental fong said and the representative of the antiracist league jerry auburn said from them i would strongly suggest a certain horace hampton
