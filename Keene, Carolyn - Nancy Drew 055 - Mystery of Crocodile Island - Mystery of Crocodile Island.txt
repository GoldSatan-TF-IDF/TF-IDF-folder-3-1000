chapter i a risky adventure nancy drew and her friend bess marvin were seated in the drew living room eagerly awaiting the arrival of nancys father i wish your dad would hurry and get here bess said impatiently nancy have you any idea what the trip he wants us to take h all about the attractive eighteenyearold strawberry blond shook her head i know the place but not the mystery were to solve where is the place bess asked florida dad didnt tell me what part though bess giggled any part will be all right with me as long as theres warm weather and swimming nancy smiled probably all of us will be glad to swim at this time of year it can get pretty hot down there a ring at the front door interrupted her nancy hurried to answer it the visitor was besss cousin george fayne george was a vivacious darkhaired girl with a winning smile and a great appetite for adventure she and bess had helped nancy with many mysteries hi george nancy greeted her mend come in when the two walked into the living room bess pointed to a shoe box george carried whats in there she inquired georges eyes twinkled she took off the lid which had several small holes punched in it you can see she said but dont touch in the box lay a twelve inch baby crocodile since it did not move the girls assumed it was asleep george held up the box and tapped the underside at once the crocodile began to wiggle it opened its jaws wide and swished its tail bess screamed put the lid on and get that thing out of here she demanded george laughed its not real nancy your dad asked me to stop at the river heights trick shop and buy a rubber crocodile he didnt explain why she replaced the lid and set the box on the table the clerk in the store said if you tickle the trick crocodile it will wiggle its meant to scare people but it cant possibly hurt you bess looked doubtful and george went on if this reptile were real the government would take it and fine me twenty thousand dollars what bess cried out thats incredible or i could spend five years in jail for possessing it without government permission but why bess asked because crocodiles are a vanishing species nancy put in there used to be plenty of them in this country but now there are only a few left in florida besss eyes opened wide do you think your father is going to send us to the part where there are crocodiles nancy was looking out the window well soon know she replied hes driving in now carson drew a leading attorney in river heights parked his car in the garage then came into the house by way of the kitchen when he reached the living room he kissed nancy and greeted the other two girls dont keep us in suspense any longer nancy pleaded are we going to crocodile land her tall handsome father sat down on the couch in a way yes this is the story an old college friend of mine named roger gonzales lives in key biscayne outside of miami biscayne bay is full of small islands which are called keys most of them are inhabited but some of the smaller ones are like jungles and nobody lives on them some twenty miles from key biscayne theres a key that has been nicknamed crocodile island a group of men operate a crocodile farm on it they breed these reptiles to sell to zoos or other places where sightseers can view them as mr drew paused bess spoke with fright in her voice and youre going to ask us to go to this alligator farm mr drew smiled crocodile farm bess theres a difference there is yes the american alligator has a much broader snout than the crocodile and is less vicious and active the two reptiles are about equal in size and can grow up to twelve feet in length but the croc weighs about a third less than the gator bess shivered i dont want to meet either one george laughed to tease bess she said mr drew tell us some more scary things about crocodiles bess groaned they like to live in large bodies of shallow salty water mr drew continued preferably in sluggish rivers open swamps and marshes that are brackish they raise their heads when you go near them and oh stop bess begged mr drew grinned but im not finished in this country crocs were formerly found around the southernmost tip of florida but because so many people went to live on key biscayne the crocs moved into the everglades they have webbed feet and can walk on soft ground how fast can they run george asked very fast like horses forget it bess declared im staying home who wants to be eaten american crocodiles occasionally do attack animals and people mr drew admitted a croc can twist a large animal to pieces by seizing one part of it then turning rapidly in the water george grimaced i think i agree with bess dont worry mr drew said you probably wont meet any wild crocs what im talking about is a farm where theyre bred in captivity theres a mystery connected with the place that i hope you girls can solve what kind of mystery george asked ill tell you in a minute mr drew looked at the shoe box i see you did the errand george thank you very much i thought you girls might want to study a rubber crocodile to get acquainted with its looks he rose and walked over to the table and removed the lid george suggested that he lift the box and tap the bottom he did and once more the baby crocodile wiggled its tail and opened and closed its jaws this is certainly a good imitation mr drew remarked he sat down again and went on with his story mr gonzales has stock in the crocodile farm which is called crocodile ecology company he doesnt live or work there however hes a silent partner so to speak recently he has become suspicious that the business arrangements on the island are not what they should be and that his partners are up to something dishonest nancy asked and this mr gonzales has requested that we investigate crocodile island thats right her father replied however he doesnt want his partners to know it so you girls are not to visit his home or his office or even phone him roger gonzales is afraid his partners are spying on him and in some way may find out hes starting an investigation mr drew told the girls they should pretend to be just tourists id even suggest that while youre there you act like silly young girls so that the crocodile ecology people wont catch on the last thing you want them to know is that you all have high detective iqs bess laughed thatll be easy enough for me i can act silly any time but nancy will really have to play the part mr drew asked to be excused i must get back to my office for another case after he had gone the telephone rang and nancy hurried to answer it in the hall is this the drew home a mans voice asked yes who is this the river heights trick shop i want to speak to the girl who bought the crocodile nancy motioned to george and handed her the receiver hello george said are you the girl who bought the crocodile yes why youre in great danger the man told her the boy who was working here gave you a live one by mistake what george cried out bring it back right away the man ordered if you dont the police will arrest you george was aghast she could be put in jail for five years or be fined twenty thousand dollars nancy who had overheard the conversation looked toward the box on the table her father had not bothered to put the lid on after examining the crocodile now the reptile was climbing out of the container it opened its jaws wide though the crocodile was only a baby there was no doubt about its viciousness it could easily snap off someones finger just then the other girls in the room noticed that the crocodile had escaped from its container as nancy dashed toward it george froze and bess screamed in fear chapter ii new names mrs hannah gruen the drews housekeeper heard the commotion and rushed in from the kitchen by now the baby crocodile lay at the edge of the table making low hissing sounds hannah backed away in alarm even though she usually had plenty of courage when confronted with a crisis a middleaged woman she had brought nancy up after mrs drews death when nancy was three years old since then kindly mrs gruen had fostered the girls natural instinct to face danger without flinching wh what on earth is going on here hannah asked before anyone could answer nancys bullterrier togo slipped into the room behind the housekeeper as soon as he spied the little reptile he began to bark wildly he jumped up in the air trying to reach the crocodile with his paws dont hurt it nancy exclaimed she grabbed togo by his collar and tried to keep him from nipping the little creature ill take togo hannah offered nancy walked up to the table and turned the shoe carton on its end then with the lid she gently pushed the crocodile back toward it apparently the dogs barking and yapping had frightened it and the little reptile willingly crawled into the box thank goodness hannah gruen said with a sigh of relief as nancy put the lid back on im glad thats over bess added if one little baby can scare us like that whatll we do when we get to a farm full of great big crocs mrs gruen laughed no doubt the reptiles are kept in pits and cant get out she said dont worry bess togo continued to bark and jump so nancy led him outside and put him in his run the dog had helped her many times in her detective work which had started with the secret of the old clock recently she had unraveled the strange message in the parchment meanwhile hannah had found a sturdy cord to secure the shoe box when nancy returned to the living room she suggested that tie three girls go downtown and deliver the baby crocodile to its owner i second the motion bess said the sooner we get this creature out of here the better ill like it when they reached the store bess stayed in the car while nancy and george went inside the shop the owner noly reareck greeted the girls with a look of relief you have no idea what a load youve taken off my mind he said you see i have a license to keep crocky as a pet and have agreed to keep it in suitable surroundings and never to abuse it kill it or sell its hide mr reareck explained that it was unfortunate the little reptile had been sold to george i had to go to the post office he said and asked a neighborhood boy to watch the shop for a few minutes he decided to play a joke on me instead of selling you a rubber crocodile that can be made to wiggle and open its mouth he gave you my pet its a good thing you told him it was for carson drew or i wouldnt have been able to trace it im mighty relieved that crocky didnt bite anyone bess who was waiting in the car wondered why the girls did not come back and walked into the shop george explained about the switching of the crocodiles then nancy asked mr reareck where the young reptile had come from crocodile island in florida he said the girls looked at one another in amazement crocodile island bess blurted out why thats where she stopped suddenly because george stepped on her toes nancy was relieved if mr reareck had any connection with crocodile island she did not want him to know about the girls mission the three thanked the shop owner and left nancy dropped bess and george off at their homes then returned to her own house with hannah gruen looking on and offering advice from time to time nancy chose a wardrobe to take on the trip among her summer clothes were two bathing suits a terrycloth beach robe and a jump suit after she finished packing nancy learned from hannah that her father had come home she went into his room where he was reading dad she said mr reareck told us that he got his pet from crocodile island it would be a good idea if you could find out if he has any connection with the crocodile ecology company other than just having bought crocky her father promised to do so im glad you told me the next day nancy and her friends climbed into a plane bound for new york where they would change for a nonstop flight to miami after they landed in new york the girls hurried into the huge airport building and up to a counter to arrange for seats on their jet to florida the clerk smiled at nancy and said you are miss nancy drew yes i am we received a message that you are to get in touch with your father at once its possible your trip will be canceled puzzled nancy hurried to a phone and was soon talking to mr drew is something wrong dad she asked worried the lawyer replied that his friend roger gonzales had called him to say that his suspicions about the crocodile ecology company had been unfounded he told me there is no need for legal or protective action mr drew explained and he has canceled your motel reservations nancy was stunned by the news but before she could express her dismay mr drew went on im afraid that roger was forced to make that call and needs help thats why you should go ahead with your trip but dont get in touch with him until you hear from me i have arranged for you to stay at the home of friends of mine named mr and mrs henry cosgrove in key biscayne they have a sixteenyearold son danny whos an excellent sailor and familiar with the keys he can take you around in their motorboat im sure hell be of great help to you in your sleuthing oh good nancy said im glad we dont have to give up the trip mr drew urged his daughter and her friends to be very careful we will nancy promised then asked have you had a chance to speak to mr reareck yes he saw an ad in the paper about the crocodile ecology farm and wrote to them ordering the pet he doesnt know the partners or anything about them well goodby dear and have a great time when nancy joined bess and george they were worried about the turn of events do you suppose bess asked that somehow the people on crocodile island found out that we were coming and that youre an amateur detective nancy thats possible nancy replied anyway since dad wants us to go ahead lets get our seat numbers the girls did then went to the lounge and settled on three seats away from other waiting passengers to discuss what they would do when they reached key biscayne george said perhaps we should disguise ourselves with wigs and quicktanning lotions bess could become a brunette i could be a blond and nancy a grayhaired old lady thanks nancy laughed it would be fun but the suspects on crocodile island have never seen us before what good would a disguise be after a few moments thought bess spoke up youre right they havent seen us but they evidently know who we are do you think it would be safer if we changed our names we could use pseudonyms when necessary what names do you suggest george asked nancy smiled suppose i call myself anne and bess can be elizabeth and george quickly george interrupted her not georgia she exclaimed bess laughed georgia was her cousins real name but she would never allow anyone to call her by it ill be jackie george declared the girls discussed a last name and finally decided on boonton which was mrs marvins maiden name nancy looked at her watch ill have time to phone dad and tell him our new names he can inform mr gonzales when she returned george said okay anne our section of seats has been called to board lets go bess grinned oh jackie dear she said you have such brilliant ideas the girls entered the giant airliner in a happy mood and sat down side by side during the flight they teased one another using their assumed names they passed part of the time reading magazines and eating a delicious lunch in the middle of the afternoon they arrived in miami and went to the baggageclaim area as they retrieved their suitcases a young man walked up to them pardon me he said but are you the girls who are visiting the cosgroves thats right george said and you my name is steven they sent me to drive you to their house well get a porter and have him bring your bags steven led them to a beautiful goldcolored car does this belong to the cosgroves nancy asked no its mine he said and opened the doors for them its yummy bess remarked and plopped into the creamcolored velvety back seat george climbed in next to her while nancy rode in front with steven on the way the girls admired the sprawling large homes and the glistening bay steven who was not very talkative answered their questions merely with a yes or no so after a while they gave up including him in their conversation he drove over the causeway and through key biscayne at last they came to an area of beautiful homes that occupied large pieces of property steven turned into a long driveway and approached an elegant mansion he stopped at the front door and offered to carry the bags up to the girls rooms nancy rang the bell the door was opened by a middleaged couple you must be nancy drew the woman said she was cordial but did not smile and these are your friends bess and george nancy nodded and asked and you are mr and mrs cosgrove yes the man replied he did not smile either and the girls felt uncomfortable at the cool welcome the couple silently escorted them to the second floor and showed each visitor to a large and expensively furnished bedroom steven followed with their luggage nancy walked to the picture window at the far end of her room to gaze down into the beautiful garden bess and george also looked out their windows none of them had noticed that their hosts had silently closed the doors to the hall when the three friends tried to get together before joining the cosgroves downstairs they found that they had been locked in chapter iii escape although nancy felt a tight knot of alarm in the pit of her stomach her mind was racing obviously she and her friends had been kidnapped and what made it worse was that the three girls were locked in separate rooms no chance to plan an escape before the young sleuth could decide what to do she heard bess cry out anne jackie where are you locked in just like you georges voice came faintly this is awful bess wailed whatll we do dont panic nancy advised that wont get us anywhere the girls realized that if they tried to discuss a plan of action through the walls their captors would hear them and foil any attempted escape each one had to fend for herself while bess and george began a minute examination of their prisons nancy looked through the keyhole the key was gone but she was sure the lock on this bedroom door was a common type thats a break she thought and opened her purse she took out a bobby pin and a nail file first she inserted the file into the keyhole and held it tight next she pushed in the bobby pin by manipulating first one then the other she finally managed to get the door open silently nancy stepped into the hallway and listened she heard the front door slam and tip toed to a window just in time to see the sham cosgroves get into a green sedan and roar out of the driveway obviously steven had left too because his fancy goldcolored car was nowhere in sight all was quiet and nancy was inclined to think they were alone in the house but she could not be sure quickly she went to besss door and started to work with her makeshift tools bess heard the noise nancy george she called shhh nancy whispered im trying to get you out within minutes she had released the lock and entered the room youre a doll nancy drew bess cried out hugging her friend in relief have you any idea where we are this is a pretty grandlooking place i cant imagine that the kind of people who live here would imprison us in their own house i cant either nancy replied i have a strong hunch that our captors borrowed this place by the way i saw those people leave but they could come back any minute lets work on georges door the girls quickly went to their friends room and again nancy inserted her nail file into the lock there was no sound from inside the room had something happened to george finally the bolt snapped and bess pushed the door open the room was empty george nancy called out softly there was no reply oh dear bess said maybe those people took her out of here i doubt it nancy reasoned we would have heard the commotion besides we spoke to her just a few minutes ago she walked to the window and a big grin spread over her face bess come here she said pointing to a large maple tree directly in front of her a long branch extended almost to the window climbing down the last two feet of the trunk was george hi nancy called softly george looked up and chuckled im an escapee nancy smiled as bess reached her side and heaved a sigh of relief george continued her descent bess do you want to come down the way i did or use the stairs and how did you two get loose she queried bess made a face then smiled nancy h a great lock picker shh nancy warned we dont know for sure that everyones gone somebody could have been left to guard us so what do we do next bess asked i think you and i can risk tiptoeing through the house nancy replied quick grab your bag ill get georges and mine well meet her outside she motioned to the girl below to wait for them and the two quickly got their luggage they hurried down the stairs trying to move as noiselessly as possible they opened the front door and slipped outside george was waiting for them i dont think we should take the road nancy said the kidnappers could come back lets walk through the backyard and see if we can get help at one of those houses in the distance the girls had not gone far when they realized that the ground beyond the garden was marshy the mud ruined their shoes and spattered their dresses but the three friends hurried on until they were out of range of the house bess stopped and put down her bag my arm is killing me she said cant we rest a minute nancy looked back the house behind them seemed deserted i guess were safe enough she decided so she and george dropped their heavy suitcases boy what an experience george said our kidnappers must have overheard mr gonzaless call to your father nancy when he asked for help nancy nodded and the second call when mr gonzales canceled our reservations must have been made from another phone she said thoughtfully otherwise they wouldnt have sent steven to the airport to get us who do you think our kidnappers are bess asked they must be connected with the crocodile ecology company nancy replied i wonder if they own that house george said i doubt it they wouldnt be foolish enough to imprison us in their own home if we got away it would be too easy to trace them bess giggled they were foolish to leave us alone i think we should hurry on george said if they come back and find were gone theyre bound to look for us the girls picked up their bags and trudged through the swamp until they reached the house they had seen ahead of them as they went up to the front porch bess looked down at her dress and shoes were absolute sights she said what will the people think when they see us that were swamp ducks george quipped the girls rang the bell there was no answer nancy knocked but no one seemed to be home what are we going to do bess asked worried we cant go on like this and theres not another house in sight they left their suitcases on the porch and walked around to the back luckily there was a wall telephone on a rear patio nancy called the operator and asked to speak to the police department when a sergeant answered she explained the girls predicament and asked if someone could come and help them right away miss he replied and within ten minutes a squad car pulled up with two officers in it one jumped out and walked up to them you say you were kidnapped and escaped he said thats right nancy told him and explained exactly what had happened were on our way to visit mr and mrs henry cosgrove but we dont know how to find the place ill order a cab for you the officer said and asked his companion to make the call i know the cosgroves he continued its a long ride from here he took a notebook from his pocket and wrote down the circumstances of the kidnapping first he requested the names and addresses of the girls this time nancy gave him the correct ones she described steven the young man who had met them at the airport as well as the couple who had locked them into the bedrooms well get to work on the case at once the officer promised he walked to the squad car and picked up his radio phone first he asked that a taxi be sent out then gave a full report on the case when he returned to the girls he said a cab will be here in a few minutes is this your first visit to key biscayne when the three nodded yes he shook his head im sorry your introduction to our town was so disastrous believe me youll find that key biscayne is a mighty nice area well i hope youll have an enjoyable time while youre here in a few minutes a taxi pulled up in front of the house the driver looked at the girls curiously bess explained they had walked through the swamp after coming from the wrong direction to the cosgroves home she gave the correct address and they set off unlike the couple who tried to kidnap them helen and henry cosgrove were delightful nancy quickly explained why they were so unkempt what a dreadful experience mrs cosgrove exclaimed we must report it to the police at once ive already done that nancy said and told the whole story mr cosgrove said i got to the airport late because our car wouldnt start when i arrived you had already gone i thought you might have taken a taxi and come back home we started to worry when you didnt arrive i even called your home in river heights but no one was there good nancy said with a chuckle dad and hannah didnt have a chance to become alarmed at this point a sixteenyearold boy with red hair and twinkling eyes walked in and was introduced to the girls as danny cosgrove he looked at their dirty shoes and clothes and said i guess you got here the hard way what happened nancy told him and he responded your dad said you would be here to solve a mystery and there might be some danger connected with it you sure made a good start the girls laughed then asked to be excused to change their clothes mrs cosgrove led them to two bedrooms who wants to share the big one she asked bess and george said they would so nancy took the smaller room during dinner nancy explained more about the mystery but asked the cosgroves to keep it a secret we decided to use fake names to avoid detection by any suspects nancy said but now im not so sure its worth it mrs cosgrove spoke id try it if i were you even if part of this group youre about to investigate knows who you are not everyone connected with the crocodile ecology company has seen you by using fictitious names you can probably fool them what are your new names danny asked im anne said nancy and im elizabeth bess replied george grinned im jackie nancys first bit of detective work was to call the police early next morning she inquired about the house where they had been imprisoned and was told that the owners were away on vacation the girls kidnappers had broken in and borrowed the premises for their scheme the police managed to track down steven who told them the couple had approached him in a supermarket and asked him if he would like to earn some money they needed someone to pick up three visitors from the airport and bring them to their house steven agreed and assured as he knew nothing about a kidnapping the officer concluded were inclined to believe his story but well keep an eye on him after nancy had put down the phone mr cosgrove asked the girls if they would like danny to take them to crocodile island in the familys motorized skiff its high tide now and a good time to go he said i wish you luck in your sleuthing he added smiling thank you very much nancy said do you think well have a chance to go on the island sometimes they do allow visitors mr cosgrove explained on certain days of the week but i dont know about today youll have to see the four walked to the marina where the boat was kept how do you like the name i gave it danny asked the girls laughed when they saw what was painted on the side of the skiff pirate george exclaimed even if you hadnt told me id have known a boy picked it do you go after all the treasure thats supposed to be buried on these islands bess asked him i sure do danny replied the trouble is some of the small keys floated away in hurricanes and any treasure on them is lost forever what a shame george teased and here we came all the way to florida thinking we could dig up a million doubloons the young people laughed then stepped aboard the skiff four swivel chairs were bolted to the deck and danny explained that this made it easy for fishermen to turn in all directions then he pointed to the large outboard motor in the rear of the craft it weighs two hundred and fifty pounds and is raised and lowered hydraulically why do you have to raise it bess asked when you get caught in low tide you literally have to jump along over the sand dunes at a very fast clip if you dont youre apt to get stuck danny settled himself behind the wheel and started the boat as they rode along he pointed out the shoreline of key biscayne with its highrise condominiums and manystoried hotels but soon they left the area and one little island after another came into view all of these were built up by coral formations and mangrove trees danny explained ill show you some trees along the edge the way they grow is fascinating he pulled up to a small key and stopped the boat the narrow mangrove trunks rose some fifteen feet into the air then started to bend over their branches were heavy with leaves which in turn hung down into the water being thick and close together they were a natural catchall for whatever floated by and together they formed a solid shoreline over there said danny pointing is a place where the water is a little deeper we can glide in between two of the widespreading trees and you can get a better look he raised the outboard motor somewhat moved the skiff forward then headed among the mangroves it was a strange sight roots twisted and turned among them and beyond the shoreline lay fragments of weathered coral rock suddenly there was a grinding sound under the skiff which stopped so abruptly it almost threw the girls into the water chapter iv crocodile farm what did we hit bess cried out oh i hope it didnt ram a hole in the skiff i doubt it danny replied from the deck he picked up a long pole with a pronged hook on the end leaning over the side he poked around under the boat and raised an enormous pile of matted mangrove roots and leaves with a chuckle he swung it into the skiff ugh bess cried out what are all those crawly things in there crocodile food danny said and handed her a tin can pick them up and drop them in this george laughed you asked the wrong person danny bess hates that kind of thing you bet i do bess said pulling her knees up to her chin nancy took the can and she and george scooped up the small marine creatures some of them were no longer than a half inch nancy remarked a crocodile would have to eat a million of these to get even half a meal that would do for a snack danny agreed then he made sure the outboard motor was not dogged fortunately the green mass had come up in one big lump and he was able to back the skiff away from the key george threw the leaves and roots far out and once more the boat headed for crocodile island the water was very shallow and sand dunes stuck up here and there once in a while the skiff ran through an area where the water was dark green in color these channels run quite deep danny explained larger craft can travel only in these whereas a flatbottomed boat like ours can go anywhere on the bay a few minutes later he pointed to their left where series of tall stout poles protruded from the water many had small cottages on top ive never seen anything like this before bess stated are they summer homes danny nodded right theyre weekend retreats the owners like to get away from the city out here there are a lot of interesting things to see and many birds but not noise except from the boat motors what about the poles with nothing on top george asked the houses they supported were blown away in hurricanes danny explained bess shivered id run at the first sign of a breeze if i lived in one of them danny laughed im sure people dont stay and wait for the storm an hour later he reached another key it was surrounded by a line of mangroves as they drew closer the girls saw stakes driven into the water forming a fence it stretched as far as they could see here and there warning signs were posted crocodile farm no trespassing under penalty of the law so this is crocodile island george remarked just then nancy noticed two bright spots in the water behind the fence what are those she asked crocodile eyes danny told her you see these reptiles can stay completely under water except for their eyes which are raised high in their heads watch he picked up the can of little marine creatures and tossed them toward the crocodile its great jaws rose and took in the food then the reptile swam away lazily bess who had drawn her feet back on deck said i see now why the owners put up this fence they left enough water between it and the island so the crocodiles can enjoy themselves danny told her that this was the first time he had ever seen one of the creatures in this spot usually theyre kept in pits and guarded carefully he added wheres the entrance to the island nancy questioned on the far side of the key you girls are lucky today is a visiting day there were several boats with tourists waiting to see crocodile island a boardwalk ran from a small dock up through mangrove trees to a partially open area here among the mangrove trees were shallow pits fenced in with fivefoot concrete walls fresh sea water flowed into them through pipes there was an elevated area in each pit so the reptiles could stay either in or out of the water a small irish terrier ran around barking loudly at the visitors his name is efee danny explained i know because ive been here before efee bess asked thats a strange name its seminole for dog danny said he has six toes on one front paw and likes to be the center of attention hes always around on visiting days the boy petted the little animal and efee licked his fingers a guide asked the group to follow him and told them about the crocodiles the youngest ones have a greenish cast with black markings he said the halfgrown ones are olive green and the senior citizens are all gray they came to an enclosure with a fifteenfootlong giant in it this old fellow has to stay by himself the guide said he doesnt seem to get along with the others does anyone have any questions danny spoke up ive heard that crocodiles can drown is that true it sure is the guide replied both alligators and crocodiles can stay under water until the oxygen in their lungs is used up alligators longer than crocodiles but finally they both have to surface how often do they have to come up george asked oh id say the crocs come up about once every hour it depends on the water temperature the warmer the water the more often they have to breathe in cold water they can hibernate a lot longer do they have to surface to eat a man inquired yes they can seize their prey underwater because they have valves in the backs of their throats that close when they open their mouths and the water cant flow into their lungs but they have to stick their heads out to swallow the group walked on and nancy asked the guide what do you do with all these crocodiles the ecology company sells them to various zoos and parks and even to the government he replied the government george repeated what would uncle sam do with a lot of crocodiles the guide told her they were distributed to certain areas you have probably heard that the crocodile is a vanishing species we are trying to do our part in seeing that american crocodiles do not become extinct at this remark bess heaved a great sigh would america really be badly off if it didnt have any the guide looked at her with contempt in his eyes young lady if you knew anything about ecology you would realize how useful they are bess had no chance to reply because a loud bell rang this is an alarm the guide exclaimed i must ask you all to get back to the dock as quickly as possible and leave the island why nancy asked disappointed does it mean a crocodile is loose it could be the guide replied now please ladies and gentlemen return to your boats without delay the tourists ran bess was one of the first and the others for once had trouble keeping up with her just before they reached the skiff a guard at the dock asked them if they had registered when they came in no we forgot danny said ill do it now he hurried into a small office building and signed his name then he entered the girls names as anne elizabeth and jackie boonton when he came out again they had already climbed into the skiff a man in overalls approached the pirate pulled out a camera and snapped their pictures then hurried away and disappeared among the mangrove trees danny jumped into the skiff and pushed off why was that guy taking your pictures he asked nancy looked concerned i have no idea he did it so fast we didnt have time to turn our backs or refuse he didnt photograph any of the other visitors george stated he singled us out for a reason nancy nodded im sure the top men here realize who we are perhaps they wanted our picture to distribute to the members of the gang who havent seen us yet george frowned this could mean well be harassed by all kinds of people wherever we go im worried so am i bess added i think we should return to river heights and get out of this whole dangerous mess you dont mean that nancy exclaimed yes i do nancy and george looked at the frightened girl finally nancy said if thats what you want to do bess go ahead as for me im staying right here and seeing this mystery through so am i george added there was silence for several minutes then bess gave in you know perfectly well that i wouldnt run out on my friends but i warn you to be careful i know im not as brave as you arc i hate to get hurt chapter v a threat danny and the girls moved away from crocodile island all of them watched anxiously to see if they were being followed other tourists were leaving in their motorboats nancy wondered if one of them might contain a spy from the ecology company sent out to pursue the pirate i hope not the girl detective thought nancy observed through binoculars what directions the various craft took one seemed to stalk the pirate and nancy had an uneasy feeling about it do you see anything bess wanted to know theres a fast motorboat called the whisper nancy replied it seems to be tailing us is that unusual george asked after all other people might be heading for key biscayne of course nancy answered its just that most of the boats have scattered this one stays right in the wake of our boat oh oh danny murmured maybe they want to find out where were headed on the other hand they wouldnt really have to bother anyone can check the boat registry to see who owns the pirate and where we live thats great george said they already know who we are and now they can find out where were staying bess became alarmed lets head for home she begged danny looked at nancy what do you say im not ready to leave crocodile island just yet lets go around it and see whats on the other side we might pick up a clue danny nodded sure we may even find out if a loose crocodile caused the alarm what else would george asked you girls someone might have recognized not anne elizabeth and jackie but nancy bess and george and wanted you off the premises nancy agreed that it was a possibility were getting to be notorious she chuckled danny followed the shoreline of the key the whisper stayed right behind them and soon there was no doubt in the girls minds that the boat was pursuing them the fast craft finally pulled alongside the pirate with some apprehension the young people watched the two men on the whispers deck both had swarthy complexions and unpleasant faces one of them shouted get away from this island why danny asked innocently because its private property the water isnt george pointed out besides were not doing any harm we dont want you here the man insisted and shook his fist now get lost who are you danny asked and why should we listen to you its none of your business who we are and if you dont listen youll be in trouble danny paid no attention to the warning instead he revved up his engine and pulled away from the other craft obviously the two men did not know what to do next so they followed the young people around the island bess had scanned the shoreline through binoculars as unobtrusively as possible she focused on a metal tube sticking out of the water it seemed to give off bursts of light as if it were studded with prisms and mirrors reflecting the rays of the sun hey see that thing over there i wonder what it is she said excited the others looked and george gasped it could be the periscope of a submarine what danny exclaimed for a moment he forgot to keep his engine racing nancy took the binoculars from bess and trained them on the strange object is the water deep enough for a submarine to get in yes danny replied notice that the thing is sticking out of one of the channels where the water is green that means its deep enough for a small sub as a matter of fact during world war ii enemy subs got in here this way the government had mined all the larger more important channels to keep them out but small enemy craft slipped in anyway danny can you go into the channel nancy asked id like to see if that really is a periscope sure danny said and changed course but they soon realized that the men on the whisper had no intention of letting them go through with their plan theyre coming closer george said tensely obviously they dont want us to check that thing out there which proves that they have something to do with it bess added again the other boat pulled alongside the pirate you kids think im fooling the skipper shouted im not if you dont turn around instantly your boat is gonna get rammed and itll cost you a pretty penny to have it repaired but were leaving the island danny pointed out just as you told us to youre going in the wrong direction turn back danny hesitated he realized that this rime their pursuers meant business before he had a chance to pull the wheel around the whisper came so close to their skiff that it scraped the bow all right all right danny cried out were leaving you dont have to damage us the skipper chuckled evilly and dont ever come back you hear bess had turned white and sat frozen in her chair her hands clamped tightly around its edge nancy and george realized that the situation was critical and did not object to dannys pulling away in the direction the men had indicated the whisper followed them for a while then turned off obviously the men were satisfied that they had chased the intruders away wow bess said finally i dont want to see those people ever again nancy grinned i do theyre up to no good and im planning to find out what it is as the pirate headed toward key biscayne george said i wonder who those guys arc lets stop at the coast guard office and see in whose name the whisper is registered we dont have to do that danny said my dad has a book containing all the information unless its a brandnew entry it should be in there i wish we could fee sure that we saw a periscope nancy said still pondering their strange experience how do periscopes work bess asked oh i know that because we just had it in school danny volunteered you see the periscope is the eye of the underwater craft a submarine builder by the name of simon lake invented the first good periscope which was way ahead of the technology and science of his time he bought a lot of lenses and began to experiment not too complicated george said maybe not but one day he hit upon a lucky combination he could look down the street and see people walking and wagons rolling through the harbor he called it an omniscope it offered enough magnification and clearness of optics even for night vision so it was a big success how long ago was that george asked nineteen hundred two danny told her before that they just had makeshift equipment as soon as they arrived at the cosgrove house danny went to get the boat registry it was large and heavy he put it on the diningroom table the girls peered over his shoulder as he checked w for whisper ah here it is he said triumphantly it belongs to two men matt carmen and breck tobin they live in bridgeport connecticut do you know who they are nancy asked no never heard of them i wonder what theyre doing down here theyre a long way from home im sure theyre in league with the men who run the crocodile ecology company nancy said maybe theyre supposed to guard the place george spoke up they got rid of us in a hurry i hope they dont check up on who owns the pirate and then come here and bother us bess said worried danny insisted upon being cheerful about the whole affair we may be boxed in but were not going to let those guys get the better of us he vowed nancy smiled thats the spirit the question is what are we going to do next when mr cosgrove returned home the young people told him what had happened and asked his opinion on the case he thought for a few moments then said frankly im puzzled we now have a list of suspicious people but we still have no idea of what theyre up to or how the periscope fits in nancy added mr cosgrove smiled are you sure you werent looking at a marker for a buoy i dont think so nancy replied but the only way to find out for sure will be to go back and look again maybe we shouldnt use the pirate danny said our enemies are familiar with it whenever they see us theyll come after us what do you have in mind his father asked perhaps we could ask our friends the piarullis if we can use their cabin cruiser he turned to the girls they dock right next to us and if theyre not using the sampson im sure theyll let us have it its enclosed too which would help those men couldnt identify us thats a good idea mr cosgrove agreed ill call them and ask he went to the telephone and returned a few minutes later mr piarulli said you can have his boat tomorrow unfortunately their son and his wife are taking it up north the following day danny grinned one day is better than none true george agreed but what do we do after that play it by ear danny said with a grin well take things as they come lets leave early in the morning the tide should be just right do you think its necessary for all of us to go bess asked mrs cosgrove promised to show me how to make lemon nut cake i dont want to pass up the opportunity to enlarge my knowledge of recipes if youd rather cook than be a detective youre welcome to stay home george said bess could not stand her cousins condescending tone on second thought ill postpone my culinary education she decided bess was relieved however when the plans changed abruptly later that evening the cosgroves and their guests were seated in the living room discussing the mystery the visitors were trying to figure out the connection between the men on crocodile island and the two from connecticut when the telephone rang mr cosgrove answered then said nancy theres a longdistance call for you chapter vi the impostor the caller was mr drew ive had a long conversation with roger gonzales he told nancy hes eager to see you and has asked that you meet him at twelve oclock tomorrow at his golf club mr cosgrove will give you directions youre to tell the man at the desk that youre miss boonton nancy did not reply immediately is something wrong her father asked i dont know dad have you any idea where mr gonzales called from no his house i suppose why because i think his phone is being tapped why do you say that his enemies knew all about our arrival nancy said and told her father about the kidnapping attempt i dont like this he exclaimed the case is more dangerous than i expected one thing is sure nancy said our masquerade is known when we visited crocodile island someone took our pictures great her father murmured perhaps you should come home oh no nancy cried out please dad well manage we have danny to help us and even though the crooks know who we are and why were here well figure out something to outsmart them besides i have to keep my date with mr gonzales tomorrow so i can warn him true her father agreed if the crocodile ecology people overheard my conversation with roger today theyll probably try to follow you and prevent you from reaching the club keep that in mind i will nancy promised dont worry ill think of something all right and good luck when nancy told the others about the new developments they agreed that she should meet mr gonzales the following day i suggest mrs cosgrove said that when you leave here you go shopping then take a cab to the club from a store this way you wont be followed thats a good idea nancy agreed the next day mr cosgrove drove her to a department store where she made a few purchases then went out a side door and took a taxi when nancy arrived at the club she went to the desk and asked for mr gonzales im miss boonton she added the clerk looked at her searchingly there must be some mistake he said slowly miss boonton is already here what nancy was stunned by the announcement so thats how her enemies had doublecrossed her she asked the man for a piece of paper and a pencil and quickly scribbled a note to mr gonzales nancy explained the situation and asked if he would come to the lobby then she handed the note to the clerk would you please send this to mr gonzales she requested the clerk summoned a boy and within a few minutes nancy saw a handsome darkhaired man of about fifty wearing a white suit approach the desk the clerk motioned to the girl this is mr gonzales he said nancy nodded then asked her fathers friend to move a little distance away so they would not be overheard im nancy drew she whispered the miss boonton youre entertaining is an impostor nancy opened her purse and showed mr gonzales her drivers license he looked at it then at her in amazement how do you do he said in a low voice im dreadfully sorry about this do you know who the other girl is no nancy replied left go inside and find out quickly the two went to the dining room and mr gonzales led the way toward a table at the window suddenly he stopped short shes gone he exclaimed the other miss boonton is gone nancy was not surprised to hear it she deduced that when mr gonzales had received the note and gone to the desk the girl realized that her trick had been discovered and she decided to disappear at once she had a good head start the girl detective thought nancy suggested that they give an alarm to the man at the main desk so he could ask the clubhouse guard and various workers on the grounds and golf course to look for the impostor mr gonzales went to the headwaiters desk and picked up the phone nancy heard him tell the story to the man in charge of the club and ask that a search be made for a tall slender young woman with a lot of blond hair she was wearing a white skirt and blouse with a redandwhite sleeveless vest he said the message was passed along at once nancy impatient to find out where the girl had gone told mr gonzales she wanted to do a little hunting on her own account he offered to go with her where do you want to look first he asked how about inspecting all the cars parked on the grounds she might be hiding in one mr gonzales led the way to the far side of the dining room and out a sliding glass door a caddy came by and mr gonzales asked him if he had seen the girl the answer was no and the search went on they checked every car in the area all they found inside them was a sleeping dog in one with an open window and a large teddy bear in another of course theres a third possibility nancy said the phony miss boonton could have been brought to the club by a friend who could have waited for her true mr gonzales agreed as they turned back to the clubhouse nancy stopped a couple who were driving in she asked if they had seen a girl dressed in white except for a redandwhite vest we dont know whether she was on foot or in a car no we didnt the man replied thank you nancy said disappointed moments later a sports car came from the opposite direction mr gonzales asked the driver if he had noticed a girl on the road a blond wearing a redandwhite vest the man asked thats right nancy answered excited where did you see her i passed her about a mile down the road she was riding in a brown car with a man the information was sufficient for nancy to conclude that the fraudulent miss boonton had made a quick getaway no use in looking for her any more she told mr gonzales he nodded i owe you a lunch you must be starved lets return to the dining room after they had ordered salads and iced tea nancy and her host talked about the mystery i dont understand how this could have happened he said puzzled i do nancy said your phone must be tapped do you remember where you were when you called my father on various occasions mr gonzales frowned the first call i made from home the second one too no wait a minute i made that one from the club yesterday i phoned from home again nancy nodded that proves my theory she said and told him about all that had happened including the kidnapping attempt the man turned pale this means that not only am i in great danger but you are too he said i never would have asked you to come here if i had known mr gonzales nancy said i think you have more to worry about than i do i have two friends with me and a boy is helping us well be all right but you would probably be better off if you left this club as little as possible while were working on the case mr gonzales nodded i see your point and ill do as you say nancy changed the subject you told my father that you were suspicious of your business partners who are they and exactly what worries you there are three partners in the crocodile ecology company mr gonzales said hal gimler george sacco and me recently the two active partners were evasive when i asked them about certain matters i had a feeling they were dodging my questions about whats going on i found out they made trips to mexico numerous times and i know we have no dealings with that country i had the feeling that they were trying to deceive me thats when you called dad the first time nancy asked right when they realized i suspected them they asked me to sell my interest in the company to them and at one point i felt that would be the best thing to do that was when i called your father the second time and canceled your reservations but then you changed your mind yes because it turned out that i was not getting any cooperation at all from my partners im glad youre here but i dont like the idea of exposing you to danger were used to that nancy said dryly tell me have you ever seen a submarine or a periscope near crocodile island no why do you ask nancy told him how she and her friends had spotted a periscope which had disappeared before they could get a closer look mr gonzales frowned the company could be shipping out crocodiles and not listing the sales a submarine would be a splendid way of concealing the transaction he went on to say that some older reptiles had disappeared and when he had inquired about them his partners had merely said they had escaped i dont see how they could have with the fencing there is all around the island nancy commented thats true her companion agreed how much of all this did you tell the other miss boonton nancy asked i mentioned that i was suspicious of hal gimler and george sacco because i couldnt get straight answers out of them then you arrived and she took off you didnt mention the phone calls to my father only the first one by this time mr gonzales and nancy had finished eating they left the table and walked to the entrance the clerk at the desk called a taxi for nancy while waiting for it to arrive she told mr gonzales how couch she had enjoyed talking with him now ill work harder to solve your mystery youve made a very good start he said patting her on one shoulder from here on ill make calls only from the club or a public phone booth nancy rode off to the cosgrove home when she arrived the couple was alone with bess george and danny went out in the borrowed boat bess said i thought theyd be back by now they may have hit low tide mr cosgrove said nancy tell us how your luncheon date was did you get to the club all right i did only someone else got there before me nancy said and gave full details about the impostor incredible mrs cosgrove burst out just think of the nerve of that young lady pretending to be you i dont like the whole thing mr cosgrove added these people are obviously very clever and dont shy away from anything underhanded well be careful nancy said when danny and george had not returned two hours later she began to worry did they have another encounter with the whisper she wondered chapter vii sea detectives mrs cosgrove realized that nancy was concerned and tried to cheer her up look danny is a very reliable boatman she said they could have become stuck during low tide instead of sitting here and waiting why dont we all go to see a friend of mine she has a little private zoo which im sure you would enjoy that sounds great nancy said but before we leave do you mind if i phone the coast guard and ask if theyve had a report of an accident of course not mrs cosgrove said go ahead nancy learned that no trouble had been reported and felt better ill stay here and wait for george and danny mr cosgrove said you enjoy yourselves mrs cosgrove drove her guests along the waterfront until they came to a large estate she pulled in stopped at the front door and rang the bell to her disappointment she was told by the woman who answered that her friend mrs easton was away for the day and so was the animal trainer id like to show my visitors from the north your zoo mrs cosgrove said is it all right yes indeed the woman replied go ahead youll probably meet eric our gamekeeper hell show you around the man was not in sight mrs cosgrove who had been to the estate many times drove on she told the girls a bit about the birds turtles and snakes that were in large covered cages that flamingo is gorgeous bess exclaimed watching the longlegged creature with the pink feathers and dignifiedlooking head walk daintily across a fencedin lawn in the center was a pool mrs cosgrove pointed out an enormous turtle and remarked they live to a very old age ive heard of some that had dates carved on their backs showing they were a hundred and twentyfive years old in another wiremesh enclosure were a variety of snakes im not going to look at them bess declared they give me the creeps mrs cosgrove laughed if you lived in florida youd have to get used to snakes we have all kinds and sizes some are beautiful and all are very graceful ill take your word for it bess said and was glad when mrs cosgrove passed the snake pen and stopped the car some distance away she and the girls got out and walked to a spot directly on the bay here there was a large enclosure part of it extending into the bay a pair of crocodiles mrs cosgrove said resting her elbows on the cement fencing as the onlookers watched one of the reptiles got up and walked into the water at the same time nancy spotted a canoe being paddled under the overhanging mangrove trees along the shore in it were three boys without warning one threw a large piece of coral rock at the reptile fortunately it missed the move annoyed the crocodile however he turned back to join his mate the boys in the canoe paddled off quickly im glad theyre gone nancy said id hate to see the croc injured mrs cosgrove explained that the creatures hide was so thick that it was almost impossible to hurt its back but if something hits a crocodile in the eyes its very painful bess asked do these crocs have names mrs cosgrove smiled yes theyre lord and lady charming nancy and bess laughed and bess remarked they dont look very charming to me as if he had heard her the larger of the two crocodiles emitted a low growl followed by a hiss he opened his jaws wide bess retreated in a hurry wwhats the matter with him suddenly several small fish sucked up through a pipe running into the enclosure from the salt water were sprayed into the pen the crocodile forgot it was angry with lightning speed he ran down into the water and grabbed several fish with his great jaws then closed them with a resounding crack at this moment the canoe with the three boys returned this time each of them was armed with large pieces of coral rock they pitched them over the wall of the enclosure directly at the big reptiles one of the rocks hit lord charming on one eye it was obviously painful for he began swishing madly in a circle growling and hissing get away from here nancy yelled at the boys dont do that again the youngsters looking scared quickly paddled out of sight the crocodile swished his great tail back and forth so rapidly in the water that it sprayed into the air soaking the onlookers eric mrs cosgrove called frantically eric come quickly the gamekeeper a tall man with a gray beard ran toward the enclosure and looked at lord charming whats the matter he asked his eye mrs cosgrove answered poor old fellow eric said hes in pain all right i hope he wont lose the sight of that eye let me get something to put on it he hurried off and returned with a tube of salve and a pole with a hook on the end of it fearlessly he jumped over the cement wall and talked soothingly to the crocodile sorry old boy he said come now lord charming let me help you nancy and her friends watched in fascination as eric flipped the reptile onto his back with the pole and squirted some of the salve into his injured eye all this time lady charming had been watching from a distance when her mate turned over onto his stomach she hurried forward using the pole for support eric leaped high over the concrete fence the visitors clapped youre marvelous mrs cosgrove said eric grinned its all in a days work tell me how lord charming got hurt nancy reported that three mean boys had come by in a canoe and hit the crocodile eric scowled i cant stand people big or little who take advantage of a defenseless animal wheres the trainer today mrs cosgrove asked its his day off eric replied you must come back when hes here im sure you girls would enjoy the various acts he puts on with the animals we will mrs cosgrove promised then the visitors turned to leave when they reached home george and danny were back they explained their delay saying they had been caught in the low tide did you pick up any new clues nancy asked i think so george replied we went all the way to crocodile island there was no periscope in sight but the whisper was tied up at the dock we got near enough to overhear voices apparently someone was talking on a radio telephone what did he say nancy asked eagerly tonight at eight george replied what do you think it meant bess asked george said she and danny had figured out that either someone was coming to the island or that the whisper was taking off for a rendezvous with another boat nancy was excited by the report i think youre right she said lets go out there this evening and see what happens danny said that the tide would be perfect for the trip he turned to mrs cosgrove okay with you mother she smiled it sounds like a great adventure of course you must be careful not to get caught youve been warned to stay away from that place so take it easy she packed a picnic supper for the young people and before six oclock danny and the girls set off they ate the food on the way and arrived at crocodile island before sunset the whisper left sometime later and danny followed it nancy remarked that she was glad they were in a covered boat this way our enemies wont suspect were in it even if they see us she said danny nodded and the sampson is powerful enough so we wont lose them he said the whisper headed out into the green channel and traveled for miles and miles it seems as if theyre going around the world bess said after dusk had come on do we have enough gas to follow them our supply wont last forever danny said but we can follow for several miles and still have enough gas for the return trip more time passed then suddenly the young people spotted the vague outline of a large freighter it was too dark to see its name or country of origin i wonder if the whisper is going to rendezvous with that ship nancy said she took the binoculars out of their case and scanned the area theyre both running without lights danny i think wed better turn ours off too danny complied and said i wonder if the whisper and the freighter are still in motion he flicked on the sampsons sonar and detected the sound of the whispers motor the freighter is standing still and the whisper is idling alongside he said can we go any closer without being detected george asked i think so he replied well advance slowly ill keep the engine as low as possible its getting very misty out here george observed i hope well be able to see whats going on danny chuckled at least they wont see us he drew up to within a hundred yards of the whisper and cut his motor again the four young people strained their eyes and ears eager to find out why the two craft had met suddenly a bright searchlight was turned on revealing the deck of the freighter and illuminating the smaller boat alongside it nancy and her friends were terrified that they might be seen would the beam penetrate the mist far enough so the sampson could be spotted chapter viii indian tricks the four watchers in the sampson held their breath would they be kidnapped and taken aboard the freighter although the brilliant searchlight showed up the sampson clearly the two men paid attention only to the freighter the young people observed a large pine box being lowered from the freighter to the whisper bess gave a little low scream lets go she urged somebodys going to be buried at sea the others disagreed nancy said if that box were a coffin there would be no need for a secret transfer the freighter could have lowered it into the sea then what is it carrying bess asked nancy said she wished she knew that and where the whisper would take the box suddenly the great searchlight was turned off then the regular lights on the freighter beamed again and its engines began to roar within seconds the large craft started to move northward where do you suppose its going danny asked my guess nancy replied is bridgeport connecticut remember thats where the owners of the whisper are from what do you think the freighter brought george asked nancy shrugged obviously something very secret maybe itll be buried on one of the keys like pirate treasure i think the box contains something they need on crocodile island george suggested i doubt that they need corpses bess said dryly danny laughed lets follow the whisper im sure itll go back to the island perhaps we can find out whats in the pine box the lights of the whisper were still out but they could hear its motor running danny listened carefully then frowned it sounds as if theyre going out to sea he declared can we follow it nancy asked excited we dont have that much fuel also with no lights its almost impossible its so dark now wed either lose the whisper or run into it i have an idea george said why dont we return to crocodile island and wait perhaps the whisper is only making a detour to throw off anyone who might follow it and will come back to the island later good suggestion nancy agreed the young people turned around after a while danny put the lights back on im glad were getting away from that coffin bess said i dont ever want to see it again george looked at her youre probably right there was a slain gangster in it and the whisper is going to dump him overboard into deep water so nobody will know where hes buried youre disgusting bess exclaimed george defended herself you brought it up not the rest of us danny and nancy were laughing george the boy said you ought to write horror stories youd make a lot of money no thanks she replied ill stick to real mysteries like the secret of crocodile island when danny saw the outline of the key he shut down the engine and turned off his lights again the young people settled down to wait for the whisper to arrive passing the time by telling danny about various adventures they had had in the past however hours dragged by and nothing happened finally danny suggested that they go home my parents will be worried if we dont show up soon he said and i really dont think the whisper is coming back here tonight everyone agreed and bess suggested that they report the incident to the police the following morning nancy reminded her that the authorities would not investigate without proof of their accusation right now we dont know if a crime has been committed were just assuming that something illegal is going on and were angry at the skipper of the whisper because he chased us away from crocodile island but thats not enough for the police when the young people reached home the cosgroves were relieved we were worried about you dannys mother said what happened the girls reported the strange events then mrs cosgrove said a man called here asking for anne boonton i didnt know whether it was mr gonzales or not so i told him he had the wrong number good idea nancy said how did he react he just hung up and didnt call again for nearly an hour nancy her friends and the cosgroves discussed what might have been in the box and where the whisper had taken it finally mrs cosgrove said if the people on crocodile island were shipping something out illegally the box would have been hauled up to the freighter not the other way around it appears as if gimler and sacco were receiving something illegal but then why didnt the whisper take it back to the island thats a good question nancy said and gave a frustrated sigh anyway id like to go back in the morning perhaps we can pick up a due to the puzzle danny offered to accompany her but said they would have to wait until noon for the right tide mrs cosgrove spoke up in the meantime why dont you girls visit mrs easton again i spoke to her tonight and she invited you said you can come any time tomorrow their indian animal trainer will be there all day and will be glad to show you his tricks hes a seminole from the miccosukee tribe and his name is joe hanze that sounds great bess said id much rather go there than to crocodile island the others laughed and the following morning danny and the girls borrowed mrs cosgroves car and set out for the zoo when they arrived nancy rang the front doorbell mrs easton greeted them and talked for a while then she said im sure youll enjoy watching joe with the animals hes very entertaining and well informed just drive around to the back of the house youll see his cottage tell him i sent you the girls thanked the friendly woman and went to the indians place joe hanze was a pleasant man who spoke english fluently his bronzed face was handsome and his body muscular and lithe nancy guessed that he was about fifty years old joe said he would be happy to show off his tricks on the way to the turtle pen he asked the girls if they knew anything about the background of the seminoles no nancy told him id love to hear some of their history joe said that the original seminoles had come from canada the reason why they trekked south was not known maybe it was the weather he surmised in any case some of them got as far as florida and intermarried with other indians who were already here my greatgrandfather came from canada he was a fine hunter and earned a good living on the way by trapping wild animals and selling their hides where do your people live bess asked up in the everglades life there is rather primitive so i decided to come here when i was a young man and get some education i liked it so much that i stayed whenever i want to see my folks i just get in a car and drive to the everglades the group had reached the wire enclosure where the giant turtle lived and joe went inside the reptile poked its head out of the shell and looked at him the indian pulled a little musical pipe from his pocket and played a tune to the girls surprise the turtle began to dance when joe stopped the music the amusing creature went up and down on its forefeet as if bowing wonderful bess exclaimed the girls clapped and laughed and joe said he would have the flamingo put on an act next when he spoke to the beautiful pinklegged bird it went over to him and touched the indians lips thank you for my morning kiss joe said now suppose you do your war dance the flamingo flapped its wings up and down furiously while running around the lawn at one point the bird soared off and the girls were worried that it might not return in a few moments it came back and strode about in a circle every few feet the bird jumped high into the air and landed neatly a few yards away when the flamingo became tired of showing off it walked back to joe thats great george exclaimed you must have a lot of patience to train these creatures the indian said he loved animals and did not find it hard to work with any of them now lets go over and call on lord and lady charming he added on the way joe stopped at a large toolshed he opened the door and the girls noticed a refrigerator inside joe took out a large chunk of meat that he wrapped in paper he rejoined the girls and said to nancy i want you to feed this to lord charming when i tell you is this breakfast or lunch george asked grinning joe smiled its just a snack watch how fast it disappears when they arrived at the concrete wall that surrounded the crocodile pen he picked up a pole from the edge then jumped over the fence and walked up to the reptile who was resting on the sand lady charming he said youd better flip over and not give us any trouble he prodded her with the spiked pole until he was able to flip her over now she would take a few minutes to get back on her feet lord charming was lying in the water at one end of the pen under the shade of the mangrove trees that hid the wall of the pen at this point as joe approached him he said to the girls notice his eyeteeth and see how they protrude below the gums thats one way you can tell the difference between an alligator and a crocodile the alligators teeth are more even and do not show below the jaw when its tightly closed he went on to say that nancy was to throw the meat after he got the crocodile to open his jaws she figured that from the angle where she stood her aim would be poor so she vaulted the fence and stood at the edge of the water joe looked worried i wanted you to throw it over the fence he said but maybe lord charming will behave if you dont make a fuss he tossed a little stone which hit the crocodile lightly on the snout at once his jaws opened instantly nancy threw the chunk of beef her aim was perfect and the meat disappeared within a second nancy was so fascinated as she watched the reptile that she failed to retreat suddenly the crocodile moved its great tail in a moment it would hit nancy hard and injure her look out george shouted chapter ix hurricane legend with a leap nancy cleared the top of the concrete wall surrounding the crocodile pen she avoided the swishing tail by inches joe shouted at the reptile in the seminole language and prodded him with his heavy wooden pole finally the creature became quiet and the indian hurried out of the pen nancy jumped to the ground still trembling slightly she looked over the wall and said lord charming your manners are pretty bad that was no way to thank me for the meat joe grinned crocodiles arent house pets you know im glad nothing happened bess spoke up you almost gave me a heart attack nancy im sure i would have been too terrified to jump over that wall george chuckled ill bet you would have but then i doubt that youd have gone into the pit in the first place joe stood shaking his head youre some girl he said to nancy she smiled then changed the subject just before i threw that chunk of meat i saw a man peering at me from among the trees he didnt look one bit friendly thats strange joe said the only other person who works here is eric and hes not around this morning it wasnt eric nancy said we met him the other day what did this guy look like george asked he had long black hair small eyes and looked like an indian nancy whispered not wishing to hurt joes feelings ill search for him danny offered and ran in the direction nancy had indicated joe joined in the hunt but both of them returned a little while later without having seen the stranger i noticed footprints along the shore danny reported they led toward the water whoever the man was he wore a smallsized shoe with a rippled sole when i reached the spot where the prints stopped i saw a man in a small motorboat too far away to recognize if he was the fellow who was watching us nancy hes gone joe promised to look out for the stranger in case he should return then the young people thanked him for the tour of the zoo and went home after a quick lunch they set out in the skiff for crocodile island do you think that man was spying on us this morning bess asked while they were gliding along in the water maybe he was a sneak thief who was trying to make off with something from the estate danny suggested when he saw us he ran its possible nancy agreed but its more likely that bess is right he could have followed us from your house to see what we were doing george looked behind them no one is following us now lets stop worrying about him the young people once again passed the stilts with cottages built on top of them and it occurred to nancy that they might pick up a clue to crocodile island from one of the inhabitants after all they live close to the place she said danny do you think we might stop and call on the owners why not he replied and paused at each cottage he received no answer to his hello anybody home finally he laughed there arent any boats tied up at the posts obviously no one is here as they passed a group of posts with nothing on them bess shivered every time i think about a cottage being blown away in a hurricane i worry about whether people were in it or not i never heard of any danny said but did you know that crocodiles were blown here by hurricanes the girls laughed and george said dont kid us im not kidding danny replied the story comes from the indians they say that when the seminoles arrived here many many years ago there were plenty of alligators but no crocodiles then after a terrific hurricane crocodiles were seen along the shore of key biscayne nancy curious asked where did the crocodiles come from supposedly from cuba danny answered but they might even have traveled all the way from africa oh yes george said if i see that in a science book ill believe it but not from hearsay well they got here somehow danny defended himself and certainly no one brought them you figure it out he sent his boat past the houses on stilts the pirate had not gone far when he pointed out an uninhabited key thats a good picnic spot he said friends of mine and i sometimes come here george asked if he could go closer i see a green bottle floating toward shore lets pick it up bess saw a good chance to tease her cousin she rarely got the opportunity are you collecting old bottles she asked from here that doesnt look very valuable possibly not george retorted but its corked maybe theres something valuable inside when danny reached the spot george got down from her chair leaned over the gunwale and grabbed the bottle out of the water it was dark green and had no markings she tried to uncork it but at first the stopper would not budge i guess well have to take the bottle home and work on it with a corkscrew bess said maybe not george replied she wiggled the cork from left to right being careful not to break it the cork loosened little by little with one final yank george pulled it out she turned the bottle upside down nothing fell out then she held it up to her nose what does it smell like bess asked perfume nothing george said disappointed you might as well throw it back into the water danny advised i guess youre right george said the whole thing was wait a minute she had given the bottle a hard shake and looked into it i see something inside she said excited it might be a note everyone watched breathlessly as george held the bottle upside down and continued to shake it finally a rolled paper appeared in the long thin neck she reached in with one finger and gently eased the piece out what is it nancy asked george carefully unrolled the yellowed crinkled paper its a message she cried out dated twenty years ago what does it say danny asked impatiently captain wayne george read uss venerable sank in hurricane off argentina twelve took to life boat gods blessings there was complete silence for several seconds then nancy asked to see the paper i believe its authentic she said after examining it carefully the paper is well preserved and the cork was in tight and down in the corner is a date this was written twenty years ago why dont we take the whole thing to the naval station at key west danny suggested they have all kinds of records there of old ships that went down in hurricanes good idea george said she was about to roll the note and put it back in the bottle when bess stopped her dont do that her cousin advised it was hard enough to get it out the first time shoving it back in the bottle wont make it any more authentic you know george laughed and slipped the message in her pocket then replaced the cork in the bottle my dear cousin youre right for a change im right more often than you want to admit bess said haughtily danny grinned and started the pirates engine soon they approached crocodile island the girls used the binoculars to search for the periscope in the deep green channel but did not see it they circled the island from a distance and noticed a sign at the landing platform no visitors today theyre keeping everyone out danny said no activity at all i wonder for how long nancy shrugged lets just keep going around the island maybe well see something sooner or later they had almost completed the second circle when they heard an agonizing cry from somewhere on the island chapter x the runaways clues bess turned pale whwhat was that before anyone could guess there were more bloodcurdling screams from the island maybe a crocodile got one of the workers george cried out in alarm just then a young bearded man raced from behind the mangrove trees into the water he splashed through the shallow area and when he reached the green channel began to swim seeing the nearby boat he cried out save me save me danny guided the skiff alongside the frantic swimmer and the girls pulled him aboard his eyes were bulging with terror and his legs were bleeding profusely danny quickly got a firstaid kit from a locker and handed it to the girls they carefully washed the strangers wounds and applied a soothing salve what happened to you nancy asked him just just dont take me back to the island please the young man pleaded of course not did a crocodile bite you no no i was beaten with one of the sharp hooked poles they use on the reptiles how dreadful bess said why would anyone do that to you because i didnt clean the pits to suit the boss oh he has a terrible temper nancy wound a bandage around the mans left leg while george attended to the right one danny looked back to see if they were being followed then asked where do you want to go to key biscayne the fugitive replied the young people heard the sound of an engine and noticed a fast motorboat coming up in the deep channel toward the island just then a man appeared at the shore yelling at the top of his lungs colombo colombo where are you you cant run away where are you colombo the runaway lay down in the bottom of the skiff well protected by the three girls he trembled with fright danny put on extra power and the pirate skipped speedily across the bay the man on shore continued to yell for colombo but suddenly he addressed the skipper of a passing motorboat follow the pirate he ordered pointing the waters not deep enough the skipper replied much to the relief of danny and his passengers the fugitive sighed and nancy asked him who he was and what had happened on crocodile island my name is colombo banks im from new orleans but i came here to get a job i was hired to work on crocodile island at first i liked it but then the bosses became very cruel in what way nancy asked colombo said that although he had requested permission to make a trip into biscayne bay on his free days he had always been refused i began to wonder why and finally decided that the members of the crocodile ecology company were doing something underhanded perhaps they didnt want me to leave and tell people what i had seen or heard what did you see and hear george spoke up colombo told them that a speedboat called the whisper came and went mysteriously mysteriously how nancy asked often it docks or leaves in the middle of the night and i was never allowed to watch what was going on the bosses made me sleep on the far side of the island with one other man named sol hes black and a great guy we were friends but four other fellows who work there stay in the main house with the bosses how mean bess exclaimed colombo went on i decided to find out what was going on at night i would sneak out of my cabin and go to the main part of the island many times i saw mr sacco and mr gimler at the landing dock but usually they whispered and i couldnt overhear anything once however gimler spoke loud enough to a man id never seen they want five hundred the boss said can you carry that many unfortunately i couldnt make out the answer whom was he talking to george inquired the skipper of the whisper do you think they were referring to crocodiles danny asked i dont know do they ever transport crocs in the whisper no colombo replied then added i was scolded a good deal mostly for no reason it seemed as if the bosses had a grudge against me i think they figured i knew more than i really do thats possible nancy said thoughtfully i wanted to leave the job colombo went on but they would never let me a few times i tried to sneak up to the visitors and ask for a ride but one of the workmen who lived with the bosses always chased me away did sacco and gimler ever have anything delivered to the island or did they do the shopping themselves nancy asked colombo said that as far as he knew all supplies were brought in by the whisper and whenever any of the men left they used that boat you mean nancy asked that they do not use any other means of transportation not as far as i know but then i wasnt around to see everything i just worked and ate and slept the young people felt sorry for the man and his story made them more suspicious than ever of the partners in the crocodile ecology company by now they had reached key biscayne danny pulled into a public dock to let colombo off and asked him if they could be of any further help colombo shook his head youve all been mighty kind and ill never forget it if i can ever do you a favor just let me know nancy asked him where he would stay at the ymca he said i have relatives here but mr gimler knows about them if i go there hell track me down and try to force me to return to crocodile island by threats and make up some story thats true nancy said well i hope your legs will heal properly perhaps you should see a doctor colombo smiled i think you ladies did a fine job ill be well in no time he stepped onto the dock with dannys help then turned around i dont even know your names he said nancy hesitated but danny spoke up quickly im danny cosgrove and these are the boonton girls anne elizabeth and jackie thank you colombo said i really appreciate your help danny pushed off i hope you girls dont mind what i told him he said but he can find out from anyone around here who owns the pirate that was perfectly all right nancy said besides i think we can trust him on the way home the young people discussed what the phrase they want five hundred could have meant if not crocodiles what else george asked the thing that bothers me most bess said is that mr gimler might have known colombo was on the skiff if so he may make trouble wed better not go back to crocodile island weve got to bess said nancy were just beginning to get some good clues when they reached the cosgrove home dannys mother was waiting for them after greeting each one she said i have a message for you nancy yes what is it mr gonzales called he has some valuable information to give you did he give any hint as to what it was nancy asked mrs cosgrove shook her head he said that you would receive a letter in the morning nancy wanted to phone mr gonzales at once but realized that she should not let her curiosity get the better of her and possibly embarrass him later in the evening the group settled down to watch television but the young detective had trouble concentrating on the show instead her thoughts focused on what colombo had told them about crocodile island presently the phone rang mrs cosgrove answered then handed the receiver to nancy its for you hello nancy said youre not anne boonton a man said gruffly youre nancy drew we know all about you if you and your friends dont leave florida at once youll never get home again chapter xi an identification who are you nancy asked the man on the phone there was no reply only a click in her ear nancys friends looked at her questioningly who was it george asked one of our enemies im afraid he told us to leave florida or we might never see our homes again oh dear bess wailed now they know where were staying so what george said this isnt the first time nancy has been threatened over the phone by her adversaries danny tried to break the tension bess will you stop worrying after all you have me to protect you bess laughed and after a while the mysterious call was forgotten next morning nancy watched eagerly for the mailman when he came up the street she ran from the house to meet him he smiled at her and asked is a miss anne boonton staying here yes nancy replied do you have a letter for her indeed i do the man replied and a lot of others you want to take them ill be glad to nancy said and he handed her the bundle she thanked him then hurried into the house and quickly scanned the stack the one addressed to anne boonton was near the bottom nancy opened the envelope the letter read dear anne i had a phone call from hal gimler today he told me that one of our employees colombo banks has run away he suspects that the workman escaped in a skiff with three girls and a boy in it gimler thinks that colombo may cause trouble and asked me to locate him i was wondering was your group responsible for his rescue and do you know where he is gimler threatens to have him arrested for stealing if you have any information about colombo meet me at my club for lunch tomorrow g thats today nancy said to herself by this time bess george and the cosgroves had joined her and wanted to know what the letter said she read it to them when she finished mr cosgrove said youd better go to the dub and talk to mr gonzales theres only one problem george said nancy might be followed now that the ecology people know where were staying they may have this place staked out well mr cosgrove said we belong to the same club as mr gonzales and we know many other members perhaps you could meet one of them and get a ride thats a good plan nancy said now we just have to figure out how i get from here to wherever ill meet this person bess had a suggestion danny and nancy are about the same size couldnt she wear his clothes and cover her hair with a golf hat nancy laughed i wouldnt want to have lunch with mr gonzales in dungarees and a tshirt true mrs cosgrove agreed then her face lit up i have it she said the delivery boy from drummonds market is due here at about eleven he drives a van ill tell him to back up to our attached garage so you can slip into the van unseen then he can drop you off downtown that sounds great nancy agreed okay ill call my friend mrs grote and see if shes playing golf today if so she can meet you at a drugstore on the main street she has to pass it on the way to the club what shall i tell her youll be wearing if i put on my darkblue pants suit i might still be taken for a boy from a distance provided i cover my hair nancy replied mr cosgrove said he had a hat he used on the golf course and offered to lend it to nancy come with me and see if it fits he said while nancy was gone mrs cosgrove called her friend who agreed to pick up nancy at the drugstore ten minutes later the girl detective appeared again dressed in a blue pants suit with white collar and cuffs and the white golf hat oh you look cute bess exclaimed not quite like danny but close just then danny walked into the room and overheard besss remark youve got to be kidding he protested i dont own a fancy getup like that and if i did id give it away quick everyone laughed and nancy said all that counts is that from a distance i dont look like me nancy mrs cosgrove said mrs grote will meet you at the drugstore shell be wearing a white dress with a multicolored embroidered belt soon the delivery boy arrived at the back door in a van mrs cosgrove gave him the necessary instructions and nancy slipped into the rear after he had left the street she climbed into the seat next to him he looked at her and gave a low whistle youre a doll he said appreciatively are you on a secret date nancy smiled suppose you guess im sure you are the young man said as he pulled around a corner so i wont interfere but id like to take you out myself some time thats very kind of you nancy replied right now however i have to go on an important errand when they reached the drugstore she thanked the boy quickly hopped out and went inside she saw a rack of books and walked over to examine the titles just then an attractive woman walked into the store she was dressed in white except for an embroidered manycolored belt she must be mrs grote nancy concluded the woman spotted her at the same moment and walked toward the girl holding out her hand anne im mrs grote ill be very happy to drive you to the club they left the store by the rear entrance where mrs grote had parked her car nancy was relieved if anyone had followed the van and was waiting for her in front he would be fooled are you enjoying your visit here mrs grote asked as she drove off oh yes nancy replied it has been very exciting in what way mrs grote asked nancy did not want to give any details concerning the mystery so she merely talked about their interesting boat rides their trip to the easton estate and the show the indian had put on soon mrs grote drove into the club grounds so it was not necessary for nancy to explain any further she thanked the woman for picking her up and wished her a good score in her golf game mr gonzales was seated in the lobby im so glad you came he said and led her to the dining room while they were eating nancy told him about colombo and what he had said regarding the officers of the crocodile ecology company im not surprised mr gonzales commented nancy mentioned the phrase they want five hundred can you carry that many mr gonzales have you any idea what that could have meant the man furrowed his brow no i havent surely they couldnt have been talking about crocodiles there wouldnt be enough to fill such a big order do you raise anything else on the island that they could have referred to nancy asked no nothing i could ask my partners but if i do they will know that i received word from colombo then they are likely to go after the poor man and harm him youre right nancy agreed would you like to speak to colombo personally indeed i would do you know how to reach him ill try colombo said he would be staying at the ymca nancy stood up and went to a phone booth in the lobby luckily the receptionist at the y confirmed that mr banks was registered and offered to get him soon he was on the line hello he said hurriedly his voice sounded frightened hello colombo nancy replied its anne boonton could you meet me at this club she gave the address a friend of mine wants to speak to you about crocodile island take a taxi ill pay for it all right he said im glad its you and not one of my former bosses ill be there as soon as lean half an hour later the man arrived nancy hurried outside to pay the cabbie then took colombo to the tropical garden to meet mr gonzales when the young man heard that he was one of the partners in the crocodile ecology company he looked at nancy apprehensively dont worry she said mr gonzales is not like the other men he wants to find out whats going on at crocodile island and if his partners are dishonest this reassured colombo and he talked freely about the hardship he had suffered and the things he had observed im in real trouble he finished ive been trying to find a job but havent been successful im running out of money but im afraid to contact my relatives for fear of being tracked down by gimler perhaps i can help mr gonzales offered i heard the other day that one of the men in the club kitchen is quitting wait here and ill see what i can find out he went to the lobby to talk to the manager and returned a few minutes later with a smile on his face youre in luck colombo he said do you know how to prepare seafood colombo grinned i did that in new orleans but i never cut up a crocodile nancy laughed and mr gonzales asked colombo to come along with him to see the head chef in the kitchen we wont be long he told nancy within ten minutes the two were back with a third man who proved to be the pastry chef mr gonzales said that this man had finished his work and was about to drive home he would take colombo with him the cook went to get his car meanwhile nancy was told that colombo had been given the job and was to report for work the next morning colombo said i certainly appreciate what youve done for me mr gonzales patted him on the back were glad to help and thank you for some good clues if you think of anything else about the crocodile ecology company leave a note for me at the desk i will colombo promised then hurried outside where the pastry chef was waiting for him when nancy returned to the cosgroves home no one was there she knew where a key was hidden and went to get it as she entered the hall nancy saw a note from george lying on the table it said that danny and the girls had gone to the small local naval station with the bottle george had found in the water maybe we can find out about it without going to key west george had written at this moment george was telling her story to a friendly young captain named smith he agreed that the old note appeared to be authentic and said he would try to verify its contents he stood up and went to a shelf containing and registries george meanwhile walked around his small office and glanced at photographs on the wall suddenly she stopped in front of a group picture of sailors one of the faces looked familiar bess george said excited come here a moment doesnt this man remind you of someone matt carmen or breck tobin bess answered only the sailors a lot younger as captain smith turned around george asked who the sailor was chapter xii child in danger captain smith turned over the picture george had pointed out he read the names on the back and said this fellow is giuseppe matthews ill look up his record after a search in several volumes he came across the item matthews went awol captain smith explained and was never heard from again why did you ask about him george replied weve met a man who looks very much like the one in this picture hes older but theres a strong resemblance where did you see him captain smith asked out in the bay near crocodile island if hes the same person hes using a different name now what is it smith inquired matt carmen or breck tobin george answered we were never introduced so we dont know which name goes with whom you realize of course that were still looking for matthews captain smith said and that well have to arrest him when we find him can you tell me where these men live for a moment george hesitated what if one of them is the wrong person she asked i wouldnt want to get anyone in trouble if theyre not giuseppe matthews they wont get into trouble the captain pointed out we saw a boat called the whisper danny said we checked in a registry of ships and learned that it belongs to two men from bridgeport connecticut one of them is matt carmen the other breck tobin captain smith wrote the information on a pad and said he would follow up the lead then he checked another set of records for proof that the note in the bottle was authentic finally he smiled here it is he said this is really amazing a ship named venerable was last heard from in argentina her captain was george wayne this is the first message received since then no one reported that she was wrecked bess asked no and this note must have traveled at least ten thousand miles i presume it would be considered part of the venerables records so id like to keep it if you dont mind of course not george said perhaps we can locate relatives of the captain and the crew who would like to see it captain smith added he thanked the girls for bringing him their find and remarked the government may give you a citation for this george grinned that would be fun ive never had one the girls said goodby to the captain and returned home there was plenty of exciting conversation as they exchanged stories with nancy mr and mrs cosgrove listened and were thunderstruck at all that had been learned each day you prove more and more what good detectives you are their host complimented them but we havent solved anything yet nancy reminded him she turned to george did you ask captain smith about the periscope oh dear i didnt even think of that george said but we can go back another time and inquire if hes ever heard of a sub around here nancy wanted to go out in the skiff the following day but mr cosgrove said that he had had the craft out in the morning and found that it had been tampered with it was lucky i discovered the damage before you used the pirate again you might have had a bad accident nancy exclaimed you say it has been sabotaged im afraid our enemies have been at work the others agreed mrs cosgrove was worried this could mean that were all being watched by spies i think you should stay away from crocodile island for a while george grimaced at least until the pirate is repaired meanwhile why dont you visit cape florida their hostess suggested its a lovely place beautiful trees and a nice beach people go there for picnics the main attraction is an old lighthouse a guide will show you around and tell you something about its history that sounds great bess said i could use a change of pace the girls got directions and set off early the next morning in one of the cosgrove cars nancy at the wheel drove across the bridge leading to cape florida and turned into the park entrance look at those gorgeous trees bess exclaimed as they rode down an avenue of tall australian pines ive read in a magazine that these arent native to florida nancy said they were imported the road twisted and turned then they came to a shaded picnic area with a large sandy beach this is a heavenly spot bess remarked no wonder its so popular many people were seated oft the beach while others had settled at picnic tables set up in a grove of trees nancy parked and the girls strolled toward the water to their right was a natural coral breakwater which had been built up by polyps it was very rough and nancy realized at once that anyone slammed into it by waves could be badly cut she noticed that bathers seemed to be avoiding it what a lot of seaweed there is george remarked she picked up handfuls of it and rolled the soggy masses into a ball lets play catch she suggested the girls formed a triangle and threw the seaweed ball back and forth to one another whoever dropped it was eliminated from the game after about ten minutes of play george was declared the winner to tease her bess picked up the ball and threw it hard at her cousin unfortunately it missed and sailed across the sand the soggy mass landed plunk on a baldheaded bather who was stretched out on the beach sleeping oh bess cried in dismay and went over to the man he blinked at her and looked annoyed but after she apologized and he saw the look of concern on her face he sat up and smiled hi he said my youre pretty bess backed away hes old and fat and baldheaded she told herself i hope he wont try to get too friendly her fears were confirmed when the man stood up and took her hand i believe you threw that seaweed on purpose to wake me up well here i am at your service i i it was an accident bess stammered then she turned away and ran off as fast as she could when she reached nancy and george they laughed thatll teach you to aim straight when you throw something george remarked nancy who had been watching various bathers in the water now spotted a little girl who had not noticed that the tide was pulling her toward the coral breakwater she realized that at any moment the child would be bashed against its jagged side and severely injured nancy rushed down to the waters edge slipped off her sandals and splashed in the water was shallow for adults but the little girl could have drowned in it nancy swam with powerful crawl strokes toward her by now the child was only a few feet from the breakwater come here nancy called out and grabbed the childs hand together they struggled to the beach where they were met by a frantic woman tessie she scolded you were told not to wade over there the little girl cried i didnt mean to but all of a sudden i couldnt keep from going that way she sobbed are you her mother nancy inquired no im mrs turnbull im in charge of a group of children who attend my day camp i brought them here to swim but its hard to watch all of them at once i understand nancy said thank you for going in after tessie mrs turnbull continued when i saw her it was too late for me to help now the other children ran to them the woman opened her purse and offered nancy a bill as a reward for saving tessies life thank you nancy said but i couldnt possibly accept any money tessie had stopped crying she took mrs turnbull by the hand and said i know how we can reward her give her the map mrs turnbull smiled tessie we have no right to give the map away we should turn it over to the authorities but i will show it to this young lady by the way what is your name nancy introduced herself and her friends who had joined the group by their boonton name not wishing to be identified the woman fished in her handbag and brought out a faded piece of paper she unfolded it i dont know whether this is authentic or not she said we found it back in the woods somebody must have dropped it yesterday or today nancy bess and george studied the map not only was the paper old but the printing on it was quite faded mrs turnbull explained that she and the children suspected that someone had been hunting for a treasure perhaps buried long ago by pirates the person must have lost it the map does seem to indicate a buried treasure she said perhaps its here on florida key the girls were intrigued by the story and nancy looked closely at the map on it were directional lines pointing north east south and west there were also a number of intersecting lines converging at one spot this must be the place where the treasure was hidden nancy remarked true mrs turnbull said but how would one go about trying to figure out where it is we have to find a point of reference nancy said but what she puckered her brows and tried to figure out the strange map suddenly the girl detective had an idea you see this line running directly into the water it could be the coral breakwater youre right mrs turnbull agreed lets draw a continuing line from it through the sand and then bisect it just as it was on the map tessie jumped up and down in excitement lets hurry up and dig she exclaimed i brought my sand shovel ill get it she ran off and soon returned with a toy shovel nancy bess and george were amused at the thought of digging for hidden pirate treasure with this implement the bald bather had walked up curious to see what was going on when he realized that they were planning to dig with the toy shovel he said i have a spade in my trunk and would be glad to lend it to you he hurried to his parked car and returned a few minutes later with the spade he handed it to bess and looked at her with an admiring smile it made her blush thank you she said and pushed the spade into the sand she worked for a while then when the hole was about a foot deep she handed the spade to nancy your turn she declared while the daycamp children mrs turnbull and the baldheaded man watched nancy continued to dig when her arms got tired she looked at george youre next if i dont hit something she said and shoved the spade down once more there was a slight clang of metal against metal nancy exclaimed i hit something hard it must be the treasure tessie cried out jumping up and down chapter xiii doubloons nancy lifted tessie into the hole and she dug the objects out with her toy shovel as she handed up a battered tin knife and spoon she squealed in delight did pirates leave these i dont know nancy replied they could have been utensils dropped by a picnicker and buried in the sand george pointed out bess examined the pieces carefully im sure theyre very old she said theyre probably from a pirate ship can i keep them tessie begged maybe nancy replied tessie looked for more treasure but reported that there was nothing nancy helped her climb out then offered to dig deeper a few minutes later she stopped suddenly and stepped out tessie go down and feel around in the sand in a few seconds the little girl handed up a coin nancy looked at it and exclaimed this is a doubloon a spanish doubloon tessie wanted to know what a doubloon was bess explained that many years ago spanish ships sailed across the ocean to mexico which was not far from florida they captured people and had them do all sorts of work one thing was to make coins like those they had in spain they were called doubloons and were made of pure gold tessie tried to dig farther but found it impossible she had hit solid coral rock the little girl looked up at nancy and said please lift me out and then you dig nancy complied she assumed that the coral rock had been there a long time but suspected that something precious might have been buried before the tiny polyps had built their pile of rock on top of it she chipped at the coral with the spade and presently saw a few more doubloons she handed them up to tessie then nancy broke off more of the rock in a few moments she climbed out of the hole but helped tessie down this tune the little girl exclaimed oh i found a bracelet and climbed out nancy explained that all treasure found must be taken to police headquarters and listed you cant keep everything you find she added its against the law george scraped the hole thoroughly but found nothing more and came back up now i suppose we must put all that sand back bess said with a sigh of course george replied otherwise someone could fall in and get hurt here my dear cousin you havent been digging for a while you start bess did not look very happy and the baldbeaded man stepped tip dont worry ill do it for you he offered and took the spade with powerful arms he threw the sand back into the hole and soon the beach looked just as it had before thanks bess said that was very nice of you dont mention it want an ice cream oh no thanks i im on a diet the man smiled and left to take his spade back to the car george chuckled how come youre turning down food bess blushed as i said im on a diet george and nancy laughed best joke ive heard in years george exclaimed if he had been young and handsome bess would have eaten three banana splits mrs turnbulls children became restless now that the treasure hunt was over and asked if they could have their lunch the woman nodded and again thanked nancy for rescuing tessie she promised to take the treasure to the authorities on their way home then beckoned her charges toward the grove the children waved goodby and followed the woman after they had gone nancy said im sore someone else found the rest of that treasure i hope he reported it george said grinning the three friends walked along the beach from mrs cosgroves description nancy said this should be the way to the old lighthouse youre right george confirmed a few seconds later when they saw the building inside a fenced area it was about sixty feet in height coneshaped and made of brick several other visitors including a group of boy scouts had gathered in front of the gate and the girls joined them the tour will begin in a few minutes the scoutmaster told them he had hardly finished speaking when an attractive young woman in a rangers uniform unlocked the gate she admitted the visitors and led them around the lighthouse toward the water they went up to a small porch and gathered around her as she talked about the buildings history this lighthouse hasnt been used for years she said because others have been built farther out in the bay however it has an interesting background this building is not the original one what happened to that one a scout asked it was burned was anyone in it unfortunately yes the lighthouse keeper john thompson and his black assistant it was dangerous living out here at that time because the indians who occupied this territory were not friendly many of the seminoles had had their wives and children taken away by white people who made them slaves naturally they were furious and did everything they could to retaliate one night a crowd of indians came here a circular stairway led to the top where the great lantern was the seminoles set the old wooden building on fire to prevent the keeper and his assistant from escaping the two men hid in the tower but bullets whizzed at them continuously the black man was shot and died and the keeper was wounded but the fire attracted the attention of two ships offshore did anyone come to rescue them bess asked anxiously yes but meanwhile john thompson rolled a keg of powder down the stairway when it hit the fire below the powder exploded and the indians ran for their lives good a boy scout exclaimed but did mr thompson get saved yes but the rescuers almost failed when the ships got closer to the lighthouse they sent out a lifeboat but the crew realized that it would be impossible to climb to the top of the tower instead they tried sending out a kite from which there was a stout cord for mr thompson to grab unfortunately he wasnt able to so they tied the twine to a ramrod and fired it from a musket this time thompson grabbed the cord and used it to haul up heavier rope on it two men climbed to the tower room to take care of him he reached the ground safely im glad to hear that bess said the black man was buried the ranger went on but ive never seen his grave it was unmarked so the indians couldnt find it she let the visitors inside the lighthouse which had been modernized and had an upstairs bedroom after they had inspected the sparse but comfortable furnishings they went down again and walked outside i want to show you some of the bushes around here the ranger said pointing to a shrub this is called an inkberry bush it was used by the indians and the early settlers of the area to write letters with how one of the boy scouts wanted to know the liquid from its berries is just like ink the ranger replied from a little basket that she carried on her wrist she took a number of small plastic bags each contained an inkberry she handed them out to the visitors as souvenirs these berries were also used to make a dye she explained when you get home try to write with the ink the boy scouts giggled on regular paper sure white paper yellow paper you can even use a paper bag next the young woman pointed out a bush called sea grape this yields fruit to make jelly she said but notice the leaves they are very thick and you can write on them she took one off the bush picked up a small stick from the ground and wrote thank you for coming i hope you had a good time then she handed the leaf to the scoutmaster he passed it on to his charges and thanked her for the interesting tour now she opened the gate and the visitors said goodby when the girls were back in their car george grinned ill remember that seagrape bush if im ever in a tight spot out on the water ill write a message on one of them and let it float ashore nancy laughed you may have to wait twenty years before someone picks it up the girls drove back to key biscayne chatting about their experiences on cape florida when they reached the business district traffic became congested and momentarily stopped nancy watched the scene in front of her and suddenly gasped bess george she said do you see those two men getting into that red car up ahead i see them george said they look like matt carmen and breck tobin right bess agreed what are we going to do just then traffic began to move again the suspects started their red sedan and pulled in a few cars ahead of the girls lets chase them george urged yes nancy said only right now its a rather slow chase at the next big intersection their quarry turned right the girls followed and kept the sedan in sight soon the traffic thinned out and nancy sped after the two suspects chapter xiv periscope pursuit the driver of the car nancy was pursuing seemed to be aware that he was being followed not only did he put on speed but he turned corners with squealing wheels nancy and her friends were convinced that the men were indeed carmen and tobin bess who was tossed violently from side to side in the rear seat begged nancy to slow down please dont go so fast well overturn sorry nancy replied then grinned this time those men are afraid of us a sure sign of guilt they dont want us to alert the town cops they reached an intersecting highway and the men drove onto it they were getting ahead of the girls and it was obvious that they had no intention of obeying the speed limit theyre worried about being caught george said on the other hand im sure they wouldnt want to be stopped by the police to show their licenses that would be a dead giveaway nancy did not want to disobey the traffic laws but how else was she going to catch the two suspects she gave her car more power and it raced along the highway george remarked if we could only get close enough to see the license number we could report those men to the police instead of chasing them nancy agreed and asked diet you notice anything on the license plate only that it was from connecticut george answered maybe the car was stolen and thats one reason why they want to get away in such a hurry the words were hardly out of georges mouth when the girls heard a siren behind them oh oh bess said worried obediently nancy drove to the side of the road and waited for the police car to pull alongside her an officer jumped out and walked up to the girls youre going over seventy in a fiftyfive mile zone he grumbled whats the idea were chasing a car nancy said but now weve lost it we believe one of the passengers is wanted by the navy for going awol his name is giuseppe matthews but hes known under the alias of matt carmen or breck tobin how do you know about all this he owns a boat called the whisper and has been harassing us in biscayne bay yesterday we were at the naval office and saw a picture of him you can check with captain smith the officer hesitated a moment then said what did the car look like it was a red sedan with a connecticut license plate george put in all right ill take care of the matter and send out an alarm since you were trying to do a good deed i wont give you a ticket this time but from now on leave chasing criminals to the police nancy nodded its just that he turned up ahead of us in the downtown traffic she said i understand and thanks for the information the officer said goodby and went back to his car nancy pulled out onto the highway again and to the surprise of bess and george did not head home instead she went toward the waterfront where are you going bess asked if the two men were breck tobin and matt carmen theyre probably headed for the whisper right but what makes you think well catch up with them theyre way ahead of us by now true on the other hand if they suspect we tipped off the police they may change their minds and not go to their boat we may be able to find the whisper at a dock nancy reasoned pretty smart bess agreed lets go the young sleuths drove as close to the waters edge as they could then got out of the car and walked they looked for a red sedan as well as the whisper after carefully scanning all the boats and parking areas without finding either they gave up ill bet they took the boat and skipped to crocodile island george said they probably parked the car in some garage well it was a good try bess added nancy drove to the cosgrove house their hosts were not there the telephone was ringing so nancy answered it the caller was colombo oh hello nancy said how are things going for you very fine the young man replied i like my work and the people at the dub are very good to me have you heard any news from crocodile island yes i have colombo answered a worrisome piece of news my friend sol there got a message through to me at the ymca he advised me to get out as fast as i could since gimler had found out i was staying there and threatened to have me arrested oh dear nancy said im sorry to hear youve been tracked down have you any idea how gimler knew no but i took sols advice and moved out right away if you have a pencil and paper handy ill give you my new address and phone number good hold on just a minute when nancy returned with a note pad he dictated the information then she asked him colombo did you ever see a submarine near crocodile island a submarine no but its strange you should ask sol mentioned once that hed seen a periscope but the sub never surfaced while he was watching so i thought hed mistaken something else for a periscope has sol told you anything else nancy asked yes he overheard gimler say to one of the workmen that he wanted no more visitors on crocodile island until he gave the word he said something like people are too inquisitive and not about crocodiles either nancy thanked colombo for the information and then said to him youd better be careful i will he promised nancy reported the conversation to bess and george and added i have a strong hunch that the crocodile farm is a coverup for some bigger operation i wish i knew what it was bess spoke up do you think it involves that big pine box we saw lowered from the freighter probably nancy replied the freighter the whisper and the submarine are all part of it im sure if youre right george said what do we do next tomorrow lets see if we can locate the periscope and try to follow the sub nancy suggested what bess exclaimed if youre going on another wildgoose chase count me out okay said george well leave the chicken at home if you prefer that to a great adventure you can have it nancy i like your plan i suppose our going will depend on the tide when danny comes home lets ask him nancy nodded also well have to find out if the pirate has been repaired bess laughed i see theres no holding you back and you know perfectly well i dont want to be thought of as a chicken well all go thank goodness george said i was just beginning to think id have to put you in a coop bess made a face at her cousin then she changed the subject here comes danny lets ask him about his boat the young man said he was happy to tell them that the pirate was in good running order once more ill look up the tide table he said when he returned danny announced that morning would be the best time to go are yon game to get tip real early sure the girls chorused by sixthirty they were seated in the skiff danny put on full speed and the pirate bounced across the watercovered sand dunes when they reached the green channel alongside crocodile island nancy picked up the binoculars and stared ahead suddenly a broad grin appeared on her face i see it she exclaimed in the distance she had discovered the periscope it seemed to be motionless the sub evidently was lying in the channel nancy asked danny to race toward it as fast as he could they had barely started however when the periscope disappeared the sub is taking off george exclaimed oh i hope we can catch it danny followed the green waterway into the ocean the elusive periscope had not appeared again and the young people assumed that the sub was now in deeper water oh hypers george cried out using one of her favorite expressions now weve lost it where did it go they all knew it was futile to search in the wide expanse of ocean the only possible way to spot the sub would be from a plane or a helicopter wed better turn back danny suggested its a long way home and im afraid well have to run for it to make biscayne bay before low tide he entered the channel again putting on full speed but when he turned into the shallow water beyond crocodile island he looked worried do you think well make it george asked him ill do my best he said grimly there was no more conversation as the skiff fairly flew on top of the water everything went well until they were about halfway home danny who had been turning left and right to avoid the higher dunes suddenly swerved very hard he straightened the boat again but within seconds it rammed into a long sandbank the motor churned desperately for a moment then stopped the impact had knocked all three girls from their chairs they flew through the air and landed with a resounding splash in the water chapter xv jungle attack drenched with seawater and covered with sand nancy bess and george stood up alongside the pirate to dannys amazement they were not angry instead they started to laugh george said thanks for the unexpected bath bess looking at the skiff remarked i guess well have to walk home or wait for high tide danny told her instead of waiting however you could walk to that key over there and investigate the wildlife it isnt far from here does anyone live on it nancy asked no its uninhabited bess chose to stay with danny and dry out in the hot sun but nancy and george were interested in seeing the key so they sloshed through the shallow water to the mangrovelined island when the girls reached it they scrambled over roots and coral rocks there was nothing to see but bushes and trees its a real jungle george said ill say it is nancy agreed look over at that mangrove she pointed george stared in amazement a fish was climbing up the bark the two girls watched to see how high it would go to their astonishment it disappeared in the leafy foliage above this place is absolutely spooky george muttered she had barely finished the sentence when they heard a dog barking there must be somebody on this key besides us nancy said but lets go on maybe well see something else unique the dogs barks were coming closer and the girls wondered if he were friendly if not both of them would have to scramble up the next tree they waited for the animal to come closer when it did nancy gasped he was an irish terrier and on his right forepaw were six toes efee nancy cried out recognizing the animal from crocodile island how did you get here the dog came up to the girls at once wagged his tail in delight and barked in short yaps is your master around nancy asked apprehensively the girls stood still waiting for someone to appear but no one did the dog stayed close by and acted so glad to see them that they were convinced there were no other human beings on the small key besides themselves george asked do you suppose someone from crocodile island left efee here on purpose nancy shrugged if so its a pretty poor way to treat the dog he couldnt swim back to crocodile island its too far from here puzzled nancy and george walked on efee bounded ahead of them presently he ran to a little clearing and began to bark frantically the girls hurried to the spot where he was standing efee looked up at them gave a few quick barks then dug furiously into the sandy soil nancy hes looking for something george said maybe his master is buried here horror stories again eh nancy quipped but she felt apprehensive herself efee did not stop digging until he had made a goodsized hole then he looked at the girls as if to say go ahead take a look nancy and george stepped forward and gazed into the hole to their amazement a pistol lay inside where did that come from george asked do you suppose efees master put it there and then went away leaving the dog to guard it nancy thought a moment then said its a good guess george perhaps the men on crocodile island didnt want efee there anymore because his barks attracted too much attention now that the island is closed to the public id say they dont want a dog calling attention to the place if something illegal is going on there george got down on her knees and carefully lifted the pistol out of the hole she examined it and found that the firearm was not loaded and the serial number on it had been almost obliterated lets take it along she suggested if nobody owns this island and a person comes here and buries a weapon then it becomes the property of the finder nancy smiled i love your logic well take the pistol with us but well turn it over to the police the girls filled up the hole shoving the sandy soil in place with their shoes then they went on exploring nancy and george watched for anyone who might be on the island efee followed since he did not bark they felt reasonably sure they were alone presently nancy noticed that there were many twelve inch lizards running around some hid in the undergrowth but a large number of them were at a freshwater pond containing hundreds of mosquito larvae the lizards were eating them greedily the girls were so busy watching the fascinating sight that they failed to notice a swarm of mosquitoes coming their way suddenly the mosquitoes enveloped nancy and george biting furiously as the girls tried to duck the insects sang divebombed and stung them oh dear george cried out wed better get away from here fast with efee at their heels the girls ran as quickly as they could to their dismay the mosquitoes followed this is awful george panted a real jungle attack whatll we do ive heard nancy called out that the only way to get rid of these pests is to dive into the water the two friends hurried toward the spot where they had entered the key the going was rough despite the protection of their shoes they nicked their ankles on coral rocks and tripped on tree roots which made them wince in pain the mosquitoes kept buzzing around their heads necks arms and legs which were fast covered with bites the dog had long since outdistanced them and met the girls among the mangroves along the shore when he saw them dive into the water which was now deeper he ran in after them how good the cool water felt nancy and george swam all the way to the pirate efee followed when they reached the skiff and stood up bess exclaimed what in the world happened to you and where did this dog come from without being invited efee climbed aboard nancy said hes a visitor from crocodile island george explained about the jungle attack of mosquitoes and how they had found the dog jump in girls danny said i have just the thing for you he opened the firstaid kit and gave each girl an antihistamine pill followed by a drink of water then he handed them a tube of medicine and suggested that they lather themselves with it they did this and soon the medication began to take effect making them feel better what an experience bess said tell us the rest of the story we think someone from crocodile island buried a pistol there and then left efee behind how did you know that danny asked heres proof george said and pulled the pistol out of her pocket what bess shrank back in surprise where on earth it was buried on the key george explained efee dug it up since he knew where it was we figure he saw his master bury it we brought the pistol to give to the authorities is is it loaded bess asked uncomfortable at the thought relax its empty george said danny asked whether they intended to return the dog to his master at once george answered not on your life ill find a nice home for him danny said he was glad to hear this because he felt it would be unwise to keep the animal at the cosgrove home some of your enemies might track it down and then well be in trouble you might be accused of stealing efee i agree nancy said do you think we should drop him off at the animal shelter thats a good idea danny replied nancy now asked how about those mosque toes we have never seen a swarm like that before in key biscayne and other inhabited keys they have mosquito control which takes care of the problem the insects breed only in deserted little islands like the one you were on lizards act as natural balancers george remarked if they eat that whole swarm theyre sure to have indigestion the others laughed then danny said usually mosquitoes are bothersome only during the rainy season i didnt think youd encounter any at this time of year all right we forgive you george grinned thanks danny now asked do you want to go periscope hunting again or do a little more sightseeing neither nancy said quickly all i want is a shower and some more of that soothing lotion i second the motion george added lets head for home after the group docked in key biscayne they brought efee to the animal shelter the girls felt bad about leaving him but just then a woman and her little girl stopped and asked if they were looking for a home for the dog yes nancy replied the child was already patting the dog whose tail was wagging happily the little girl looked up mommy cant we take this one i love him already the woman smiled and said to nancy is he gentle oh very and a good watch dog the little girl gave efee a tremendous hug her mother said to the man in charge of the shelter well take efee and give him a good home by the way what does his name mean dog in seminole bess answered and the little girl giggled nancy bess and george left the shelter happy that efee would be living with kind people instead of suspected criminals their next stop was police headquarters where george turned in the pistol and explained where it had come from an officer dusted it for fingerprints while they waited but unfortunately there were none except georges itll be difficult to trace the owner the officer told them unless we can find a bullet fired from this gun he thanked the young people for bringing the weapon in then they left and now into the tub george said gleefully when they reached the cosgrove home after i take a shower nancy said ill be ready for another bit of sleuthing id like to see a submarine danny do you think there might be one in port at the key west naval base its possible he replied i dont know if theyll let you go aboard though we can try if we tell them about the mysterious periscope at crocodile island they might george chuckled of course they will how could anyone ever say no to nancy drew chapter xvi exciting phone call after the girls had bathed and changed into fresh clothes they went into the living room and told their hosts about the adventure on the uninhabited island mrs cosgrove was worried about the pistol but danny calmed his mother by telling her that they had already delivered it to the police nancy said id like to learn more about submarines mr cosgrove do you know someone at the naval base in key west he nodded as usual youre lucky it happens that captain townsend is an old friend of mine ill give you a letter of introduction and if he can spare the time im sure hell show you around and answer all your questions he smiled at nancy but dont ask him to tell you any of the secrets of the us navy nancy knew she was being teased because of her reputation as a girl sleuth she smiled back and said maybe ill find out some secrets without being told danny called across the room i dare you to after breakfast the following morning mr cosgrove wrote the letter of introduction to captain townsend take this to his house on the base he said danny asked to be excused from the trip because of a dentists appointment so the three girls drove off by themselves when they reached the naval station at key west they were amazed at the immensity of it two sailors guarded the entrance gate and asked for the visitors identification nancy pulled out the letter from mr cosgrove and showed it to them go ahead one of the sailors said take a right turn and at the next street ask someone where captain townsends house is they followed the directions and in a few minutes pulled up to an attractive bungalow many varieties of flowers were in full bloom in the front yard nancy parked and the girls walked to the door they were admitted by another sailor who took them to captain townsends office in his home nancy showed him the letter so youre a friend of the cosgroves he asked our families have been very close for many years please sit down the girls seated themselves in the comfortable wicker furniture then the captain asked what he could do for them nancy said she would love to look around the base but before that i want to ask you an important question she related the story of having seen a periscope in the green waterway at crocodile island but each time our skiff approaches it the periscope disappears quickly do you know of any sub in that area captain townsend shook his head no but let me make a quick call and see if theres any record of it he punched a number into his desk phone and in a few minutes had his answer theres no record of any sub plying those waters are you sure you didnt mistake a mischievous coot for a periscope you mean those little black birds that stay underwater with just their long necks and heads showing yes up to this point george had not spoken now she exclaimed indignantly nancy and the rest of us would certainly know the difference between a coot and a periscope captain townsend laughed no offense meant im sorry i cant help you perhaps you can help us with another sub nancy said id like to see one are there any in port you came at a good time captain townsend said im going off duty just about now so ill be glad to give you a personally conducted tour of the base and show you a sub oh thats great nancy exclaimed thank you the officer stood up and led them outside i dont have a car here so shall we take yours he asked nancy of course she said and handed him the keys he climbed behind the wheel and drove the girls up and down the various streets of the base pointing out office buildings barracks recreation centers and the air station nancy was fascinated by the very high antenna captain townsend said from here we can send messages to every part of the world by satellite george asked yes they passed the bases hospital and came to an area where helicopters were parked the men who fly these birds are specially trained in antisubmarine work the captain explained they survey suspicious areas and try to spot invading enemy subs bess spoke maybe one of them should make a run over to crocodile island ill see to it the captain promised it would only take a few minutes then he teased but that periscope you saw had better be there they passed a building where students learned how to read sonar and another containing advanced undersea weaponry which was used as a teaching facility for the naval personnel we have a great course here in underwater swimming and diving the officer stated some of the men later go into deepsea diving work youve probably seen pictures of them on television all the girls said they had and were fascinated by the sea life the pictures showed bess commented but some of those creatures are too dangerous for me the captain laughed then nancy asked if by any chance there was a nuclear submarine in port no there isnt he replied just one of the older types would you like to go into it and have a look id love to nancy replied and george and bess wanted to also when they reached it a sailor standing on the deck saluted his superior officer captain townsend offered to show the girls the interior the hatch was open and he led the way down the iron ladder to the deck below as the girls gazed ahead they noticed a long narrow center passageway george remarked i never saw so many things in such a tiny space this is like a small apartment with a whole crew living in it and everything is so neat bess added if i could keep my room like this my mother would be very happy nancy was interested in the crews quarters one bunk was perched high above a tremendous black tube as captain townsend saw her eyeing it he asked how would you like to sleep on top of a torpedo i wouldnt she replied the kitchen intrigued bess every inch of the galley was used and the equipment including stove and refrigerator was so compact that it amazed the visitors she asked how many men could be served from such small quarters of course that depends on the size of the sub the captain replied i think this one carries a complement of about thirty men as the visitors proceeded nancy inquired about the many upright lockers what is kept in them captain townsend opened one it was full of coiled rope most of it hanging on hooks another sailors locker held work clothes nancy could see several m rifles in slots behind the clothing she wondered why they were on a sub that used only torpedoes perhaps the men carry them when theyre on land she thought the officer said that the sub contained a shiptoshore telephone nancy would you like to call someone oh yes she replied ill phone mr cosgrove maybe youd like to speak to him the captain placed the call and spoke to his old friend then he handed the instrument to nancy mr cosgrove said an important call came for you oh she said from home no from your friend ned nickerson nancy could feel her face reddening he and burt and dave would like to come down here and see you ned said hed call again for an answer mrs cosgrove and i would be happy to have them stay with us bess and george were excited by the news it would be such fun to see the boys again captain townsend said they must leave now as it was time for the crewmen to return and go through a drill the visitors climbed topside and went to the car after the girls had thanked the captain profusely and left him at his home nancy drove off on the way to the cosgroves she said i have an idea how about the boys staying with mr gonzales instead of at the cosgroves gimler and sacco dont know them so ned burt and dave might pick up some good tips the other girls liked the idea so nancy drove to mr gonzaless club they all walked inside the man at the desk recognized nancy and said miss boonton are you looking for mr gonzales yes i am she replied is he here fortunately mr gonzales was there he came to meet nancy she introduced the other girls then asked him how would you like a threeman bodyguard mr gonzales burst into laughter is it that bad have you uncovered some new evidence nancy explained why she had made the request and he accepted her suggestion that the three boys stay with him now that you girls will have some escorts how would you like to come to the saturday night dinnerdance here mr gonzales asked the food is always excellent and the music exactly what you like wed love to accept nancy said the man looked at her and teased dont get yourself involved in some fix related to the mystery of crocodile island so you cant get here ill do my best nancy promised grinning as she was about to drive out of the club grounds nancy saw colombo he apparently was headed for a bus she stopped the car and called to him would you like a ride into town she asked indeed i would colombo replied thank you so much he opened the door to the rear seat and stepped in im glad i met you i just received a phone call from my friend sol he wants me to meet him at a garage he sounded excited he didnt say why nancy asked no when we get to the garage why dont you girls wait outside ill go in and talk to sol he may have some important news from crocodile island chapter xvii deadly golf ball in a few minutes colombo brought his friend sol outside and introduced him to start a conversation nancy asked him how he had managed to come to key biscayne from crocodile island the broadshouldered darkskinned man replied i begged for a ride with a sightseer who wasnt allowed to land i waded out into the water and asked him to bring me to town i was glad he didnt ask me why sightseers were not allowed to see the reptiles that day so i didnt have to say anything i hate to go back but i need the money colombo asked him how he planned to return ill hire a boat and pilot to take me out there after dark meanwhile i want to have a good time here you know its pretty dull in that place colombo said i know sol ive told you these girls are detectives tell them your latest news sol nodded i think you know a good deal already but if you can solve the latest mystery of crocodile hand youll put mr gimler and mr sacco to shame theres no doubt that theyre covering up something big nancy asked him if he knew what it was but sol shook his head i overheard the bosses bragging about the huge amount of money they were making i know very well its not from selling crocodiles to zoos and animal parks colombo suggested that maybe there were some underthetable sales which sol knew nothing about there could be his friend replied but i see the companys books and im sure they report every sale of crocodiles faithfully nancy was puzzled and asked about the whispers comings and goings sol knew little mr gimler often goes out in it but he never says where sometimes he brings back food bess remarked that it sounded secretive i guess mr gimler doesnt want anybody finding out whats going on at the island sol agreed by the way those of us who are still working there are likely to lose our jobs any time why nancy asked sol said he had overheard the bosses say that they planned to sell out they were going to offer all their shares of stock to mr gonzales or some other people thats strange nancy reflected not long ago mr gimler and mr sacco were offering to buy mr gonzaless stock in the crocodile ecology company no one had an answer to this puzzle sol changed the subject whether i lose my job or not id like to get away from that place it scares me i have a feeling that the police are going to find out that something crooked is going on at the island and arrest the top men then ill be called in as a witness mr gimler and mr sacco might even tell lies about me and ill be sent to jail nancy was shocked to hear this you mean that the partners are really mean and mad enough to do that i wouldnt put it past them sol replied george told him that the girls were only visitors and had very few contacts at key biscayne but if we ever hear of a job you could fill well let colombo know thank you sol said id appreciate it i dont even like the men i work with out on the island in fact i dont trust any of them if something dishonest is going on theyre probably in league with the bosses nancy said that under the circumstances she was amazed that they had not already discharged sol unless you havent given any indication that youre suspicious oh i havent he told her and i dont think the other men have any idea im squealing on them thats good nancy praised him youre sort of playing detective keep up the good work and report to us as often as you can sol promised to do so but said it was becoming more difficult to get away from the island the few times he had tried it gimler had docked his pay thats wicked george exclaimed nobody should be expected to stay in one place and work all the time without any recreation after a little more conversation the girls thanked sol again and left him and colombo as nancy drove off bess asked where to now nancy said she had a hunch that they should go back to the golf club and report this latest bit of information to mr gonzales at the desk the girls learned that he was playing golf but he should be back soon the clerk told them why dont you go out to the porch from there you can watch him come in on the eighteenth green the three friends hurried to the porch and took chairs near the railing they had a clear view of the green and part of the fairway nancy who played golf well noticed that there were trees on one side of the fairway just before it ended at the green that really makes it hard she thought a person would have to aim a straight shot not to hit those trees remember that beautiful golf course at the deer mountain hotel where we solved the mystery of the haunted bridge george asked i sure do bess said nancy won a tournament there she giggled here comes father time an elderly man who was almost as round as he was high and had long white hair and a flowing white beard putted for the cup missed it and made a wry race bess sighed this sure is a frustrating game it is nancy said ive seen people get so mad that they threw their dubs away once a fellow almost hit his poor caddy here comes mr gonzales george said hes a good distance away from the green i wonder how hell make out the girls watched in silence as he took his position behind the ball and swung his club in a few practice strokes just as he placed the club behind the ball and got ready for his approach shot another players ball whizzed from among the trees to his right and hit him hard on the temple mr gonzales dropped his club and fell to the ground unconscious oh all three girls cried out in horror nancy bess and george expected the other player to emerge from the woods and run up to the victim but no one did that ball must have been sent on purpose to hit mr gonzales nancy exclaimed the three girls jumped up and ran toward an outside stairway bess suddenly pointed i see somebody running beyond those trees hes carrying a bag of clubs he must be the one who shot that ball maybe hes a caddy george added nancy was torn between the desire to hurry after the suspect and the need to help mr gonzales by the time the girls reached the foot of the stairs they noticed that several people had surrounded their friend but no one was taking off after the suspect this helped nancy decide what to do although the man was out of sight lets go she said we must catch him where do you think hell run bess asked to the caddy house he doesnt seem to be heading in that direction george replied maybe he isnt a caddy but a member who is running scared nancy was already racing across another fairway toward a public road the man with the golf bag suddenly came into view he looked back and realized he was being chased despite the weight of the bag he put on extra speed before the girls could get to him he reached the road a car was waiting for him he jumped in and it roared off now well never know who he is bess wailed nancy said she had seen the license plate and repeated the number to the girls whats more the glimpse i got of the man makes me think hes the one who spied on us out at the easton estate she added since we cant chase him lets return to the clubhouse and phone the police the girls hurried back and told the manager what they had seen and asked him to call headquarters and give the license number he did so and the sergeant on duty promised to send two officers out at once while they were waiting nancy asked how mr gonzales was the manager replied hes still unconscious but a doctor is with him hes in a room down the hall bess decided to go there and see if she could find out anything further nancy and george remained in the lobby when the police officers arrived the manager introduced them as parks and joyce this young lady saw a man with a bag of clubs running away shell give you the details the manager said the girl detective described how the suspect had fled in a car adding that she had managed to see the license plate headquarters has the number yes we know it parks said can you tell us anything else about the man yes nancy replied i think hes the same person who was spying on me and my friends while we were watching the crocodiles at the easton estate he was peering at us from behind some mangroves so i caught only a glimpse of his face he had shoulderlength black hair and beady eyes he might be a halfbreed indian im afraid thats all i can tell you about him thats more than people usually notice officer joyce complimented her thank you for the information while he had been talking lieutenant parks picked up the managers phone and called headquarters he asked the sergeant on duty to look up the license number nancy had given him its urgent she heard him say they all waited for an answer which came in a few minutes when the manager heard the name of the owner he showed utter astonishment thats my name its my car it must have been stolen immediately he called the parkinglot attendant who phoned back in a few minutes your car is not here i didnt notice anyone take it im sorry sir the manager hung up just then another phone rang the call was for the officers lieutenant parks picked up the instrument he said thats good you say the suspects got away the officer put down the phone and reported to his listeners that a few minutes earlier the car had been found abandoned about five miles from the club in that case joyce said well have to depend on this girls description to nab the fellow were to look for a man with a bag of golf dubs he has long black hair beady eyes and could be a halfbreed indian while this conversation had been going on bess had been waiting outside the room where mr gonzales was for the doctor to appear in a few minutes he came outside she asked how the patient was he has regained consciousness the physician reported but has a racking headache ive ordered an ambulance to take him to the hospital no one is to see him either here or at the hospital bess said thank yon turned and hurried back to repeat this message to nancy and george she heard lieutenants parks and joyce discussing the case parks declared that he was sure the suspect would have dumped the golf clubs as soon as possible as to his being a halfbreed indian there were so many of them around that it would be almost impossible to identify the man they were looking for joyce shrugged i guess were at a dead end on this case nancy spoke maybe not she said then turning to the manager she requested will you see if colombo has returned chapter xviii snakes the manager mr burley learned that colombo was back and sent for him he asked him to meet nancy bess and george in the tropical garden did something happen he questioned when they met and sat down he looked worried ill say it did george replied mr gonzales was hit on the head with a golf ball which was deliberately aimed at him it knocked him out and now hes in the hospital colombo stood up walked in a circle and spoke spanish so fast that the girls could not understand him finally he sat down again and said that is very bad please tell me more about it nancy took up the story and when she finished describing the attacker colombo said he sounds like a man named sam yunki who used to be a caddy at this club then he worked at crocodile island a short time i dont know where he is now when he was at the island nancy asked was he one of the workmen who was close to mr gimler yes he was very close im sure yunkis the one who threw the golf ball at mr gonzales hes an excellent shot did you know him well bess inquired no colombo replied i was never allowed to be near him thats understandable george said gimler and his partner wouldnt have wanted you to become a pal of his nancy went into the clubhouse to tell this latest news to mr burley when she told him about sam yunki he said i remember hearing about him he was surly and uncooperative that is unless people paid him handsomely or tipped him generously nancy asked mr burley if he knew that yunki had worked at crocodile island after leaving the dub no i didnt he said i heard he left here unexpectedly and no one knew where he went not even the other caddies well ill notify the police at once nancy rejoined her friends who said colombo had already gone back to work as the three girls walked to the parking lot george said we really picked up a good clue when they reached home their hostess was smiling i have another message for you girls she said nancy your friend ned called again i invited the three boys to come down as soon as they could it didnt take them long to make up their minds theyll be at the miami airport this afternoon nancy gave the woman at hug how sweet of you to invite them you know we wanted to farm them out as bodyguards for mr gonzales but now he wont need them hes in the hospital what mrs cosgrove cried out in alarm nancy and the girls told her about the days events oh im so sorry mrs cosgrove said i hope mr gonzales isnt seriously hurt bess said well call tomorrow and find out the doctor said they would need to make some tests nancy bess and george went upstairs to get ready they gave their hair special attention and put on pretty dresses before going to meet the boys miami airport was crowded but the girls had no trouble finding the athletes from emerson college at once the couples paired off to exchange kisses then while the boys were collecting their baggage and later as they all rode to the cosgrove home the girls told them of their adventures to date im relieved that youve made such progress in your sleuthing ned teased we didnt want to come here to join a wildgoose chase george said i havent seen any geese around but there are crocodiles alligators snakes fish that climb trees oh stop your kidding burt interrupted youll see george told him a few minutes later the young people reached the cosgrove house after dinner dave said danny what do you think our chances are of getting onto crocodile island i cant wait to see a crocodile nancy told us that recently it has been closed to visitors danny offered nevertheless to take them all in the skiff the following morning and try to land on the key it may be open he added cheerfully the seven young people set off early and headed directly to crocodile island nancy suggested that if visitors were allowed ashore ned burt and dave should go without the girls no one there knows you so you could look around without making the owners suspicious perhaps you can pick up some clues weve missed unfortunately the planned visit did not take place when they reached the island prominently displayed signs prohibited visitors furthermore there was no activity around the place this lack of activity puzzled nancy i cant understand it she said i wonder if something happened danny shrugged if we cant go ashore we cant find out tell you what suppose i take you boys to an uninhabited key so you can see exactly what one looks like the girls havent seen the island either he smiled i can almost guarantee that you wont find any mosquitoes the girls laughed and then told the boys about the jungle attack danny went on to say that the key ahead was reputed to have been a slave hideout i mean an indianslave hideout ned remarked we havent been here twentyfour hours and ive learned a lot i never knew before george grinned oh hadnt you heard we three girls and danny are walking encyclopedias just ask us anything you want to know about this place okay said burt how deep is the water in biscayne bay george did not hesitate a second it runs from nothing to twenty feet burt was startled and turned to danny is she putting us on no shes not george is telling the truth at low tide some of the sand isnt covered at all the deepwater channels vary from twelve to thirty feet he explained wow burt said i never would have guessed thats interesting when they reached the key danny stayed in the skiff while the others went ashore as they scrambled over the mangrove roots the boys seemed to have trouble this stuff is something dave cried out i just turned my ankle you have to get used to it bess told him and youd better make sure you dont turn your whole leg the young people found it difficult to walk across the coral rock mangrove and spiny plants which grew in profusion about quarter of a mile from shore they spotted a tumbledown thatchedroof hut ned remarked i thought danny said this place was uninhabited im sure it is nancy said no one could possibly live in that cabin they all struggled up to the hut and stared its roof was sagging and the building made of mangrove branches was ready to fall apart ive seen enough dave announced now i can be a walking encyclopedia myself on the subjects of mangrove trees and coral rocks bess was about to say something but screamed instead look out whats the matter george asked her bess continued to scream and pointed at the branches of trees over their heads large black snakes were falling from them in profusion everyone ran and the reptiles missed all of them except ned one slimy creature landed on his shoulders and instantly wound itself around the young mans neck ugh he cried out trying to pull the snake away burt and dave jumped to help him burt grabbed the snake just behind its head while dave closed his fingers around the body near the end of the tail bess was still screaming with the result that all the other snakes scurried off into the underbrush apparently frightened within seconds burt and dave yanked the reptile from neds neck and shoulders they flung it away and with swift humping motions the snake crawled out of sight thanks fellows ned said im glad that thing didnt fasten its fangs in my throat besss continued screaming had brought danny dashing through the bushes what happened he asked george told him and he said dont worry ned those snakes are harmless they live in the water part of the time but come ashore to hunt for food i guess they climb the trees to sleep and dry off nancy told danny his passengers were ready to return to the skiff after they had reached it and climbed aboard the boy pointed out a police launch in the distance i wonder where its going he said nancy asked isnt that the direction of crocodile island yes it is he replied want to follow it and see whats happening you bet everyone replied as they neared the crocodile farm they saw the police launch pull up to the pier four officers jumped out and went ashore nancy and her friends could hear indistinct voices they assumed the police were ordering everyone on the island to come out of hiding when no one appeared the officers blew whistles at the same time the men spread out on the island i wish we could do something to help nancy said danny suggested that they go around to the other side of the island and see if any of the suspects were trying to escape in a boat he put on power and presently the pirate was rounding the tip of the key look george exclaimed theres a boat and men are climbing into it nancy and bess cried out together the whisper oh theyre getting away bess wailed whatll we do to stop them we should tell the police george declared chapter xix triple sleuthing after them bun shouted and danny quickly guided the skiff toward the fleeing boat the whisper was a more powerful craft however and stayed well ahead of them they followed it through the green waterway and it became smaller and smaller in the distance by the time they reached the ocean the whisper was only a tiny dot nancy heaved a sigh she felt completely defeated i was so sure we would close in on those men she said now theyve slipped through our fingers ned patted her shoulder lightly dont give up he said kindly were bound to get a break george said i think the break is coming right now she looked into the sky a helicopter was making its way toward their skiff its a police helicopter burt pointed out the craft lowered until the young people in the skiff could see the officers aboard they were shouting through a megaphone but those on the water could not understand a word too bad we dont have a shiptoshore or shiptoship telephone danny said the only way nancy could get a message across to the men above was to point in the direction the whisper had taken she made motions with her hands to indicate that it was going very fast then she put her finger to her lips hoping the men might translate it to mean whisper she could see the pilot bobbing his head and assumed he understood what she meant that they should follow the suspect boat to the ocean the copter turned and set off in that direction dave spoke up too bad we cant be on hand to witness the capture ill bet the men in the whisper put up a real fight bess said well i for one would just as soon not witness a battle lets go back the skiff returned to crocodile island the police launch was gone but two officers stood on the dock and invited the young people to come ashore they introduced themselves as patman and fifer arent you danny cosgrove and these girls detectives yes nancy smiled and said ned burt and dave were friends weve made some arrests patman reported for one we caught the man named yunki oh the one who hit mr gonzales with a golf ball bess cried out yes putnam said they had found him hiding among some bushes he had readily confessed to hitting the deadly shot toward gonzales but yunki also said that he had not done it of his own accord gimler and sacco had hired him to do not only this but several other illegal jobs yunki was well paid for his dastardly work where is he now ned asked patman told him that the police launch had taken away yunki and all the other workers who admitted helping gimler and sacco in some illegal secret work but would not say what it was two of the men had escaped however its important that we catch them theyre the ones who made phone calls and acted as spies whenever necessary as far as we know they are still on the island they are gimler and saccos special henchmen named stryker and jackson unfortunately for them they were not quick enough to follow gimler on the whisper which set off in a hurry when you people showed up at the key nancy asked if gimler had gone off with matt carmen and breck tobin patman nodded yunki told us that we sent word for a police helicopter to go out and intercept the craft the listening group also learned that the fake mr and mrs cosgrove and their daughter who had posed as miss boonton had been arrested they were part of the gimlersacco gang the weapon efee dug up belonged to sacco who buried it so the police would not find it if they visited crocodile island he left the dog on the deserted key because efee had almost bitten one of the men on the whisper whose cruelty he hated nancy looked at the police officers and asked did i understand you to say that you think two of the workmen are still on the island yes a couple of saccos special buddies and bad both of them they have records where did they go nancy asked we dont know patman replied he walked off to join his fellow officer in another hunt nancy said to her friends why dont we start a search great idea ned agreed the others were eager to begin but bess was cautious maybe the men are armed if so were walking into danger ned hurried off to ask the officers about the firearms patman replied according to yunki they were not armed didnt have time to go for any i doubt that youd be in any danger if you want to look around fifer and i must stay within sight of the beach until the launch returns it took all the captives to jail nancy had followed ned and was alarmed at its import she asked quickly was one of the prisoners a man named sol patman pulled a pad from his pocket and consulted it i have the list of prisoners here theres no one named sol on it im glad nancy said that hes not with gimler and sacco weve talked to him hes very nice probably he didnt come back to the island after being in key biscayne nancy and ned returned to their friends she suggested that they separate into couples and make their search on the island some distance from one another well be couple one george and burt two and bess and dave three in case of trouble call out your numbers instead of your names and danny how about your going around the island in the skiff if you see anyone or anything suspicious sound your horn okay he agreed the three couples started off on their search bess and dave stopped for a few minutes to look at the crocodiles and bess remarked if all the workers are gone whos going to take care of these reptiles dave grinned how would you like the job instead of answering bess made a face at him just then one of the old male crocodiles grunted then hissed and opened its jaws wide within seconds he closed them with such a resounding snap that the couple jumped bess and dave waited no longer they took off for a copse of mangroves to start their hunt for the missing suspects meanwhile burt and george tramped through a jungle area looking up into trees behind bushes and on the ground they stopped every few minutes to listen but everything was quiet and there was no sign anywhere of the wanted men they came to a low coral cave and stopped isnt that attractive george whispered i wonder if those men are hiding inside ill look burt said no they might trap you and attack ill be careful just follow me but wait when i get to the entrance the two advanced without making a sound slowly they neared the entrance then burt picked up a stone and threw it inside there was no reaction from within he cautiously peered around the rocky opening and saw the small interior the walls were jagged and arranged in a moonshaped pattern but there was no cement or any other indication that the cave was manmade its empty burt reported anyway its not much of a hiding place george looked inside isnt that coral fascinating she said think of the millions of tiny polyps climbing up and dying to form layer after layer of coral yes burt said but dont get sidetracked never mind the coral now lets look for those missing men the couple went deeper into the jungle rabbits and raccoons scurried away from them suddenly the stillness was broken by a loud noise something was crashing through the underbrush ahead of them george wondered if it was an animal then they heard human voices they may be the suspects burt whispered come on all this time nancy and ned were searching along the waterfront thinking the men might have hidden a second boat among the mangroves and would try to reach it suddenly nancy stopped short look she said pointing to a periscope out in the green waterway its moving in the direction of the island ned said excited maybe itll dock here lets return to the pier nancy suggested she and ned quickly made their way back careful to remain shielded by trees at all times just before they reached the open areas the submarine surfaced it slid in noiselessly the hatch opened and two men appeared they jumped to the dock and disappeared in the direction of the main building nancy and ned wondered if the men were aware of the recent events on the island obviously they were not worried about being seen or were they just desperate nancy decided on a bold move ned are you game to go aboard and hide sure thing wait just a second nancy said she plucked a leaf from a trailing seagrape bush next she picked up a small sturdy stick and scratched out the words going aboard couple one she jabbed the leaf onto a tree twig and beckoned ned to follow her quickly the two went to the open hatch and climbed down the iron ladder where can we hide ned asked looking around nancy pointed to the upright lockers and opened one it contained a coiled rope similar to the one she had seen on the sub in key west ned checked the adjoining locker behind some clothes many boxes were stacked neatly from the floor to the ceiling each one was stamped high speed cameras bridgeport ct thats a lot of cameras for a few guys ned remarked right nancy said now suspicious open the next locker ned did and found similar boxes concealed behind raingear further search revealed guns grenades and explosives in each locker ned shook his head in disbelief and nancys eyes were wide with amazement ned she exclaimed now i know what the secret of crocodile island is gimler and sacco are taking expensive highspeed cameras out of the us theyre smuggling them to someplace maybe mexico as the two hurried back to the ladder ned put a hand on nancys shoulder youre right and this means were in great danger wed better get out of here before just then they heard voices two men were conversing rapidly and walking toward nancy and ned the couple who did not want to be seen scooted into the first two lockers she hid behind coiled ropes ned managed to squeeze in back of the raingear and stood next to the boxes of cameras they left the doors slightly ajar so they could see who was coming the two men they had seen leave the sub reentered it quickly one of them turned a handle which slowly closed the hatch the other man rotated a wheel that retracted the periscope then he started the engine and the sub moved away nancy and ned held their breath wondering what would happen next the man at the wheel suddenly laughed he said confidently we pulled that one off all right no more bothering with gimler and sacco next stop mexico chapter xx submarine prisoners mexico nancy thought she and ned were terrified when they realized that they were being taken out of the country with no chance to call for help they tried to keep calm and figure out some way to outwit these men the prisoners listened attentively when the men resumed their conversation one said i had no idea when we went into shipping stolen cameras with gimler and sacco that we could make so much money i dont know why we ever bothered with the small amount we got out of the crocodile ecology company the other man said you forget williams that we needed a cover id say we just got out of there in time that nosey girl detective and her friends are just too smart in spite of their predicament nancy and ned smiled at this remark williams said nothing to worry about now captain frederick were rid of the bunch the men talked about what they were going to do with all the money they had made frederick said ill show those relatives of mine in mexico what i can do even if they thought i was a nogood he laughed raucously how easy the whole operation was we stole a lot of cameras from the factory in connecticut and bought a whole lot of others cheap on the black market and sold them at a three hundred percent profit nancy and ned almost suffocated in the lockers but did not dare miss a word they learned that the cameras were shipped out at night to a freighter going south then they were transferred to the whisper which carried them to the submarine then the whisper returned to the key which was home base whenever the submarine came there the periscope would be hoisted if any visitors were on the island an alarm would be sounded and the sightseers sent away williams said its too bad we couldnt fill that order for five hundred cameras if the buyer in mexico had only given us a little more time we wouldnt have had any trouble the men were silent for a while then williams said we wont be tying up for some time i think ill put away this rope were not using its in the way he stepped to the locker in which nancy was hiding and yanked open the door the girl detective tried to slump to the floor so she would not be seen but it was impossible upon spotting her williams cried out a volume of expletives he reached in roughly grabbed nancys arm and pulled her out into the passageway the captain also exclaimed and then said to nancy how did you get here she did not answer i said how did you come aboard this sub the captain demanded still nancy made no reply ill make you answer frederick cried out exasperated and grabbed hold of her with both arms he was so strong that she thought he would crush her ribs at this second a voice said let her alone ned the subs captain let go of nancy and stared at the young man who are you ned said nothing by this time williams and frederick were jabbering loudly and arguing with each other about what they should do with their stowaways we cant take them into mexico williams said youre right the captain agreed what do you suggest that we go topside open the hatch and push them out into the water ned spoke up youd better not do that he said then decided to try a bluff did you know that were being followed by helicopters the men looked stunned williams rushed to raise the periscope above the water after turning it in various directions he said i dont see any helicopter the captain angry yelled at ned you were just trying to bluff us well were not going to fall for it after a pause williams said i have an idea captain we both like money whv dont we hold these two snoopers for ransom captain frederick thought this over and finally agreed it was not a bad idea just how can we work it he wondered ill think of something his fellow officer said give me time nancy and ned were glad of the temporary reprieve their thoughts went back to crocodile island where were the rest of their friends had they found nancys note if so had they done anything about it all this time the two couples had been very busy george and burt had finally startled stryker and jackson who were hiding in the jungle they managed to corner them then talked to the men from a distance its no use to try getting away george called all the others on this island have left they didnt even wait to take you along now you have nothing they have the money and wont dare come back here because of the police in feet there are policemen on the island now hunting for you what stryker exclaimed then gave a sneering smile youre trying to trick us burt spoke up its no trick you dont have a chance the couple continued to coax the men to come out of hiding but several more minutes went by before they consented to do so burt told them to walk ahead he and george would follow all the way to the pier on the other side of the island the couple was very watchful in case the men should try to get away apparently the fugitives felt beaten because they did not attempt to run or fight when the two captives saw the officers on the pier they knew burt and george had been telling the truth the captives raised no objection when they were placed under arrest some time before this bess and dave having found no trace of the suspects had started back toward the pier as they were making their way along the waterfront bess grabbed daves arm look there are nancy and ned nancy is writing something on a leaf the couple were too far away to distinguish what it might be but started to run forward as fast as they could over the mangrove roots when they reached the note bess and dave read it quickly going aboard couple one going aboard what dave asked he and bess ran faster a few moments later they saw nancy and ned hurry across the pier bess exclaimed theres the sub oh my goodness theyre climbing down inside we must stop them before the couple could get near enough to shout to their friends they saw two men dash from the main building and get onto the submarine quickly they descended and closed the hatch the ship submerged and took off bess was in tears oh dave whats going to happen now to nancy and ned dave wasted no time in conversation wheres the office ill show you bess said and the two sped off to the little building the door was open dave looked around for what he wanted to use then began to send a radio message to the coast guard in as few words as possible he described what had taken place on crocodile island within seconds a return message was received two coast guard cutters would be sent out at once one would go directly to crocodile island the other would go after the submarine we will also send out two helicopters try to have someone tell them which direction the sub and the speedboat took the coast guard operator said about this time the two policemen who had gone into the jungle returned they were amazed to hear what had happened and thanked dave for sending out the alarm the officer had hardly finished speaking when they saw the two suspects being ushered into the area by george and burt patman and his companion looked astounded you caught them george could not help quipping yes and with no guns the officers gave the two prisoners a long look then advised them of their rights to seek legal counsel the two men exchanged worried glances but did not answer where does the sub go patman asked no reply bess felt that treating the men gruffly was accomplishing nothing she tried a softer more kindly approach smiling at them she said what about your families surely you care for them and would like to get back to them as soon as possible you cant hide out forever one prisoner stared at her are you some kind of preacher he asked you sure talk like one but what you say makes good sense ill tell what i know after gimler and sacco are caught they ran out on us so i wont mind squealing just then the group heard a motor and turned to see the police launch coming after it docked and the two prisoners were taken aboard the officer in charge lieutenant royce said the whisper was spotted and the coast guard picked up gimler sacco carmen and tobin great said george but what about the submarine two of our friends are prisoners on it a copter and two coast guard revenue cutters are after it he replied they got directions from danny cosgrove he followed the whisper in the pirate the speedboat got away but he spotted the sub as it came out the channel danny wigwagged signals to the copter ill see what else i can find out he leaped ashore and went at once to the office in a few minutes he was back good news the officer said your friends are safe and are on their way back the smugglers have been arrested they wouldnt talk but nancy drew and ned nickerson told their story for them and for gimler and sacco the freighters captain is also in custody wonderful wonderful bess cried out and the whole group clapped bess george burt and dave hugged one another in their exuberance lieutenant royce smiled as he boarded the launch and said nancy ned and danny will meet you at the cosgroves a copter will pick you all up goodby he waved and gave orders to shove off in a short time the helicopter landed and soon nancys friends were back in key biscayne there was a joyful reunion and an exchange of stories far into the night of course nancy though happy at the successful outcome of the mystery hoped another would soon come her way it did it was called the thirteenth pearl the following afternoon she and her friends went to see mr gonzales in his hospital room he was sitting up and declared he felt much better but lets not talk about me he said after nancy introduced the others tell me everything after he had heard all the details and thanked the young sleuths nancy said theres one question i have when you told us not to come down here was it because you were intimidated by gimler and sacco yes he admitted i see now why they didnt want you to investigate them he smiled but im mighty glad you came thank you all for your superb work and now mr gonzales said i have a surprise for you i have taken over ownership of crocodile island i want you to greet the new manager and his assistant he waved toward the corridor through the doorway walked two smiling young men colombo and sol nancy and the others cheered softly and congratulated them thank you said colombo and now sol and i must get back to feed our pets the crocodiles of crocodile island
