how shakspere came to write the tempest contents introduction by ashley h thorndike how shakspere came to write the tempest notes by a h t introduction mr kiplings brilliant reconstruction of the genesis of the tempest may remind us how often that play has excited the creative fancy of its readers it has given rise to many imitations adaptations and sequels fletcher copied its storm its desert island and its woman who had never seen a man suckling borrowed its spirits davenant and dryden added a man who had never seen a woman a husband for sycorax and a sister for caliban mr percy mackaye has used its scene mythology and persons for his tercentenary shaksperian masque its suggestiveness has extended beyond the drama and aroused moral allegories and disquisitions caliban has been elaborated as the missing link and in the philosophical drama of renan as the spirit of democracy and in brownings poem as a satire on the anthropomorphic conception of deity but apart from such commentaries by poets and philosophers the poem has lived these many generations in the imaginations of thousands there the enchanted island has multiplied and continued its existence shelley sang of a land far from ours where music and moonlight and feeling are one shakspere created that land as the possession of each of us not far removed but close to the great continent of our daily routine and drudgery lies this enchanted island where we may find music and moonlight and feeling and also fun and mischief and wisdom there in tune with the melody and transfigured as by the charm of moonlight we may encounter the nonsense of drunken clowns the mingled greed and romance of primitive man the elfishness of a child the beauty of girlhood and the benign philosophy of old age we may leave the city at the close of business and if we avoid the snares of caliban and trinculo we may sup with prospero ariel and miranda how did shakspere discover this enchanted island from what materials did he create the baseless fabric of this vision what had london playhouses to do with these spirits of thin air on what books or plays were these dreams made out of the issues of rivalry and profit which beset the kings company of players at the globe and the blackfriars how came this insubstantial pageant we have been told that the sonnets are the key with which to unlock shaksperes heart and perhaps if we could answer all these questions we might have the key to his imagination i do not believe however that his imagination was lockt up rather it was open wide to many impulses hospitable to countless influences this apparently is the opinion of mr kipling who suggests that shaksperes vision was woven from the most prosaic material from nothing more promising in fact than the chatter of a halftipsy sailor at the theater mr kipling writes as one inventor of tales about another certainly no one is better qualified to trace out the processes of the creative imagination and to discover the very fabrics of its visions in those marvelous stories of his who has not recognized a shaksperian catholicity in the quest of fact and a shaksperian alchemy in its transformation he has himself created many enchanted islands and he knows whereof they are made the sailor just home from a famous shipwreck on the bermudas might have stept out of one of mr kiplings tales but he becomes a factor in some very acute criticism for the sailors profligate abundance of detail at the beginning when he was more or less sober supplied and surely established the earthbasis of the play in accordance with the great law that a story to be truly miraculous must be ballasted with facts mr kiplings letter has found a place in all subsequent critical discussions of the play and has become a contribution to that historical research which seeks to discover the ways and means by which literature is made it may not be unseemly therefore to bring together as an introduction and commentary some other suggestions that criticism has advanced in regard to the influences and incentives that directed shaksperes art in this play written at the very close of his career and at the moment when the elizabethan drama had reached its highest development recent investigation has added to our certainty that the play was written in or for mr ernest law has shown that the supposedly forged entry of its performance at court on november is genuine various passages in the play indicate that it was not written before july when sir thomas gates and his ships sailed up the thames with news of the safety of the fleet that had departed from plymouth over a year before this fleet of nine vessels had started for the new colony in virginia had been scattered by a great storm and the ship sea venture with the leaders aboard sir george somers sir thomas gates and captain christopher newport had been cast ashore on one of the bermudas but there had been no loss of life the adventurers had lived comfortably for many months had built two pinnaces from the materials of the wreck and had rejoined their comrades in virginia before the arrival of gates from virginia reports of the wreck had reached london so his safe return was a nine days wonder full accounts were written two were printed in the autumn and others circulated in manuscript shakspere certainly read some of the pamphlets recounting the strange experiences of the expedition and he made some use of other voyagers tales as raleighs discovery of guiana but he may have heard much more than he read in the common gossip of the day or enter mr kiplings sailor the original stephano fresh from the seas and halfseas over from this original stephano or from the voyagers tales may have come some hints for caliban there were many strange accounts of cannibals and monsters an earlier narrative tells of a sea monster arms like a man without hair and at the elbows great fins like a fish indians had been brought back from america and only a few years before the play several had been exhibited and aroused much curiosity as trinculo observes when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar they will lay out ten to see a dead indian caliban was doubtless intended to be of the earth earthy the opposite of ariel the spirit of the air and was also intended as a sketch of the savage resisting the mastery of the european but brutish and savage though he be he too is a dweller in the enchanted island for him too life has its romance there is no finer touch of shaksperes magic in the whole play than this marco polo had recounted that you shall heare in the ayre the sound of tabers and other instruments to put the travellers in fear c by evill spirits that make these sounds and also do call travellers by their names but shaksperes caliban reassures his companions frightened by ariel playing on a tabor be not afeard the isle is full of noises sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears and sometimes voices that if i then had wakd after long sleep will make me sleep again and then in dreaming the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that when i wakd i cried to dream again the enchanted island owes still more to preceding voyagers in the great seas of romance shakspere had made many earlier voyages thither but he was not the first columbus to search out the undiscovered lands of illusions and enchantments fortunately for us he lived in the period of imaginative adventure and steered his crafts on the oceans whence many predecessors had returned treasureladen this is no place to relate the various circumstances that placed the men of the sixteenth century in a fortunate position for romance or to indicate the long development of romanticcomedy in which shakspere played so great a part but surely the interview between the dramatist and the sailor would have had very different results if the elizabethan theater had not been accustomed to the union of the laughable and the romantic the comic and the marvellous such a union is not a common one there are no romanticcomedies in the literature of antiquity and very few in modern literature since shaksperes death he found a stage that was already the home of romance used to fantasy and medley and used also to fill out a three hours entertainment with sentiment and fun music and monsters idealized heroines and puns romance had found its readiest entrance to the stage thru the shows and spectacles which delighted the courts of the tudors venus and diana or loyalty and sedition or red cross knight and fairy princess or whoever else if sumptuously arrayed and bejeweled and sufficiently attended might be wheeled in on a huge car representing castle or garden or island decorated with flowers and spangles begin with a tableau and end with a dance along with all this splendor it would not be thought inappropriate to have a clown dance a jig or mimic the antics of a drunken man such spectacles soon became the joy of the public as well as of the court and were imitated by many a rustic holofernes or bottom nymphs and fairies the nine worthies or the golden age might find representation by almost any village pedagog and his school children out of such entertainments there soon developt a kind of comedy at first the peculiar property of the children of the royal choirs who performed at court but soon adapting itself to the adult companies and public theaters this comedy availed itself of any stories that might come to hand so they were strange unusual marvelous impossible enough and accompanied them with music dancing and spectacle and with lively jests in the mouth of the smallest boys dressed as pages endymion in love with the moon the judgment of paris pandora and her varied actions under the seven planets the rival magic of friars bacon and bungay jack the giant killer alexander the great in love with campaspe who preferred apelles these are some of the themes astrologers amazons fairies sirens witches ghosts are some of the personages who appear along with the singing pages and olympian deities of course these persons and these marvels are impossible on any stage most of all by daylight in the roofless public theaters of shaksperes london but neither audience nor dramatist thought of impossibility they tried everything on their stage even their wonderlands when shakspere began to write plays the stage was well used to romance it was the comedies of lyly and greene with their beautiful and unselfish maidens their wonders and shows their witty dialogs and jesters their lovers crosses and final happiness their utopias and fairies which prepared the way for shaksperes two gentlemen of verona and loves labors lost and for his great series of romantic plays from a midsummer nights dream to twelfth night but by both dramatists and audiences had become somewhat sophisticated and tired of romance and the theaters turned to plays of a different fashion to tragedies that searched the ways of crime and punishment and to comedies that treated contemporary folly and vice with realism and satire from the date of twelfth night to that of cymbeline it is difficult to find a romanticcomedy on the london stage there are no more marvels and magic no charming princesses disguised as pages no moonlit forests and terraces no rescues and reconciliations not much sentiment and no fun except what may be found on the seamy side of reality shakspere seems to have had little taste for satire and he wrote no satirical and realistic plays of the sort temporarily in fashion but during these eight years his comedies like measure for measure have no romantic charm and his energies are given to tragedy he is occupied with the pomp and majesty of human hope and with the inevitable waste and failure of human achievement but for his hamlet othello macbeth coriolanus and the rest there were no forests of arden and no enchanted islands like his associates he seems to have forsaken romance what turned his imagination from tragedy back to romance in my opinion it was the success of two brilliant young dramatists beaumont and fletcher who in a series of remarkable dramas made romance again popular on the london stage their romantic plays employ many of the old incidents and personages but in general character differ strikingly from the plays of a decade or two earlier they are hardly comedies at all tho they have their humorous passages but tragedies and tragicomedies dealing with more thrilling circumstances and less naive wonderments than the earlier plays instead of a combination of romance and comedy they aim at a contrast of the tragic and idyllic they oppose a story of sexual passion with one of idealized sentiment and delight in a succession of thrills as by clever stagecraft they hurry us from one suspense into another surprise until the very end you can scarcely guess whether it will be tragic or happy their land of romance is somewhat artificial and theatrical but yet it has as of old its adventures dangers escapes rescues jealousies suspicions reconciliations and reunions and it has its idyls of forests and fountains of lovelorn maidens and enraptured princes it is a land of thrills and surprises but also of idealization and poetry for in all that choir of poets who wrote for the london theaters there was no one except shakspere who could excel these young dramatists in their power to turn the affairs and emotions of mankind into copious verse now tumultuous now placid but always bubbling with fancy and flowing melodiously if shaksperes mind was directed again to romantic themes and situations by the success of beaumont and fletchers plays the clearest evidence of his indebtedness to them is to be found in his cymbeline which has many marked similarities to their philaster in his two plays which follow the winters tale and the tempest there is no detailed resemblance to the romantic tragiccomedies of the younger men shakspere as well as they had the whole tradition of romantic drama to draw from and in particular he had his own past practice he did not need to be shown how to depict romantic love or charming heroines or ardent suitors for drinking scenes like those of trinculo and stephano or for dialog like that not very witty one of gonzalo and the courtiers he had many passages in his own plays that served as guides moreover if cymbeline is an example of only partially successful experimentation with new methods the winters tale and still more the tempest seem to me triumphant and unguided excursions of his own in the new field but i think that shakspere was attracted to this field by contemporary stagesuccesses and that in seeking for novel and invented plots in the contrast of tragic and idyllic elements in the unusual and rapidly shifting situations in the loose and parenthetical style and in the elaboration of the dnouement he was adapting himself to the new formulas and fashions in which beaumont and fletcher were the leaders still another suggestion came from the theater but this time from the court the court shows of the sort which we have noticed as characteristic of the early years of elizabeths reign had given place to a better ordered and more sumptuous spectacle the court masque under james i with the great architect inigo jones to devise the machines and setting and with ben jonson to write the librettos one of these masques was a magnificent affair it was given on festal occasions at court and often cost thousands of pounds it had but a single or at most two performances always at night and it came to follow a distinct formula the kernel of the show was the masked dance in which members of the court even king and queen took part this dance or masque proper often elaborated into several measures came near the end of the show as accompaniments there were music instrumental and vocal a play of some length usually with mythological or allegorical motive various grotesque dances by professional performers preceding the main masque and often integrated with the play and a spectacular stagesetting these shows were given in great halls brilliantly lighted the stage was splendidly decorated gods and goddesses floated among the clouds and elaborate machines and scenes were devised in one masque a few years before the tempest an artificial sea was seen to shoot forth over the stage as it flowed to land this was the main machine a great stage four feet high on trestles on which was a great concave shell like mother of pearl containing the masquers and conveyed by many seamonsters hidden by the torchbearers the costumes of the masquers were in brilliant colors and heavily jeweled these were often bizarre but inigo jones knew the monuments of classical antiquity and the artistic achievements of renaissance italy as well as jonson knew classical and humanistic literature the living pictures were often in richness and color no unworthy rivals of the frescoes with which rubens had decorated the ceiling of the masquing hall such expensive spectacles were beyond the reach of the professional theaters but contemporary dramatists frequently found something that could be adapted or imitated for the public stage so the antick dance of satyrs in a winters tale three of whom are announced as having already appeared before the king seems borrowed from an antimasque in ben jonsons masque of oberon in two plays of nearly the same date there is a well defined effort to combine the masque and the regular drama into a distinctive and novel dramatic entertainment in the four plays in one of beaumont and fletcher and the tempest of shakspere the tempest has always been a spectacular play on the stage and so it must have appeared to him and as a spectacle having many of the features of the court masque there is music and song ariel prospero and even caliban are proper figures for a court show the masque proper is used to celebrate the betrothal in the fourth act this is a simplified form of such a masque as would be given at court there is evidently some machinery it is the insubstantial pageant that calls forth prosperos famous lines ariel iris ceres and juno appear juno descending from the heavens there is music and a song and ferdinand cries this is a most majestic vision and harmonious charmingly may i be bold to think these spirits and when prospero says they are spirits summoned by his art ferdinand exclaims let me live here ever so rare a wondred father and a wise makes this place paradise it is not miranda now but the machine and costumes used in courtspectacles that turn the platform into a land of romance then enter nymphs naiads of the winding brooks with sedgd crowns and sun burnt reapers with ryestraw hats these are the main masquers and join in a graceful dance until upon prosperos sudden start to a strange hollow and confused noise they heavily vanish more ingenious is shaksperes use of the antimasques ie dances by professional performers drest in fantastic costumes as animals satyrs statues witches etc such are the several strange shapes of iii who first bring in the banquet and again enter and dance with mocks and mows and carrying out the table and in iv the divers spirits who in shape of dogs and hounds hunt about the drunken conspirators while prospero and ariel set them on for a stage then that had long been used to romance shakspere planned a new wonderment for it he revived some of his old creations from illyria and arden and fairyland all transformed by a sea change into something rich and strange and he added some excitements and novelties to keep pace with the thrilling tragicomedies of beaumont and fletcher and just as years before in the midsummer nights dream he had drawn hints from the court entertainments by children so now he conceived a spectacle that so far as was possible might rival the great shows of the jacobean court he did not need to go beyond the drama to find abundant suggestions for his new venture but this was to be a play as well as a show and must have some kind of plot perhaps he found an italian novella with the story no one has been able to find it since then but stories somewhat similar to that of the tempest occur in a spanish tale and in a german play there was indeed a real alfonso king of naples and a duke of milan who was dispossesst and another named prospero but whatever story shakspere found it is my notion that he forgot most of it the palace intrigues the rivalries of the banisht and usurping dukes set at naught by the love at first sight of their children the perilous adventures and the dnouement brought about by magic were commonplaces of fiction shakspere wanted to weld them into a more surprising fable perhaps it was at the very moment when he was most intent on this problem that the sailor from the fleet of sir thomas gates hove into view even the mariners ballast of facts did not quite suffice as shakspere wrote he recalled some lines from his old favorite ovid to fill out one of prosperos descriptions and he used the newlyread montaigne for gonzalos account of a utopian commonwealth and some fine lines from sir william alexanders tragedy of darius seem to have lingered in his recollection when he wrote of the great globe which is like a pageant and life that is like a dream as he wrote of prospero he thought too of his own career of his own so potent art of his promised retirement and the fading pageants of both life and art perhaps too he may have thought of some of his battles of wit with ben jonson in the mermaid tavern ben was a great stickler for the rules though he lamented that the unity of time was very difficult to secure on the english stage he thought masques should be kept distinct from comedies and he had no liking for fantastic medleys indeed a few years later he indulged in a scoff at shaksperes servantmonster and at those who beget tales tempests and such like drolleries shakspere recalling some such discussion may have said to himself well here is a play as fantastic as possible and just to show benjamin what can be done i will keep it in strict accord with his classical unities of time and place for this or some other propose he was for once at great pains to keep all the action within the time of the stageperformance tho in doing so he makes his one nautical error by forgetting that the seamans measure of time was a halfhour glass when prospero first consults ariel we are precisely told that it is two oclock in the afternoon and just before the end of the drama we are told that three hours have elapst it has taken me too long to enumerate some of the materials in addition to those of mr kiplings sailor with which shaksperes fantasy worked i hope i may have suggested that almost always as here in this extraordinary flight of his imagination he was writing as a playwright and not without full use of the hints and opportunities which the contemporary theater afforded and i should like to suggest also that to the playwrights of that theater there were open many and great opportunities sailors home from a new world might cross the threshold of the dramatist and dramatists then could think of magicians and monsters and fairies of goddesses and drunken boors of ideal commonwealths the three unities and beautiful verse all in terms of the stage thru some such processes as have been rehearst by some such influences shaksperes imagination must have been led to the construction of a spectacular play that would win applause both in the blackfriars playhouse and at court perhaps it is out of such varied driftwood that all enchanted islands are created ashley h thorndike april how shakspere came to write the tempest how shakspere came to write the tempest to the editor of the spectator sir your article on landscape and literature in the spectator of june th has the following among other suggestive passages but whence came the vision of the enchanted island in the tempest it had no existence in shaksperes world but was woven out of such stuff as dreams are made of may i cite malones suggestion connecting the play with the casting away of sir george somers on the island of bermuda in and further may i be allowed to say how it seems to me possible that the vision was woven from the most prosaic material from nothing more promising in fact than the chatter of a halftipsy sailor at a theater thus a stagemanager who writes and vamps plays moving among his audience overhears a mariner discoursing to his neighbor of a grievous wreck and of the behavior of the passengers for whom all sailors have ever entertained a natural contempt he describes with the wealth of detail peculiar to sailors measures taken to claw the ship off a leeshore how helm and sails were workt what the passengers did and what he said one pungent phrase to be rendered later into what care these brawlers for the name of king strikes the managers ear and he stands behind the talkers perhaps only onetenth of the earnestly delivered handonshoulder sea talk was actually used of all that was automatically and unconsciously stored by the island man who knew all inland arts and crafts nor is it too fanciful to imagine a halfturn to the second listener as the mariner banning his luck as mariners will says there are those who would not give a doit to a poor man while they will lay out ten to see a rareeshow a dead indian were he in foreign parts as he now is in england he could show people something in the way of strange fish is it to consider too curiously to see a drink ensue on this hint the manager dealt but little in his plays with the sea at first hand and his instinct for new words would have been waked by what he had already caught and with the drink a sailors minute description of how he went across the reefs to the island of his calamity or islands rather for there were many some you could almost carry away in your pocket they were sown broadcast like like the nutshells on the stage there many islands in truth says the manager patiently and afterwards his sebastian says to antonio i think he will carry the island home in his pocket and give it to his son for an apple to which antonio answers and sowing the kernels of it in the sea bring forth more islands but what was the island like says the manager the sailor tries to explain it was green with yellow in it a tawnycolored country the color that is to say of the coralbeached cedarcovered bermuda of today and the air made one sleepy and the place was full of noises the muttering and roaring of the sea among the islands and between the reefs and there was a souwest wind that blistered one all over the elizabethan mariner would not discriminate finely between blisters and prickly heat but the bermudian of today will tell you that the souwest or lighthouse wind in summer brings that plague and general discomfort that the coral rock battered by the sea rings hollow with strange sounds answered by the winds in the little cramped valleys is a matter of common knowledge the man refresht with some drink then describes the geography of his landing place the spot where trinculo makes his first appearance he insists and reinsists on details which to him at one time meant life or death and the manager follows attentively he can give his audience no more than a few hangings and a placard for scenery but that his lines shall lift them beyond that bare show to the place he would have them the manager needs for himself the clearest possible understanding the most ample detail he must see the scene in the round solid ere he peoples it much doubtless he discarded but so closely did he keep to his original informations that those who go today to a certain beach some two miles from hamilton will find the stage set for act ii scene of the tempest a bare beach with the wind singing through the scrub at the lands edge a gap in the reefs wide enough for the passage of stephanos butt of sack and these eyes have seen it a cave in the coral within easy reach of the tide whereto such a butt might be conveniently rolled my cellar is in a rock by the seaside where my wine is hid there is no other cave for some two miles heres neither bush nor shrub one is exposed to the wrath of yond same black cloud and here the currents strand wreckage it was so well done that after three hundred years a stray tripper and no shakspere scholar recognized in a flash that old first set of all so far good up to this point the manager has gained little except some suggestions for an opening scene and some notion of an uncanny island the mariner one cannot believe that shakspere was mean in these little things is dipping to a deeper drunkenness suddenly he launches into a preposterous tale of himself and his fellows flung ashore separated from their officers horribly afraid of the devilhaunted beach of noises with their heads full of the fumes of broacht liquor one castaway was found hiding under the ribs of a dead whale which smelt abominably they hauled him out by the legs he mistook them for imps and gave him drink and now discipline being melted they would strike out for themselves defy their officers and take possession of the island the narrators mates in this enterprise were probably described as fools he was the only sober man in the company so they went inland faring badly as they staggered up and down this pestilent country they were prickt with palmettoes and the cedar branches raspt their faces then they found and stole some of their officers clothes which were hanging up to dry but presently they fell into a swamp and what was worse into the hands of their officers and the great expedition ended in muck and mire truly an island bewicht else why their cramps and sickness sack never made a man more than reasonably drunk he was prepared to answer for unlimited sack but what befell his stomach and head was the purest magic that honest man ever met a drunken sailor of today wandering about bermuda would probably sympathize with him and today as then if one takes the easiest inland road from trinculos beach near hamilton the path that a drunken man would infallibly follow it ends abruptly in swamp the one point that our mariner did not dwell upon was that he and the others were suffering from acute alcoholism combined with the effects of nerveshattering peril and exposure hence the magic that a wizard should control such an island was demanded by the beliefs of all seafarers of that date accept this theory and you will concede that the tempest came to the manager sanely and normally in the course of his daily life he may have been casting about for a new play he may have purposed to vamp an old one say aurelio and isabella or he may have been merely waiting on his demon but it is all prosperos wealth against calibans pignuts that to him in a receptive hour sent by heaven entered the original stephano fresh from the seas and halfseas over to him stephano told his tale all in one piece a two hours discourse of most glorious absurdities his profligate abundance of detail at the beginning when he was more or less sober supplied and surely establisht the earthbasis of the play in accordance with the great law that a story to be truly miraculous must be ballasted with facts his maunderings of magic and incomprehensible ambushes when he was without reservation drunk and this is just the time when a lesserminded man than shakspere would have paid the reckoning and turned him out suggested to the manager the peculiar note of its supernatural mechanism truly it was a dream but that there may be no doubt of its source or of his obligation shakspere has also made the dreamer immortal rudyard kipling notes notes mr kiplings letter was originally publisht in the london spectator for july he allowed it to appear as his contribution to a book of homage to shakspere oxford university press pp but he has not yet included it in any collection of his miscellaneous writings and for his permission to reprint it in this series the committee in charge of the dramatic museum desires to express its thanks malones suggestion was presented in his essay an account of the incidents from which the title and a part of the story of shaksperes tempest were derived and its true date ascertained this was privately printed in and supplemented by an additional pamphlet in both were reprinted in volume xv of the boswellmalone variorum edition of shakspere in malones essay gives a careful analysis of the several contemporary accounts of the shipwreck of sir george somers and of their relations to the tempest in his preface malone states that his account was written some years ago but acknowledges that his discovery had been anticipated by douce in his illustrations of shakspere published in in his little book shaksperes sea forms explained bristol mr w b whall master mariner expresses his belief that shaksperes use of sea phrases is copious and accurate he declares that words and phrases of an extremely technical nature are scattered thru shaksperes plays and a mistake in their use is never made then he asks could a mere lubber have steered clear of error in the use of such terms p mr whall had earlier noted that there are seven years of shaksperes life as to which we have scarcely any information and that one of these years was the year of the armada when he had only just attained his majority where was shakspere and what was he doing there was a hot press for men to man the fleet is it possible that he was among the prest p it was a time of exaltation of all things pertaining to sea things and it is no wonder that the playwrights of the day heywood for one made frequent use of sea words the wonder is that without professional acquaintance shakspere should always use these terms correctly p he abounds in elizabethan sailor talk pure and simple and a little later mr whall draws attention to the fact that sea expressions crop up in quite unexpected places just as theatrical expressions crop up and that they are all phrased as by a sailor p then mr whall quotes a remark from another master mariner captain basil hall who had earlier noticed this striking characteristic one would like to know how shakspere pickt it up when he comes to deal with the tempest mr whall cites the saying of lord mulgrave some time first lord of the admiralty the first scene of the tempest is a very striking instance of the great accuracy of shaksperes knowledge in a professional science with this mr whall disagrees now this does not of necessity follow a playwright with any sense would if about to write such a scene obtain professional assistance unless he himself had professional knowledge to steer clear of error the whole scene is graphic accurate and correct in the terms of nautical speech but it is by no means such a proof of the writers sea knowledge as are the scattered and wholly unexpected nautical references in many other plays every one of which might have been written by an experienced seaman the most recent and the most careful consideration of shaksperes acquaintance with seafaring life is contained in mr l g carr laughtons essay on the navy ships and sailors contributed to shaksperes england
