chapter one a shocking confession maybe he was mad maybe he had a sixth sense or was he really haunted i he told me the first part of the story and i saw the last part with my own eyes at school my friend haldane and i hated a boy called visger when we did something wrong he always told the teacher one day we stole some cherries from a tree do you know who did it visger the teacher asked it was haldane and winston he replied later haldane asked him how he knew it was us i didnt know he said i just felt certain and i was right haldane and i grew up visger became a vegetarian and never drank alcohol he also became sir george visger when we all left oxford university i went away to india after a year i came back and wanted to see haldane he was always happy kind and honest i wanted to see the smile in his blue eyes again and hear his happy laugh so i went to visit him in london but this time he did not laugh he was miserable his face was pale and he looked weak and ill he was packing his things and there were lots of big boxes full of furniture and books around the house im moving he said i dont like this house theres something strange about it im going tomorrow lets go out and have some dinner i said im too busy he looked nervously around the room look im really happy to see you but why dont you go to the restaurant and bring back some food when i came back we sat by the fire and ate the food i tried to tell jokes and he tried to laugh but sometimes he looked into the shadows in the corners of the room we finished our meal and then i said well whats the matter you tell me i answered he was silent again he looked into the shadows youre very nervous i said what is it drink gambling women tell me or go and tell your doctor youre ill my friend i wont be your friend if you talk like that well i am your friend and something is wrong come on tell me but he did not tell me anything he asked me to stay for the night but i had a room in a hotel so i left him when i returned the next morning he was gone and some men were putting his boxes into a van haldane did not leave his new address i saw him again more than a year later he came to see me early one morning before breakfast he looked really bad worse than before his face was thin and white like a ghost and his hands were shaking i invited him to have breakfast with me but i did not ask him any questions because i knew he wanted to tell me something i made coffee talked and waited im going to kill myself he began dont worry i wont do it here or now ill do it when its necessary when i cant continue to live any more and i want somebody to know why can i tell you yes of course i said astonished you must promise not to tell anybody while im alive he said i promise he looked at the fire silently its difficult to begin he said you remember george visger dont you yes i havent seen him for a long time but somebody told me he went to an island to teach vegetarianism to the cannibals i laughed anyway hes gone haldane did not laugh yes hes gone but not to an island hes dead dead how you remember he always knew when people did bad things and told the teacher well he told a girl some bad things about me i loved her but she left me then she died suddenly oh it was terrible when i went to the funeral he was there i came back home and sat thinking about it and then he arrived i hope you told him to go away i said angrily no i listened to him he came to say it was better that she was dead and we hadnt got married i asked why and he said because there was madness in my family and is there i dont know but he said he knew and had told my girlfriend i said i never knew anything about madness in the family and he said so you see its better you didnt get married isnt it and then i put my hands round his neck i dont know if i meant to kill him but thats what happened i was shocked i said nothing what can you say when your friend tells you he is a murderer haldane continued i saw that he was dead but i was very calm i sat down and thought theres no blood no weapon everybody knows visger is going to an island and he told me hes said goodbye to them so theres no problem i must get rid of his body thats all how he smiled no i wont tell you you promised not to tell anybody but maybe youll talk in your sleep or when you have a fever one day ill be safe if you dont know where the body is do you see i was sorry for my friend but i could not believe he was a murderer i said yes i see look lets go away together lets travel and see the world and forget about visger he looked very happy you understand and you dont hate me why didnt i tell you before its too late now too late no it isnt come on well pack our suitcases tonight well go where nobody can find us he said when i tell you what has happened to me youll change your mind but i know what has happened to you no he said slowly ive told you what happened to him not what happened to me thats very different did i tell you what his last words were just before i put my hands around his neck he said careful haldane youll never get rid of my body well i got rid of his body and i forgot about his last words but a year later i was sitting here and i suddenly remembered them i got rid of your body very easily visger i said and then i looked at the carpet in front of the fire and aaah haldane screamed very loudly i cant tell you no i cant chapter two a haunted at that moment we heard thunder outside i went to the window and saw some dark storm clouds in the sky where was i haldane said oh yes i looked at the carpet and there he was visger i cant explain it the door was closed the windows were closed he wasnt there before and he was there now thats all a hallucination i said thats exactly what i thought he answered but i touched it it was real it was heavy and hard like stone the arms were rigid like the arms of a statue it was a hallucination i repeated well i thought somebody had put him here to frighten me so i went to the place where i had hidden him and he was there just as he was a year before my dear haldane i said this is very funny you might think its funny but when i wake up in the night and think of it it isnt funny at all i dont want to die in the dark winston thats why i think ill kill myself so im sure that i wont die in the dark is that all no he came back again i was asleep on the train one day and when i woke up he was on the seat opposite me he looked the same as before hard and rigid like a statue i threw him out of the window in a tunnel if i see him again ill kill myself you think im mad but im not you cant help me nobody can help me he knew you see he said youll never get rid of my body and i cant he always knew things winston i promise you im not mad i dont think youre mad i think your mind is disturbed but well stay together if you can talk to me you wont imagine things so we went travelling together and i was full of hope haldane was always a rational man and i could not believe he was mad i wanted to help him get better after a month or two the madness passed and we joked and laughed again i was extremely happy that my old friend was normal hes forgotten about visger i thought and now hes fine we arrived in bruges where there was a big exhibition and all the hotels were full we could only find one room with a single bed in a hotel called the grande vigne so i had to sleep in the armchair we had dinner and went to a pub and it was late when we returned to our room we talked for a while and then haldane got into bed i tried to sleep in the armchair but it was not very comfortable i was nearly asleep when haldane began to talk about his will ive left everything to you winston he said i know i can trust you to take care of everything thank you i said sleepily lets talk about it in the morning but he continued telling me what a good friend i was i told him to go to sleep but he said he was thirsty oh alright i said light the candle and go and get some water and then please let me sleep no you light it i dont want to get out of bed in the dark i might step on something or walk into something that wasnt there when i got into bed i lit the candle and he sat up in bed and looked at me his face was very pale his hair untidy and his eyes were shining thats better he said oh look here there are two big letters on the sheet in red cotton gv george visger no its the symbol of the hotel grande vigne i said hurry up and get the water please come with me winston ill go down by myself and i went to the door with the candle in my hand he jumped off the bed in a second no i dont want to stay alone in the dark he said like a frightened child i tried to make a joke of it but i was very disappointed it was clear to me that all my time spent trying to help him had been wasted and that he was not better after all we went down as quietly as we could and got some water from the dining room haldane took the candle from me and went very slowly back towards our room he looked around very carefully i knew what he was looking for and i became angry and nervous when we entered the room i almost expected to see something on the carpet but of course there was nothing i put out the candle pulled the blankets round me and tried to get comfortable in my chair so i could sleep again youve got all the blankets haldane said no i havent only the ones i had before well i cant find mine im so cold light the candle quick light it theres something horrible but i could not find the matches light the candle light the candle he shouted if you dont hell come to me hell come in the dark i cant die in the dark please winston light the candle i am lighting it i said angrily but in the dark i was trying to find the matches with my hands on the shelf the table i could not remember where i had put them youre not going to die its alright ill get the matches in a second its cold its cold its cold he said like that three times and then he screamed loudly like a child or like a rabbit attacked by dogs what is it i cried there was silence then very slowly its visger he said and his voice seemed strange and distant of course it isnt my hand found the matches as i spoke hes here he screamed here next to me in the bed i lit the candle i ran to the bed he was lying on the edge of the bed next to him was a dead man white and cold haldane had died in the dark there was a simple explanation haldane and i were in the wrong room the dead mans room his name was felix leblanc and he had died from a heart attack earlier that day i found out more information in england the police found the body of a man with a bottle of poison in his hand in a railway tunnel his name was simmons and he had drunk poison in haldanes carriage because he was depressed haldane had thrown his body out of the window haldane left me all his possessions in his will i asked a police inspector to be with me when i opened the boxes he had left me inside one were the bodies of two men one man was identified later he was a salesman who had died of epilepsy the other body was visgers i leave it to you to explain the events in this story i cannot find an explanation that satisfies me the end
