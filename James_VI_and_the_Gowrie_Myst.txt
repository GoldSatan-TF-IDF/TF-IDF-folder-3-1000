james vi and the gowrie mystery introduction an old scottish lady four generations ago used to say it is a great comfort to think that at the day of judgment we shall know the whole truth about the gowrie conspiracy at last since the author as a child read the tales of a grandfather and shared king jamies disappointment when there was no pot of gold but an armed man in the turret he had supposed that we do know all about the gowrie conspiracy that it was a plot to capture the king carry him to fastcastle and see how the country would take it as in the case of the gunpowder plot but just as father gerard has tried to show that the gunpowder affair may have been cecils plot so modern historians doubt whether the gowrie mystery was not a conspiracy by king james himself mr hume brown appears rather to lean to this opinion in the second volume of his history of scotland and dr masson in his valuable edition of the register of the privy council is also dubious mr louis barbe in his tragedy of gowrie house holds a brief against the king thus i have been tempted to study this auld misterie afresh and have convinced myself that such historians as sir walter scott mr frazer tytler and mr hill burton were not wrong the plot was not the kings conspiracy but the desperate venture of two very young men the precise object remains obscure in detail but the purpose was probably to see how a deeply discontented kirk and country would take it in working at this fascinatingly mysterious puzzle i have made use of manuscript materials hitherto uncited the most curious of these the examinations and documents of the country writer sprot had been briefly summarised in sir william frasers memorials of the earls of haddington my attention was drawn to this source by the rev john anderson of the general register house who aided sir william fraser in the compilation of his book the earl of haddington generously permitted me to have copies made of the documents which lady cecily bailliehamilton was kind enough to search for and rediscover in an enormous mass of documents bequeathed by the learned first earl on reading the calendars of the hatfield mss i had observed that several letters by the possible conspirator logan of restalrig were in the possession of the marquis of salisbury who was good enough to permit photographs of some specimens to be taken these were compared by mr anderson with the alleged plotletters of logan at edinburgh while photographs of the plotletters were compared with logans authentic letters at hatfield by mr gunton to whose acuteness and energy i owe the greatest gratitude the results of the comparison settle the riddle of three centuries the other hitherto unused manuscripts are in no more recondite place than the record office in london and i do not know how they managed to escape the notice of previous writers on the subject to dr massons register of the privy council i am indebted for the sequel of the curious adventure of mr robert oliphant whose part in the mystery hitherto overlooked is decisive if we accept the evidence a point on which the reader must form his own opinion for copies made at the record office i have to thank the care and accuracy of miss e m thompson to mr andersons learning and zest in this longest and sorest chase as king james called his hunt on the morning of the fatal august i am under the deepest obligations the allurements of a romantic conclusion have never tempted him to leave the strait path of historical impartiality i have also to thank mr henry paton for his careful copies of the haddington mss extracts from the treasurers accounts and other researches for permission to reproduce the picture of fastcastle by the rev mr thomson of duddingston i have to thank the kindness of mrs blackwoodporter the painting probably of about when compared with the photograph of today shows the destruction wrought by wind and weather in the old fortalice my obligations to sir james balfour paul lyon king of arms for information on points of heraldry ought to be gratefully acknowledged since this book was written the author has had an opportunity to read an apology for the ruthvens by the late andrew bisset this treatise is apt to escape observation it is entitled sir walter scott and occupies pp in essays on historical truth long out of print a on many points mr bisset agreed with mr barbe in his tragedy of gowrie house and my replies to mr barbe serve for his predecessor but mr bisset found no evidence that the king had formed a plot against gowrie by a modification of the contemporary conjecture of sir william bowes he suggested that a brawl between the king and the master of ruthven occurred in the turret occasioned by an atrocious insult offered to the master by the king this hypothesis for various reasons does not deserve discussion mr bisset appeared to attribute the sprot papers to the combined authorship of the king and sir thomas hamilton which our new materials disprove a critic who like mr bisset accused the king of poisoning prince henry and many other persons was not an unprejudiced historian contents page introduction vii

most peoples riddles put by the sphinx of the past to the curious of the new generations these questions do not greatly concern the scientific historian who is busy with constitutionmaking statistics progress degeneration in short with human evolution these high matters these streams of tendency form the staple of history but the problems of personal character and action still interest some inquiring minds among these enigmas nearly the most obscure the gowrie conspiracy is our topic this affair is one of the haunting mysteries of the past one of the problems that nobody has solved the events occurred in but the interest which they excited was so keen that belief in the guilt or innocence of the two noble brothers who perished in an august afternoon was a party shibboleth in the wars of the saints against the malignants the strife of cavaliers and roundheads the problem has ever since attracted the curious as do the enigma of perkin warbeck the true character of richard iii the real face behind the iron mask the identity of the false pucelle and the innocence or guilt of mary stuart in certain respects the gowrie mystery is necessarily less attractive than that of the fairest and most pitiless queen on earth there is no woman in the story the world of course when the ruthvens died at once acted on the maxim cherchez la femme the woman in the case men said was the beautiful queen anne of denmark wife of james vi that fair and frivolous dame very very woman certainly did her best by her behaviour to encourage the belief that she was the cause of these sorrows even so when the bonny earl moray the tallest and most beautiful man in scotland died like a lion dragged down by wolves the people sang he was a brave gallant and he rode at the ring and the bonny earl moray he might have been the king he was a brave gallant and he rode at the glove and the bonny earl moray he was the queens love on one side was a beautiful queen mated with james vi a pedant and a clown on the other side were first the bonny earl then the earl of gowrie both young brave handsome both suddenly slain by the kings friends none knew why the opinion of the godly of the kirk of the people and even of politicians leaped to the erroneous conclusion that the young men perished like konigsmarck because they were beautiful and beloved and because the queen was fair and kind and the king was ugly treacherous and jealous the rumour also ran at least in tradition that gowrie might have been the king an idea examined in appendix a here then was an explanation of the slaying of the ruthvens on the lines dear to romance the humorous king jamie who if he was not always sensible at least treated his flighty wife with abundance of sense had to play the part of king mark of cornwall to gowries sir tristram for this theory we shall show no evidence exists and in looking for the woman fancy found two men the queen was alternately said to love gowrie and to love his brother the master of ruthven a lad of nineteen if she did not love both at once it is curious that the affair did not give rise to ballads if it did none has reached us in truth there was no woman in the case and this of course makes the mystery much less exciting than that of mary stuart for whom so many swords and pens have been drawn the interest of character and of love is deficient of gowries character and even of his religion apart from his learning and fascination we really know almost nothing did he cherish that strongest and most sacred of passions revenge had he brooded over it in italy where revenge was subtler and craftier than in scotland did this passion blend with the vein of fanaticism in his nature had he been biding his time and dreaming over sea boyish dreams of vengeance and ambition all this appears not improbable and would if true explain all but evidence is defective had gowrie really cherished the legacy of revenge for a father slain and a mother insulted had he studied the subtleties of italian crime pondered over an italian plot till it seemed feasible and communicated his vision to the boy brother whom he found at home the mystery would be transparent picture james vi as to king james we know him well the babe wronged in his mothers womb threatened by conspirators before his birth terrified by a harsh tutor as a child bullied preached at captured insulted ruled now by debauched favourites now by godly ruffians james naturally grew up a dissembler and betrayed his fathers murderer with a kiss he was frightened into deceit he could be cruel he became as far as he might a tyrant but though not the abject coward of tradition james as he himself observed was never the man to risk his life in a doubtful brawl on the chance that his enemies might perish while he escaped for him a treachery of that kind an affair of sword and dagger fights on staircases and in turrets and chambers in the midst of a town of doubtful loyalty had certainly no attractions moreover he had a sense of humour this has been the opinion of our best historians scott mr tytler and mr hill burton but enthusiastic writers have always espoused the cause of the victims the ruthvens so young brave handsome so untimely slain as it were on their own hearthstone other authors such as dr masson in our own day and mr s r gardiner have abstained from a verdict or have attempted the via media have leaned to the idea that the ruthvens died in an accidental brawl caused by a nervous and motiveless fit of terror on the part of the king thus the question is unsettled the problem is unsolved why did the jolly hunt at falkland in the bright august morning end in the sanguinary scuffle in the town house at perth the deaths of the ruthvens the tumult in the town the kings homeward ride through the dark and dripping twilight the laying of the dead brothers side by side while the old family servant weeps above their bodies and the wailing of the queen and her ladies in falkland palace when the torches guide the cavalcade into the palace court and the strange tale of slaughter is variously told the reports so fighting together that no man could have any certainty where lay the actual truth this problem with which the following pages are concerned is much darker and more complex than that of the guilty casket letters attributed to mary queen of scots the queen did write these in the madness of a criminal passion or she wrote parts of them the rest being garbled or forged in either case her motives and the motives of the possible forgers are distinct and are human the queen was in love with one man and hated another to the death or her enemies desired to prove that these were her moods absolute certainty escapes us but either way motives and purposes are intelligible not so with the gowrie mystery the king marys son after hunting for four hours rides to visit lord gowrie a neighbour after luncheon that nobleman and his brother are slain in their own house by the kings attendants the king gives his version of the events instantly he never varies from it in any essential point but the story is almost incredible on the other hand the slain men cannot speak and only one of them if both were innocent could have told what occurred but one of their apologists at the time produced a version of the events which is beyond all doubt boldly mendacious it was easy to criticise and ridicule the kings version but the opposite version hitherto unknown to historians destroys itself by its conspicuous falsehoods in the nature of the case as will appear no story accounting for such wild events could be easily credible so extraordinary motiveless and inexplicable do the circumstances appear if we try the theory that the king wove a plot we are met by the fact that his plot could not have succeeded without the voluntary and vehement collaboration of one of his victims a thing that no man could have reckoned on if we adopt the idea that the victims had laid a trap for the king we have only a vague surmise as to its aim purpose and method the later light which seemed to fall on the affair as we shall see only darkens what was already obscure the inconceivable iniquity of the government at a later date reflects such discredit on all concerned on their side that we might naturally though illogically be inclined to believe that from the first the king was the conspirator but that we shall find was almost or quite a physical impossibility despite these embroilments i am in this case able to reach a conclusion satisfactory to myself a thing which in the affair of the casket letters and queen mary i was unable to do there is no doubt in my own mind that the earl of gowrie and his brother laid a trap for king james and fell into the pit which they had digged to what precise end they had plotted to seize the kings person what they meant to do with him when they had got him must remain matter of conjecture but that they intended to seize him i have no doubt at all these pages on so old and vexed a problem would not have been written had i not been fortunate enough to obtain many unpublished manuscript materials some of these at least clear up the secondary enigma of the sequel of the problem of different readers will probably draw different conclusions from some of the other documents but perhaps nobody will doubt that they throw strange new lights on scottish manners and morals the scheme adopted here is somewhat like that of mr brownings poem the ring and the book the personages tell their own stories of the same set of events in which they were more or less intimately concerned this inevitably entails some repetition but i am unable to find any plan less open to objection it must of course be kept in mind that all the evidence is of a suspicious nature the king if he were the conspirator or even if innocent had to clear himself and frankly his majestys word was not to be relied upon however he alone was crossexamined by an acute and hostile catechist and that upon oath though not in a court of justice the evidence of his retinue and of some other persons present was also taken on oath three months after the events before a parliamentary committee the lords of the articles we shall see that nine years later a similar committee was deceived shamelessly by the kings government he himself being absent in england but the nature of the evidence in the second case was entirely different it did not rest on the sworn testimony of a number of nobles gentlemen and citizens but on a question of handwriting comparatio literarum as in the case of the casket letters that the witnesses in did not perjure themselves in the trial which followed on the slaughter of the ruthvens is what i have to argue next we have the evidence taken under torture of three of the slain earls retainers three weeks after the events no such testimony is now reckoned of value but it will be shown that the statements made by the tortured men only compromise the earl and his brother incidentally and in a manner probably not perceived by the deponents themselves they denied all knowledge of a plot disclaimed belief in a plot by the earl and let out what was suspicious in a casual way without observing the import of their own remarks finally we have the evidence of the only living man except the king who was present at the central point of the occurrences that this man was a most false and evasive character that he was doubtless amenable to bribes that he was richly rewarded i freely admit but i think it can be made probable by evidence hitherto overlooked that he really was present on the crucial occasion and that with all allowances for his character and position his testimony fits into the facts while if it be discarded no hypothesis can account for him and his part in the adventure in short the kings tale almost incredible as it appears contains the only explanation which is not demonstrably impossible to this conclusion let me repeat i am drawn by no sentiment for that unsentimental prince gentle king jamie he was not the man to tell the truth if he could think of anything better but where other corroboration is impossible by the nature of the circumstances facts corroborate the kings narrative his version colligates them though extravagant they become not incoherent no other hypothesis produces coherency each guess breaks down on demonstrated facts ii the slaughter of the ruthvens in the month of august his majesty the king of scotland james sixth of that name stood in more than common need of the recreation of the chase things had been going contrary to his pleasure in all directions his dearest sister queen elizabeth as he pathetically said seemed likely to continue as long as sun or moon and was in the worst of humours her minister cecil was apparently more ill disposed towards the scottish king than usual while the ministers rival the earl of essex had been suggesting to james plans for a military demonstration on the border money was even more than normally scarce the highlands were more than common unruly stories of new conspiracies against the kings liberty were flying about and above all a convention of the estates had just refused in june to make a large grant of money to his majesty it was also irritating that an old and trusted servant colonel stewart wished to quit the country and take english service against the irish rebels this gentleman sixteen years before had been instrumental in the arrest and execution of the earl of gowrie the new young earl son of the late peer had just returned from the continent to scotland and colonel stewart was afraid that gowrie might wish to avenge his father therefore he desired to take service in ireland with all these frets the king needed the refreshment of hunting the buck in his park of falkland he ordered his own hunting costume it was delivered early in august and which is singular was paid for instantly green english cloth was the basis of his apparel and five ounces of silver decorated his secondbest socks his boots had velvet tops embroidered his best socks were adorned with heavy gold embroidery he even bought a new horse his gentlemen john ramsay john murray george murray and john auchmuty were attired at the royal expense in coats of green cloth like the king a thus equipped the royal party rose early on the morning of tuesday august left the pleasant house of falkland with its strong round towers that had lately protected james from an attack by his cousin wild frank stewart the earl of bothwell and rode to the stables in the park the weather says his majesty being wonderful pleasant and seasonable b all the jolly hunt was there tell true and the other hounds were yelping at the limits of their leashes the duke of lennox and the earl of mar friends of james from his youth and honourable men were the chief nobles in the crowd wherein were two or three of the loyal family of erskine cousins of mar and a dr herries remarkable for a club foot at the stables hacks were discarded hunters were led out men were mounting the king had his foot in the stirrup when a young gentleman the master of ruthven rode swiftly up from the town of falkland he had trotted over very early from the town house at perth some twelve or fourteen miles away of his brother the earl of gowrie he was but nineteen years of age tall handsome and brother of the queens favourite maid of honour mrs beatrix ruthven that he was himself one of the gentlemen of the household has often been said but we find no trace of money spent for him in the royal accounts in fact he had asked for the place but had not yet obtained it however if we may believe the royal word which is a matter of choice james loved the young master like a brother the master approached the king and entered into conversation with him jamess account of what he had to say must be given later for the present we may be content with the depositions on oath which were made later at a trial in november by the attendants of the king and other witnesses among these was the duke of lennox who swore to the following effect they hunted their buck and killed him the king in place of trotting back to lunch at the house of falkland to which the progress of the chase had led the sportsmen round in a circle bade the duke accompany him to perth some twelve miles away to speak with the earl of gowrie his majesty then rode on lennox despatched his groom for his sword and for a fresh horse another was sent after the king he then mounted and followed when he rejoined james the king said you cannot guess what errand i am riding for i am going to get a treasure in perth the master of ruthven mr alexander ruthven has informed me that he has found a man with a pitcher full of gold coins of great sorts james also asked lennox what he deemed of the master whose manner he reckoned very strange nothing but an honest discreet gentleman said the duke the king next gave details about the treasure and lennox said he thought the tale unlikely as it was more or less james then bade lennox say nothing on the matter to ruthven who wanted it to be a secret at about a mile from perth the master galloped forward to warn his brother the earl who met the royal party on foot with some companions near the town this was about one oclock in the afternoon picture situation and topography of gowrie house the royal party of thirteen nobles and gentlemen then entered the earls house it faced the street as the house of falkland also does and at the back had gardens running down to the tay it is necessary to understand the situation and topography of gowrie house passing down south street or shoe gait the chief street in perth then a pretty little town you found it crossed at right angles by a street called on the left water gate on the right spey gate immediately fronting you as you came to the end of south street was the gateway of gowrie house the garden wall continuing towards your right on your left were the houses in water gate occupied by rich citizens and lairds many will understand the position if they fancy themselves walking down one of the streets which run from the high street at oxford towards the river you then find merton college facing you the street being continued to the left in such old houses as beam hall the gate of gowrie house fronted you as does the gatetower of merton and led into a quadrangle the front court called the close behind gowrie house was the garden and behind that ran the river tay as the isis flows behind merton and corpus entering the quadrangle of gowrie house you found on your right and facing you a pile of buildings like an inverted l the basement was occupied by domestic offices at the angle of the inverted l was the main entrance on your right and much nearer to you than the main entrance a door opened on a narrow spiral staircase so dark that it was called the black turnpike picture interior of gowrie house as to the interior entering the main doorway you found yourself in the hall a door led thence into a smaller diningroom on the left the hall itself had a door and external stair giving on the garden behind the chief staircase which you entered from the hall led to the great gallery built and decorated by the late earl this extended above the diningroom and the hall and to the right was separated by a partition and a door from the large upstairs room on the same flat called the gallery chamber at the extremity of this chamber on the left hand as you advanced was a door leading into a round or turret or little circularshaped study of which one window seems to have looked to the gateway the other to the street people below in the street could see a man looking out of the turret window a door in the gallery chamber gave on the narrow staircase called the black turnpike by which the upper floor might be reached by any one from the quadrangle without entering the main door and going up the broad chief staircase thus to quote a poet who wrote while gowrie house was extant in the palace kythes may namd be perths white hall with orchards like these of hesperides the palace was destroyed to furnish a site for a gaol and county buildings in but the most interesting parts had long been in ruins in an antiquary mr cant writes that the palace after the forty five was converted into artillery barracks we see nothing but the remains of its former grandeur the coats of arms of the nobility and gentlemen of fortune who dwelt in spey gate and water gate were in still visible on the walls of their houses a fragment of the old palace is said to exist today in the gowrie inn into this palace the king was led by gowrie he was taken to the dining chamber on the left of the great hall in the hall itself lennox mar and the rest of the retinue waited and wearied for apparently no dinner had been provided and even a drink for his thirsty majesty was long in coming gowrie and the master kept going in and out servants were whispered to and sir thomas erskine sent a townsman to buy him a pair of green silk stockings in perth he wanted to dine comfortably leaving the kings retinue in the hall and the king in the dining chamber off the hall we may note what up to this point the nobles and gentlemen of the suite had to say at the trial in november about the adventures of that august morning mar had not seen the master at falkland after the kill mar did not succeed in rejoining james till they were within two or three miles of perth drummond of inchaffray had nodded to the master at falkland before the master met the king at the stables he later saw the master in conference for about a quarter of an hour with james outside the stables the master then left the king inchaffray invited him to breakfast but he declined as his majesty had ordered him to wait upon him according to other evidence he had already breakfasted at falkland inchaffray then breakfasted in falkland town and next rode along the highway towards his own house on the road he overtook lennox lindores urchill hamilton of grange finlay taylor the king and the master riding perthwards he joined them and went with them into gowrie house nobody else among the witnesses did anything but agree with lennoxs account up to this point but four menials of james for example a cellarer and a porter were at gowrie house in addition to the nobles and gentlemen who gave this evidence to return to lennoxs tale dinner was not ready for his hungry majesty as we have said till an hour after his arrival was not ready indeed till about two oclock he had obviously not been expected or gowrie did not wish it to be known that he was expected and himself had dined before the kings arrival between twelve and one oclock a shoulder of mutton a fowl and a solitary grouse were all that the earls caterer could procure except cold meat obviously a poor repast to set before a king it is said that the earl had meant to leave perth in the afternoon when james reached the stage of dessert gowrie who had waited on him entered the hall and invited the suite to dine when they had nearly finished gowrie returned to them in the hall and sent round a gracecup in which all pledged the king lennox then rose to rejoin the king who now passed with the master across and out of the hall but gowrie said his majesty was gone upstairs quietly some quiet errand gowrie then called for the key of the garden on the banks of the tay and he lindores the lame dr herries and others went into the garden where one of them tells us they ate cherries while they were thus engaged gowries equerry or master stabler a mr thomas cranstoun who had been long in france and had returned thence with the earl in april appeared crying the king has mounted and is riding through the inch that is the inch of perth where the famous clan battle of thirty men a side had been fought centuries ago gowrie shouted horses horses but cranstoun said your horse is at scone some two miles off on the further side of the tay why the earl that day kept his horse so remote in times when men of his rank seldom walked we may conjecture later cf p infra the earl however says lennox affected not to hear cranstoun and still shouted horses he and lennox then passed into the house through to the front yard or close and so to the outer gate giving on the street here lennox asked the porter christie if the king had gone the porter said he was certain that the king had not left the house on this point lindores who had been with gowrie and lennox in the garden and accompanied them to the gate added as indeed lennox also did that gowrie now explained to the porter that james had departed by the back gate that cannot be my lord said the porter for i have the key of the back gate andrew ray a bailie of perth who had been in the house looking on told the same tale adding that gowrie gave the porter the lie the porter corroborated all this at the trial and quoted his own speech about the key as it was given by lindores he had the keys and must know whether the king had ridden away or not in this odd uncertainty gowrie said to lennox i am sure the king has gone but stay i shall go upstairs and get your lordship the very certainty gowrie thereon went from the street door through the court and up the chief staircase of the house whence he came down again at once and anew affirmed to lennox that the king was forth at the back gate and away they all then went out of the front gate and stood in the street there talking and wondering where they should seek for his majesty where was the king here we note a circumstance truly surprising it never occurred to the earl of gowrie when dubiously told that the king had loupen on and ridden off to ask where is the kings horse if the royal nag was in the earls stable then james had not departed again a thing more astonishing still it has never occurred to any of the unnumbered writers on the gowrie conspiracy to ask how did the earl if guilty of falsehood as to the kings departure mean to get over the difficulty about the kings horse if the horse was in the stable then the king had not ridden away as the earl declared gowrie does not seem to have kidnapped the horse we do not hear from the king or any one that the horse was missing when the royal party at last rode home the author is bound in honour to observe that this glaring difficulty about the horse did not occur to him till he had written the first draft of this historical treatise after reading so many others on the subject and yet the eagle glance of mr sherlock holmes would at once have lighted on his majestys mount however neither at the time nor in the last three centuries as far as we know was any one sensible enough to ask how about the kings horse we return to the question where was the king some time had elapsed since he passed silently from the chamber where he had lunched through the hall with the master and so upstairs going quietly a quiet errand gowrie had explained to the men of the retinue the gentlemen had then strolled in the garden till cranstoun came out to them with the news of the kings departure young john ramsay one of jamess gentlemen had met the laird of pittencrieff in the hall and had asked where his majesty was both had gone upstairs had examined the fair gallery filled with pictures collected by the late earl and had remained a certain space admiring it they thence went into the front yard the close where cranstoun met them and told them that the king had gone instead of joining the gentlemen whom we left loitering and wondering outside the front gate on the street ramsay ran to the stables for his horse he said and as he waited at the stable door being further from the main entrance than lennox mar and the rest he heard jamess voice but understood not what he spake the others on the street just outside the gate being nearer the house than ramsay suddenly heard the kings voice and even his words lennox said to mar the king calls be he where he will they all glanced up at the house and saw says lennox his majesty looking out at the window hatless his face red and a hand gripping his face and mouth the king called i am murdered treason my lord of mar help help mar corroborated inchaffray saw the king vanish from the window and in his judgment his majesty was pulled perforce in at the same window bailie ray of perth saw the window pushed up saw the kings face appear and heard his cries murray of arbany who had come to perth from another quarter heard the king murray seems to have been holding the kings falcon on his wrist in hall he had later handed the bird to young ramsay on beholding this vision of the king hatless redfaced vociferous and suddenly vanishing most of his lords and gentlemen and murray of arbany rushed through the gate through the close into the main door of the house up the broad staircase through the long fair gallery and there they were stopped by a locked door they could not reach the king finding a ladder they used it as a batteringram but it broke in their hands they sent for hammers and during some half an hour they thundered at the door breaking a hole in a panel but unable to gain admission now these facts as to the locked door and the inability of most of the suite to reach the king are denied by no author they make it certain that if james had contrived a plot against the two ruthvens he had not taken his two nobles mar and lennox and these other gentlemen and murray of arbany into the scheme he had not even arranged that another of his retinue should bring them from their futile hammerwork to his assistance by another way for there was another way young ramsay was not with lennox and the rest when they saw and heard the flushed and excited king cry out of the window ramsay he says was further off than the rest was at the stable door he heard and recognised jamess voice but saw nothing of him and distinguished no words he ran into the front yard through the outer gate lennox and the rest had already vanished within the house ramsay noticed the narrow door in the wall of the house giving on the quadrangle and nearer him than the main door of entrance to reach which he must cross the quadrangle diagonally he rushed into the narrow doorway ran up a dark corkscrew staircase found a door at the top heard a struggling and din of mens feet within dang open the door caught a glimpse of a man behind the kings back and saw james and the master wrestling together in each others arms james had the masters head under his arm the master almost upon his knees had his hand on the kings face and mouth strike him low cried the king because he wears a secret mail doublet such as men were wont to wear on a doubtful though apparently peaceful occasion like a wardens day on the border ramsay threw down the kings falcon which he had taken from murray and bore on his wrist drew his dagger or couteau de chasse and struck the master on the face and neck the king set his foot on the falcons leash and so held it ramsay might have spared and seized the master instead of wounding him james later admitted that but man he said i had neither god nor the devil before me but my own defence remember that hammers were thundering on a door hard by and that neither james nor ramsay knew who knocked so loud enemies or friends the king then says ramsay pushed the wounded master down the steep narrow staircase up which the young man had run the man of whom ramsay had caught a glimpse standing behind the king had vanished like a wraith ramsay went to a window looked out and seeing sir thomas erskine cried come up to the top of the staircase where was erskine and what was he doing he had not followed lennox and mar in their rush back into the house on hearing jamess cries from the window he and his brother had tried to seize gowrie who had been with the party of lennox and mar if james was in peril within gowries house they argued naturally that gowrie was responsible not drawing sword or dagger daggers indeed they had none the two erskine brothers rushed on gowrie who was crying what is the matter i know nothing they bore him or nearly bore him to the ground but his retainers separated the stragglers and one a ruthven knocked sir thomas down with his fist the knight arose and ran into the front court where dr herries asked him what the matter meant at this moment erskine heard ramsay cry come up here from the top of the narrow dark staircase he says not from the window ramsay may have called from both erskine who was accompanied by the lame dr herries and by a menial of his brothers named wilson found the bleeding master near the foot of the stair and shouted this is the traitor strike him the stricken lad fell saying alas i had not the wyte of it and the three entered the chamber where now were only the king and ramsay words not very intelligible as reported by erskine we consider them later passed between him and the king though erskine does not say so they shut james up in the turret opening into the chamber where they were and instantly cranstoun the earls equerry entered with a drawn sword followed by gowrie with two swords while some other persons followed gowrie where had gowrie been since the two erskines tried to seize him in the street and were separated from him by a throng of his retainers why was gowrie whose honour was interested in the kings safety later in reaching the scene than erskine the limping dr herries and the serving man wilson the reason appears to have been that after the two erskines were separated from gowrie sir thomas ran straight from the street through the gateway into the front court of the house meeting in the court dr herries who was slow in his movements but gowrie on the other hand was detained by certain of tullibardines servants young tullibardine being present this at least was the story given under examination by mr thomas cranstoun gowries master stabler while other witnesses mention that gowrie became involved in a struggle and went back from his house further up or down the street young tullibardine present at this fray was the heir of murray of tullibardine and ancestor in the male line of the present duke of atholl he later married a niece of the earl of gowrie his father being a man of forty in young tullibardine must have been very young indeed the murrays were in perth on the occasion of the marriage of one of their clan an innkeeper some of their party were in the street and seeing an altercation in which two of the kings gentlemen were prevented from seizing gowrie they made an ineffectual effort to capture the earl gowrie ran from them along the street and there drew his two swords out of one scabbard says cranstoun the earl had just arrived in scotland from italy where he had acquired the then fashionable method of fencing with twinswords worn in a single scabbard gowrie then had retreated from the murrays to the house of one macbreck as cranstoun and macbreck himself declared cranstoun too drew his sword and let his cloak fall asking gowrie what the fray was the earl said that he would enter his own house or die by the way cranstoun said that he would go foremost but at whom should he strike for he knew not who was the enemy he had only seen the erskines collar gowrie then certain murrays interfere and he was entirely puzzled gowrie did not reply and the pair advanced to the door of the house through a perplexed throng a servant of gowries placed a steel cap on his head and with some four or five of gowries friends hew moncrieff alexander ruthven harry ruthven and patrick eviot the earl and cranstoun entered the front court here cranstoun saw the body of a man whether dead or wounded he knew not lying at the old turnpike door the entry to the dark narrow staircase up which ramsay had run to the kings rescue who lies there asked cranstoun gowrie only replied up the stair cranstoun led the way gowrie came next the other four must have followed for several witnesses presently saw them come down again wounded and bleeding cranstoun found erskine ramsay and herries with drawn swords in the chamber the king then in the turret he did not see he taunted herries ramsay and gowrie crossed swords cranstoun dealt he says with herries erskine and perhaps wilson but though cranstoun nowise knew who followed him the four men already named two ruthvens a moncrieff and eviot were in the fray though there was some uncertainty about eviot the position of the king at this moment was unenviable he was shut up in the little round turret room on the other side of the door in the chamber swords were clashing feet were stamping james knew that he had four defenders one of them a lame medical man who or how many their opponents might be he could not know the air rang with the thunder of hammers on the door of the chamber where the fight raged were they wielded by friends or enemies from the turret window the king could hear the town bell ringing and see the gathering of the burgesses of perth the friends of their provost gowrie we know that they could easily muster eight hundred armed men which side would they take the murrays as we saw had done nothing except that some of them had crowded round gowrie meanwhile there was clash of steel stamping of feet noise of hammers while the king in the turret knew not how matters were going cranstoun only saw his own part of the fight in the chamber how ramsay and gowrie sped in their duel he knew not ramsay he says turned on him and ran him through the body herries also struck him of gowrie he saw nothing he fled when wounded down the turret stair his companions following or preceding him gowrie in fact had fallen leaving ramsay free to deal with cranstoun writers of both parties declare that ramsay had cried to gowrie you have slain the king that gowrie dropped his points and that ramsay lunged and ran him through the body erskine says that he himself was wounded in the right hand by cranstoun herries lost two fingers when ramsay ran gowrie through the earl says erskine fell into the arms of a man whom he himself knew not gowries party retreated but it seems they returned to the head of the narrow staircase and renewed hostilities by pushing swords and halberts under the narrow staircase door this appears from the evidence of lennox after pounding at the door so long lennoxs party at last sent robert brown a servant of jamess who had brought the hammers round to discover another way of reaching the king brown too now went up the narrow staircase and in the gallery chamber he found the king with herries erskine ramsay wilson and the dead earl he reassured james the hammerers were his friends they handed says lennox one of the hammers to the kings party through a shattered panel and they within broke the doors and gave them entry at this time halberts and swords were being struck by gowries retainers under the door and through the sides of the door of the chamber this door apparently being that from the chamber to the narrow staircase murray of arbany who had come into the house at the end of dinner was stricken through the leg by one of these weapons deacon rhynd of perth saw hew moncrieff striking with a jeddart staff a kind of halbert a voice that of alexander ruthven a cousin of the fallen earl cried for gods sake my lord tell me how the earl of gowrie does he is well go your way you are a fool you will get no thanks for this labour answered lennox and all was silence alexander ruthven and the rest retreated ruthven rushed to the town rousing the people and rifling shops in search of gunpowder the king and the nobles knelt in prayer on the bloody floor of the chamber where the dead gowrie lay for some time the confused mob yelled outside shaking their fists at the kings party in the window men and women crying come down greencoats ye have committed murder bloody butchers others cried the king is shot the exits of the house were guarded by retainers of gowrie rentoul bissett and others mar and lennox from the window explained to the mob that the king was well james showed himself the magistrates and nobles pacified the people who some armed some unarmed were all perplexed whether they were anxious about the king or about their provost the earl from the evidence of scores of burghers it appears that the tumult did not last long one man was reaping in the morton haugh hearing the town bell he hastened in when all the tumult was ceased and the magistrates ray and others were sending the people to their houses as also did young tullibardine a baker hearing the bell went to the town cross and so to gowries house where he met the stream of people coming away another baker was at work and stayed with his loaves otherwise he would have lost his whole baking the king represents that it was between seven and eight in the evening before matters were quiet enough for him to ride home to falkland owing to the tumult the citizens doubtless minimised and james probably exaggerated the proportions and duration of the disturbance picture falkland place this version of that strange affair the slaughter of the ruthvens is taken entirely from the lips of sworn witnesses we still know no more than we did as to what passed between the moment when james and the master alone left the dining chamber and the moment when the king cried treason out of the turret window the problem is had james lured the master to falkland for the purpose of accompanying him back to perth as if by the masters invitation and of there craftily begetting a brawl in which gowrie and the master should perish at the hands of ramsay or had the master with or without his brothers knowledge lured james to perth for some evil end the question divided scotland france and england were sceptical as to the kings innocence our best historians like mr hill burton and mr tytler side with the king others are dubious or believe that james was the conspirator and that the ruthvens were innocent victims iii the kings own narrative so far we have not gained any light on the occurrences of the mysterious interval between the moment when the king and alexander ruthven passed alone through the hall after dinner up the great staircase and the moment when the king cried treason out of the turret window in the nature of the case the master being for ever silent only james could give evidence on the events of this interval james and one other man of whose presence in the turret we have hitherto said little as only one of the witnesses could swear to having seen a man there none to having seen him escaping thence or in the tumult now the word of james was not to be relied on any more than that of the unequalled elizabeth if we take the kings word in this case it is from no prejudice in his favour but merely because his narrative seems best to fit the facts as given on oath by men like lennox mar and other witnesses of all ranks it also fits with discrepancies to be noted the testimony of the other man the man who professed to have been with the master and the king in the turret the evidence of that other man was also subject for reasons which will appear presently to the gravest suspicion james if himself guilty of the plot had to invent a story to excuse himself the other man had to adopt the version of the king to save his own life from the gibbet on the other hand james if innocent could not easily have a credible story to tell if the master was sane it was hardly credible that as james averred he should menace the king with murder in his brothers house with no traceable preparations either for flight or for armed resistance in jamess narrative the master is made at least to menace the king with death however true the kings story might be his adversaries the party of the kirk and the preachers would never accept it in lennoxs phrase they liked it not because it was not likely emphatically it was not likely but the contradictory story put forward by the ruthven apologist as we shall see was not only improbable but certainly false there was living at that time a certain mr david calderwood a young presbyterian minister aged twentyfive he was an avid collector of rumour of talk and of actual documents and his history of the kirk of scotland composed at a much later date is wonderfully copious and accurate as it was impossible for king james to do anything at which calderwood did not carp assigning the worst imaginable motives in every case we shall find in calderwood the sum of contemporary hostile criticism of his majestys narrative but the criticism is negative calderwoods critics only pick holes in the kings narrative but do not advance or report any other explanation of the events any complete theory of the kings plot from the ruthven side any such story any such hypothesis must be to the full as improbable as the kings narrative there is nothing probable in the whole affair every system every hypothesis is difficile a croire yet the events did occur and we cannot reject jamess account merely because it is unlikely the improbabilities however were enormously increased by the kings theory that the ruthvens meant to murder him this project not borne out by the kings own version of ruthvens conduct would have been insane the ruthvens by murdering james would have roused the whole nation and the kirk itself against them but if their object was to kidnap james to secure his person to separate him from his ministers who were either secretly catholics or indifferents and to bring in a new administration favourable to kirk or church then the ruthvens were doing what had several times been done and many times attempted james had been captured before even in his own palace while scores of other plots to take him for instance when hunting in falkland woods remote from his retinue had been recently planned and had failed to kidnap the king was the commonest move in politics but as james thought or said that the idea at gowrie house was to murder him his tale even if true could not be easily credible the first narrative was drawn up at falkland in the night of august early on august the letter reached the chancellor in edinburgh and the contents of the letter were repeated orally by the secretary of state elphinstone later lord balmerino to nicholson the english resident at the court of holyrood nicholson on the same day reported what he remembered of what the secretary remembered of the falkland letter to cecil yet though at third hand nicholsons written account of the falkland letter of august contains the same version as james later published with variations so few and so unessential that it is needless to dwell upon them they may safely be attributed to the modifications which a story must suffer in passing through the memories of two persons whatever the amount of truth in his narrative the king had it ready at once in the form to which he adhered and on which he voluntarily underwent severe crossexamination on oath by mr robert bruce one of the edinburgh ministers a point to which we return james declares in a later narrative printed and published about the end of august that the master when he first met him at falkland made a very low bow which was not his habit the master then said their conference we saw occupied a quarter of an hour that while walking alone on the previous evening he had met a cloaked man carrying a great pot full of gold in large coined pieces ruthven took the fellow secretly to gowrie house locked him in a privy derned house and after locking many doors on him left him there and his pot with him it might be argued that as the man was said to be locked in a house and as james was not taken out of gowrie house to see him james must have known that when he went upstairs with the master he was not going to see the prisoner the error here is that in the language of the period a house often means a room or chamber it is so used by james elsewhere in this very narrative and endless examples occur in the letters and books of the period ruthven went on to explain what greatly needed explanation that he had left perth so early in the morning that james might have the first knowledge of this secret treasure concealed hitherto even from gowrie james objected that he had no right to the gold which was not treasure trove ruthven replied that if the king would not take it others would james now began to suspect very naturally that the gold was foreign coin indeed what else could it well be coin from france italy or spain brought in often by political intriguers was the least improbable sort of minted gold to be found in poor old scotland in the troubles of the supplies of the catholic rebels were in spanish money whereof some was likely enough to be buried by the owners james then fancied that jesuits or others had brought in gold for seditious purposes as they have ofttimes done before sceptics of the period asked how one pot of gold could cause a sedition the question is puerile there would be more gold where the potful came from if catholic intrigues were in the air james then asked the master what kind of coin it was they seemed to be foreign and uncouth unusual strokes of coin said ruthven and the man he added was a stranger to him james therefore suspected that the man might be a disguised scottish priest the few of them then in scotland always wore disguises as they tell us in their reports to their superiors the kings inferences as to popish plotters were thus inevitable though he may have emphasised them in his narrative to conciliate the preachers his horror of practising papists at this date was unfeigned he said to the master that he could send a servant with a warrant to gowrie and the magistrates of perth to take and examine the prisoner and his hoard contemporaries asked why he did not commit the credit of this matter to another james had anticipated the objection he did propose this course but ruthven replied that if others once touched the money the king would get a very bad account made to him of that treasure he implored his majesty to act as he advised and not to forget him afterwards this suggestion may seem mean in ruthven but the age was not disinterested nor was ruthven trying to persuade a highsouled man the king was puzzled and bored the morning was fair the game already found the monarch was a keen sportsman so he said that he would think the thing over and answer at the end of the hunt granting jamess notorious love of disentangling a mystery granting his love of money and of hunting i agree with mr tytler in seeing nothing improbable in this narration if the master wanted to lure the king to perth i cannot conceive a better device than the tale which according to the king he told the one improbable point considering the morals of the country was that ruthven should come to james in place of sharing the gold with his brother but ruthven we shall see had possibly good reasons known to james for conciliating the royal favour and for keeping his brother ignorant moreover to seize the money would not have been a safe thing for ruthven to do the story would have leaked out questions would have been asked james had hit on the only plausible theory to account for a low fellow with a pot of gold he must be a practising papist james could neither suppose nor expect others to believe that he supposed one pot of foreign gold enough to bribe the country into rebellion but the pot and the prisoner supplied a clue worth following probabilities strike different critics in different ways mr tytler thinks jamess tale true and that he acted in character that is my opinion his own the reader must form for himself ruthven still protested this hunt of gold was well worth a buck the prisoner he said might attract attention by his cries a very weak argument but ruthven was quite as likely to invent it on the spur of the moment as james was to attribute it to him falsely on cool reflection finally if james came at once gowrie would then be at the preaching tuesdays thursdays and sundays were preaching days and the royal proceedings with the captive would be undisturbed now on the hypothesis of intended kidnapping this was a wellplanned affair if james accepted ruthvens invitation he with three or four servants would reach gowrie house while the town of perth was quiet nothing would be easier than to seclude him seize his person and transport him to the seaside either by tay or down the north bank of that river or in disguise across fife to the firth of forth in the retinue of gowrie before alarm was created at falkland gowrie had given out so his friends declared that he was to go that night to dirleton his castle near north berwick a strong hold manned and provisioned could he have carried the king in disguise across fife to elie dirleton was within a twelve miles sail on summer seas had jamess curiosity and avarice led him to ride away at once with ruthven and three or four servants the plot might have succeeded we must criticise the plot on these lines thus if at all had the earl and his brother planned it but fate interfered the unexpected occurred but the plot could not be dropped the story of the pot of gold could not be explained away the king with royal rudeness did not even reply to the new argument of the master without any further answering him his majesty mounted ruthven staying still in the place where the king left him at this moment inchaffray as we saw met ruthven and invited him to breakfast but he said that he was ordered to wait on the king at this point jamess narrative contains a circumstance which confessedly was not within his own experience he did not know he says that the master had any companion but from the evidence of another he learned that the master had a companion indeed two companions one was andrew ruthven about whose presence nobody doubts the other one andrew henderson was not seen by james at this time however the king says on hendersons own evidence that the master now sent him about seven oclock to warn gowrie that the king was to come really it seems that henderson was despatched rather later during the first check in the run it was allimportant to the kings case to prove that henderson had been at falkland and had returned at once with a message to gowrie for this would demonstrate that in appearing to be unprepared for the kings arrival as he did gowrie was making a false pretence it was also important to prove that the ride of ruthven and henderson to falkland and back had been concealed by them from the people at gowrie house now this was proved craigengelt gowries steward who was tortured tried convicted and hanged deponed that going up the staircase just after the kings arrival he met the master booted and asked where he had been an errand not far off said the master concealing his long ride to falkland a again john moncrieff a gentleman who was with gowrie asked henderson who had returned to perth much earlier than the kings arrival where he had been and he said that he had been two or three miles above the town b henderson himself later declared that gowrie had told him to keep his ride to falkland secret c the whole purpose of all this secrecy was to hide the fact that the ruthvens had brought the king to perth and that gowrie had early notice by about am of jamess approach from henderson therefore to make out that henderson had been in falkland and had given gowrie early notice of jamess approach though gowrie for all that made no preparations to welcome james was almost necessary for the government they specially questioned all witnesses on this point yet not one of their witnesses would swear to having seen henderson at falkland this disposes of the theory of wholesale perjury the modern apologist for the ruthvens mr louis barbe writes we believe that henderson perjured himself in swearing that he accompanied alexander the master and andrew ruthven when they rode to falkland we believe that henderson perjured himself when he asserted on oath that the master sent him back to perth with the intelligence of the kings coming on the other hand george hay lay prior of the famous chartreux founded by james i in perth deponed that henderson arrived long before gowries dinner and peter hay corroborated but hay averred that gowrie asked henderson who was at falkland with the king it would not follow that henderson had been at falkland himself john moncrieff deponed that gowrie said nothing of hendersons message but sat at dinner feigning to have no knowledge of the kings approach till the master arrived a few minutes before the king mr rhynd gowries tutor deponed that andrew ruthven the masters other companion in the early ride to falkland told him that the master had sent on henderson with news of the kings coming if henderson had been at falkland he had some four hours start of the king and his party and must have arrived at perth and spoken to gowrie long before dinner he himself says at am dinner was at noon or on this day half an hour later yet gowrie made no preparations for welcoming the king it is obvious that though the hays and moncrieff both saw henderson return booted from a ride somewhere or other at an early hour none of them could prove that he had ridden to falkland and back there was in fact no evidence that henderson had been at falkland except his own and that of the poor tortured tutor rhynd to the effect that andrew ruthven had confessed as much to him but presently we shall find that while modern apologists for gowrie deny that henderson had been at falkland the contemporary ruthven apologist insists that he had been there to return to jamess own narrative he asserts hendersons presence at falkland but not from his own knowledge he did not see henderson at falkland ruthven says james sent henderson to gowrie just after the king mounted and followed the hounds here it must be noted that henderson himself says that ruthven did not actually despatch him till after he had some more words with the king this is an instance of jamess insouciance as to harmonising his narrative with hendersons or causing henderson to conform to his cooked evidence collusive evidence would have avoided these discrepancies james says that musing over the story of the pot of gold he sent one naismith a surgeon he had been with james at least since to bring ruthven to him during a check and told ruthven that he would after the hunt come to perth james thought that this was after the despatch of henderson but probably it was before to judge by hendersons account during this pause the hounds having hit on the scent again the king was left behind but spurred on at every check the master kept urging him to make haste so james did not tarry to break up the deer as usual the kill was but two bowshots from the stables and the king did not wait for his sword or his second horse which had to gallop a mile before it reached him mar lennox and others did wait for their second mounts some rode back to falkland for fresh horses some dragged slowly along on tired steeds and did not rejoin james till later ruthven had tried james says to induce him to refuse the company of the courtiers three or four servants he said would be enough the others might mar the whole purpose james was half angry he began to entertain odd surmises about ruthven one was it might be that the earl his brother had handled him so hardly that the young gentleman being of a high spirit had taken such displeasure as he was become somewhat beside himself but why should gowrie handle his brother hardly the answer is suggested by an unpublished contemporary manuscript the true discovery of the late treason a c some offence had passed betwixt the said mr alexander ruthven the master and his brother for that the said alexander both of himself and by his majestys mediation had craved of the earl his brother the demission and release of the abbey of scone which his majesty had bestowed upon the said earl during his life his suit had little success b if this be fact and there is no obvious reason for its invention james might have reason to suspect that gowrie had handled his brother hardly scone being a valuable estate well worth keeping to secure the kings favour as to scone ruthven had a motive as james would understand for making him and not gowrie acquainted with the secret of the treasure thus the unpublished manuscript casually explains the reason of the kings suspicion that the earl might have handled the master hardly on some such surmise james asked lennox who corroborates whether he thought the master quite settled in his wits lennox knew nothing but good of him as he said in his evidence but ruthven observing their private talk implored james to keep the secret and come alone with him at first to see the captive and the treasure james felt more and more uneasy but he had started and rode on while the master now despatched andrew ruthven to warn gowrie within a mile of perth the master spurred on his weary horse and gave the news to gowrie who despite the messages of henderson and andrew ruthven was at dinner unprepared for the royal arrival however gowrie met james with sixty men four says the ruthven apologist jamess train then consisted of fifteen persons others must have dropped in later they had no fresh mounts but rested their horses the king says and let them graze by the way they followed because learning that james was going to perth they guessed that he intended to apprehend the master of oliphant who had been misconducting himself in angus thus the king accounts for the number of his train an hour passed before dinner james pressed for a view of the treasure but the master asked the king not to converse with him then as the whole affair was to be kept secret from gowrie if the two brothers had been at odds about the lands of scone the masters attitude towards his brother might seem intelligible a point never allowed for by critics unacquainted with the manuscript which we have cited at last the king sat down to dinner gowrie in attendance whispering to his servants and often going in and out of the chamber the master too was seen on the stairs by craigengelt if gowries behaviour is correctly described it might be attributed to anxiety about a royal meal so hastily prepared but if gowrie had plenty of warning from henderson as i do not doubt that theory is not sufficient if engaged in a conspiracy gowrie would have reason for anxiety the circumstances owing to the number of the royal retinue were unfavourable yet as the story of the pot of gold had been told by ruthven the plot could not be abandoned james even chaffed gowrie about being so pensive and distrait and about his neglect of some little points of scottish etiquette finally he sent gowrie into the hall with the gracecup for the gentlemen and then called the master he sent gowrie apparently that he might slip off with the master as that gentleman wished his majesty desired mr alexander to bring sir thomas erskine with him who ruthven desiring the king to go forward with him and promising that he should make any one or two follow him that he pleased to call for desiring his majesty to command publicly that none should follow him this seems to mean james and the master were to cross the hall and go upstairs james or the master for him bidding no one follow the master according to balgonie did say that the king would be alone while presently the master should return and privately beckon on one or two to join the king the masters excuse for all this was the keeping from gowrie and others for the moment of the secret of the prisoner and the pot of gold now if we turn back to sir thomas erskines evidence we find that when he joined james in the chamber after the slaying of the master he said i thought your majesty would have concredited more to me than to have commanded me to await your majesty at the door if you thought it not meet to have taken me with you the king replied alas the traitor deceived me in that as in all else for i commanded him expressly to bring you to me and he returned back as i thought to fetch you but he did nothing but steik shut the door what can these words mean they appear to me to imply that james sent the master back according to their arrangement to bring erskine that the master gave erskine some invented message about waiting at some door that he then shut a door between the king and his friends but told the king that erskine was to follow them erskine was beyond doubt in the street with the rest of the retinue before the brawl in the turret reached its crisis when gowrie had twice insisted that james had ridden away in any case to go on with jamess tale he went with ruthven up a staircase the great staircase and through three or four rooms three or four sundry houses the master ever locking behind him every door as he passed and so into a little study the turret this is perplexing we nowhere hear in the evidence of more than two doors in the suite which were locked the staircase perhaps gave on the long gallery with a door between them the gallery gave on a chamber which had a door the door battered by lennox and mar and the chamber gave on a turret which had a door between it and the chamber we hear in the evidence of no other doors or of no other locked doors however in the latin indictment of the ruthvens many doors are insisted on as all the evidence tells of opposition from only one door that between the gallery and the chamber of death jamess reason for talking of three or four doors must be left to conjecture the true discourse ms gives but the gallery chamber and turret but appears to allow for a door between stair and gallery which the master closed while he made fast the next door that between gallery and chamber one thomas hamilton a who writes a long letter ms to a lady unknown also speaks of several doors on the evidence of the king and some of the lords this manuscript has been neglected by historians b leaving this point we ask why a man already suspicious like james let the master lock any door behind him we might reply that james had dined and that wine and beer produce a careless state of mind as a writer on cricket long ago observed we may also suppose that till facts proved the locking of one door at least for about that there is no doubt james did not know that any door was locked on august the rev mr galloway in a sermon preached before the king and the populace at the cross of edinburgh says that the master led the monarch upstairs and through a trans a passage the door whereof so soon as they had entered chekit to with ane lok then through a gallery whose door also chekit to through a chamber and the door thereof chekit to also and thence into the turret of which he also locked the door were the locks that chekit to spring locks and was james unaware that he was locked in but ramsay before the affray had wandered into a gallery very fair and unless there were two galleries he could not do this if the gallery door was locked lennox and mar and the rest speak of opposition from only one door while we cannot explain these things that door at least between the gallery and the gallery chamber excluded james from most of his friends can the reader believe that he purposely had that door locked we know not how or by whom on the system of compelling gowrie to come and be killed by way of the narrow staircase could we see gowrie house and its secret ways as it then was we might understand this problem of the locked doors contemporary criticism as minutely recorded by calderwood found no fault with the number of locked doors but only asked how could the kings fear but increase perceiving mr alexander the master ever to lock the doors behind them if the doors closed with spring locks of which the principle had long been understood and used the king may not have been aware of the locking the problem cannot be solved we only disbelieve that the king himself had the door locked to keep his friends out and let gowrie in note the abbey of scone on page we have quoted the statement that james had bestowed on gowrie the abbey of scone during his life this was done in registrum magni sigilli vol iii no on may william fullarton got this gift the first earl of gowrie and his children being then forfeited but on july the gowrie of the day was restored to all his lands and the earldom of gowrie included the old church lands of scone reg mag sig iv no no how then did john third earl of gowrie hold only for his life the commendatorship of the abbey of scone as is stated in s p scot eliz vol lxvi no iv the kings narrative ii the man in the turret we left james entering the little round or study the turret chamber here at last he expected to find the captive and the pot of gold and here the central mystery of his adventure began his majesty saw standing with a very abased countenance not a bondman but a freeman with a dagger at his girdle ruthven locked the door put on his hat drew the mans dagger and held the point to the kings breast avowing now that the king behoved to be at his will and used as he list swearing many bloody oaths that if the king cried one word or opened a window to look out that dagger should go to his heart if this tale is true murder was not intended unless james resisted the king was only being threatened into compliance with the masters will ruthven added that the kings conscience must now be burthened for murdering his father that is for the execution of william earl of gowrie in his conviction was believed to have been procured in a dastardly manner later to be explained james was unarmed and obviously had no secret coat of mail in which he could not have hunted all day perhaps ruthven had his sword as for the other man he stood trembling and quaking james now made to the master the odd harangue reported even in nicholsons version of the falkland letter of the same day as for gowries execution the king said he had then been a minor he was eighteen in and gowrie was condemned by the ordinary course of law which his friends denied james had restored he said all the lands and dignities of the house two of ruthvens sisters were maids of honour ruthven had been educated by the revered mr rollock he ought to have learned better behaviour if the king died he would be avenged gowrie could not hope for the throne the king solemnly promised forgiveness and silence if ruthven let him go ruthven now uncovered his head and protested that the kings life should be safe if he made no noise or cry in that case ruthven would now bring gowrie to him why asked james you could gain little by keeping such a prisoner ruthven said that he could not explain gowrie would tell him the rest turning to the other man he said i make you the kings keeper till i come again and see that you keep him upon your peril he then went out and locked the door the person who later averred that he had been the man in the turret believed that ruthven never went far from the door james believed indeed averred that he ran downstairs and consulted gowrie if there was an armed man in the turret he was either placed there by the king to protect him while he summoned his minions by feigned cries of treason or he was placed there by gowrie to help the master to seize the king in the latter case the masters position was now desperate in lieu of an ally he had procured a witness against himself great need had he to consult gowrie but though gowrie certainly entered the house went upstairs and returned to lennox with the assurance that james had ridden away it is improbable that he and his brother met at this moment james however avers that they met ruthven running rapidly downstairs but this was mere inference on the kings part james occupied the time of ruthvens absence in asking the man of the turret what he knew of the conspiracy the man replied that he knew nothing he had but recently been locked into the little chamber indeed while ruthven was threatening the man says james was trembling and adjuring the master not to harm the king james having sworn to ruthven that he would not open the window himself now characteristically asked the man to open the window on his right hand if the king had his back to the turret door the window on his right opened on the courtyard the window on his left opened on the street the man readily opened the window says the king and the person claiming to be the man deponed later that he first opened what the king declared to be the wrong window but before he could open the other in came the master who casting his hands abroad in desperate manner said he could not mend it his majesty behoved to die instead of stabbing james however he tried to bind the royal hands with a garter swearing he behoved to be bound a garter was later picked up on the floor by one of the witnesses graham of balgonie and secured by sir thomas erskine a struggle then began james keeping the masters right hand off his swordhilt the master trying to silence james with his left hand james dragged the master to the window which the other man had opened in the latin indictment of the dead ruthvens james opens the window himself the turret man said in one of two depositions that he stretched across the wrestlers and opened the window the retinue and gowrie were passing as we know or loitering below gowrie affected not to hear the cries of treason lennox mar and the rest rushed up the great staircase meanwhile struggling with the master james had brought him out of the turret into the chamber so he says though more probably the master brought him they were now near the door of the chamber that gave on the narrow staircase and james was throwing the masters sword out of his hand thinking to have stricken him therewith when ramsay entered and wounded the master who was driven down the stairs and there killed by erskine and herries gowrie then invaded the room with seven others james was looking for the masters sword which had fallen but he was instantly shut into the turret by his friends and saw none of the fight in which gowrie fell after that lennox and the party with hammers were admitted and the tumult appeased james rode back through a dark rainy night to falkland picture the gallery chamber and the turret gowrie house v hendersons narrative the man in the turret had vanished like a ghost henderson on the day after the tragedy was also not to be found like certain ruthvens hew moncrieff eviot and others who had fought in the deathchamber or been distinguished in the later riot henderson had fled he was though a retainer of gowrie a member of the town council of perth and chamberlain or factor of the lands of scone then held by gowrie from the king to find any one who had seen him during the tumult was difficult or impossible william robertson a notary of perth examined in november before the parliamentary committee said then that he only saw gowrie with his two drawn swords and seven or eight companions in the forecourt of the house and so being afraid he passed out of the place the same man earlier on september when examined with other citizens of perth had said that he followed young tullibardine and some of his men who were entering the court to relieve the king he saw the master lying dead at the foot of the stair and saw henderson come out of the said turnpike over the masters belly he spoke to henderson who did not answer he remembered that murray of arbany was present arbany before the parliamentary committee in november said nothing on this subject nor did robertson his evidence would have been important had he adhered to what he said on september but oddly enough if he perjured himself on the earlier occasion september he withdrew his perjury when it would have been useful to the kings case in the evidence given before the lords of the articles in november mr barbe perhaps misled by the sequence of versions in pitcairn writes apparently it was only when his memory had been stimulated by the treatment of those whose evidence was found to be favourable to the king that the wily notary recalled the details by which he intended to corroborate hendersons statement a the reverse is the case the wily notary did not offer at the trial in november the evidence which he had given in september at the examination of the citizens of perth it may perhaps be inferred that perjury was not encouraged but depressed b despite the premiums on perjury which ruthven apologists insist on not one witness would swear to having seen henderson during or after the tumult yet he instantly fled with others who had been active in the brawl and remained in concealment calderwood the earnest collector of contemporary gossip and documents assures us that when the man in the turret could not be found the first proclamation identified him with a mr robert oliphant a black grim man but that oliphant proved his absence from perth one gray and one lesley were also suspected and one younger hiding when sought for it is said was killed but we have no copy of the proclamation as to mr robert oliphant to mr robert oliphant who had an alibi we shall return for this gentleman though entirely overlooked by our historians was probably at the centre of the situation p infra meanwhile whatever henderson had done he mysteriously vanished from gowrie house during or after the turmoil following darkness like a dream nobody was produced who could say anything about seeing henderson after moncrieff and the hays saw him on his return from falkland at about ten oclock in the morning of august by august henderson was still in hiding and was still being proclaimed for with others of whom mr robert oliphant was not one they were moncrieff eviot and two ruthvens a but on august at the cross of edinburgh in presence of the king his chaplain the rev patrick galloway gave news of henderson mr galloway had been minister of perth and a fierce presbyterian of old blow galloway the trumpet of the lord exclaimed a contemporary poet but james had tamed galloway he was now the kings chaplain he did not blow the trumpet of the lord any longer and i fear was capable of anything he had a pension calderwood tells us from the lands of scone and knew henderson who as chamberlain or steward paid the money in his exciting sermon galloway made a dramatic point henderson was found and henderson was the man in the turret galloway had received a letter from henderson in his own hand any listener who knew hendersons hand might see the letter henderson tells his tale therein galloway says that it differs almost nothing from the kings story of which he had given an abstract in his discourse and he adds that henderson stole downstairs while ramsay was engaged with the master b henderson being now in touch with galloway probably received promise of his life and of reward for he came in before august and at the trial in november was relieved of the charge of treason and gave evidence here we again ask why did henderson take to flight what had he to do with the matter none fled but those who had been seen sword in hand in the fatal chamber or stimulating the populace to attack the king during the tumult andrew ruthven who had ridden to falkland with henderson and the master did not run away no proclamation for him is on record nobody swore to seeing henderson like his fellow fugitives armed or active yet he fled and skulked manifestly henderson had in one way or other been suspiciously concerned in the affair he had come in and was at falkland by august when he was examined before the chancellor montrose the kings advocate sir thomas hamilton sir george hume of spot later earl of dunbar and others in the kings absence he deponed that on the night of august gowrie bade him and andrew ruthven ride early to falkland with the master and return if the master ordered him so to do with a message at falkland they went into a house and the master sent him to learn what the king was doing he came back with the news the master talked with the king then told henderson to carry to gowrie the tidings of the kings visit and that his majesty would be quiet henderson asked if he was to start at once ruthven told him to wait till he spoke to the king again they did speak at a gap in a wall during the check in the run ruthven returned to henderson sent him off and henderson reached perth about ten oclock gowrie on his arrival left the company he was with the two hays and here george hays evidence makes gowrie ask henderson who was with the king at falkland hay said that gowrie then took henderson into another room henderson says nothing about a question as to the kings company asked in presence of hay a compromising and improbable question if gowrie wished to conceal the visit to falkland apart gowrie put some other questions to henderson as to how the king received the master henderson then went to his house an hour later gowrie bade him put on his secret coat of mail and plate sleeves as he had to arrest a highlander henderson did as commanded at twelve the steward told him to bring up dinner as craigengelt the caterer was ill dinner began at halfpast twelve at the second course the master entered andrew ruthven had arrived earlier the company rose from table and henderson who was not at the moment in the room heard them moving and thought that they were going to make breeks for maconilduy that is to catch the highlander finding he was wrong he threw his steel gauntlet into the pantry and sent his boy to his house with his steel cap he then followed gowrie to meet the king and after he had fetched a drink which james says was long in coming the master bade him ask mr rhynd gowries old tutor for the key of the gallery which rhynd brought to the master gowrie then went up and spoke with the master and after some coming and going henderson was sent to the master in the gallery thither gowrie returned and bade henderson do whatever the master commanded the king says that gowrie came and went from the room during his dinner the master next bade henderson enter the turret and locked him in he passed the time in terror and in prayer there follows the story of the entry of james and the master and henderson now avers that he threw the dagger out of the masters hand he declares that the master said that he wanted a promise from the king on what point gowrie would explain the rest is much as in the kings account but henderson was pressing to have opened the window he says when the master entered for the second time with the garter to bind the kings hands during the struggle henderson removed the masters hand from the kings mouth and opened the window the master said to him wilt thou not help woe betide thee thou wilt make us all die a hendersons later deposition at the trial in november was mainly but not without discrepancies to the same effect as his first he said that he prayed when alone in the turret but omits the statement previously made by him that he deprived ruthven of his dagger a very improbable tale told falsely at first no doubt as robertson the notary at first invented his fable about meeting with henderson coming out of the dark staircase this myth robertson narrated when examined in september but omitted it in the trial in november henderson now explained about his first opening the wrong window but he sticks to it that he took the garter from ruthven of which james says nothing he vows that he turned the key of the door on the staircase so that ramsay could enter whereas ramsay averred that he himself forced the door mr hudson jamess resident at the court of england who in october interviewed both henderson and the king says that in fact the master had not locked the door on his reentry b henderson slunk out when ramsay came in he adds that it was his steel cap which was put on gowries head by a servant there was plenty of evidence that a steel cap was thus put on one singular point in hendersons versions is this after ruthven in deference to jamess harangue in the turret had taken off his hat the king said what is it ye crave man if ye crave not my life sir it is but a promise answered ruthven the king asked what promise and ruthven said that his brother would explain this tale looks like a confusion made by hendersons memory in a passage in jamess narrative his majesty inquired what the earl would do with him since if his majestys life were safe according to promise they could gain little in keeping such a prisoner ruthven then in jamess narrative said that the earl would tell his majesty at his coming it appears that the word promise in the royal version occurring at this point in the story clung to hendersons memory and so crept into his tale others have thought that the ruthvens wished to extort from james a promise about certain money which he owed to gowrie but to extort a promise by secluding and threatening the king would have been highly treasonable and dangerous nor need james have kept a promise made under duress perhaps few persons who are accustomed to weigh and test evidence who know the weaknesses of human memories and the illusions which impose themselves upon our recollections will lay great stress on the discrepancies between hendersons first deposition in august his second in november and the statement of the king in the footnote printed below a hudson explains the origin of certain differences between the kings narrative and hendersons evidence given in august hudson declares that james boasted of having taken the dagger out of ruthvens hands which in fact james does not do in his published narration and that henderson claimed to have snatched the dagger away to move mercy by more merit it is clear that james would not accept his story of disarming ruthven henderson omits that in his second deposition for the rest james who was quite clever enough to discover the discrepancies let them stand at the end of his own printed narrative with the calm remark that if any differences existed in the depositions they must be taken as uttered by the deponer in his own behouf for obtaining of his majestys princely grace and favour b hendersons first deposition was one of these which james printed with his own narrative and thus treated en prince he was not going to harmonise his evidence with hendersons or hendersons with his on the other hand from the first henderson had probably the opportunity to frame his confession on the falkland letter of august to the chancellor and the provost of edinburgh and later on the printed narrative officially issued at the close of august he varied when he did vary in hopes of his majestys princely grace and favour and he naturally tried to make out that he was not a mere trembling expostulating caitiff he clung to the incident of the garter which he snatched from the masters hand henderson had no royal model for his account of how he came to be in the turret which james could only learn from himself now that is the most incredible part of hendersons narrative however secret the ruthvens may have desired to be how could they trust everything to the chance that the town councillor of perth upper footman and chamberlain of scone would act the desperate part of seizing a king without training and without warning but was henderson unwarned and uninstructed or did he fail after ample instruction that is the difficult point raised by the very curious case of mr robert oliphant which has never been mentioned i think by the many minute students of this bewildering affair vi the strange case of mr robert oliphant suppose that men like the ruthvens great and potent nobles had secretly invited their retainer andrew henderson to take the role of the armed man in the turret what could henderson have done such proposals as this were a danger dreaded even by the most powerful thus in march james hepburn the wicked earl of bothwell procured through john knox a reconciliation with his feudal enemy arran the brain of arran was already it seems impaired a few days after the reconciliation he secretly consulted knox on a delicate point bothwell he said had imparted to him a scheme whereby they should seize queen marys person and murder her secretary lethington and her halfbrother lord james stuart later earl of moray arran explained to knox that if ever the plot came to light he would be involved in the crime of guilty concealment of foreknowledge of treason but if he divulged the plan bothwell would challenge him to trial by combat knox advised secrecy but arran now far from sane revealed the real or imagined conspiracy to a man like henderson the peril in simply listening to treasonable proposals from the ruthvens would be even greater if he merely declined to be a party and kept silence or fled he lost his employment as gowries man and would be ruined if the plot ever came to light he would be involved in guilty concealment of foreknowledge if he instantly revealed to the king what he knew his word would not be accepted against that of gowrie he would be tortured to get at the very truth and probably would be hanged by way of experiment to see if he would adhere to his statement on the scaffold a fate from which henderson in fact was only saved by the king what then if the gowries offered to henderson the role of the man in the turret could henderson do he could do what according to james and to himself he did he could tremble expostulate and assure the king of his ignorance of the purpose for which he was locked up like a dog in the little study that this may have been the real state of affairs is not impossible we have seen that calderwood mentions a certain mr robert oliphant mr means master of arts as having been conjectured at immediately after the tragedy as the man in the turret he must therefore have been and he was a trusted retainer of gowrie but oliphant at once proved an alibi he was not in perth on august his name never occurs in the voluminous records of the proceedings he is not like henderson among the persons who fled and for whom search was made as far as the documents declare though calderwood says that he was described as a black grim man in the first proclamation if so it looks ill for james as henderson was a brown fair man in any case oliphant at once cleared himself but we hear of him again though historians have overlooked the fact among the acts of caution of that is the records of men who become sureties for the good behaviour of others is an entry in the privy council register for december mr alexander wilky in the canongate for john wilky tailor there l not to harm john lyn also tailor there further to answer when required touching his john wilkys pursuit of lyn for revealing certain speeches spoken to him by mr robert oliphant anent his foreknowledge of the treasonable conspiracy of the late john sometime earl of gowrie thus robert oliphant ma had spoken to tailor lyn or so lyn had declared about his own foreknowledge of the plot lyn had blabbed tailor wilky had pursued or attacked lyn and alexander wilky who was bailie of the canongate enters into recognisances to the amount of l that john wilky shall not further molest lyn now what had oliphant said on the very day december when alexander wilky became surety for the good behaviour of john wilky nicholson the english resident at holyrood described the facts to robert cecil a nicholson says that at a house in the canongate mr robert oliphant was talking of the gowrie case he was a man who had travelled and he inveighed against the unfairness of scottish procedure in the case of cranstoun we have seen that mr thomas cranstoun gowries equerry first brought to lennox and others in the garden the report that the king had ridden away we have seen that he was deeply wounded by ramsay just before or after gowrie fell unable to escape he was taken examined tortured tried on august and on august hanged at perth he had invaded and wounded herries and thomas erskine and had encouraged the mob to beleaguer the back gate of gowrie house against the kings escape he had been in france he said since had come home with gowrie but he swore had not spoken six words with the ruthvens during the last fortnight b this is odd as he was their master stabler and as they by their friends account had been making every preparation to leave for dirleton which involved arrangements about their horses in any case mr robert oliphant in a house in the canongate in november or early december declared that cranstoun who he said knew nothing of the conspiracy had been hanged while henderson who was in the secret and had taken the turret part escaped and retained his position as chamberlain of scone henderson at the critical moment had fainted said oliphant that is had failed from want of courage oliphant went on to say that he himself had been with gowrie in paris februarymarch and that both in paris and at home in scotland later gowrie had endeavoured to induce him to take the part later offered to henderson he had tried but in vain to divert gowries mind from his dangerous project this talk of oliphants leaked out through lyn as we know and oliphant says nicholson fled again of oliphant we learn no more till about june at that time the king in england heard a rumour that he had been connected with the conspiracy a captain patrick heron obtained a commission to find oliphant and arrested him at canterbury he was making for dover and for france heron seized oliphants portable property eight angels two half rosenobles one double pistolet two french crowns and a half one albertus angel two english crowns one turkish piece of gold two gold rings and a loose stone belonging to one three netherland dollars one piece of four royals two quart decuria seven pieces of several coins of silver two purses one sword one trunk one mail and two budgetts oliphant himself lay for nine months in the gate house of westminster but heron careless to justify his accusation and discovering his aim in that business writes the king presently departed from hence we have tried the innocency of mr robert oliphant james goes on and have freed him from prison the scottish privy council is therefore ordered on march to make heron restore oliphants property on may heron was brought before the privy council in edinburgh and was bidden to make restitution he was placed in the tolbooth but released by lindsay the keeper of the prison in march oliphant having again gone abroad heron expressed his readiness to restore the goods except the trunk and bags which he had given to the english privy council who restored them to robert oliphant the brother of robert oliphant of bauchiltoun represented him in his absence and in robert got some measure of restitution from heron we know no more of mr robert oliphant his freedom of talk was amazing but perhaps he had been drinking when he told the story of his connection with the plot by nothing could be proved against him in london in had he not fled from edinburgh in december something might have been extracted we can only say that his version of the case is less improbable than hendersons henderson if approached by gowrie as oliphant is reported to have said that he was could not divulge the plot could not like oliphant a gentleman leave perth and desert his employment so perhaps he drifted into taking the role of the man in the turret if so he had abundance of time to invent his most improbable story that he was shut up there in ignorance of the purpose of his masters henderson was not always of the lamblike demeanour which he displayed in the turret on march nicholson reports that sir hugh herries the lame doctor and henderson fell out and were at offering of strokes whence revelations were anticipated they never came and for all that we know herries may have taunted henderson with oliphants version of his conduct he was pretty generally suspected of having been in the conspiracy and of having failed from terror and then betrayed his masters while pretending not to have known why he was placed in the turret it is remarkable that herries did not appear as a witness at the trial in november he was knighted and rewarded every one almost was rewarded out of gowries escheats or forfeited property but that was natural whether james was guilty or innocent and we repeat that the rewards present or in prospect did not produce witnesses ready to say that they saw henderson at falkland or in the tumult or in the turret why men so freely charged with murderous conspiracy and false swearing were so dainty on these and other essential points the advocates of the theory of perjury may explain how james treated discrepancies in the evidence we have seen his account was the true account he would not alter it he would not suppress the discrepancies of henderson except as to the dagger witnesses might say this or that to secure the kings princely favour let them say the kings account is true this attitude is certainly more dignified and wiser than the easy method of harmonising all versions before publication meanwhile if there were discrepancies they were held by sceptics to prove falsehood if there had been absolute harmony that would really have proved collusion on one point i suspect suppression at the trial almost all versions aver that ramsay or another said to gowrie you have slain the king and that gowrie who certainly did not mean murder then dropped his points and was stabbed of this nothing is said at the trial by any witnesses vii the contemporary ruthven vindication we now come to the evidence which is most fatally damaging to the two unfortunate ruthvens it is the testimony of their contemporary vindication till a date very uncertain a tradition hung about perth that some old gentlemen remembered having seen a vindication of the ruthvens written at the time of the events antiquaries vainly asked each other for copies of this valuable apology was it printed and suppressed by royal order did it circulate only in manuscript in a mr panton published a vehement defence of the ruthvens speaking of the kings narrative he says in a short time afterwards a reply or counter manifesto setting forth the matter in its true light written by some friend of the ruthven family made its appearance the discovery of this performance would now be a valuable acquisition but there is no probability that any such exists as the government instantly ordered the publication to be suppressed the learned and accurate lord hailes writing in the second half of the eighteenth century says it appears by a letter of sir john carey governor really deputy governor of berwick to cecil th september that some treatise had been published in scotland in vindication of gowrie that treatise or rather newsletter unsigned and overlooked by our historians as far as my knowledge goes is extant in the record office we can identify it as the document mentioned by carey to cecil in his letter of september carey was then in command of berwick the great english frontier fortress for his chief the brave lord willoughby was absent on sick leave on september then from berwick carey wrote to sir robert cecil i have thought good to send you such information as i have received out of scotland this morning on both sides both on the kings part and the earls part that you may read them both together now we possess a manuscript the verie maner of the erll of gowrie and his brother their death quha war killit at perth the fyft of august by the kingis servanttis his majestie being present this paper is directed to my lord governor and as carey was acting for my lord governor lord willoughby at berwick he received and forwarded the document to cecil this is the vindication at least i know no other and no printed copy though nicholson writes that a book on the ruthven side was printed in england october the manuscript is in bad condition in parts illegible acids appear to have been applied to it the story however from the gowrie side can be easily made out it alleges that on saturday august really august the lame dr herries came on some pretext to gowries house this man by my lord was convoyed through the house and the secret parts shown him now there was no secret part in the house as far as the narratives go the entry to the narrow staircase was inconspicuous but was noticed by ramsay and of course was familiar to gowrie and his men on tuesday the fatal day according to the ruthven vindication gowries retainers were preparing to go with him to lothian that is to dirleton a castle of his on the sea hard by north berwick the narrator argues as all the friends of the ruthvens did that if gowrie had intended any treason his men would not have been busy at their houses with preparations for an instant removal the value of this objection is null if gowrie had a plot it probably was to carry the king to dirleton with him in disguise picture dirleton castle the master the apology goes on whom the king had sent for divers times before and on august rode early to falkland accompanied by andrew ruthven and andrew henderson none of jamess men nor james himself as we have remarked saw henderson at falkland and modern opponents of the king deny as the aforesaid mr panton does that he was there here they clash with the verie manner c issued at the time by gowries defenders it avers that the master and his two men did not intend to return from falkland to perth they meant to sleep at falkland on the night of the fifth and meet gowrie next day august at the waterside and cross with him to the south coast of the firth of forth thence riding on as other friendly accounts allege to dirleton near north berwick and andrew hendersons confessions testified this as published they do nothing of the sort the master took his lodging in falkland for this night hearing that james was to hunt the master breakfasted and went to look for him after a conversation with james he bade henderson ride back to perth and tell gowrie that for what occasion he knew not the king was coming now after they all arrived at perth the master told gowries caterer craigengelt that the king had come because robert abercrombie that false knave had brought the king there to make his majesty take order for his debt this fact was stated by craigengelt himself under examination if ruthven spoke the truth he did know the motive or pretext of the kings coming which the apologist denies but ruthven was not speaking the truth he told craigengelt as we saw that he had been on an errand not far off as to the debt james owed gowrie a large sum with accumulated interest for expenses incurred by gowries father when lord treasurer of scotland james in june as we shall see gave gowrie a years respite from the pursuit of his fathers creditors hoping to pay him in the meanwhile whether this exemption would not have defended gowrie from robert abercromby whether james would act as debt collector for robert abercromby a burgess of edinburgh the kings saddler the reader may decide but the master gave to craigengelt this reason for jamess unexpected arrival though his contemporary apologist says as to jamess motive for coming to perth that the master knew nothing henderson having cantered off with his message james rode to perth nothing is said by the apologist of the four hours spent in hunting accompanied by sixty horsemen of whom thirty came a little before him no trace of either the sixty or the thirty appears anywhere in the evidence no witness alludes to the arrival of any of the kings party in front of him on hearing from henderson of the kings approach says the vindication gowrie who was dining ordered a new meal to be prepared all the other evidence shows that henderson came back to perth long before gowrie dined and that nevertheless gowrie made no preparations at all gowrie with four others then met the king on the inch of perth says the apologist james kissed him when they met the kiss of judas we are to understand he entered the house and all the keys were given to jamess retainers the porter as we saw really had the keys and gowrie opened the garden gate with one of them the apologist is mendacious dinner was soon over james sent the master to bid ramsay and erskine follow him to his chamber where his majesty sir thomas erskine john ramsay dr herries and mr wilson being convened slew the master and threw him down the stair how and for what cause they know best themselves of course it is absolutely certain that the master did not bring the other three men to james in the chamber where the master was first wounded undeniably herries ramsay and erskine were not brought by the master at jamess command to this room they did not enter it till after the cries of treason were yelled by james from the window of the turret a servant of jamess says the apologist now brought the news that the king had ridden away cranstoun gowries man really did this as he admitted gowrie the author goes on hearing of jamess departure called for his horse and went out into the street there he stood abiding his horse now cranstoun as he confessed had told gowrie that his horse was at scone two miles away by keeping his horses there gowrie made it impossible for him to accompany the royal retinue as they went on their useless errand p supra in the street gowrie hears his majesty call on him out at the chamber window my lord of gowrie traitors has murdered your brother already and ye suffer me to be murdered also nobody else heard this and if gowrie heard it how inept it was in him to go about asking what is the matter he was occupied thus while lennox mar and the others were rushing up the great staircase to rescue the king james according to the ruthven apologist had told gowrie what the matter was his brother was slain and slain by erskine who while the earl asked what is the matter was trying to collar that distracted nobleman the master had brought erskine to the king says the apologist erskine had slain the master yet simultaneously he tried to seize gowrie in the street erskine was in two places at once the apology is indeed a valuable acquisition gowrie and cranstoun and they alone the apologist avers were now permitted by jamess servants to enter the house we know that many of jamess men were really battering at the locked door and we know that others of gowries people besides cranstoun entered the house and were wounded in the scuffle cranstoun himself says nothing of any opposition to their entry to the house after gowrie drew his two swords cranstoun according to the apologist first entered the chamber alone and was wounded and drawn back by gowrie which cranstoun in his own statement denies after his wounds he fled he says seeing no more of gowrie then according to the apologist gowrie himself at last entered the chamber the kings friends attacked him but he was too cunning of fence for them they therefore parleyed and promised to let him see the king who was in the turret gowrie dropped his points ramsay stabbed him he died committing his soul to god and declaring that he was a true subject this narrative we are told by its author is partly derived from the kings men partly from the confessions of cranstoun craigengelt and baron accused of having been in the chamberfight and active in the tumult all these three were tried and hanged the apologist adds that jamess companions will swear to whatever he pleases this was unjust ramsay would not venture to recognise the man of whom he caught a glimpse in the turret and nobody pretended to have seen henderson at falkland though the presence of henderson at falkland and in the chamber was an essential point but among the kings crew of perjurers not a man swore to either fact what follows relates to gowries character he had paid all his fathers debts which most assuredly he had not done as to the causes of his taking off they are explained by the apologist but belong to a later part of the inquiry such was the contemporary vindication of gowrie sent to carey at berwick for english reading and forwarded by carey to cecil the narrative is manifestly false on the points which we have noted it is ingeniously asserted by the vindicator that a servant of james brought the report that he had ridden away it is not added that the false report was really brought by cranstoun and twice confirmed by gowrie once after he had gone to make inquiry upstairs again the apologist never even hints at the locked door of the gallery chamber whereat mar lennox and the rest so long and so vainly battered who locked that door and why the subject is entirely omitted by the apologist on the other hand the apologist never alludes to the murrays who were in the town other writers soon after the events and in our own day allege that james had arranged his plot so as to coincide with the presence of the murrays in perth what they did to serve him we have heard john murray was wounded by a ruthven partisan after the earl and master were dead some murrays jostled gowrie before he rushed to his death young tullibardine helped to pacify the populace that is all nothing more is attributed to the murrays and the contemporary apologist did not try to make capital out of them though the narrative of the contemporary apologist for the ruthvens appears absolutely to lack evidence for its assertions it reveals on analysis a consistent theory of the kings plot it may not be verifiable in fact it cannot be true but there is a theory a system which we do not find in most contemporary or in more recent arguments james by the theory is intent on the destruction of the ruthvens his plan was to bring the master to falkland and induce the world to believe that it was the master who brought him to perth the master refuses several invitations at last on his way to dirleton he goes to falkland taking with him andrew ruthven and andrew henderson the old apologist asserts what modern vindicators deny that henderson was at falkland then the master sends henderson first andrew ruthven later to warn gowrie that for some unknown reason the king is coming to conceal his bloody project though the apologist does not mention the circumstance james next passes four hours in hunting to omit this certain fact is necessary for the apologists purpose the king sends thirty horsemen in front of him and follows with thirty more after dinner he leaves the hall with the master but sends him back for erskine wilson and ramsay james having secured their help and next lured the master into a turret the minions kill ruthven and throw his body downstairs one of them simultaneously is in the street james has previously arranged that one of his servants shall give out that the king has ridden away this he does announce at the nick of time though gowries servant did it so that gowrie shall go towards the stables where he expects to find his horse though he knows it is at scone thus coming within earshot of the turret window thence james shouts to gowrie that traitors are murdering him and have murdered the master now this news would bring not only gowrie but all the royal retinue to his majestys assistance but as not knowing the topography of the house the retinue james must have calculated will run up the main stairs to rescue the king their arrival would be inconvenient to the king as the nobles would find that james has only friends with him not traitors so the king has had the door locked we guess though we are not told this by the apologist to keep out lennox mar and the rest gowrie however has to be admitted and killed and gowrie knowing the house will come the king calculates by the dark stair and the unlocked door therefore jamess friends in the street will let him and cranstoun enter the house these two alone and no others with them they knowing the narrow staircase go up that way naturally as naturally gowrie lets cranstoun face the danger of four hostile swords alone waiting till cranstoun is disabled gowrie then confronts alone the same murderous blades is disarmed by a ruse and is murdered this explanation has a method a system unfortunately it is contradicted by all the evidence now to be obtained from whatever source it comes retainers of gowrie companions of james or burgesses of perth we must suppose that gowrie with his small force of himself and cranstoun both fencers from the foreign schools would allow that force to be cut off in detail one by one we must suppose that erskine was where he certainly was not in two places at once and that ramsay and herries and he unseen left the hall and joined the king on a message brought by the master unmarked by any witness we must suppose that the kings witnesses who professed ignorance on essential points perjured themselves on others in batches but if we grant that mar lennox and the rest gentlemen servants retainers and menials of the ruthvens and citizens of perth were abandoned perjurers on some points while scrupulously honourable on others equally essential the narrative of the ruthven apologist has a method a consistency which we do not find in modern systems unfavourable to the king for example the modern theories easily show how james trapped the master he had only to lure him into a room and cry treason then even if untutored in his part some hotheaded young man like ramsay would stab ruthven but to deal with gowrie was a more difficult task he would be out in the open surrounded by men like lennox and mar great nobles and his near kinsmen they would attest the innocence of the earl they must therefore be separated from him lured away to attack the locked door while gowrie would stand in the street asking what is the matter though james had told him and detained by the murrays till they saw fit to let him and cranstoun go within the gate alone then knowing the topography gowrie and cranstoun would necessarily make for the murderchamber by the dark stair and perish the royal wit never conceived a subtler plot it is much cleverer than that invented by mr g p r james in his novel gowrie nothing is wrong with the system of the apologist except that the facts are false and the idea a trifle too subtle while instead of boldly saying that the king had the gallery chamber locked against his friends the apologist never hints at that circumstance we have to help the contemporary vindicator out by adding the detail of the locked door which he did not see how to account for and therefore omitted and by explaining that the king had it locked himself that lennox mar and the rest might not know the real state of the case and that gowrie might be trapped through taking the other way by the narrow staircase an author so conspicuously mendacious as he who wrote the apology for english consumption is unworthy of belief on any point it does not follow that henderson was really at falkland because the apologist says that he was but it would appear that this vindicator could not well deny the circumstance and that to work it conveniently into his fable he had to omit the kings hunting and to contradict the hays and moncrieff by making henderson arrive at perth after twelve instead of about ten oclock the value of the apology so long overlooked is to show how very poor a case was the best that the vindicator of the ruthvens was able to produce but no doubt it was good enough for people who wished to believe viii the theory of an accidental brawl so far the kings narrative is least out of keeping with probability but had james been insulted menaced and driven to a personal struggle as he declared is the fact not that finding himself alone with ruthven and an armed man or no armed man if you believe that none was there james lost his nerve and cried treason in mere panic the rest followed from the hot blood of the three courtiers and the story of james was invented after the deaths of the gowries to conceal the truth and to rob by forfeiture the family of ruthven but james had certainly told lennox the story of ruthven and the pot of gold before they reached perth if he came with innocent intent he had not concocted that story as an excuse for coming we really must be consistent mr barbe a recent ruthven apologist says that the theory of an accidental origin of the struggle between james and ruthven may possibly contain a fairly accurate conjecture but mr barbe also argues that james had invented the pot of gold story before he left falkland that if james was guilty the pretext had been framed the myth of the treasure had been concocted long before their meeting in falkland and was held in readiness to use whenever circumstances required if so then there is no room at all for the opinion that the uproar in the turret was accidental but mr barbes meaning is that james thus forced a quarrel on ruthven for there was no captive with a pot of gold nor can accident have caused the tragedy if ruthven lured james to falkland with the false tale of the golden hoard that tale confided by james to lennox on the ride to perth was either an invention of the kings in which case james is the crafty conspirator whom mr bruce in did not believe him to be as shall be shown or it is true that ruthven brought james to perth by the feigned story in which case ruthven is a conspirator i reject for reasons already given the suggestion that lennox perjured himself when he swore that james told him about ruthvens narrative as to the captive and his hoard for these reasons alone there is no room for the hypothesis of accident either james or ruthven was a deliberate traitor if james invented the pot of gold he is the plotter if ruthven did ruthven is guilty there is no via media no room for the theory of accident the via media the hypothesis of accident was suggested by sir william bowes who wrote out his theory in a letter to sir john stanhope from bradley on september bowes had been english ambassador in scotland probably with the usual commission to side with the kings enemies and especially much as elizabeth loathed her own puritans with the party of the kirk his coach had been used for the kidnapping of an english gentleman then with james while the governor of berwick supplied a yacht in case it seemed better to carry off the victim by sea consequently bowes was unpopular and needed and got a guard of forty horsemen for his protection he was no friend as may be imagined of the king bowes had met preston whom james sent to elizabeth with his version of the gowrie affair bowess theory of it all was this james the master and one other attending the man of the turret were alone in a chamber of gowrie house speech arose about the late earl of gowrie ruthvens father whether by occasion of his portrait on the wall or otherwise the king angrily said he was a traitor whereat the youth showing a grieved and expostulatory countenance and haplie scotlike words the king seeing himself alone and without weapon cried treason the master placed his hand on jamess mouth and knelt to deprecate his anger but ramsay stabbed him as he knelt and gowrie was slain preston said after ramsay had made him drop his guard by crying that the king was murdered the tale of the conspiracy was invented by james to cover the true state of the case this bowes only puts forth as a working hypothesis it breaks down on the kings narrative to lennox about ruthvens captive and hoard it breaks down on one other attending the man in the turret whatever else he may have been he was no harmless attendant it breaks down on the locked door between the king and lennox and mar which bowes omits it is ruined by gowries repeated false assurances that the king had ridden away which bowes ignores the third hypothesis the via media is impossible there was a deliberate plot on one side or the other to make the theory of bowes quite clear his letter is appended to this section ix contemporary clerical criticism the most resolute sceptics as to the guilt of the ruthvens were the edinburgh preachers they were in constant opposition to the king and the young gowrie was their favourite nobleman as to what occurred when the news of the tragedy reached edinburgh early on july we have the narrative of mr robert bruce then the leader of the presbyterians his own version is printed in the first volume of the bannatyne club miscellany and is embodied with modifications and without acknowledgment as references to such sources were usually omitted at that period in calderwoods history it is thus better to follow mr bruces own account as far as it goes the preachers heard the bruit or rumour of the tragedy by nine oclock on the morning of august by ten oclock arrived a letter from james to the privy council the preachers were called first before the council of the town and the kings epistle was read to them it bore that his majesty was delivered out of a peril and therefore that we should be commanded to go to our kirks convene our people ring bells and give god praises while the preachers were answering the privy council sent for the provost and some of the town council the preachers then went to deliberate in the east kirk and decided that we could not enter into the particular defence of the existence of the treason seeing that the king was silent of the treason in his own letter and the reports of courtiers varied among themselves this is not easily intelligible the letter from falkland of which nicholson gives an account on august was exceedingly particular as to the treason it is my impression based mainly on the burgh records quoted by pitcairn that the letter with full particulars cited by nicholson was written more or less officially by the notary david moysie who was at falkland and that the kings letter was brief only requiring thanksgiving to be offered yet nicholson says that the letter with details written by the king he seems to think was meant for the preachers as well as for the privy council cf p note the preachers in any case were now brought before the privy council and desired by montrose the chancellor to go to church and thank god for the kings miraculous delivery from that vile treason they replied that they could not be certain of the treason but would speak of delivery from a great danger or they would wait and when quite sure of the treason would blaze it abroad they the council said it should be sufficient to read his majestys letter this appears to mean that the preachers would content the lords by merely reading jamess letter aloud to the public we answered that we could not read his letter aloud to the people and doubt of the truth of it it would be better to say generally if the report be true the preachers would have contented the lords by merely reading jamess letter aloud to their congregations but this they declined to do they wished in the pulpit to evade the royal letter and merely to talk conditionally of the possible truth of the report or bruit this appears to have been a verbal narrative brought by graham of balgonie which seemed to vary from the long letter probably penned by moysie at this moment the rev david lindsay who had been at falkland and had heard jamess story from his own mouth arrived he therefore was sent to tell the tale publicly at the cross the council reported to james that the six edinburgh preachers would in no ways praise god for his delivery in fact they would only do so in general terms on august james took the preachers to task bruce explained that they could thank and on sunday had thanked god for the kings delivery but could go no further into detail in respect we had no certainty had you not my letter asked the king bruce replied that the letter spoke only of a danger in general yet the letter reported by nicholson was full and particular but that letter the preachers seem to have regarded as unofficial could not my council inform you of the particulars asked the king the president fyvie later chancellor dunfermline said that they had assured the preachers of the certainty of the treason on this bruce replied that they had only a report brought orally by balgonie and a letter by moysie an edinburgh notary then at falkland and that these testimonies fought so together that no man could have any certainty the secretary elphinstone later lord balmerino denied the discrepancies james now asked what was the preachers present opinion they had heard the king himself the council and mar bruce replied that as a minister he was not fully persuaded four of the preachers adhered to their scepticism two hewat and robertson now professed conviction the other four were forbidden to preach under pain of death and forbidden to come within ten miles of edinburgh they offered terms but these were refused the reason of jamess ferocity was that the devout regarded the preachers as the mouthpieces of god and so if they doubted his word the kings character would to the godly seem no better than that of a mendacious murderer from a modern point of view the ministers if doubtful had a perfect right to be silent and one of them hall justly objected that he ought to wait for the verdict in the civil trial of the dead ruthvens we shall meet this hall and hewatt one of the two ministers who professed belief in very strange circumstances later p here it is enough to have explained the kings motives for severity in september the recalcitrants came before the king at stirling all professed to be convinced one after inquiries in fife except bruce we learn what happened next from a letter of his to his wife he had heard from one who had been at craigengelts execution august that craigengelt had then confessed that henderson had told him how he was placed by gowrie in the turret bruce had sent to verify this moreover he would believe if henderson were hanged and adhered to his deposition to the last a pretty experiment the comptroller asked will you believe a condemned man better than the king and council mr bruce admitted that such was his theory of the grammar of assent if henderson die penitently i will trust him later as we shall see this pleasing experiment was tried in another case but though the witness died penitently and clinging to his final deposition not one of the godly sceptics was convinced but henderson saved the kings life replied the comptroller to mr bruce as to that i cannot tell said mr bruce and added that if henderson took the dagger from ruthven he deserved to die for not sheathing it in ruthvens breast henderson later we know withdrew his talk of his seizure of the dagger which james had never admitted james now said that he knew not what became of the dagger suppose said the comptroller henderson goes back from that deposition then his testimony is the worse said mr bruce then it were better to keep him alive said the comptroller but mr bruce insisted that henderson would serve james best by dying penitently james said that bruce made him out a murderer if i would have taken their lives i had causes enough his meaning is unknown i need not have hazarded myself so by the causes can james have meant gowries attempts to entangle him in negotiations with the pope these were alleged by mr galloway in a sermon preached on august in the open air before the king and the populace of edinburgh see infra p mar wondered that bruce would not trust men who like himself heard the king cry and saw the hand at his throat mr bruce said that mar might believe as he were there to hear and see he was left to inform himself but calderwood says that the story about craigengelts dying confession was untrue bruce had frankly given the lie to the king and mar though he remarked that he had never heard mar and lennox tell the tale out of their own mouths mar later september most solemnly assured mr bruce by letter that the treason in respect of that i saw was a certain fact this he professed before god in heaven meanwhile mr hall was restored to his edinburgh pulpit and mr bruce after a visit to restalrig a place close to edinburgh and leith went into banishment a if he stayed with the laird of restalrig he had as will presently appear a strange choice in friends pp a later letter of bruces now takes up the tale in bruce was in london when mar was there as jamess envoy they met and bruce said he was content to abide by the verdict in the gowrie trial of november what he boggled at henceforward was a public apology for his disbelief an acceptance from the pulpit of the kings veracity as to the events in london bruce had found that the puritans as to the guilt of essex which was flagrant were in the same position as himself regarding the guilt of gowrie b but they bowed to the law and so would he for the present the puritans in england would not preach that they were persuaded of the guilt of essex nor would bruce preach his persuasion of the guilt of gowrie from my knowledge and from my persuasion he assured mar that it was not possible for any man to be fully persuaded or to take on their conscience but so many as saw and heard however bruce is selfcontradictory he would be persuaded if henderson swung for it adhering to his statement such were mr braces theories of evidence he added that he was not fully persuaded that there was any hell to go to yet probably he scrupled not to preach tidings of damnation he wanted to be more certain of gowries guilt than he was that there is hellfire spiteful taunts followed mars repartee to the argument about hell being obvious bruce must have asserted the existence of hell from the pulpit though not fully persuaded of hell so why not assert the kings innocence bruce returned later to scotland and met the king in april now he said according to calderwood that he was resolved that is convinced what convinced him mars oath how could he swear asked james he neither saw nor heard that is what passed between james the man in the turret and the master i cannot tell you how he could swear but indeed he swore very deeply said bruce and reported the oath which must have been a fine example james took bruces preference of mars oath to his own word very calmly bruce was troubled about the exact state of affairs between james and the master doubt ye of that said the king then ye could not but count me a murderer it followeth not if it please you sir said mr robert for ye might have had some secret cause a strange ethics a man may slay another without incurring the guilt of murder if he has a secret cause bruce probably referred to the tattle about a love intrigue between gowrie or ruthven and the kings wife even now james kept his temper he offered his whole story to bruce for crossexamination mr robert uttered his doubt where he found occasion the king heard him gently and with a constant countenance which mr robert admired but mr robert would not preach his belief would not apologise from the pulpit i give it but a doubtsome trust he said again on june james invited crossexamination bruce asked how he could possibly know the direction of his majestys intention when he ordered ramsay to strike the master i will give you leave to pose me interrogate me said james b had you a purpose to slay my lord that is gowrie as i shall answer to god i knew not that my lord was slain till i saw him in his last agony and was very sorry yea prayed in my heart for the same what say ye then concerning mr alexander i grant i was art and part in mr alexanders slaughter for it was in my own defence why brought you not him to justice seeing you should have god before your eyes i had neither god nor the devil man before my eyes but my own defence here the king began to fret and no wonder he frankly said that he was one time minded to have spared mr alexander but being moved for the time the motion passion prevailed he swore in answer to a question that in the morning he loved the master as his brother bruce was now convinced that james left falkland innocent of evil purpose but as he was in a passion and revengeful while struggling with the master he could not be innocent before god here we leave mr bruce he signed a declaration of belief in jamess narrative public apologies in the pulpit he would not make he was banished to inverness and was often annoyed and put at james reckoning him a firebrand the result on the showing of the severe and hostile calderwood is that in bruces opinion in june james was guiltless of a plot against the ruthvens the kings crime was not that strangely complicated project of a double murder to be inferred from the ruthven apology but words spoken in the heat of blood betrayed captured taunted insulted struggling with a subject whom he had treated kindly james cried to ramsay strike low he knew not the nature and extent of the conspiracy against him he knew not what knocking that was at the door of the chamber and he told ramsay to strike we have no assurance that the wounds were deadly this is how the matter now appeared to mr bruce the king swore very freely to the truth of his tale and that influenced bruce but the kings candour as to what passed in his own mind when he bade ramsay strike ruthven is more convincing to a modern critic than his oaths for some reason bruces real point that he was satisfied of the kings innocence of a plot but not satisfied as regards his yielding to passion when attacked is ignored by the advocates of the ruthvens mr barbe observes what slight success there ever was remained on bruces side for in one conference he drew from the king the confession that he might have saved ruthvens life and brought him to justice that confession shows unexpected candour in james but does not in the slightest degree implicate him in a conspiracy and of a conspiracy even the rigid bruce now acquitted the king mr pitcairn at first a strong kings man in an appendix to his third volume credits bruce with the best of the argument this he does illogically because the king never ceased to persecute bruce whom he thought a firebrand however wicked this conduct of james may have been it in no way affects the argument as to his guilt in the conspiracy of that mr bruce acquitted the king calderwoods words vi are mr robert by reason of his oaths thought him innocent of any purpose that day in the morning to slay them yet because he confessed he had not god or justice before his eyes but was in a heat and mind to revenge he could not be innocent before god and had great cause to repent and to crave mercy for christs sake the thing is perfectly clear bruce acquitted james of the infamous plot against the ruthvens what then was the position of the ruthvens if the king was not the conspirator obviously they were guilty whether james at a given moment was carried away by passion or not x popular criticism of the day calderwood has preserved for us the objections taken by sceptics to the kings narrative first the improbability of a murderous conspiracy by youths so full of promise and presbyterianism as gowrie and his brother to gowries previous performances we return later the objection against a scheme of murder hardly applies to a plan for kidnapping a king who was severe against the kirk the story of the pot of gold and the kings desire to inspect it and the captive who bore it personally and the folly of thinking that one pot of gold could suffice to disturb the peace of the country are next adversely criticised we have already replied to the criticism p the story was well adapted to entrap james vi the improbabilities of ruthvens pleas for haste need not detain us the king did not think them probable next it was asked why did james go alone upstairs with ruthven he may have had wine enough to beget valour or as he said he may have believed that he was being followed by erskine the two reasons may well have combined why did not gowrie provide better cheer if forewarned by henderson it was asked to give the impression we reply that he was taken by surprise and that the king came uninvited and unexpected why did ruthven aim a dagger at james and then hold parley because he wanted to frighten the king into being at his will how could ruthven trust the king with the armed man alone in the turret what else could he do he locked them in and was through the failure of the man in a quandary which made clear reflection necessary and impossible it was strange that the man had not been trained in his task if oliphant is correctly reported he had been trained but fainted why bind the king with a garter in helpless pursuit of the forlorn idea of capturing him why execute the enterprise when the courtiers were passing the window ruthven could not have known that they were coming at that moment it was gowries illtimed falsehoods to the effect that the king had ridden away which brought them there gowrie had not allowed for hendersons failure how could the king struggle successfully with the stalwart master he fought for his life and ruthven probably even then did not wish to injure him bodily why was not the master made prisoner james answered this question when posed by mr bruce his blood was up and he said strike the earl likewise might after he was stricken have been preserved alive perhaps by miracle he died instantly the discrepancies as to the dagger and the opening of the window we have already treated also the locking and unlocking or leaving unlocked of the chamber door giving on the dark staircase after ruthvens last hurried entrance p there follow arguments to be later considered about the relations between james and the earl previous to the tragedy and a statement with no authority cited that james had written to gowries uncle to meet him at perth on august implying that james had made up his mind to be there and did not go on ruthvens sudden invitation the earl and cranstoun were alone with the four in the fatal chamber the others who were wounded there went up after gowries death it may be so but the bulk of the evidence is on the other side it is reported that henderson was eating an egg in the kitchen and went into the town when the fray arose it is also denied on oath by gowries cook who added that he was content to be hanged if it could be proved the ruthven apologist ms says that henderson was waiting on the lords who dined in the hall and was there when the kings servant brought the news that the king had ridden away the masters sword after his death was found rusted tight in his scabbard the master must have been a very untidy gallant no authority is cited for the story the murrays who were well rewarded were in perth whether of set purpose let the reader judge by all means let the reader judge the king knew henderson so the anonymous goodman of pitmillie said but did not recognise the man in the turret it was reported that patrick galloway the kings chaplain induced henderson to pretend to be the man in the turret as to the good man of pitmillie calderwood did not even know his name this is mere gossip again calderwood who offers these criticisms does not ask why of all concerned henderson was the only man that fled who had not been seen in connection with the fray and the tumult if he was not the man of the turret and if andrew ruthven who also had ridden to falkland did not abscond why did henderson as to the man in the turret if not a retainer of ruthven he was a minion of james or there was no man at all if there was no man at all could james be so absurd as to invent him on the off chance that somebody anybody would turn up and claim to have been the man that is frankly incredible but if james managed to insert a man into the turret he was not so silly as not to have his man ready to produce in evidence yet henderson could not be produced he had fled and certainly had not come in by august when he was proclaimed that james had introduced and suborned henderson and that henderson fled to give tone and colour to his narrative is not among the most probable of conjectures i do not find that this desperate hypothesis was put forward at the time it could not be for apologists averred that henderson was eating an egg in the kitchen that he was waiting on the gentlemen in the hall at the moment when by the desperate hypothesis he was by some machination of james in the turret there is a third myth a perth tradition that henderson had been at scone all day and first heard the tragic news when all was over as on his return he crossed the bridge over tay as it is incredible that there was no man in the turret at all and that james took the outside chance that somebody anybody would claim to be the man the assailants of the king must offer a working hypothesis of this important actor in the drama my own fancy can suggest none was he in four places at once in the kitchen in the hall on the bridge and in the turret if he was in the kitchen in the hall or on the bridge why did he instantly abscond if james put him in the turret why did he fly the kings word i repeat was the word that no man could rely on but among competing improbabilities the story which was written on the night of august and to which he adhered under bruces crossexamination is infinitely the least improbable the master of gray an abominable character not in scotland when the events occurred reported not from scotland that lennox had said that if put on his oath he could not say whether the practice proceeded from gowrie or the king sept picture falkland palace the master of gray wrote from chillingham on the english side of the border where he was playing the spy for cecil often he played the double spy for england and for rome lennox may well have been puzzled he may have said so but the report rests on the evidence of one who did not hear his words who wished to flatter the scepticism of jamess english enemies and whose character though on one point he is unjustly accused reeks with infamy that of james does not precisely smell sweet and blossom in the dust but if the question arises whether a man of jamess position age and temperament or whether a young man with the antecedents which we are about to describe was the more likely to embark on a complicated and dangerous plot in jamess case involving two murders at inestimable personal risk it is not unnatural to think that the young man is the more likely to have the wyte of it xi the king and the ruthvens having criticised the contemporary criticism of the gowrie affair we must look back and examine the nature of gowries ancestral and personal relations with james before the day of calamity there were grounds enough for hatred between the king and the earl whether such hatred existed or not in a kind of hereditary feud and in political differences as against jamess grandmother mary of guise the grandfather of gowrie lord ruthven had early joined the reformers who opposed her in arms later in it was gowries grandfather who took the leading part in the murder of riccio he fled to england and there died soon after his exploit beholding it was said a vision of angels his son gowries father also one of the riccio murderers when mary was imprisoned in loch leven june was in charge of her but was removed as he began to show great favour to her and gave her intelligence mary herself through the narrative of nau her secretary declares that ruthven then a married man persecuted her by his lust he aided lindsay in extorting her abdication at loch leven such was his record as regards mary james too had little reason to love him the early reign of james in scotland was a series of court revolutions all of the same sort james was always either unwillingly under nobles who were allies of elizabeth and who used the kirk as their instrument or under vicious favourites who delivered him from these influences when morton fell in the king was under daubigny lennox a false protestant and secret catholic intriguer and arran captain james stewart a free lance and in religion an indifferent lennox entangled james in relations with the guises and catholic powers gowrie and the protestant nobles being threatened by arran and lennox captured james in an insulting manner at gowries castle of ruthven he came as a guest for hunting he remained a prisoner the kirk approved and triumphed james waited and dissembled while gowrie was at the head of the government in june james by a sudden flight to st andrews castle where his friends surrounded him shook himself free of gowrie who however secured a pardon for his share in jamess capture in the raid of ruthven of lennox being dead the masterful and unscrupulous arran now again ruled the king and a new lennox came from france the duke of lennox who was present at the tragedy of august the lords who had lost power by jamess escape to st andrews now conspired anew angus mar and others were to march on stirling gowrie was waiting at dundee april arran knew of the plot and sent colonel stewart to arrest gowrie after holding his house against stewarts men the earl was taken and carried to edinburgh the other lords his allies failed and fled gowrie was brought to trial he had a pardon for the raid of ruthven he had done nothing ostensible in the recent rising which followed his capture at dundee nevertheless he was tried condemned executed and forfeited there exists a manuscript of the date which at least shows what gowries friends thought of the method by which his conviction was procured arran and sir robert melville it is said visited him in prison and advised him to make his peace with james how was that to be done gowrie entreated for the kind offices of melville and arran they advised him to write to the king confessing that he had been in several conspiracies against his person which he could reveal in a private interview i should confess an untruth said gowrie and frame my own indictment the letter the others urged being general would move the kings curiosity he would grant an interview at which gowrie might say that the letter was only an expedient to procure a chance of stating his own case gowrie naturally rejected so perilous a practice you must confess the foreknowledge of these things said arran or you must die gowrie replied that if assured of his life he would take the advice arran gave his word of honour that gowrie should be safe he wrote the letter he received no answer but was sent to stirling he was tried nothing was proved against him and arran produced his letter before the court gowrie was called confessed to his handwriting and told the tale of arrans treachery which he repeated to the people from the scaffold this is briefly the statement of a newsletter to england written as usual against the government and in the protestant interest a a manuscript in the british museum gives a somewhat different version b one charge against gowrie we learn was that of treasonable intercommuning with hume of godscroft an envoy of the earl of angus who before gowries arrest was arranging a conspiracy this charge was perfectly true godscroft in his history of the douglases ii describes the circumstances and mentions the very gallery whose door resisted lennox and mar on august godscroft rode from the earl of angus to gowrie in his house at perth looking very pitifully upon his gallery where we were walking at that time which he had but newly built and decored with pictures he brake out into these words having first fetched a deep sigh cousin says he is there no remedy et impius haec tam culta novalia miles habebit barbarus has segetes whereupon godscroft was persuaded of his sincerity and at his return persuaded the earl of angus thereof also so the plot went on gowrie pretending that he meant to leave the country says his accomplice godscroft while both the court and the conspirators were uncertain as to his trimming intentions he trimmed too long he was taken the plot exploded and failed gowrie was thus within the danger of the law for treasonably concealing foreknowledge of the conspiracy according to the british museum ms gowrie now told the jury that he was being accused on the strength of his own letter treacherously extorted under promise of life by montrose doune maitland melville colonel stewart and the captain of dumbarton not by arran in gowries letter of confession to the king as printed by spottiswoode he does not mention godscroft but another intriguer erskine however in this letter he certainly confesses his concern with the conspiracy but says the ms the nobles charged by gowrie with having betrayed him under promise of life denied the accusations on oath gowrie himself according to another copy of the ms denied knowing hume of godscroft if he did he spoke untruly teste godscroft however matters really stood the earls friends at all events believed that he had been most cruelly and shamefully betrayed to the death and as the king was now eighteen they would not hold him guiltless these were not the only wrongs of the ruthvens while the power of arran lasted and it was on the whole welcome to james though he had moments of revolt the family of ruthven was persecuted the widow of gowrie was a daughter see appendix a of henry stewart lord methven who as a young man had married margaret sister of henry viii widow of james iv and divorced from the earl of angus as this lady our gowries mother knelt to implore the pity of james in the street after her lords death arran pushed her aside and threw her down he received the earls forfeited estate and castle of dirleton near north berwick in october arran fell in his turn angus mar and others drove him into retirement james acquiesced his relations with the house of mar remained most friendly the house of ruthven was now restored to its lands and dignities in the new earl being james who died in early youth he was succeeded by his brother the gowrie of our tragedy who was born about he had many sisters the eldest mary married the earl of atholl a stewart in january lady gowrie was thus motherinlaw of the earl of atholl who died at gowrie house in august her granddaughter dorothea daughter of atholl and mary ruthven sister of our gowrie in married that young tullibardine who was in perth at the tragedy of august lady atholl is said to have opposed the marriage another sister of gowrie sophia married before she was dead by that time the duke of lennox who was at the slaughter of the ruthvens another sister beatrix was maid of honour to jamess queen and later married hume of cowdenknowes hence come the earls of home gowrie had two younger brothers patrick and william who fled to england from his castle of dirleton the day after the tragedy and were forfeited and persecuted by james patrick was long imprisoned in the tower the new earl john the victim of does not come into public notice till when he was elected provost of perth he went to edinburgh university his governor was the respected mr rollock here a curious fact occurs on august young gowrie read his thesis for his masters degree three weeks earlier on july the wild francis stewart earl of bothwell had captured in holyrood his king who was half dressed and untrussed james at the time was suspected of favouring the catholic earls of the north huntly errol and a new unpresbyterian angus the king was on ill terms with the kirk england had secretly abetted bothwell the clan of stewart including lennox lent aid and countenance but bothwells success was due to gowries mother the widow of the decapitated earl and to his sister lady atholl bothwell entered lady gowries house adjoining the palace spent the night there stole into holyrood by a passageway left open by lady atholl and appeared before the king sword in hand when his majesty was half dressed meanwhile our gowrie reading for his thesis may not have been uninterested in the plot of his mother and sister this was in a way the second successful ruthven plot to seize the king the first was the raid of ruthven the new success was not enduring james shook off bothwell in september and in october gowries brotherinlaw atholl with our gowrie himself entered into alliance with bothwell against king james and offered their services to queen elizabeth james moved out against atholl gowrie and the master of montrose who were at castle doune intending to join hands with bothwell and seize the king but bothwell found the plan impracticable atholl fled gowrie and the master of montrose were pursued and taken no harm was done to them their excuses were accepted but young gowrie and atholl continued to conspire in april atholl signing for himself and gowrie and bothwell signing for his associates wrote a manifesto to the kirk they were in arms they said for protestant purposes and wished commissioners from among the preachers to attend them and watch their proceedings bothwell then took action he made a demonstration in arms against edinburgh but the forces of atholl and gowrie did not arrive and bothwell retreated atholl was threatened for this affair but pardoned by the king and died in august in the same month gowrie informed the town council of perth that he was going to study abroad they retained him in the position of provost he went with his tutor mr rhynd to padua an university where protestantism was protected by the toleration of the republic of venice and where there was an angloscottish nation among the students in the return from parnassus a satirical play of we find gullio the admirer of shakespeare professing to have studied at padua gowrie is said to have been elected rector but i cannot find his name in the lists he does appear in the roll of scottish scholars some of them characterised unlike the english scholars by personal marks most have scars on the face or hand archibald douglas has a scar on the brow from left to right james lindsay of gowries year has also a scar on his brow next him is andrew keith with a scar on his right hand and then dominus ioannes ruthuen scotus cum signo albo in mento with a white mark on his chin then we have his luckless tutor mr rhynd who was tortured scotus cum ledigine super facie robert ker of newbattle kerrus de heubattel is another of gowries college companions all were students of law magic was not compulsory at padua though gowrie was said to have studied that art a concerning gowries behaviour at padua but a single circumstance is known probably through one of his fellowstudents douglas ker keith lindsay or another the report reached scotland that the young earl had left in padua a strange relique an emblematic figure emblazoned and had made on the subject a singular remark the emblematic figure represented a blackamoor reaching at a crown with a sword in a stretched posture the remark of gowrie the earls own mot was to the effect that the emblem displayed in umbra or foreshadowed what was to be done in facto this emblem was secured at padua in by sir robert douglas who had heard of it in scotland and it was sent to king james b if such ideas were in gowries mind he showed no signs of them in an early correspondence with the king in james wrote a most loving letter to gowrie the earl replied in a tone of gratitude at the same time gowrie wrote to a preacher in perth extolling the conduct of an english fanatic who had thrown down and trampled on the host at rome he hoped he said when he returned to scotland to amend whatever is amiss for lack of my presence a nevertheless on december nicholson informed cecil that gowrie had been converted to catholicism b in the venice despatches and vatican transcripts i find no corroboration gowrie appears to have visited rome the ruthven apologist declares that he was there in danger for his religion galloway on august in presence of the king and the people of edinburgh vowed that gowrie since his return from italy had laboured to make james revolt from religion at least in inward sincerity to entertain purpose with the pope and he himself promised to furnish intelligence if so gowrie was indeed a deep dissimulate hypocrite galloways informant must have been the king if gowrie did or said anything to colour the story it may have been for the purpose of discovering by pretending to approve of them these intrigues with rome of which james was constantly being accused a new complexity is added here by a list of scottish catholic nobles ready to join an invading spanish force which the earl of bothwell handed in to philip iii of spain at a date not absolutely certain at a time conjectured at by major hume as bothwell laid before the spanish ministry a scheme for an invasion of scotland he made another more elaborate proposal at a date which to all seeming was july in the appended list of scottish catholic nobles appear the names of the earl of gowrie and of baron rastellerse that is logan of restalrig but in there was no earl of gowrie the title was extinct the lands were forfeited and gowries natural heir william ruthven his brother was a poor student at cambridge could bothwell refer to him who was no catholic can he have handed in in an earlier list of without deleting the name of the dead gowrie as to gowries real creed bothwell must have known the truth through home a reluctant convert to presbyterianism who went from paris to brussels to meet bothwell leaving gowrie in paris just before home and gowrie openly and as it was said bothwell secretly returned to scotland in april was the gowrie conspiracy a bothwellian plot a we know little more about gowrie after his letters of till on august colville reports to cecil that the party of the kirk who were now without a leader among the greater nobles intend to summon home the earl b he is said to have stayed for three months at geneva with beza the famous reformer who was devoted to him he was in paris in february and march the english ambassador neville recommended gowrie to cecil as a man of whom there may be exceeding good use made elizabeth and cecil were then on the worst terms with james at paris gowrie would meet lord home who as we have said and shall prove in a later connection had an interview with the exiled bothwell still wandering plotting and threatening descents on scotland p on april gowrie was in london a he was very well received a cabinet of plate it is said was given to him by elizabeth what else passed we do not know in may gowrie returned to scotland and rode into edinburgh among a cavalcade of his friends according to sir john carey writing to cecil from berwick on may james displayed jealousy of gowrie giving him many jests and pretty taunts on his reception by elizabeth and marvelling that the ministers met him not b calderwood adds a rumour that james talking of gowries entry to edinburgh said there were more with his father when he went to the scaffold again as the earl leaned on the kings chair at breakfast james talked of dogs and hawks and made an allusion to the death of riccio in which gowries father and grandfather took part these are rumours it is certain that the king june gave gowrie a years respite from pursuit of his creditors to whom he was in debt for moneys owed to him by the crown expenditure by the late earl of gowrie when in power a it is also certain that gowrie opposed the kings demands for money in a convention of june b but so did lord president fyvie who never ceased to be jamess trusted minister and later chancellor under the title of earl of dunfermline calderwood reports that after gowries speech sir david murray said yonder is an unhappy man they are but seeking occasion of his death which now he has given this is absurd fyvie and the laird of easter wemyss opposed the king as stoutly and no harm followed to them fyvie rising steadily and he had opposed the king yet more sturdily before to the highest official position calderwood adds a silly tale of dr herries beatrix ruthven laughed at his lame leg he looked in her palm and predicted a great disaster the same anecdote with of course another subject is told of gowries own prediction that a certain man would come to be hanged which was fulfilled gowrie had been at perth before the convention at holyrood of june to perth he returned thence some time in july about the th c he went to his castle of strabran in atholl to hunt whether his brother the master remained with him continuously till the earls return to perth on saturday august i know not how to ascertain if there is anything genuine in the plotletters produced eight years later the master once or twice visited edinburgh in july but that may have been before going to strabran concerning the master a romantic story of unknown source but certainly never alluded to in the surviving gossip of the day was published late in the eighteenth century by lord hailes a report is handed down that lord gowries brother received from the queen a ribbon which she had got from the king that mr alexander went into the kings garden at falkland on a sultry hot day and lay down in a shade and fell asleep his breast being open the king passed that way and discovered part of the ribbon about his neck below his cravat upon which he made quick haste into the palace which was observed by one of the queens ladies who passed the same way she instantly took the ribbon from his neck went a near way to the queens closet where she found her majesty at her toilet whom she requested to lay the ribbon in a drawer james entered and asked to be shown the ribbon the queen produced it and james retired muttering devil tak me but like is an ill mark legend does not say when or in what year this occurred but the fancy of authors has identified the queens lady with beatrix ruthven and has added that the master in disgrace though undetected retired with gowrie to strabane or strabran history has no concern with such fables it is certain however or at least contemporary letters aver that queen anne of denmark was grieved and angered by the slaying of the gowries on october carey writing to cecil from woodrington mentions this and the tattle to the effect that as the queen is about to have a child charles i she shall be kept as prisoner ever after was the master supposed to be father of the queens child carey goes on there is a letter found with a bracelet in it sent from the queen to the earl of gowrie to persuade him to leave his country life and come to court assuring him that he should enjoy any contents that court could afford can some amorous promise underlie this as in the case of mr pickwicks letter to mrs bardell about the warmingpan this letter the king hath says carey was it with gowrie not the master that the queen was in love she was very fond of beatrix ruthven and would disbelieve in the guilt of her brothers hence these tears and that anger of the queen but james also says calderwood was as anxious as carey declares that the queen was to bring gowrie to falkland when the earl was in strabran fifteen days before the fact the king wrote sundry letters to the earl desiring him to come and hunt with him in the wood of falkland which letters were found in my lords pocket at his death as is reported but were destroyed a so james was not jealous both he and the queen were inviting gowrie to their country house the queen adding the gift of a bracelet she may have worked it herself like the bracelet which queen mary is said to have sent to bothwell all this is the idlest gossip but it is certain that on one occasion at the end of july close letters were sent from the court at edinburgh to atholl and gowrie and later to inchaffray and the master the first three are in bothwells list of catholics ready to meet the spanish invaders the fact of the letters appears from the treasurers accounts where the money paid to the boy who carried the letters is recorded without dates of the days of the month the boy got shillings scots for the journey from edinburgh to the earls of gowrie and atholl for the other two which he carried from falkland craigengelt in his deposition denies that during my lords being in strabran neither yet in perth after his coming from strabran he knew any man or page to come from court to my lord or that he commanded to give them any meat or drink b no conclusion as to jamess guilt can be drawn either from the fact that he wrote to atholl inchaffray the master and gowrie at the end of july or from the circumstance that craigengelt professed to know nothing about any messenger james might write to ask the earl to hunt we cannot guess what he had to say at the same time to atholl or inchaffray or the master he may even have written about the affair of the abbey of scone if it is true that the master wished to get it from his brother we really cannot infer that as the ruthvens would not come and be killed when invited at falkland james went to kill them at perth even if he summoned the master for august intending to make it appear that the master had asked him to come to perth the master need not have arrived before seven in the morning when the king went and hunted for four hours what conceivable reason had the master if innocent for leaving perth at am and visiting his sovereign at seven in the morning as to the coming of the gowries to perth from strabran or strabane before the tragedy we only know what craigengelt stated his language is not lucid depones that my lords being in strabrand alexander ruthven a kinsman came from dunkeld to my lord and that upon friday august my lord commanded captain ruthven to ride and tell my lady gowries mother that he was to come and captain ruthven met my lord at the ferryboat and rode back to dunkeld with my lord where he gowrie having supped returned to his bed at trochene the deponer being in his company where at the end of july was lady gowrie was she within a days ride of her sons was she at perth we know that she was at dirleton castle near north berwick on august had she left the neighbourhood of perth between the st and th of august captain ruthven seems to have ridden to lady gowrie and back again to dunkeld with gowrie if so and i can make no other sense of it she was in perthshire on august and went at once to dirleton did she keep out of the way of the performances of august it is curious that no apologist for gowrie as far as i have observed makes any remark on this perplexing affair of my lady we know that she had once already set a successful trap for the king he had not punished her he took two of her daughters barbara and beatrix into his household and restored to gowrie his inheritance of the lands of scone which as we know had been held by his father he had written a loving letter to gowrie at padua after the young man had for many months been conspiring against him with his most dangerous enemy the wild earl of bothwell on the morning of the fatal august gowrie went to sermon what else he did we learn from john moncrieff who was the earls cautioner or guarantee for a large sum due by him to one robert jolly he was also brother of hew moncrieff who fled after having been with gowrie in arms against herries ramsay and erskine both moncrieffs says john were puzzled when they found that the master had ridden from perth so early in the morning gowrie says moncrieff did not attend the town council meeting after church he excused himself on account of private affairs he also sent away george hay who was with him on business when henderson arrived from falkland saying that he had other engagements for the same reason he at first declined to do a piece of business with moncrieff who dined with him and two other gentlemen he made him to misknow all things that is affected to take no notice when andrew ruthven came in and rounded to him whispered to him about the kings approach then the master entered and gowrie went out to meet the king the rest we know as far as evidence exists picture queen anne of denmark we now have all the essential facts which rest on fairly good evidence and we ask did the ruthvens lay a plot for the king or did the king weave a web to catch the ruthvens looking first at character and probable motives we dismiss the gossip about the amorous queen and the jealous king the tatlers did not know whether to select gowrie or the master as the object of the queens passion or whether to allege that she had a polyandrous affection for both at once the letters of the age hint at no such amour till after the tragedy when tales of the liaison of anne of denmark with the elder or younger ruthven or both arose as a myth to account for the events the queen no doubt was deeply grieved in a womanly way for the sake of her two maidens beatrix and barbara ruthven her majesty also in a womanly way had a running feud with mar and the whole house of erskine to mar certainly one of the few men of honour as well as of rank in scotland james had entrusted his son prince henry the care of the heir to the crown was a kind of hereditary charge of the erskines the queen had already in her resentment at not having the custody of her son engaged in one dangerous plot against mar she made another quarrel on this point at the time when the king succeeded to the crown of england now mar was present at the gowrie tragedy and his cousin sir thomas erskine took part in the deeds hating the erskines devoted to the ruthven ladies and always feebly in opposition to her husband the queen no doubt paraded her grief her scepticism and her resentment this was quite in keeping with her character and this conduct lent colour to the myth that she loved gowrie or the master or both par amours the subject is good for a ballad or a novel but history has nothing to make with the legend on which mr g p r james based a romance and mr pinkerton a theory leaving fable for fact what motives had james for killing both the ruthvens he had dropped the hereditary feud and had taken no measures against the young earl to punish his conspiracies with bothwell in of gowrie on his return to scotland in may he may have entertained some jealousy the earl had been for months in paris caressed by the english ambassador and probably as we have seen in touch with the exiled and ceaselessly conspiring bothwell in london the earl had been well received by elizabeth and by lord willoughby who a year earlier as governor of berwick had insulted james by kidnapping close to edinburgh an english gentleman ashfield on a visit to the kings court guevara a cousin of lord willoughby lured ashfield into the coach of the english envoy bowes and drove him to the frontier lord willoughby had a swift yacht lying off leith in case it was thought better to abduct ashfield by sea this is an example of english insolence to the scottish king also of english kidnapping and lord willoughby the manager had made friends with gowrie in england thus james who was then on the worst terms short of open war with england may have suspected and disliked the earl who had once already put himself at the service of elizabeth and might do so again in the april of rumours of a conspiracy by archibald douglas the infamous traitor douglas of spot one of mortons brood and john colville who with bothwell and later independently had caught james had tried to catch him and proposed to essex to catch him again were afloat colville was in paris at the same time as gowrie bothwell was reported to have come secretly to scotland in april or may and this combination of facts or rumours may have aroused the kings mistrust again the kirk was restive the preachers in need of a leader were said by colville to have summoned gowrie home a moreover there were persons about james for example colonel stewart who had reason to dread the earls vengeance for his father the ruthven apologist mentions this fact and the predilection of the kirk for gowrie among the motives for destroying him once more there are hints very vague that in bothwell aimed at changing the dynasty b the fable that gowrie was a maternal grandson of margaret tudor widow of james iv by henry stewart lord methven her third husband and that gowrie was thus a candidate for the succession to the english throne perhaps also for the hand of arabella stuart may conceivably have existed compare appendix a again gowrie had sided with the burgesses and minor barons as against the nobles by refusing a grant of money to james in the convention of june and james owed money to gowrie as he did to most people but we have already seen that an exemption had been granted to gowrie for a year from pursuit of creditors as far that is as regarded his fathers debts l scots june the college of justice refused to grant any new legal summonses of creditors against gowrie and suspended all that were extant mr barbe accuses the king of utter and unblushing disregard for common truth and common honesty be this as it may the exemption granted to gowrie was not regarded by his fathers creditors as extending to his mother after his dishonoured death on november lady gowrie implored elphinstone the secretary to bring her suit for relief before the king the security for these debts was on her conjunct fee lands and creditors because i suppose the gowrie estates were about to be forfeited pressed lady gowrie who of course had no exemption we know nothing as to the success of lady gowries petition but we have seen that her daughters married very well i presume that gowrie not his mother had previously paid interest on the debts he had already paid many sums of money james had already restored to gowrie the valuable lands of scone however taking things as the kings adversaries regard them the cumulative effect of these several grudges and of the mystery of gowries catholicism would urge james to lay his very subtle plot he would secretly call young ruthven to falkland by six in the morning of august he would make it appear that ruthven had invited him to perth he would lure the youth to a turret managing to be locked in with him and an armed man he would post ramsay below the turret window and warn him to run up the dark staircase at the kings cry of treason by the locked door he would exclude lennox and mar while his minions would first delay gowries approach by the narrow stairs and then permit him to enter with only one companion cranstoun he would cause a report of his own departure to be circulated exactly at the right moment to bring gowrie under the turret window and within reach of his cries this plot requires the minutest punctuality everything must occur at the right moment and all would have been defeated had gowrie told the truth about the kings departure or even asked where is the kings horse or gowrie might have stood in the streets of perth and summoned his burgesses in arms the king and the courtiers with their dead man would have been beleaguered without provisions in gowries house was james the man on the strength of the grudges which we have carefully enumerated to risk himself unarmed in this situation as to how he managed to have the door locked so as to exclude the majority of his suite who can conjecture how again did he induce gowrie to aver and that after making inquiry that he had ridden homewards i cannot believe that any sane man or monarch from the motives specified would or could have laid and that successfully the plot attributed to the king turning to gowrie we find that his grudges against james may have been deep and many if revengeful he had the treacherous method of his fathers conviction and the insults to his mother to punish for a boy of seventeen he had already attempted a good deal in his mother had set him an example of kingcatching and it looks as if his mother had been near him in perth while he was at strabane if ambitious and devoted to elizabeth and england as he had been gowrie had motives for a new raid of ruthven the unceasing desire of the english government he might if successful head a new administration resting on the support of england and the kirk such a change was due in the natural course of things or quite the reverse if a secret catholic he might hand the king over to bothwell thus gowrie may well have wished to revenge his father his mother had once already helped to betray james to an attack of the most insulting nature he himself was strong for the kirk over which james was playing the despot or he desired toleration for catholics he had been well received in england where all such plots their name was legion had always been fostered he was very young and he risked everything only his method was new that of strict secrecy he had previously spoken to mr cowper minister of perth in a general way about the failure of plots for lack of deep secrecy and through the admission of too many confederates cowper told this to spottiswoode at falkland mr rhynd gowries tutor told cowper and the comptroller unrequired not under torture nor in answer to a question under examination that gowrie when abroad several times said that he was not a wise man that having the execution of a high and dangerous purpose communicated the same to any but himself as to this secrecy we must remember that gowrie was very young that in italy he may have heard or read of romantic and crafty plots and may long have dreamed as robert oliphants reported allegation declared of some such scheme as that in which he failed we must remember too that jamess own account at least suggests a plan quite feasible to bring james to gowrie house early in the day when the townsmen were at kirk to bring him with only three or four attendants then to isolate him and carry him off was far from impossible they might hurry him disguised to dirleton a castle garrisoned and provisioned according to carey who reports the version of gowries friends a scottish judge gibson the ancestor of sir thomas gibsoncarmichael was later carried from leith sands across the border with perfect success a fault of the plan was that once undertaken it could not be dropped even though james came late and well attended ruthven could not tell the king that his story about a captive and a pot of gold was false to do that would have subjected him to a charge of treason he could have only one motive for thus deceiving his majesty thus the plot had to go on even under circumstances very unfavourable there was no place for repentance thus considered the conspiracy looks like the plot of a romance not without meritorious points but painfully amateurish as proof of gowries guilt the evidence i think distinctly proves that he intentionally concealed from those about him the ride of his brother henderson and andrew ruthven to perth that he concealed his knowledge derived from henderson of the kings approach and that ruthven concealed from craigengelt on his return his long ride to falkland saying that he had been on an errand not far off moncrieff swore that henderson gave him a similar answer asked by moncrieff where he had been he said he had been two or three miles above the town henderson corroborated moncrieffs evidence on this point there can have been no innocent motive for all this secrecy it would have been natural for gowrie to order luncheon for the king to be prepared as soon as henderson arrived finally the earls assertions that james had ridden away assertions repeated after he had gone upstairs to inquire and make sure are absolutely incompatible with innocence they could have only one motive to induce the courtiers to ride off and leave the king in his hands what was to happen next who can guess at the plot of such a plotter it is perhaps least improbable that the king was to be conveyed secretly by sea or across fife to dirleton in the first place gowrie may have had an understanding with guevara at berwick james himself told nicholson that a large english ship had hovered off the coast refusing communication with the shore bothwell again now desperate may have lately been nearer home than was known finally fastcastle the isolated eyrie on its perpendicular rock above the northern sea may have been at gowries disposal i am disinclined to conjecture being only certain that a young man with gowries past italianate and of dubious religion was more apt to form a wild and daring plot than was his canny senior the king of scots but that a plot of some kind gowrie had laid i am convinced by his secrecy and by his falsehoods as to the kings departure among the traps for the king contrived by bothwell and colville and reported by colville to his english paymasters were schemes quite as wild as that which gowrie probably entertained the king once in the pious hands of so godly a man as gowrie the party of the kirk or the party of the church would have come in and made themselves useful xii logan of restalrig we now arrive at an extraordinary sequel of the gowrie mystery a sequel in which some critics have seen final and documentary proof of the guilt of the ruthvens others have remarked only a squalid intrigue whereby jamess ministers threw additional disgrace on their master that they succeeded in disgracing themselves we shall make only too apparent but if the evidence which they handled proves nothing against the ruthvens it does not on that account invalidate the inferences which we have drawn as to their conspiracy we come to the story of the laird and the country writer that we may know the laird better a brief description of his home may be introduced within a mile and a half of the east end of princes street edinburgh lies on the left of the railway to the south a squalid suburb you drive or walk on a dirty road northeastwards through unambitious shops factories tall chimneys flaming advertisements and houses for artisans the road climbs a hill and you begin to find on each side of you walls of ancient construction and traces of great old doorways now condemned on the left are ploughed fields and even clumps of trees with blackened trunks grimy are the stacks of corn in the farmyard to the left at the crest of the hill on the right a gateway gives on a short avenue which leads to a substantial modern house having reached this point in my pilgrimage i met a gentleman who occupies the house and asked if i might be permitted to view the site the other with much courtesy took me up to the house of which only the portion in view from the road was modern facing the west all was of the old scottish chateau style with gables narrow windows and a strange bulky chimney on the north bulging out of the wall the west side of the house stood on the very brink of a steep precipice beneath which lay what is now but a large deep waterhole but at the period of the gowrie conspiracy was a loch fringed with water weeds and a haunt of wild fowl by this loch restalrig loch the witch more than three centuries ago met the ghost of tam reid who fell in pinkie fight and by the ghost was initiated into the magic which brought her to the stake i scrambled over a low wall with a deep drop and descended the cliff so as to get a view of the ancient chateau that faces the setting sun beyond the loch was a muddy field then rows on rows of ugly advertisements then lines of smoky dwarf houses and above these clear against a sky of march was the leonine profile of arthurs seat steam rose and trailed from the shrieking southward trains between the loch and the mountain old and new were oddly met for the chateau was the home of an ancient race the logans of restalrig ancestors of that last laird with whom our story has to do their rich lands stretched far and wide their huge dovecot stands sturdy as a little pyramid in a field to the north towards the firth they had privileges over leith harbour which must have been very valuable they were of royal descent through a marriage of a logan with a daughter of robert

and to be named by barbour for a deed and a death so chivalrous is honour enough picture restalrig house picture restalrig village the logans flourished in their eyrie above the loch of restalrig and intermarried with the best houses sinclairs ogilvys homes and ramsays of dalhousie it may be that some of them sleep under the muddy floor of st triduanas chapel in the village of restalrig at the foot of the hill on the eastern side of their old chateau this village surrounded by factories is apparently just what it used to be in the days of james vi the low thickwalled houses with forestairs retain their ancient highpitched redtiled roofs with dormer windows and turn their tall narrow gables to the irregular street a mile frae embro town you find yourself going back three hundred years in time on the right hand of the road walking eastward what looks like a huge green mound is visible above a high ancient wall this is all that is left of st triduanas chapel and she was a saint who came from achaia with st regulus the mythical founder of st andrews she died at restalrig on october and may have converted the celts who then dwelt in a crannog in the loch at all events we hear that in a very dry summer the timbers of a crannog were found in the sandy deposit of the lake margin the chapel or chapterhouse very dirty and disgracefully neglected has probably a crypt under it and certainly possesses a beautiful groined roof springing from a single short pillar in the centre the windows are blocked up with stones the exterior is a mere mound of grass like a sepulchral tumulus on the floor lies broken the gravestone of a lady restalrig who died in outside is a patchedup church the general assembly of decreed that the church should be destroyed as a monument of idolatry it was a collegiate church with a dean and prebendaries and in the wrought stones were used to build a new gate inside the netherbow port the whole edifice was not destroyed but was patched up in into a presbyterian place of worship this old village and kirk made up restalrig town a place occupied by the english during the siege of leith in so much of history may be found in this odd corner where the sexton of the kirk speaks to the visitor about the great logan meaning that laird who now comes into the sequel of the gowrie mystery for some thirty years before the date of which we are speaking a robert logan had been laird of restalrig and of the estate of flemington in berwickshire where his residence was the house of gunnisgreen near eyemouth on the berwickshire coast he must have been a young boy when in the english forces besieging leith then held by the french for mary of guise pitched their camp at restalrig in kirkcaldy of grange and maitland of lethington gallantly held the last strength of the captive mary stuart the castle of edinburgh the fortress was to fall under the guns of the english allies of that earl of gowrie then lord ruthven who was the father of the gowrie of our mystery on april a compact was made between lord ruthven and drury the english general one provision was the rest do not here concern us that alexander lord home lethington and robert logan of restalrig if captured shall be reserved to be justified by the laws of scotland which means hanged by the neck but neither on that nor on any other occasion was our logan hanged he somehow escaped death and forfeiture when kirkcaldy was gibbeted after the fall of the castle in we find him with lord lindsay and mowbray of barnbogle now dalmeny surety for queen marys halfbrother the lord robert stewart who vainly warned darnley to escape from kirk o field lord robert was then confined by the regent morton in linlithgow and logan with the rest was surety in l that he would not attempt to escape later logan was again surety that lord robert would return after visiting his dominions the orkney islands logan though something of a pirate was clearly a man of substance and of a good house which he strengthened by alliances one of his wives elizabeth macgill was the daughter of the laird of cranstoun riddell and one of her family was a member of the privy council from elizabeth logan was divorced she was apparently the mother of his eldest son robert by the marriage of an ancestor of logans with an heiress of the family of hume he acquired the fortress and lands of fastcastle near st abbs on the berwickshire coast the castle now in ruins is the model of wolfscrag in the bride of lammermoor standing on the actual verge of a perpendicular cliff above the sea whence it is said to have been approached by a staircase cut in the living rock it was all but inaccessible and was strongly fortified though commanded by the still higher cliff to the south under which it nestled on its narrow plateau of rock fastcastle was then practically impregnable and twenty men could have held it against all scotland around it was and is a roadless waste of bent and dune from which it was severed by a narrow rib of rock jutting seawards the ridge being cut by a cavity which was spanned by a drawbridge master of this inaccessible eyrie logan was most serviceable to the plotters of these troubled times his religion was doubtful his phraseology could glide into presbyterian cant but we know that he indifferently lent the shelter of his fastness to the protestant firebrand wild frank stewart earl of bothwell who like carey writing from berwick to cecil reckons logan among catholics or to george ker the catholic intriguer with spain logan loved a plot for its own sake as well as for chances of booty and promotion he was a hard drinker and associate of rough yeomen and lairds like ninian chirnside of whitsumlaws bothwells emissary to the wizard richard graham yet a man of ancient family and high connections he seems to have been intimate with the family of sir john cranstoun of cranstoun on one occasion he informs archibald douglas the detested and infamous murderer and deeply dyed traitor that john of cranstoun is the one man now that bears you best good will january picture fastcastle circ in january the year of the gowrie plot we find sir john cranstoun in trouble for harbouring an outlawed mr thomas cranstoun who was with douglas the laird of spot one of bothwells allies in all his most desperate raids on the person of king james in mr thomas cranstoun was forfeited he was informed against for new conspiracies against his majestys life and estate and in january sir john cranstoun was sheltering this dangerous and desperate bothwellian outlaw as was his sonin law mr william cranstoun a now the mr thomas cranstoun who was hanged for his part in the gowrie affair was brother of sir john cranstoun of cranstoun the ally of that other mr thomas cranstoun who was so deep in bothwells wild raids on the kings person in the spring of as we have said but must here repeat there were reports that bothwell had secretly returned to scotland and on april just before the date of gowries arrival in edinburgh from london nicholson reports suspected plots of archibald douglas of john colville a ruined bothwellian and a spy and of the laird of spot b this colville had recently hinted to essex that he could do a serviceable enterprise as for the service i mean to do if matters go to the worst it shall be such god willing if i lose not my life in doing thereof as no other can do with a million of gold and yet i shall not exceed the bonds of humanity that is he will not murder the king but for conscience sake and worldly honesty i must first be absolved of my natural allegiance april again october the point for us to mark is that all these conspirators and violent men bothwell in exile or secretly in scotland colville in an exile in paris the laird of spot the cranstouns the infamous archibald douglas with richard douglas his nephew and logan of restalrig were united if not by real friendship at least as thucydides says by partnership in desperate enterprises and by were active in a subterranean way if it is fair to say noscitur a sociis a man is known by the company he keeps logan of restalrig bears the mark of the secret conspirator he had relations with persons more distinguished than his chirnsides and whittingham douglases though they were of near kin to the earl of morton his mother a daughter of lord gray married lord home after the death of logans father the laird of restalrig was thus a halfbrother of the new lord home a warden of the border and also was first cousin of the beautiful accomplished and infamous master of gray the double spy of england and of rome logan too like the master had diplomatic ambitions in july we find him corresponding with the infamous archibald douglas one of darnleys murderers whom james had sent in the crisis of his mothers fate as his ambassador to elizabeth in logan with two other logans was on the packed jury which acquitted douglas of darnleys murder logan was a retainer of bothwell that meteorlike adventurer and kingcatcher and he asks douglas to try to procure him employment of course as a spy from walsingham the english statesman in october of the same year we find the master of gray writing to douglas thus of late i was forced at restalrigs suit to pawn some of my plate and the best jewel i had to get him money for his marriage his second marriage apparently by december we find logan riding to london as part of the suite of the master of gray who was to plead with elizabeth for marys life he was the masters most intimate confidant and as such in februarymarch proposed to sell all his secrets to walsingham nevertheless when gray was driven into exile later in logan was one of his cautioners or sureties he had been of the party of gowries father during that noblemans brief tenure of power in and when gowrie fell logan was ordered to hand his eyrie of fastcastle over at six hours notice to the officers of the king through the stormy years of bothwells repeated raids on james logan had been his partisan and had been denounced a rebel later he appears in trouble for highway robbery committed by his retainers among the diversions of this country gentleman was flat burglary in december when nichts are lang and mirk the laird helped himself to the platechest of william nesbit of newton under silence of night he took spuilzie of certain gold and silver to the value of three thousand merks scots the executors of nesbit did not bring their action till after logan died in july in respect the said clandestine deed and fact came not to our knowledge nor light as to who had committed the same till just before the action was brought in when conspiracies were in the air logan was bound over not to put fastcastle in the hands of his majestys enemies and rebels this brief sketch of a turbulent life is derived from logans own letters to archibald douglas now among the cecil papers at hatfield from the papers relating to the master of gray in which we find logan under a cypher name betraying the master his cousin and ally and from the register of the privy council of scotland in which all that dead world from the king to the crofter may be traced often in circumstances peculiarly private at that time civil processes of horning putting to the horn or outlawry were the common resort of creditors against procrastinating debtors many of the most respectable persons gentlemen and ladies appear in these suits robert abercromby sues a lady of rank for l scots he is the burgess of edinburgh the kings saddler who as the master of ruthven told craigengelt had brought the king from falkland to perth to take order for his debt now the singular thing is that we never find logan of restalrig recorded as under horning for debt whereas considering his character we might expect him never to be free from the horn on the other hand we know him to have been a lender not a borrower he was sui profusus on january cecil had been making inquiries as to logan from lord willoughby commanding at berwick cecil always had his eyes on border scots likely to be useful in troubling king james willoughby replies there is sutch a laird of lesterigge as you write of a vain lose man a greate favourer of thefes reputed yet a man of a good clan as they here tearme it and a gud felow such was logan of restalrig old rugged and dangerous in may we find him appearing as surety for philip mowbray one of the mowbrays of barnbogle whose sister stood by queen mary at the scaffold and whose brother francis was with the bold buccleuch when he swam that wan water of esk and rescued kinmont willie from carlisle castle this francis mowbray and his brother philip were mixed up with cecil in some inscrutable spywork and intrigues for the murder of king james the mowbrays were old friends of logan they had been engaged in privateering enterprises together but could produce no letters of marque in francis mowbray abandoned and extradited by cecil was killed in an attempt to escape from edinburgh castle he had been accused by an italian fencingmaster of a conspiracy to kill james cecil had of course by this time made peace and alliance with james who was on the point of ascending the english throne and he gave up francis mowbray challenged the italian fencingmaster to judicial combat the italian came down to fight him the lists were actually pitched at holyrood when january francis preferred to try the chance of flight the rope of knotted sheet to which he trusted broke and he was dashed to pieces on the castle rocks a since mowbray had been corresponding with logans friend archibald douglas and offering his services to cecil to cecil in september he was again applying regarding elizabeth as his debtor in he was in touch with henry locke who had been cecils gobetween in his darkest intrigues against james and his agent with bothwell atholl and the gowrie slain on august but in the autumn of cecil had become the secret ally of james and gave up poor francis a broken tool of his and of elizabeths b we have now learned a good deal about logans habitual associates and we have merely glanced at a few of the numberless plots against james which were encouraged by the english government if james was nervously apprehensive of treason he had good cause but of logan at the moment of the gowrie plot we know nothing from public documents we do know however on evidence which has previously been in part unpublished in part unobserved that from august onwards logan was oddly excited and restless though not in debt or at least though no record of his horning exists he took to selling his lands restalrig flemington gunnisgreen fastcastle after he sold them all he wallowed in drink he made his wife wretched with his eldest son he was on ill terms he wandered to london and to france in and he returned to die of plague it seems in the canongate a landless but a monied man in july why did logan sell all his lands investing in shipping property the natural inference at the time was that he had been engaged in some ill turn some mysterious conspiracy and people probably certainly if we believe the evidence to follow thought that he had been an accomplice in the gowrie affair he died and his children by his first wives dissociated themselves from his executorship the bulk of it was the unpaid part of the purchase money for his lands sold by him to balmerino and dunbar jamess trusted ministers who owed some marks to the estate logan had a doer or law agent a country writer or notary named sprot who dwelt at eyemouth a hungry creature who did not even own a horse when logan rode to edinburgh sprot walked thither to join him yet the two were boon companions sprot was always loitering and watching at gunnisgreen always a guest at the great christmas festivals given by the laird to his rough neighbours the death of logan was a disaster to sprot and to all the parasites of the laird logan died we saw in july in april sprot was arrested by a legal official named watty doig he had been blabbing in his cups it is said about the gowrie affair certainly most compromising documents apparently in logans hand and with his signature were found on sprots person they still bear the worn softened look of papers carried for long in the pockets sprot was examined and confessed that he knew beforehand of the gowrie conspiracy and that the documents in his possession were written by logan to gowrie and other plotters he was tortured and in part recanted logan he said had not written the guilty letters he himself had forged them this was all before july while mr robert oliphant lay in prison in london on the same charge of guilty foreknowledge early in july the earl of dunbar came from london to edinburgh to deal with the affairs of the kirk he took sprot out of his dungeon gave him a more wholesome chamber secluded him from gentlemen who came and threatened him or so he said if he made revelations and dunbar provided him with medical attendance the wounds inflicted in the boot were healed for six weeks sprot was frequently examined before members of the privy council and others without torture what he said the public did not know nor till now have historians been better informed throughout after july he persisted in declaring logans complicity in the gowrie conspiracy and his own foreknowledge he was tried solely on the evidence of guilty foreknowledge alleged in his own confessions and of extracts given by him from memory only of a letter from gowrie to logan not one of those which he claimed to have forged and another of logan to gowrie both of july on august sprot was hanged at edinburgh he repeated his confession of guilt from every corner of the scaffold he uttered a long religious speech of contrition once he said he had been nearly drowned but god preserved him for this great day of confession and repentance but no unbeliever in the guilt of gowrie says calderwood was one whit the more convinced of course not nor would the death of henderson which they clamoured for have convinced them they said falsely that sprot was really condemned as a forger and having to die took oath to his guilt in the gowrie conspiracy in consideration of promises of help to his wife and family nearly a year later in june the exhumed remains of logan were brought into court a regular practice in the case of dead traitors and were tried for treason five letters by logan of july were now produced three were from logan to conspirators unnamed and unknown one was to a retainer and messenger of his laird bower who had died in january these letters were declared by several honourable witnesses to be in logans very unusual handwriting and orthography they were compared with many genuine letters of his and no difference was found the parliamentary committee the lords of the articles previously sceptical were convinced by the five letters the evidence to handwriting the energy of the earl of dunbar and the eloquence of the kings advocate logans children were all forfeited and dunbar saved the money which he owed to logans estate this trial is not alluded to either by calderwood or archbishop spottiswoode in their histories the five letters produced in the trial of logan exist and have been accepted as authentic by mr tytler and mr hill burton but not by writers who favour the ruthvens we print all five letters in appendix c meanwhile what had sprot really said under private examination between july and august when he was executed this question is to be answered from the hitherto unpublished records in the following chapters but in common charity the reader must be warned that the exposition is inevitably puzzling and complex sprot under examination lied often lied variously and perhaps lied to the last moreover much indeed everything depends here on exact dates and sprots are loose as was natural in the circumstances the events of which he spoke being so remote in time consequently the results of criticism of his confession may here be stated with brevity the persevering student the reader interested in odd pictures of domestic life and in strange human characters may read on at his own peril but the actual grains of fact extracted from tons of falsehood may be set down in very few words the genuine and hitherto unknown confessions of sprot add no absolute certainty as to the existence of a gowrie conspiracy his words when uncorroborated can have no weight with a jury he confessed that all the alleged logan papers which up to two days before his death were in possession of the privy council were forgeries by himself but on august he announced that he had possessed one genuine letter of logan to gowrie dated july that letter our letter iv or a forged copy was then found in his repositories expert evidence however decides that this document like all the others is in a specious imitation of logans hand but that it has other characteristics of sprots own hand and was penned by sprot himself why he kept it back so long why he declared that it alone was genuine we do not know that it is genuine in substance and was copied by sprot from a real letter of logans in an imitation of logans hand and that if so it proves logans accession to the conspiracy is my own private opinion but that opinion is based on mere literary considerations on what is called internal evidence and is therefore purely a matter of subjective impression like ones idea of the possible share of shakespeare in a play mainly by fletcher or another evidence of this kind is not historical evidence it follows that the whole affair of sprot and of the alleged logan letters adds nothing certain to the reasons for believing that there was a gowrie conspiracy as far as sprot and his documents are concerned we know that all as they stand are pure fictitious counterfeits by that unhappy man while as to whether one letter iv and perhaps another i are genuine in substance every reader must form his own opinion on literary grounds and no opinion is of much value such is a brief summary of the facts but the tenacious inquirer who can follow us through the tangled mazes of sprots private confessions will perhaps agree with me that they contain distinguishable grains of fact raising a strong surmise that logan was really involved with gowrie in a plot yet this again is a subjective impression which may vary with each reader xiii the secrets of sprot the final and deepest mystery of the mysterious gowrie affair rises like a mist from a marsh out of these facts concerning sprot when he was convicted and hanged persisting in his confessions on august no letters by gowrie or any other conspirator were produced in court extracts however of a letter from gowrie to logan and of one from logan to gowrie were quoted in sprots formal indictment they were also quoted in an official publication an account of sprots case prepared by sir william hart the chief justice and issued in both these documents to which we return are given by mr pitcairn in the second volume of his criminal trials but later when the dead logan was tried in five of his alleged plot letters never publicly mentioned in sprots trial were produced by the prosecution and not one of these was identical with the letter of logan cited in the indictment of sprot and in the official account of his trial there were strong resemblances between logans letter quoted but not produced in and a letter of logans produced and attested to be in his handwriting in but there were also remarkable variations of these undeniable facts most modern historians who were convinced of the guilt of the ruthvens take no notice though the inexplicable discrepancies between the logan letters quoted in and the letters produced as his in had always been matters of comment and criticism as to the letters of mr tytler wrote their import cannot be mistaken their authenticity has never been questioned they still exist now assuredly the letters exist the five alleged originals were found by mr pitcairn among the warrants of parliament in the general register house in edinburgh and were published by him but without their endorsements in his criminal trials in scotland copies of the letters are also bookit or engrossed in the records of parliament these bookit transcripts were made carelessly and the old copyist was puzzled by the handwriting and orthography of the alleged originals before him the controversy about the genuineness of the five letters took new shapes after mr pitcairn discovered those apparently in logans hand and printed them in mr hill burton accepts them with no hint of doubt and if mr tytler was the most learned and impartial mr hill burton was the most sceptical of our historians yet on this point of authenticity these historians were too hasty the authenticity of the letters except one no iv was denied by the very man sprot in whose possession most of them were originally found the evidence of his denial has been extant ever since calderwood wrote who tells us clearly on the authority of an older and anonymous history in ms now in the advocates library that sprot when first taken april accused logan of writing the letters but withdrew the charge under torture and finally when kindly treated by lord dunbar and healed of his wounds declared that he himself had forged all the logan letters save one yet logan was to sprots certain knowledge so sprot persistently declared involved in the gowrie conspiracy now assuredly this appeared to be an incredible assertion of calderwood or of his ms source he was a stern presbyterian an enemy of the king who banished him and an intimate friend of the cranstoun family who in were closely connected with conspirators of their name thus prejudiced calderwood was believed by mr pitcairn to have made an untrue or confused statement logan is in a plot sprot knows it and yet sprot forges letters to prove logans guilt and these letters found in sprots possession prove his own guilty knowledge there seems no sense in such behaviour it might have been guessed that sprot knew of logans guilt but had no documentary evidence of it and therefore forged evidence for the purpose of extorting blackmail from logan but by when sprot was arrested with some of the documents in his pocket logan had been dead for nearly two years the guess that sprot knew of logans treason but forged the proof of it for purposes of blackmailing him was not made by historians the guess was getting warm as children say in their game was very near the truth but it was not put forward by criticism historians in fact knew that logan would not have stood an attempt at extortion he was not that kind of man in he made a contract with napier of merchistoun the inventor of logarithms tradition declared that there was a hoard of gold in the place of fastcastle napier was to discover it probably by the divining rod and logan was to give him a third of the profits but napier knowing his man inserted a clause in the deed to the effect that after finding the gold he was to be allowed a free exit from fastcastle whether he found the hoard or not we do not know but two years later in letting a portion of his property napier introduced the condition that his tenant should never sublet it to any person of the name of logan if he found the gold he probably was not allowed to carry off his third share logan being a resolute character of this kind sprot a cowering creature would not forge letters to blackmail him he would have been invited to dine at fastcastle the cliffs are steep the sea is deep and tells no tales thus where was sprots motive for forging letters in logans hand and incriminating the laird of restalrig and for carrying them about in his pocket in but where was his motive for confessing when taken and examined that he did forge the letters if his confession was untrue while swearing to his certain destruction that he had a guilty foreknowledge of the gowrie conspiracy he might conciliate government and get pardoned as kings evidence by producing what he called genuine logan letters and thus proving the conspiracy and clearing the kings character but this he did not do he swore to the last that logan and he were both guilty so calderwoods authority rightly reported but that the plot letters were forged by himself to what end calderwood did not say all this appeared midsummer madness calderwood it was argued must be in error a theory was suggested that sprot really knew nothing of the gowrie mystery that he had bragged falsely of his knowledge in his cups that the government pounced on him made him forge the letters of logan to clear the kings character by proving a conspiracy and then hanged him still confessing his guilt but mr mark napier a learned antiquary replied in a long appendix to the third volume of the history by the contemporary spottiswoode to this not very probable conjecture by showing that when they tried sprot government produced no letters at all only an alleged account by sprot of two letters unproduced therefore in august mr napier argued government had no letters if they had possessed them they would infallibly have produced them that seemed sound reasoning in government had no plot letters therefore the five produced in the trial of the dead logan were forged for the government by somebody between august and june mr napier refused to accept calderwoods wild tale that sprot while confessing logans guilt and his own also confessed to having forged logans letters yet calderwoods version or rather that of his anonymous authority in ms was literally accurate sprot in private examinations july august confessed to having forged all the letters but one the important one letter iv logan to gowrie this confession the government burked the actual circumstances have remained unknown and are only to be found in the official but suppressed reports of sprots private examinations now in the muniment room of the earl of haddington these papers enable us partly to unravel a coil which without them no ingenuity could disentangle sir thomas hamilton the kings advocate popularly styled tam o the cowgate from his house in that old street of palaces was the ancestor of lord haddington who inherits his papers sir thomas was an eminent financier lawyer statesman and historical collector and inquirer who later became lord binning and finally earl of haddington as kings advocate he held and preserved the depositions letters and other documents used in the private examinations of sprot on and after july the records of sprots examinations between april and july are not known to be extant sir thomass collection consists of summonses or drafts of summonses for treason against the dead logan there is also a holograph letter of confession july from sprot to the earl of dunbar there are the records of the private examinations of sprot july august and of other persons whom he more or less implicated there are copies by sprot in his course that is current handwriting of two of the five letters in logans hand or in an imitation of it these are letters i and iv produced at the posthumous trial of logan in june finally there are letters in logans hand or in an imitation of it addressed to james bower and to one ninian chirnside with allusions to the plot and there is a long memorandum of matters of business also containing hints about the conspiracy in logans hand or in an imitation thereof addressed to john bell and james bower of these compromising papers one a letter to chirnside was found by the rev mr anderson in torn into thirteen pieces whereof one is missing wrapped up in a sheet of foolscap of the period mr anderson has placed the pieces together and copied the letter of all these documents only five letters those published by mr pitcairn were libelled or founded on and produced by the government in the posthumous trial of logan not one was produced before the jury who tried sprot on august he was condemned we said merely on his own confession in his dittay or impeachment and in the official account of the affair published in were cited fragments of two letters quoted from memory by sprot under private examination these quotations from memory differ we saw in many places from any of the five letters produced in the trial of a fact which has aroused natural suspicions this is the true explanation of the discrepancies between the plot letter cited in sprots impeachment and in the government pamphlet on his case and the similar though not identical letter produced in the indictment and the tract published by government contain merely sprots recollections of the epistle from logan to gowrie the letter iv produced in is the genuine letter of logan or so sprot seems falsely to swear this document did not come into the hands of government till after the indictment containing sprots quotation of the letter from memory was written or if it did was kept back all this has presently to be proved in detail as the government a fact unknown to our historians possessed all the alleged logan letters and papers before sprot was hanged and as at his trial they concealed this circumstance even from archbishop spottiswoode who was present at sprots public trial by jury a great deal of perplexity has been caused and many ingenious but erroneous conjectures have been invented the indictment or dittay against sprot on august is a public document but not an honest one it contains the following among other averments we are told that sprot in july at fastcastle saw and read the beginning of a letter from logan to gowrie letter iv logan therein expresses delight at receiving a letter of gowries he is anxious to avenge the macchiavelian massacre of our dearest friends the earl decapitated in he advises gowrie to be circumspect and be earnest with your brother that he be not rash in any speeches touching the purpose of padua picture fastcastle this letter as thus cited is not among the five later produced in it is a blurred reminiscence of parts of two of them the reason of these discrepancies is that the letter is quoted in the indictment not from the document itself which apparently reach the prosecution after the indictment was framed but from a version given from memory by sprot in one of his private examinations next sprot is told in his indictment that some time later logan asked bower to find this letter which gowrie for the sake of secrecy had returned to bower to be delivered to logan we know that this was the practice of intriguers after the december riot at edinburgh in the rev robert bruce writing to ask lord hamilton to head the party of the kirk is said to request him to return his own letter by the bearer gowrie and logan practised the same method the indictment goes on to say that bower being unable to read asked sprot to search for logans letter to gowrie among his papers that sprot found it abstracted it stole it retained it and read it divers times a false quotation of the ms confession sprot really said that he kept the stolen letter iv till he had framed on it as a model three forged letters it contained a long passage of which the substance is quoted this passage as printed in sprots indictment is not to be found textually in any of the five letters later produced it is we repeat merely the version given from memory by sprot at one of his last private examinations before the letter itself came into the hands of government in either form the letter meant high treason such is the evidence of the indictment against sprot of august in the light of sprots real confessions hitherto lying in the haddington muniment room we know the indictment to be a false and garbled document next on the part of government we have always had a published statement by sir william hart the kings justice with an introduction by dr george abbot later archbishop of canterbury who was in edinburgh and present when sprot was hanged this tract was published by bradewood london in and is reprinted by pitcairn after a verbose pious and pedantic diatribe abbot comes to the point sprot was arrested in april first on the strength of some words that fell from himself and next of some papers found upon him what papers they are never mentioned in the indictment of sprot they are never alluded to in the sequel of abbots pamphlet containing the official account by sir william hart of sprots trial and examinations in mentioning some papers found upon sprot dr abbot let the cat out of the bag but writers like mr napier and other sceptics of his way of thinking deny that any of the compromising letters were found at all no letters we say are mentioned by sir william hart in abbots tract as having been produced archbishop spottiswoode who was present at sprots public trial august thought the man one of those insane selfaccusers who are common enough and observes that he did not show the letter that of logan to gowrie iv this remark of spottiswoode an archbishop a converted presbyterian a courtier and an advocate for the king has been a source of joy to all ruthven apologists spottiswoode saw though the farce they say there was no letter at all and courtier and recreant as he was spottiswoode had the honesty to say so in his history to this there used to be no reply but now we know the actual and discreditable truth the government was in fact engaged in a shameful scheme to which archbishops were better not admitted they meant to use this letter iv on a later occasion but they also meant to use some of the other letters which sprot unknown to spottiswoode had confessed to be forgeries the archiepiscopal conscience might revolt at such an infamy spottiswoode might tell the king so the scottish government did not then allow the archbishop or the public to know that they had any logan letters no letter at all came into open and public court in hart cites a short one from gowrie to logan gowrie hopes to see logan or at least to send a trusty messenger anent the purpose you know but rather would i wish yourself to come not only for that errand but for some other thing that i have to advise with you there is no date of place or day this letter harmless enough was never produced in court and mr barbe supposes that it was a concoction of harts this is an unlucky conjecture the haddington mss prove that sprot really recited gowries letter or professed to do so from memory in one of his private examinations the prosecution never pretended to possess or produce gowries letter next hart cites as logans answer to gowries first letter which it was not the passages already quoted by the prosecution in sprots indictment passages out of a letter of logans given by sprot from memory only hart goes on to describe as if on sprots testimony certain movements of the lairds after he received gowries reply to his own answer to gowrie logans letter as given in is dated july and it is argued that his movements after receiving gowries reply are inconsistent with any share in the plot which failed on august even if it were so the fact is unimportant for sprot was really speaking of movements at a date much earlier than july he later gave a separate account of what logan was doing at the time of the outbreak of the plot an account not quoted by hart who fraudulently or accidentally confused the dates and next we find it as good as explicitly stated by hart that this letter of logans to gowrie was never produced in open court being demanded where this above written letter written by restalrig to the earl of gowrie which was returned again by james bower is now deponeth that he sprot left the above written letter in his chest among his writings when he was taken and brought away and that it is closed and folded within a piece of paper so hart declares in abbots tract he falsified the real facts he could not give the question as originally put to sprot for that involved the publication of the fact that all the letters but one were forged the question in the authentic private report ran thus demanded where is that letter which restalrig wrote to the earl of gowrie whereupon the said george sprot wrote and forged the missives produced august the real letter of logan to gowrie the only genuine letter if in any sense genuine had not on august been produced the others were in the hands of the government hart in his tract veils these circumstances the government meant to put the letters to their own uses on a later occasion at the trial of the dead logan meanwhile we must keep one fact steadily in mind when sprot confessed to having forged treasonable letters in logans handwriting as calderwood correctly reports that he did confess he did not include among them letter iv logan to gowrie july that letter was never heard of by sprots examiners till august and never came into the hands of his examiners till late on august or early on august the day when sprot was hanged spottiswoode was never made aware that the letter had been produced why sprot reserved this piece of evidence so long why under the shadow of the gibbet he at last produced it we shall later attempt to explain though with but little confidence in any explanation meanwhile at sprots public trial in the government were the conspirators they burked the fact that they possessed plotletters alleged to be by logan they burked the fact that sprot confessed all these with one or perhaps two exceptions to be forgeries by himself what they quoted as letters of logan and gowrie were merely descriptions of such letters given by sprot from memory of their contents xiv the laird and the notary we have now to track sprot through the labyrinth of his confessions and evasions as attested by the authentic reports of his private examinations between july and the day of his death it will be observed that while insisting on his own guilt and on that of logan he produced no documentary evidence no genuine letter attributed by him to logan nothing but his own confessed forgeries till the cord was almost round his neck if he did then in his confessions he paints with sordid and squalid realism the life of a debauched laird tortured by terror and rushing from his fears to forgetfulness in wine travel and pleasure and to strange desperate dreams of flight as a human document the confessions of sprot are unique for that period on july sprot in prison wrote in his own ordinary hand the tale of how he knew of logans guilt the letter was conveyed to the earl of dunbar who with dunfermline governed scotland under the absent king the prisoner gave many sources of his knowledge but the real source if any letter iv he reserved till he was certain of death august sprot knew perfectly he said on july that one letter from gowrie and one from his brother alexander ruthven reached logan at fastcastle and at gunnisgreen a house hard by eyemouth where sprot was a notary and held cottage land bower carried logans answers and long afterwards showed sprot the first of gowries letters the harmless one about desiring an interview and also a note of logans to bower himself which is amongst the rest of the letters produced it is no ii but in this confession of july sprot appears to say that gowries innocent letter to logan asking for an interview was the source of his forgeries i framed them all to the true meaning and purpose of the letter that bower let me see to make the matter more clear by these arguments and circumstances for the cause which i have already before july shewn to the lords that is for purposes of extorting money from logans executors this statement was untrue the brief letter to logan from gowrie was not the model of sprots forgeries as he later confessed he had another model in a letter of logan to gowrie which he held back till the last day of his life but in this confession of july sprot admits that he saw not only gowries letter to logan of july a letter never produced but also a direction or letter from logan to his retainer bower dated the canongate july this is our letter ii had it been genuine then taken with gowries letter to logan it must have aroused sprots suspicions but this letter ii about which sprot told discrepant tales is certainly not genuine it is dated as we said the canongate july its purport is to inform bower then at brockholes near eyemouth that logan had received a new letter from gowrie concerning certain proposals already made orally to him by the master of ruthven logan hoped to get the lands of dirleton for his share in the enterprise he ends keep all things very secret that my lord my brother lord home get no knowledge of our purposes for i would rather be eirdit quick that is buried alive p now we shall show later the source whence sprot probably borrowed this phrase as to lord home and being eirdit quick which he has introduced into his forged letter moreover the dates are impossible the first of the five letters purports to be from logan to an unnamed conspirator addressed as right honourable sir it is not certain whether this letter was in the hands of the prosecution before the day preceding sprots execution nor is it certain whether it is ever alluded to by sprot under examination but it is dated from fastcastle on july and tells the unknown conspirator that logan has just heard from gowrie it follows that logan had heard from gowrie on july at fastcastle that he thence rode to edinburgh and from edinburgh wrote his letter ii to bower bidding bower hasten to edinburgh to consult this is absurd logan would have summoned bower from fastcastle much nearer bowers home than edinburgh again in letter i logan informs the unknown man that he is to answer gowrie within ten days at furthest that being so he does not need bower in such a hurry unless it be to carry the letter to the unknown but in that case he would have summoned bower from fastcastle he would not have ridden to edinburgh and summoned him thence once more sprot later confessed as we shall see that this letter to bower was dictated to himself by logan and that the copy produced apparently in logans hand was forged by him from the letter as dictated to him he thus contradicted his earlier statement that letter ii was shown to him by bower he never says that he was in edinburgh with logan on july besides it is not conceivable that by dictating letter ii to sprot logan would have voluntarily put himself in the power of the notary this is a fair example of sprots apparently purposeless lying his real interest throughout was to persuade the government that he was giving them genuine logan letters this however he denied with truth yet he lied variously about the nature of his confessed forgeries sprot was so false that government might conceive his very confession of having forged the letters to be untrue the skill in handwriting of that age could not detect them for impostures government might deem that he had stolen genuine letters from bower letters which might legitimately be produced as evidence indeed this charitable view is perhaps confirmed by the extraordinary fact to be later proved that three edinburgh ministers mr hall mr hewat and mr galloway with mr lumisden minister of duddingston were present on occasions when sprot confessed to having forged the letters yet these four preachers said nothing as far as we hear when the letters confessedly forged were produced as evidence in to ruin logans innocent child did the preachers think the letters genuine in spite of the confession that they were forged we shall see later in any case that the contents of the three letters to the unknown and a torn letter when compared with letter iv demonstrate that sprots final confession to having forged them on the model of iv is true indeed the fact ought to have been discovered on internal evidence even by critics unaware of his confessions we now pursue sprots written deposition of july he gives as grounds of his knowledge of logans guilt certain conversations among logans intimates yeomen or bonnet lairds or servants from which he inferred that logan was engaged in treason again just before logans death in july he was delirious and raved of forfeiture but logan had been engaged in various treasons so his ravings need not refer to the gowrie affair he had been on bothwells enterprises and had privy dealings with percy probably thomas percy who in secretly visited hume of manderston a kinsman of logan that intrigue was certainly connected merely with jamess succession to the english crown but one of logans retainers when this affair of percy was spoken of among them said according to sprot that the laird had been engaged in treason nearer home sprot then writes that about the time of the conspiracy logan with matthew logan rode to dundee where they enjoyed a three days drinking bout and never had the laird such a surfeit of wine but this jaunt could not be part of the gowrie plot and probably occurred after its failure later sprot gave a different version of logans conduct immediately before and after gowries death once more after logans death one wallace asked sprot to be silent if ever he had heard of the lairds conspiracy sprot ended by confessing contritely that he had forged all the letters except letter iv to the true meaning and purpose of the letter that bower let me see a passage already quoted and a falsehood what was the cause for which sprot forged it was a purpose to blackmail not logan but logans heirs or executors one of whom was lord home if sprot wanted to get anything out of them he could terrify them by threatening to show the forged logan letters as genuine to the government so securing the ruin of logans heirs by forfeiture he did not do this himself but he gave forged letters for money to men who were in debt to the dead logans estate and who might use the letters to extort remission of what they owed on july sprot was examined before dunfermline dunbar hart the kings advocate sir thomas hamilton and other gentlemen he said that about july logan received a letter from gowrie which two days later bower showed to him at fastcastle this is the harmless gowrie letter which sprot now quoted from memory as it is printed in harts official account now begins a new puzzle caused by sprots dates of these we can only give a conjectural version for the sake of argument logan received a letter from gowrie about july he returned a reply by bower but when did bower start with the reply let us say on july bower returned says sprot within five days with a new letter from gowrie that would bring us to july but in letters i and ii dated july logan is informing his unknown correspondent and bower of the receipt of a new letter from gowrie why inform bower of this if bower was the bearer of the new letter but the new letter mentioned in letters i and ii was brought by a retainer of gowrie in any case supposing by way of conjecture that bower returned from gowrie about july he spent the night says sprot with logan at gunnisgreen and next day july rode to edinburgh with bower boig of lochend and matthew logan in edinburgh he remained a certain short space say four days which would bring us to july needless to say that this does not fit letter ii logan to bower july and letter i logan to the unknown fastcastle july after logans return from edinburgh which according to sprot seems to be of about july sprot heard logan and bower discuss some scheme by which logan should get gowries estate of dirleton without payment bower said nothing could be done till logan rode west himself he discouraged the whole affair but logan said in the hearing of several persons that he would hazard his life with gowrie lady restalrig blamed bower for making logan try to sell the lands of fastcastle they were not sold till of which bower protested his innocence this was after logans return from edinburgh say july that is say five days after logans return say july bower and logan had a long conference in the open air sprot was lounging and spying about beside the river a seafisher had taken a basket of blenneys or greenbanes logan called to sprot to bring him the fish and they all supped before supper however sprot walked about with bower and tried to pump him as to what was going forward bower said that the laird should get dirleton without either gold or silver but he feared it should be as dear to him they had another pie in hand than the selling of land bower then asked sprot not to meddle for he feared that in a few days the laird would be either landless or lifeless certainly this is a vivid description bower and logan were sitting on a bench at the byre end sprot come on the chance of a supper was peeping and watching peter mason the angler at the river side near the stepping stones had his basket of blenneys on his honest back his rod or net in his hand the laird was calling for the fish was taking a drink and we hope offering a drink to mason then followed the lounge and the talk with bower before supper all in the late afternoon of a july day the yellow light sleeping on the northern sea below vivid this is and plausible but is it true we have reached the approximate date of july though of course after an interval of eight years sprots memory of dates must be vague next day july logan with bower and others rode to nine wells where david hume the philosopher was born thence the same night back to gunnisgreen next night july to fastcastle and thence to edinburgh this brings us allowing freely for error of memory to about july the hinder end of july says sprot if we make allowance for a vagueness of four or five days this does not fit in badly logans letter to gowrie no iv which sprot finally said that he used as a model for his forgeries is dated gunnisgreen july at the beginning of august says sprot clearly there are four or five days lost in the reckoning logan and bower with matthew logan and willie crockett rode to edinburgh and there stayed three days and the laird with matthew logan came home and bower came to his own house of the brockholes where he stayed four days and then was sent for by logan and the laird was very sad and sorry obviously because of the failure of the plot on august how do these dates fit into the narrative logan was at gunnisgreen his letter iv proves it on july later we show another error of sprots on this point he writes that he is sending bower as bearer of his letter to gowrie if bower left edinburgh on july he could deliver the letter to gowrie at perth on august and be back in edinburgh whither logan now went on august and logan could leave edinburgh on august after hearing of the deaths of his fellowconspirators we must not press sprot too hard as to dates so remote in time we may grant that bower bearing logans letter of july rode with logan and the others to edinburgh that at edinburgh logan awaited his return with a reply that he thence learned that august was the day for the enterprise and that early on august he heard of its failure and rode sadly home all this being granted for the sake of argument had the news of august been that the king had mysteriously disappeared we may conceive that logan would have hurried to dirleton met the ruthvens there with their prisoner and sailed with them to fastcastle or he might have made direct to fastcastle and welcomed them there his reason for being at restalrig or in the canongate was to get the earliest news from perth brought across fife and from bruntisland to leith whether correct or not this scheme allowing for lapse of memory as to dates is feasible who can remote from any documents remember the dates of occurrences all through a month now distant by eight years there were no daily newspapers no ready means of ascertaining a date queen marys accusers in their chronological account of her movements about the time of darnleys death are often out in their dates in legal documents of the period the date of the day of the month of an event is often left blank this occurs in the confirmation of logans own will he died july when lawyers with plenty of leisure for inquiry were thus at a loss for dates of days of the month having since the reformation no saints days to go by sprot in prison might easily go wrong in his chronology picture fastcastle in any case taking letter iv provisionally as genuine in substance we note that on july logan did not yet know the date fixed for gowries enterprise he suggested the beginning of harvest and by august harvest had begun one of the perth witnesses was reaping in the morton haugh when he heard the town bell call the citizens to arms but gowrie must have acted in great haste logan not knowing till say august or the date of a plot that exploded on august gowrie may have thought as lord maxwell said when arranging his escape from edinburgh castle sic interprysis are nocht effectuat with deliberationis and advisments bot with suddane resolutionis it is very important we must freely admit as an argument against the theory of carrying james to logans impregnable keep of fastcastle that only one question in our papers is asked as to the provisioning of fastcastle and that merely as to the supply of drink possibly this had been ascertained in sprots earlier and unrecorded examinations april july one poor hogshead of wine a trifle to logan had been sent in that summer so matthew logan deponed as logan had often used fastcastle before for treasonable purposes he was not it may be supposed likely to leave it without provisions moreover these could be brought by sea from dirleton where carey august says that gowrie had stored all his provision moreover government did not wish to prove intent to kidnap the king that was commonly regarded as a harmless constitutional practice not justifying the slaughter of the ruthvens from the first government insisted that murder was intended in the latin indictment of the dead logan this is again dwelt on fastcastle is only to be the safe haven of the murderers this is a misreading of letter iv where fastcastle is merely spoken of as to be used for a meeting and the concluding of our plot thus it cannot be concealed that on july granting letter iv to have a basis the plot as far as logan knew was in the air if fastcastle was to be used by the conspirators it must have been taken in the rough on the chance that it was provided or that gowrie could bring his own supplies from dirleton by sea this extreme vagueness undeniably throws great doubt on logans part in the plot letter iv if genuine being the source of our perplexity but if it is not genuine that is in substance there is only rumour later to be discussed to hint that logan was in any way connected with gowrie we left bower and logan conversing dolefully some days after the failure of the plot at this point the perhaps insuperable difficulty arises why did they not as soon as they returned from edinburgh destroy every inch of paper connected with the conspiracy one letter at least logans to gowrie july was not burned according to sprot but was later stolen by himself from bower though he reserved this confession to the last day of his life but two we might have expected logan to take the letter from bower as soon as they met and to burn or for that matter swallow it if no fire was convenient yet according to sprot in his final confession logan let bower keep the damning paper for months if this be true we can only say quos deus vult perdere prius dementat people do keep damning letters constant experience proves the fact after bower had met logan in his melancholy mood he rode away and remained absent for four days on what errand sprot did not know and during the next fortnight while scotland was ringing with the gowrie tragedy sprot saw nothing of logan next logan went to church at coldinghame on a sunday and met bower next day they dined together at gunnisgreen bower was gloomy logan said be it as it will i must take my fortune and i will tell you laird bower the scaffold is the best death that a man can die logan if he said this must have been drunk he very often was it was at this point in answer to a question that sprot confessed that logans letter to bower no ii was a forgery by himself the actual letter sprot said was dictated by logan to him and he made a counterfeit copy in imitation of logans handwriting we have stated the difficulties involved in this obvious falsehood sprot was trying every ruse to conceal his alleged source and model letter iv sprot was next asked about a certain memorandum by logan directed to bower and to one john bell in this document was actually found in sprots pocquet when he was arrested and it contained certain very compromising items sprot replied that he forged the memorandum in the autumn of when he forged the other letters he copied most of it from an actual but innocent note of logans on business matters and added the compromising items out of his own invention he made three copies of this forgery one was produced he gave another to a man named heddilstane or heddilshaw a dweller in berwick in september the third in course hand he gave to another client the goodman of rentoun hume one was to be used to terrorise logans executors to whom heddilstane but not rentoun was in debt sprots words are important he omitted nothing that was in the original logans memorandum on business matters but eikit added two articles to his copy the one concerning ninian chirnside as to a dangerous plotletter lost by bower the other where the laird ordered bower to tear his missive letters he grants that he wrote another copy with his course hand copied from his copy and gave it to the goodman of rentoun while the copy given to heddilstane was of his counterfeited writing an imitation of logans hand picture handwriting of logan january perhaps sprot had two methods and scales of blackmail for one he invented damning facts and wrote them out in imitation of logans writing the other species was cheaper a copy in his course hand of his more elaborate forgeries in logans hand now the two copies of letters i and iv which at the end of his life as we shall see sprot attested by signed endorsements were in his course hand he had them ready for customers when he was arrested in april and they were doubtless found in his kist on the day before his death with the alleged original of letter iv up to august at a certain hour government had neither the alleged original nor sprots course hand copy of letter iv otherwise he would not have needed to quote iv from memory as he did on that occasion among these minor forgeries to be used in blackmailing operations was a letter nominally from logan to one ninian or ringan chirnside this man was a member of the family of chirnside of easter chirnside his own estate was whitsumlaws all these chirnsides and humes of berwickshire were a turbulent and lawless gang true borderers ninian is addressed by logan as brother they were most intimate friends it was ninian who as the endorsement shows produced our letter v on april he had purchased it for the usual ends from sprot being a great debtor as logans will proves to his estate to track these men through the background of history is to have a notion of the day of judgment old forgotten iniquities and adventures leap to light chirnside like logan and the douglases of whittingham and john colville and the laird of spot had followed the fortunes of wild frank stewart earl of bothwell and nephew of the bothwell of queen mary frank bothwell was driven into his perilous courses by a charge of practising witchcraft against the kings life absurd as this sounds bothwell had probably tried it for what it was worth when he was ruined pursued driven child of the kirk as he seemed into the catholic faction his old accomplice colville took a solemn farewell of him by me your lordship was cleared of the odious imputation of witchcraft but god only knows how far i hazarded my conscience in making black white and darkness light for your sake september after bothwell when he trapped the king by aid of lady gowrie july recovered power for a while he defended himself on this charge of witchcraft he had consulted and employed the wizard richard graham who now accused him of attempting the kings life by sorcery but he had only employed graham to heal the earl of angus himself dying of witchcraft bothwell was charged with employing a retainer ninian chirnside to arrange more than twentyone meetings with the wizard graham the result being the procurement of a poison adder skins toad skins and the hippomanes in the brain of a young foal to ooze the juices on the king a poison of such vehemency as should have presently cut him off isobel gowdie accused of witchcraft in confessed to having employed a similar charm a all this bothwell instructed by colville denied but admitted that he had sent ninian chirnside twice to the wizard all in the interests of the dying earl of angus b this chirnside then was a borderer prone to desperate enterprises and darkling rides and midnight meetings with the wizard graham in lonely shepherds cottages as was alleged he could also sink to blackmailing the orphan child of his brother logan of restalrig to go on with sprots confessions he had forged he said receipts from logan to the man named edward or ned heddilstane for some of the money which heddilstane owed him for these forgeries his client paid him well if not willingly sprot frequently blackmailed ned whenever he want siller it must be granted that sprot was a liar so complex and a forger so skilled for the time that is that nothing which he said or produced can be reckoned as such as evidence on the other hand his power of describing or inventing scenes real or fictitious was of high artistic merit so that he appears occasionally either to deviate into truth or to have been a realistic novelist born centuries too early why then it may be asked do we doubt that sprot may have forged without a genuine model letter iv the answer will appear in due time letter iv as sprot confessed is certainly the model of all the letters which he forged whether those produced or those suppressed he was afraid to wander from his model which he repeated in letters i iii v and in the unproduced letters including one which we have found in twelve torn fragments with the signature missing xv the final confessions of the notary on july sprot was again examined spottiswoode archbishop of glasgow the historian was present on this occasion only with dunfermline dunbar sir thomas hamilton hart and other nobles and officials none of them signs the record which in this case only is merely attested by the signature of primrose the clerk of council one of lord roseberys family in this session sprot said nothing about forging the letters the archbishop was not to know asked if he had any more reminiscences sprot said that in november fastcastle having been sold logan asked bower for gods sake to bring him any of the letters about the gowrie affair which he might have in keeping bower said that he had no dangerous papers except one letter from alexander ruthven and another from mr andro clerk this clerk was a jesuit who chiefly dealt between spain and the scotch catholics he was involved in the affair called the spanish blanks and visited the rebel catholic peers of the north angus errol and huntly logan like bothwell was ready to intrigue either with the kirk or the jesuits and he seems to have had some personal acquaintance with father andrew bower left logan to look for these letters at his own house at brockholes and logan passed a night of sleepless anxiety one of the mysteries of the case is that logan entrusted bower who could not read with all his papers if one of them was needed bower had to employ a person who could read to find it probably he used as a rule the help of his better educated son valentine after logans restless night bower returned with the two letters ruthvens and clerks which logan burned in the fire let it be remembered that sprot has not yet introduced letter iv into his depositions though that was by far the most important picture hand of logan as forged by sprot after burning clerks and ruthvens letters logan dictated to sprot a letter to john baillie of littlegill informing him of the fact bower rode off with the letter and logan bade sprot be silent about all these things for he had learned from bower that sprot knew a good deal here the amateur of the art of fiction asks why did sprot drag in mr john baillie of littlegill if logan as sprot swore informed baillie about the burned letters then baillie had a guilty knowledge of the conspiracy poor baillie was instantly put in ward under the charge of the earl of dunfermline but on the day after sprot was hanged namely on august baillie was set free on bail of marks to appear before the privy council if called upon three of sprots other victims maul crockett and william galloway were set free on their personal recognisances but mossman and matthew logan were kept in prison and chirnside was not out of danger of the law for several years as we learn from the privy council register nothing was ever proved against any of these men after the posthumous trial of logan june the king bade the council discharge john baillie from his bail as we rest now fully persuaded that there was no just cause of imputation against the said john so the register of the privy council informs us thus if sprot told the truth about all these men no corroborative facts were discovered while the only proofs of his charges against logan were the papers which with one exception he confessed to be forgeries executed by himself for purposes of extortion to go on with his confessions the christmas of arrived and the laird keepit ane great yule at gunnisgreen on the third day of the feast logan openly said to bower at table i shall sleep better this night than that night when i sent you for the letters in november for now i am sure that none of these matters will ever come to further light if you be true bower answered i protest before god i shall be counted the most damnable traitor in the world if any man on earth know for i have buried them after supper bower and logan called sprot out on to the open hillside logan said that bower confessed to having shown sprot a letter of gowries what he asked did sprot think of the matter sprot with protestations of loyalty said that he thought that logan had been in the gowrie conspiracy logan then asked for an oath of secrecy promising to be the best sight you ever saw and taking out l scots bade sprot buy corn for his children asked who were present at the scene of the supper sprot named eight yeomen the lady lady restalrig was also present at table that night and at her rising she said the devil delight in such a feast that will make all the children weep hereafter and this she spoke as she went past the end of the table and after entering the other chamber she wept a while and we saw her going up and down the chamber weeping a fortnight later lady restalrig blamed bower for the selling of fastcastle bower appealed to logan it was logans fault not his one of two things said bower must make you sell your lands either you think your children are bastards or you have planned some treason the children were not those of lady restalrig but by former marriages logan replied if i had all the land between the orient and the occident i would sell the same and if i could not get money for it i would give it to good fellows on another occasion logan said to bower i am for no land i told you before and will tell you again you have not learned the art of memory in fact logan did sell not only fastcastle but flemington and restalrig we know how the scot then clung to his acres why did logan sell all it does not appear as we have shown that he was in debt if he had been his creditors would have had him put to the horn proclaimed a recalcitrant debtor and the record thereof would be found in the privy council register but there is no such matter sprot supposed that logan wished to turn his estates into money to be ready for flight if the truth ever came out the haste to sell all his lands is certainly a suspicious point against logan he kept on giving sprot money hush money and for forgeries to defraud others sometimes and taking sprots oath of secrecy a remarkable anecdote follows remarkable on this account in the letter ii which logan is said by sprot to have written to bower july occurs the phrase keep all things very secret that my lord my brother get no knowledge of our purposes for i rather be eirdit quik would rather be buried alive p this my lord my brother is obviously meant for alexander sixth lord home whose father the fifth lord had married agnes sister of patrick sixth lord gray and widow of sir robert logan of restalrig by sir robert lady restalrig had a son the logan of this affair and when after sir roberts death she married the fifth lord home she had to him a son alexander sixth lord home our logan and the sixth lord home were therefore brothers uterine a now if we accept as genuine in substance the one letter which sprot declared to be really written by logan no iv gowrie was anxious that home a person of great importance warden on the border should be initiated into the conspiracy as gowrie had been absent from scotland between august when he as a lad was in league with the wild kingcatcher francis stewart of bothwell and may we ask what did gowrie know of home and why did he think him an useful recruit the answer is that as we showed in another connection p gowrie was in paris in februaryapril that home was also in paris at the same time arriving in scotland at his house of douglas april and that home did not go to court on his return owing to the kings displeasure because of his trysting with bothwell in brussels b here then we have in march gowrie and home in paris and bothwell the kingcatcher meeting home in brussels therefore when letter iv represents gowrie as anxious to bring home who had been consulting bothwell into his plot nothing can be more natural gowrie himself conceivably met his old rebellious ally bothwell he was certain to meet home in paris and home owning douglas castle and home castle near the border would have been a most serviceable assistant it must also be remembered that home was at heart a catholic a recent and reluctant protestant convert compelled to come in by the kirk bothwell was a catholic gowrie he declared was another logan was a trafficker with jesuits and an idolater in the matter of keeping great yules logan however if letter iv is genuine in substance wrote that he utterly dissented from gowries opinion he would not try his brothers homes mind in the matter or consent that he ever should be counsellor thereto for in good faith he will never help his friend nor harm his foe such being the relations if we accept letter iv as in substance genuine between gowrie home and logan we can appreciate sprots anecdote now to be given concerning lady home logan according to sprot said to him in edinburgh early in thou rememberest what my lady home said to me when she would not suffer my lord to subscribe my contract for fentoun because i would not allow two thousand marks to be kept out of the security and take her word for them she said to me which was a great knell to my heart that since her coming to the town she knew that i had been in some dealing with the earl of gowrie about dirleton now dirleton according to sprot was to have been logans payment from gowrie for his aid in the plot logan then asked sprot if he had blabbed to lady home but sprot replied that he had never spoken to her ladyship but that same day although he had read the contract as to fentoun before him and her in the abbey of coldingham probably logan then requested sprot to keep out of lady homes sight lest she should ask questions for i had rather be eirdit quick than either my lord or she knew anything of it now in letter ii july from logan to bower logan as we saw is made to write see that my lord my brother gets no knowledge of our purposes for i sic rather be eirdit quik the phrase recurs in another of the forged letters not produced in court it is thus a probable inference that logan did use this expression to sprot in describing the conversation about lady home and that sprot inserted it into his forged letter ii logan to bower but clever as sprot was he is scarcely likely to have invented the conversation of logan with lady home arising out of logans attempt to do some business with lord home about fentoun a difficulty raised by lady home led up to the ladys allusion to dirleton which was a great knell to my heart said logan this is one of the passages which indicate a basis of truth in the confessions of sprot again as home and gowrie were in paris together while bothwell was in brussels in february and as home certainly and gowrie conceivably met bothwell it may well have been that gowrie heard of logan from bothwell the old ally of both and marked him as a useful hand moreover he could not but have heard of logans qualities and his keep fastcastle in the troubles and conspiracies of after making these depositions sprot attested them with phrases of awful solemnity were i presently within one hour to die he especially insisted that he had written to logans dictation the letter informing john baillie of littlegill that all gowries papers were burned as we saw in november the king deliberately cleared baillie of all suspicion there could be no evidence bower the messenger was dead baillie was now called he denied on oath that he had ever received the letter from logan he had never seen gowrie except on the day he came first home and rode up the street of edinburgh confronted with baillie sprot abides by his deposition willie crockett was then called he had been at logans great yule in gunnisgreen where logan according to sprot made the imprudent speeches crockett had also been at dundee with logan he said but it was in the summer of he did not hear logans imprudent speech to bower at the yule supper as to the weeping of lady restalrig he had often seen her weep and heard her declare that logan would ruin his family he only remembered as to the yule supper a quarrel between logan and willie home this was the only examination at which archbishop spottiswoode attended neither he nor any of the lords as we have said already signed the record which is attested only by james primrose clerk of council signing at the foot of each page had the lords quitted the diet the next examination was held on july dunfermline dunbar sir thomas hamilton the president of the court of session and other officials all laymen being present sprot incidentally remarked that logan visited london in after king james ascended the english throne logan appears to have gone merely for pleasure he had seen london before in the winter of on his return he said that he would never bestow a groat on such vanities as the celebration of the kings holiday august the anniversary of the gowrie tragedy adding when the king has cut off all the noblemen of the country he will live at ease but many citizens disliked the th of august holiday as much as logan did picture handwriting of sprot in the autumn of logan again visited london in sprots account of his revels there and his bad reception we have either proof of logans guilt if the tale be true or high testimony to sprots powers as an artist in fiction he says that matthew logan accompanied the laird to town in september and in november was sent back with letters to bower eight days later matthew took sprot to coldingham to meet bower and get his answer to the letters it was a sunday these devotees heard sermon and then dined together at john corsars after dinner bower took sprot apart and showed him two letters would sprot read to him the first few words that he might know which letter he had to answer the first letter shown so sprot writes on the margin of his recorded deposition referred to the money owed to logan by the earl of dunbar for gunnisgreen and the lands of remington logan had expected to get the purchase money from dunbar in london he never got more than out of marks sprot wrote for bower the answer to this business letter and gave it to matthew logan to be sent to logan in london matthew being interrogated denied that he sent any letter back to logan though he owned that sprot wrote one and he denied that sprot and bower had any conference at all on the occasion but sprot had asserted that the conference with bower occurred after matthew logan left them at corsars house where they dined as matthew admitted after sermon matthew denied too much a curious conference it was bower asked sprot to read to him the other of logans two letters directed to himself it ran laird bower i wot not what i should say or think of this world it is very hard to trust in any man for apparently there is no constancy or faithfulness for since i cam here they whom i thought to have been my most entire friends have uttered to me most injurie and have given me the defiance and say i am not worthy to live and if the king heard what has moved you to put away all your lands and debosch yourself you would not make such merryness and play the companion in london as you do so near his majestie logan went on to express his fear that bowers rash speeches had roused these suspicions of the auld misterie ye ken of god forgive you but i have had no rest since these speeches were upcast to me bower was to take great care of this letter for it is within three letters enclosed and is confided to matthew logan who travelled by sea as a trusty man bower was much moved by this melancholy letter and denied that he had been gossiping he had twice before logan rode south advised him to be very careful never even to mention the name of gowrie sprot said that he too was uneasy for if anything came out he himself was in evil case logan visited france as well as london at this time he returned home in the spring of but bower expressed the belief that he would go on to spain to meet bothwell and father andrew clerk and if he come home it will be rather to die in his own country than for any pleasure he has to live bothwell and father andrew of course were both catholic intriguers among whom bothwell reckoned logan and gowrie now the letter to bower here attributed to logan telling of the new knell at his heart when he is rebuked and insulted as he plays the merry companion in london and near the court his touching complaint of the falseness of the world he himself being certainly the blackest of traitors with the distress of bower do make up a very natural description the ghost of his guilt haunts logan he cannot drown it in a red sea of burgundy life has lost its flavour if he returns it will be with the true scottish desire to die in his own country though of his ancient familys lands he has not kept an acre pleasant rich restalrig strong fastcastle jolly gunnisgreen of the great yules all are gone nothing is left surely if sprot invented all this he was a novelist born out of due time either he told truth or in fiction he rivalled de foe matthew logan being called contradicted sprot as we have already said he himself had seen bower when he brought him logans letter from london take his son valentine apart and knew that valentine read a letter to him it was a meikle letter matthew said and if sprot tell truth it contained three enclosures bower may have stopped his son from reading the melancholy and compromising epistle and kept it to be read by sprot logans folly in writing at all was the madness that has ruined so many men and women matthew could not remember having ridden to edinburgh with logan in july just before the gowrie affair as sprot had declared that he did we could scarcely expect him to remember that he could remember nothing at all that was compromising nothing of logans rash speeches as to the yule feast at gunnisgreen he averred that lady restalrig only said the devil delight in such a feast that makes discord and makes the house ado that is gives trouble asked if wine and beer were stored in fastcastle in he said as has already been stated that a hogshead of wine was therein he himself he said had been in the west at the time of the gowrie tragedy and first heard of it at falkirk on august sprot was interrogated again only lay lords were present there were no clergymen nor lawyers he denied that he had received any promise of life or reward he asked to be confronted with matthew logan and reported a conversation between them held when lord dunbar took possession of gunnisgreen matthew then hoped to ride with the laird to london but said alas geordie sprot what shall we all do now now nothing is left i was aye feared for it for i know the laird has done some evil turn and he will not bide in the country and woes me therefor sprot asked what the evil turn was matthew answered i know well enough but as the proverb goes what lies not in my way breaks not my shins sprot added that after bowers death january logan wrote to him from london not having heard the news of his decease lady restalrig opened the letter and wrote a postscript give this to laird bower for i trow that he be ridden to hell as he ofttimes said to the laird that he would do in letter iv logan tells gowrie that he believes bower would ride to hells gate to pleasure him sprot was now asked about two letters one of these logan to chirnside is endorsed production by niniane chirnesyde xiii april another is letter v endorsed produced by ninian chirnside a fact first noted by mr anderson yet another is the letter in twelve torn pieces logan in the first of these three letters requests chirnside to find a letter which bower lost in dunglas the letter imperils logans life and lands the date is september and purports falsely to be written before logan goes to london sprot explained that he forged the letters that chirnside might blackmail logans executors and make them forgive him the debts which as logans will proves he owed to the estate here we cite the letter of the twelve fragments it is of course a forgery by sprot to enable chirnside to terrorise his creditors logans executors but as it directly implicates chirnside himself in the gowrie conspiracy probably he disliked it and tore it up yet the artist could not part with his work it still lies now reconstructed in the old folio sheet of paper the reader will remark that like letters i iii and v this torn letter is a mere pastiche framed as sprot confessed on ideas and expressions in letter iv letter found among the haddington mss torn into thirteen pieces one lost these have been placed in order but at least one line of the piece is wanting brother according to my promise the last day ve met in the kannogate i have sent this berair to my lord vith my answer of all thingis and i pray you ryde vith him till his lordschip and bevar that he speik vith na other

lord home get na intelligense of thir towrnis as he lowfis all owr veillis for be god he vill be our greittest enemy a line or more wanting on the same day august sprot withdrew a deposition made before july that the unknown for whom letters i iii v were meant was the laird of kinfauns sir harry lindsay who in tried to shoot patrick eviot one of the gowrie fugitives the constable of dundee sir james scrymgeour sprot had also accused falsely the letters i iii v he says were imagined by me on august three ministers patrick galloway john hall and peter hewatt were present the two former were now preachers of the courtly party the third received a pension of marks from the king after the posthumous trial of logan at which the five letters were produced but this reward may have been a mere coincidence the ministers hall and hewatt in august had at first as we saw declined to accept jamess version of the affair at gowrie house pp sprot now confesses that he knows he is to die deposes that no man has promised him life and that he has stated nothing in hope of life with tears he deplores that he has taken gods name in vain in swearing to the truth of his depositions before that of july his last five depositions under examination are true in all points and circumstances and he will go to the death with the same further the said george sprot remembers that in the summertide of the laird of restalrig had indented with the lord willoughby then governor of berwick concerning my lords ship then built and lying at berwick whereof the laird should have been equal partner with my lord and to take voyage with the said ship either by the laird himself or some other person whom it pleased him to appoint to pass to the indies the canarys and through the straits for such conditions as were set down in the indenture betwixt my lord and him which was framed by sir john guevara willoughbys cousin the kidnapper of ashfield in now this ship of lord willoughbys at all events was a real ship and here is a grain of fact in the narrative of sprot the ship was built by lord willoughby to protect english commerce from the piracies of the dunkirkers on march he writes from berwick to cecil the respect of my country and the pity of those hurt by such the dunkirkers persuaded me to build a ship and moves me now to offer to serve her majesty at as reasonable a rate as any ship of tons with sixteen pieces of artillery and men can be maintained with if this offer seem good to you and the council my ship shall presently be fitted if not i purpose to dispose otherwise of her to logan being not able to maintain her border calendar ii on april willoughby wrote that he had pursued with his ship a pirate which had carried an english prize into the forth but he cannot unaided maintain the ship even for one summer on june willoughby took a great cold in his ship lying at the haven mouth awaiting a wind and died suddenly on july carey says that his body has been placed with all honourable rites on board his ship it appears then that willoughby unable to maintain his ship and not subsidised by government in the summer of admitted logan to a half of the venture carrying great expenses logan settled the business at robert jacksons house in bridge street berwick being accompanied by sprot bower and matthew logan matthew said privately to sprot waes me that ever i should see this day that the laird should grow a seaman i wot not what it means for it is for no good and i fear this shall be one of the sorrowful blocks that ever the laird made it is true that i have oft thought that the laird would pass away for he is minded to sell all that he has and would to god that he had never been born what should he do with such conditions to go or to send to the sea he might have lived well enough at home i find he has ever been carried excited and his mind has ever been set on passing out of the country this year past that is since the gowrie affair now all this tale has much vraisemblance the facts about logans adventure with willoughby stopped by willoughbys death were easily verifiable logan at his death owned a ship rated at marks so we read in his inventory but this can hardly have been the ship of willoughby he was restless excited selling land to supply a maritime enterprise at this time lady restalrig was deeply distressed she wished logan at the indies if only he would first settle flemington on herself if it be gods will i desire never to have a child to him she said i have a guess what this mystery means woes me for his motherless children that is children of former marriages later lady restalrig had a daughter anna by logan matthew logan as usual denied every word attributed to him by sprot except regrets for his own condition matthew could do no less to save his own life on august before other witnesses and the rev messrs galloway hall and hewatt sprot solemnly confessed to having forged the letters in logans hand then in possession of his examiners on august the same clergymen and many lords and hart being present sprot came to the point at last where he was asked after a prayer offered at his request by mr galloway was the letter of logan to gowrie whereon as model the rest were forged now he had not previously mentioned as far as the reports go a letter of logan to gowrie as the model of his forgeries he had mentioned as his model the brief harmless letter of gowrie to logan on august he had been very solemnly told that he was to die and that he would see the faces of the lords of the council no more probably after they left him he told to a minister or a servant in the gaol the fact that he had used as his model a letter from logan to gowrie the result was that he did again see on august the lords of the council who asked him where the letter now was this is letter iv the letter of logan to gowrie of july sprot in place of answering directly cited from memory and erroneously the opening of the letter he had read it while it was still unfinished in july at fastcastle logan who had been writing it was called by bower went out and thrust it between a bench and the wall there sprot found read and restored the unfinished epistle to its place but the letter is dated from gunnisgreen at the conclusion logan according to sprot left gunnisgreen one day at the end of july or beginning of august thence rode to fastcastle and thence next day to edinburgh p now logan in the letter iv says that he took two days to write it one day would be at fastcastle when he was interrupted the other the day of dating at gunnisgreen this however does not tally with sprots account p of logans movements nine wells gunnisgreen fastcastle edinburgh if these are the days of writing letter iv yet if sprot forged letter iv he knew where he dated it from if the government had it forged they knew from sprots confession that it should have been dated from fastcastle perhaps we should not bear too heavily on this point a man may mention the wrong name by inadvertence or the clerk by inadvertence may write the wrong name mr mark napier in his essay on this matter twice or thrice prints logan for sprot or sprot for logan fastcastle in sprots confession may be a slip of tongue or pen for gunnisgreen or he may have been confused among the movements to and from gunnisgreen and fastcastle the present writer finds similar errors in the manuscript of this work sprot next alleged that three months after the gowrie affair logan bade bower hunt among his papers for this very letter he had been at berwick with lord willoughby and bower told sprot that he was taking order with all who knew of his part in the gowrie plot here is the old difficulty why was the letter kept for one moment after bower brought it back why leave it with bower for three months at all events as bower could not read sprot helped him to look for the letter found it and kept it till he framed three new letters upon it after which he does not say what he did with it here sprot cited from memory but not accurately more of letter iv the existence of such errors is not remarkable sprot again swore to the truth of all his depositions since july but if this story is true how can it be true that logan was at ease in his mind after burning the letter from alexander ruthven and another from father andrew clerk jesuit as sprot previously swore there was still letter iv lost unburned a haunting fear it may be suggested that sprot only kept this letter till he had made his forgeries on its model and then in a later search pretended to find and returned it having first copied it out in logans hand that copy being our letter iv sprot first would make a copy in his ordinary hand of the letter then restore the original and after logans death copy his copy in imitation of logans hand and frame i iii v and the torn letter on his copy of iv finally sprot said that he believes this letter is in his chest among his writings because he left it there when he was taken by watty doig and deposes that it is closed and folded within a piece of paper sprot said this on august on august he was hanged now was this letter on which he forged three others found in his kist before his death that it was so found we have direct evidence though not from the best of sources in the year an aged nobleman lord cromarty published a defence of the kings conduct in the gowrie affair lord cromarty in was aged eightythree born about he remembered the beginnings of the civil war and says that the covenanters about made great political capital out of king jamess alleged guilt in the slaughter of the ruthvens later lord cromarty occupied in the restoration the highest judicial offices and as clerk registrar had access to public documents he was an old courtier he may have been forgetful he may have been unscrupulous but as to the letter in sprots kist he writes the letter was found there by the sheriff depute who was ordered by sir william hart lord justice of scotland to seize the said chest and make search for this letter which he found and delivered to the kings advocate sir thomas hamilton now this sir thomas hamilton was the ancestor of the earl of haddington who inherits many of his papers among these we find a copy in sprots course hand or rapid current hand of letter iv and another of letter i but no such copies of ii iii and v each of these is endorsed by james primrose clerk of council is endorsed by sprot in faded ink and is also endorsed in sprots ordinary everyday hand very firm and clear thus this is copyitt off the principal the original lykeas the note writtin upon the bak is writtin by me george sprott there is in fact another note on the back in ink more faded on a dirty rubbed part of the paper now certainly the last endorsation was written by sprot either on august or august he had not the original or this copy by him on august or on august when examined for on august he could only give a version of letter iv from memory and erroneously the version cited in his indictment on august he still had not the original or his copy for he quoted from memory what he believed to be a postscript to the original letter iv a passage which is really in the text of letter iv he could not have made this error if at that hour of august he had either the original of letter iv or his exact copy before him nor would there have been any reason why he should quote from memory if government had the documents yet he reendorsed his copies of letters i and iv before his death this endorsement is firm and clear the text of the two copies is fainter and much of the paper more rubbed as if from being kept in the pocket the copies are older than the final endorsement on the copies it follows that the sheriff depute found these two copies i iv and the originals in sprots kist and brought them to sprots examiners after that hour of august when he could only quote from memory he then endorsed them formally one of the last acts of his life the originals were also found for it will not be argued that government employed another forger to forge them from sprots copies in course hand we know that sprot had a secondary species of blackmailing documents these in current hand one of them he gave to the goodman of rentoun for this or some other purpose he had made the course hand copies of letters i and iv which he endorsed just before his death or perhaps he made them from the original which he then destroyed or surreptitiously returned when he was examined on august the three preachers galloway hall and hewatt and the minister of duddingston mr lumisden were present he was entreated not to perjure himself to the injury of innocent people dead or alive by making and forging of lies he renewed his protestations of truth asked mr galloway to pray for him wept and repeated his averments on august sprot was tried and hanged at edinburgh he renewed his protestations from every corner of the scaffold in the most vigorous language abbot who was present declares that he thrice gave a loud clap with his hands while he swung as a proof that he adhered in death to his last words a similar story is told of kirkcaldy of grange and i think in other cases nothing of the sort is in the first draft of the official account of his dying behaviour a draft manifestly drawn up near the spot nor in the official account itself much value was set on dying confessions when the preacher robert bruce refused to believe the kings account of the gowrie tragedy he said that one proof would satisfy him let andrew henderson the man in the turret be hanged if he persisted in his confession on the scaffold mr bruce would believe the king declined to make this abominable experiment in sprots case his dying confession did not move the kirk party calderwood hints that mr galloway had the most speech to sprot on the scaffold and so kept him true to a dying lie a he adds that spottiswoode said to galloway i am afraid this man make us all ashamed that is by retracting his confessions mr patrick answered let alone my lord i shall warrant him b had andrew henderson swung constant to his confession the presbyterian sceptics would have found similar reasons for disbelief what are we to believe did sprot go wherever he went with a blasphemous lie in his mouth a motive for such vehemence of religious hypocrisy is difficult to find conceivably he had promise of benefits to his family conceivably he was an atheist and took god in his own hand conceivably his artistic temperament induced him to act his lie well as he had a lie to act yet all this is not satisfactory let us take the unromantic view of common sense it is this logan was a restless disappointed intriguer and debauchee he sold his lands some to acquire a partnership with lord willoughby in a vessel trading to america this vessel or another is among his assets recorded in his inventory all his lands he sold not that he was in debt he was a large lender for purposes of profligacy these proceedings gave rise to gossip the laird must be selling his lands to evade forfeiture he must have been engaged in the gowrie mystery then logan dies july bower is also dead january it occurs to sprot that there is money in all this and having lost logans business the hungry sprot needs money he therefore makes a pact with some of logans debtors he for pay will clear them of their debts to logans executors whom he will enable them to blackmail logans descendants by two marriages were finally his heirs with anna a minor daughter of his last wife who had hoped to have no children by him the freespoken lady restalrig nee ker marion they of course were robbed by logans forfeiture of marks owed to logan by dunbar and balmerino meanwhile just after logans death in autumn sprot forges letters i ii iii iv v and the torn letter with two compromising letters to bower two to ninian chirnside and an eik or addition of compromising items to a memorandum on business which in september logan gave to bower and john bell before he started for london and paris all these documents the plotletters i ii iii iv v and the rest which lie before me are mere instruments of blackmail intended to terrorise the guardians of the logans so far all is clear but in april sprot has blabbed and is arrested the forgeries are found among his papers or given up by chirnside sprot confesses to the plot to logans share of it and to the authenticity of the letters and papers he is then tortured recants his confession and avows the forgery of the papers the government is disappointed in july dunbar comes down from town treats sprot leniently and gives him medical attendance sprot now confesses to his genuine knowledge of the plot but unflinchingly maintains that all the papers so far produced are forgeries based on facts why does he do this he has a better chance of pardon if he returns to the statement that they are genuine if they are the government which he must propitiate has a far stronger hand for the forgeries then defied detection however for no conceivable reason unless it be either conscience or the vanity of the artist sprot now insists on claiming the letters as his own handiwork on this point he was inaccessible to temptation if temptation was offered if he lies as to letter ii having been dictated by logan he lies by way of relapse into the habit of a lifetime and so on other points he keeps back all mention of letter iv till the last ember of hope of life is extinct it has not been hitherto known either that sprot kept back letter iv till almost his dying day or that he then at last revealed it lord cromartys averment that it was found in sprots kist was disbelieved it is true however and now we ask why did sprot keep back letter iv to the last and why having so long concealed it did he say where it was after all hope of life was over the answer can only be conjectural some might guess thus till letter iv was confessed to and found government had not received from sprot one scrap of documentary evidence that could be used against logans heirs scoundrel as he was sprot could not guess that the privy council would use papers which were confessed forgeries to save dunbar and balmerino from paying some marks to logans executors the wretched sprot had robbed the orphans on a small scale but he would not by producing the genuine logan letter enable the lords to ruin them utterly bad as he was the laird had been kind to sprot therefore he kept back and by many a lie concealed his real pieces of evidence letter iv and i if i is genuine so far he acted on a remnant of natural conscience but sprot alas had a religious conscience he had a soul to be saved the preachers had prayed with him when death was but fortyeight hours distant he feared to die with a lie in his mouth so now at last he spoke of letter iv as his real model perhaps he hoped that it would not be found and probably it was in some secret drawer or false bottom of his kist it was found and was used along with the confessed forgeries which even sprot could not have anticipated to destroy the inheritance of the children at logans posthumous trial in but the obvious reply to this hypothesis is that letter iv by the evidence of modern experts evidence unanimous and irresistible is just as much forged as all the rest is just as certainly in sprots imitation of logans handwriting this being so why did sprot keep it back so long and why having kept it back did he almost in his last hour produce it and say if he did that it was genuine and his model as it certainly was this is the last enigma of sprot his motives defy my poor efforts to decipher them even if the substance of iv is genuine what were sprots motives i do not feel assured that sprot really maintained the genuineness of the handwriting of letter iv his remark that he kept logans letter only till he forged others on it as a model certainly implies that he did not keep it after he had done his forgeries and therefore that our letter iv is confessedly not logans original certainly it is not xvi what is letter iv the crucial question now arises what is letter iv if it be genuine in substance then whatever the details of the gowrie conspiracy may have been a conspiracy there was this can only be denied by ignorance if the enterprise fails says the author of letter iv the plotters will lose their lives their lands and houses will be wrecked their very names will be extirpated and in fact james did threaten to extirpate the name of ruthven the letter deliberately means high treason the objection of calderwood and of all the ruthven apologists that sprot confessed to having forged all the letters we have shown to rest on lack of information he said at last that he had forged many papers some did not appear in court in and that he forged three letters on the model of letter iv these three letters may either be i iii and v or iii v and the torn letter the case of letter i is peculiar though it contains much that is in letter iv and might have been taken from it the repetitions need not imply copying from letter iv byron and others would say the same things on the same day to two or three correspondents letter iv is subsequent as dated to letter i and logan might say to the unknown on july what after the announced interval of ten days he said to gowrie letter i contains this remark on the nature of the plot it is not far by not unlike that form with the like stratagem whereof we had conference in cap h which may be capheaton on the english side of the border probably logan often discussed ingenious ways of catching the king new plots were hatched about once a month as cecils and the other correspondence of the age abundantly proves the plot the letter says is like that in a paduan story of a nobleman the rest of the letter is identical with the matter of iii iv and v we cannot be sure whether letter i is one of the three forged on iv or not one thing is certain letters iii and v to the unknown are modelled on iv as is the torn letter sprot said this was the case and every reader of iii v and the torn letter given above must see that he tells the truth these letters contain no invention at all they merely repeat letter iv any man who could invent iv had genius enough to alter his tunes in iii v and the torn letter but sprot never deserts his model this is an argument for the authenticity in substance of letter iv the other three contain nothing that is not in letter iv and everything that is in it except what is personal to gowrie and would be inappropriate if addressed to the unknown i iii v or to chirnside torn letter there is the mention of a paduan adventure the basis of the plot a thing that sprot is very unlikely to have invented with all my admiration for sprot i do think that the paduan touch is beyond him this occurs in letter iv the good sport that ma your lordships brother told me of a nobleman in padua it is a parasteur a propos to this purpose we have in hand this appears in letter i reckless toys of padua and in letter v bid m a remember on the sport he told me of padua the constant applause of bower this is in letter iv and in i iii v and the torn letter meeting with alexander ruthven this is in iv and in i and v the meeting at fastcastle which is to be quiet and wellprovisioned this is in iv and in i iii v lord home and mr rhynd are to know nothing this is in iv and in i and v and the torn letter utterly needless repetition the kings hunting the opportunity for the plot this is in iv and in i but that is natural directions as to returning the letters these are in iv in i iii v and the torn letter injunctions of secrecy these are in iv and i iii v and in the torn letter logan will be true although the scaffold were already set up this is a phrase of letter iv and recurs in letter iii and in the torn letter logans elevation of heart on receipt of gowries letter this occurs in iv and in v who can doubt that letter iv is the source followed servilely by the forger of the torn letter and i iii v if sprot could invent the substance of iv why was he so chary of invention in all the other letters it is clear moreover that the unknown himself is derived from a line in letter iv i have already sent another letter to the gentleman your lordship knows as the bearer will inform you of his answer the bearer is always bower so the gentleman is to be conceived as in gowries neighbourhood or on the route thither as one bearer serves both for gowrie and the gentleman therefore before july sprot who had no idea as to who the gentleman was identified the gentleman the unknown of i iii v with the laird of kinfauns near perth or with the constable of dundee but he withdrew these imputations craving the pardon of the accused thus it stands to reason that i iii v and the torn letter are forged on the model of iv sprot introduces no novelties in i iii v or the torn epistle he harps eternally on the strings of iv the only variation is v the mention of one other man with you in the proposed sail to fastcastle it is not easy for criticism to evade the conclusion that i iii v and the torn letter are indeed forgeries modelled on iv and what is iv is letter iv in substance genuine if not why did sprot keep it back till the rope was noosed for his neck a guess at his possible reasons for so keeping it back as the only real documentary evidence extant against the orphans of logan we have given but this fails if letter iv was a forgery as in handwriting it was then there are the contents of letter iv to myself and to mr anderson it does not seem probable it seems hardly credible that sprot could have invented the contents of letter iv if he did his power of rendering character might have been envied by the author of the waverley novels in iv logan is painted the main loose man but a good fellow with a master hand the thing is freely largely and spontaneously executed what especially moves me to think iv no invention is the reference to the paduan incident or romance the good sport that mr alexander told me of the nobleman of padua it is a propos to the purpose we have in hand this is casually inserted in the last words of the postscript not blazoned in the text as in the forgeries confessedly modelled on this letter the whole tone of the letter is in keeping with the alleged authors temperament it is respectful but far from servile gowrie is a great earl but logan is of an old and good name there is the genial sensualism of the man with his promise of wine and a fine hattit kit a kind of syllabub there is the joyous forward glance at an anniversary dinner with bothwell to which the kings hunting of this year shall furnish the dainty cheer hoc jocose at this dinner bothwell and gowrie old allies are to meet at logans board which may suggest that bothwell and gowrie are still working together the contempt for lord home as a conspirator in good faith he will never help his friend or harm his foe and the praises of bower are characteristic and here are in place elsewhere they are idle repetitions mere copies the apology for bad writing logan could not employ a secretary in this case is natural the two days writing agrees with sprots evidence p could sprot have invented all this and in his confessed forgeries failed to invent anything would not the fertility of his genius have hurried him into fresh developments and characteristic details appropriate to the imaginary correspondent whom he addresses these considerations may seem a mere leaning on internal evidence and literary instinct broken reeds but the case is buttressed by the long and on any theory purposeless retention of letter iv the secrecy concerning it and the confession so obviously true that letter iv is the source and model of the forgeries these facts have hitherto been unknown to writers who believed the whole correspondence to be a forgery done for the government both mr anderson who has greatly aided me by his acuteness and learned experience of old mss and myself disbelieve that logans hand wrote letter iv the matter the contents of letter iv may be logans but the existing document may be a sprot after logan sprot may have reinserted the genuine logan iv among bowers collection of papers pretended to find it and returned it to logan after copying it in logans hand or he may have copied it in his course hand the copy in the haddington mss and later in autumn after logans death have rewritten his copy in an imitation of logans hand the contents mr anderson believes as i do are none the less genuine logan if readers accept these conclusions there was a gowrie conspiracy and logan was in it i trow your lordship has a proof of my constancy already ere now he says in letter iv and gowrie may have had a proof in his early conspiracies of or in a testimonial to logan from bothwell gowries old ally but if readers do not accept our conclusions they may still rest perhaps on the arguments adduced in the earlier chapters of this essay to demonstrate that neither accident nor the machinations of the king but an enterprise of their own caused the slaughter of the ruthvens the infamous conduct of the privy council in does not prove that in the king carried out a conspiracy in itself impossible i have found nothing tending to show that king james was ever made aware of sprots confessions of forgery it is true that sir william hart the lord justice went to court after sprots death and in september the scottish privy council asked james to send him home again but hart need not have told all the truth to james there is a kind of rejoicing naivete in all of jamess references to the gowrie affair which seems to me hardly consistent with his disbelief in his own prowess on that occasion if one may conjecture one would guess that the privy council and the four preachers managed to persuade themselves sprot being the liar whom we know that he lied when he called his logan papers forgeries the real facts may have been concealed from the king mr gunton the librarian at hatfield informs me that had he not seen letter iv which he is sure was written by sprot he does not think he should have suspected the genuineness of letters ii and iii after comparing them with the undoubted letters of logan in the cecil manuscripts the government and the four preachers with such documents in their hands documents still apt to delude may easily have brought themselves to disbelieve sprots assertion that they were all forgeries let us hope that they did xvii inferences as to the casket letters the affair of sprot has an obvious bearing on that other mystery the authenticity of the casket letters attributed to queen mary as we know she though accused was never allowed to see the letters alleged to be hers we know that in december these documents were laid before an assembly of english nobles at hampton court they were compared for orthography and handwriting with genuine letters written by the queen to elizabeth and cecil tells us that no difference was found it was a rapid examination by many persons on a brief winter day partly occupied by other business if experts existed we are not informed that they were present the casket letters have disappeared since the death of the elder gowrie in from him elizabeth had vainly sought to purchase them they were indispensable said bowes her ambassador to the secrecy of the cause gowrie would not be tempted and it is not improbable that he carried so valuable a treasure with him when in april he retired to dundee to escape by sea if the angus conspiracy failed at dundee he was captured after defending the house in which he was residing that house was pulled down recently nothing was discovered but fable runs that at the destruction of another ancient house in dundee lady warks stairs a packet of old letters in french was found in a hiding hole contrived within a chimney the letters were not examined by any competent person and nobody knows what became of them romance relates that they were the casket letters entrusted by gowrie to a friend it is equally probable that he yielded them to the king when he procured his remission for the raid of ruthven in any case they are lost consequently we cannot compare the casket letters with genuine letters by mary on the other hand as i chanced to notice that genuine letters of logans exist at hatfield i was enabled by the kindness of the marquis of salisbury and of sir stair agnew to have both the hatfield logan letters and the alleged logan letters produced in photographed and compared at hatfield and at the general register house in edinburgh by good fortune the earl of haddington also possesses what we could not expect to find in the case of the casket letters documents in the ordinary handwriting of george sprot the confessed forger of the plotletters attributed to logan the result of comparison has been to convince mr gunton at hatfield mr anderson in edinburgh professor hume brown and other gentlemen of experience that sprot forged all the plotletters their reasons for holding this opinion entirely satisfy me and have been drawn up by mr anderson in a convincing report to put the matter briefly the forged letters present the marked peculiarities of logans orthography noted by the witnesses in but they also contain many peculiarities of spelling which are not logans but are sprots the very dotting of the is is sprots not logans the long s of logan is heavily and clumsily imitated there is a distinct set of peculiarities never found in logans undisputed letters in sprots own letters always found the hand is more rapid and flowing than that of logan not being myself familiar with the scottish handwriting of the period my own opinion is of no weight but i conceive that the general effect of logans hand in is not precisely like that of the plotletters my point however is that in sprots forgeries were clever enough to baffle witnesses of unblemished honour very familiar with the genuine handwriting of logan the rev alexander watson minister of the kirk of coldinghame where logan was wont to attend alleged that the character of every letter resembles perfectly roberts handwrit every way the spelling which was peculiar was also logans as a rule mr watson produced three genuine letters by logan before the lords of the articles who were very sceptical and satisfied them that the plotletters were the lairds mr alexander smith minister of chirnside was tutor to logans younger children he gave identical evidence sir john arnott provost of edinburgh a man of distinction and eminence produced four genuine letters by the laird agreeing perfectly in spelling and character with the plotletters the sheriff clerk of berwick william home in aytoun mill a guest i think at logans great yules and john home notary in eyemouth coincided the minister of aytoun mr william hogg produced a letter of logan to the laird of aytoun but was not absolutely so certain as the other witnesses he thinks them the plotletters like to be his writing and that the same appear to be very like his write by the conformity of letters and spelling a thus at the examination of logans real and forged letters as at the examination of queen marys real and casket letters in spelling and handwriting no difference was found yet the plotletters were all forged and mr anderson shows that though no difference was found many differences existed logan had a better chance of acquittal than mary the lords of the articles writes sir thomas hamilton to the king june had preconceived hard opinions of restalrigs process b yet they were convinced by the evidence of the witnesses and by their own eyes from the error of the lords of the articles in it obviously follows that the english lords at hampton court in may have been unable to detect proofs of forgery in the casket letters which if the casket letters could now be compared with those of mary would be at once discovered by modern experts in short the evidence as to marys handwriting even if as unanimously accepted by the english lords as cecil declares is not worth a hardhead a debased copper scottish coin it is worth no more than the opinion of the lords of the articles in the case of the letters attributed to restalrig appendices appendix a the frontispiece gowries arms and ambitions the frontispiece of this volume is copied from the design of the earl of gowries arms in what is called workmans ms at the lyons office in edinburgh the shield displays within the royal treasure the arms of ruthven in the first and fourth those of cameron and halyburton in the second and third quarters the supporters are dexter a goat sinister a ram the crest is a rams head the motto is not given it was deid schaw the shield is blotted by transverse strokes of the pen the whole rude design having been made for the purpose of being thus scored out after gowries death posthumous trial and forfeiture in on the left of the sinister supporter is an armed man in the gowrie livery his left hand grasps his swordhilt his right is raised to an imperial crown hanging above him in the air from his lips issue the words tibi soli for thee alone sir james balfour paul lyon informs me that he knows no other case of such additional supporter or whatever the figure ought to be called this figure does not occur on any known ruthven seal it is not on that of the first earl of gowrie affixed to a deed of february it is not on a seal used in by john third earl given in henry laings catalogue of scottish seals vol i under ruthven but in crawfords peerage of scotland p the writer gives the arms of the third earl john the victim of august in place of the traditional scottish motto deid schaw is the latin translation facta probant the writer says note c this from an authentic copy of his arms richly illuminated in the year with his name and titles viz joannes ruthven comes de gowry dominus de ruthven c in my hands in as the archives of the faculty of law in the university of padua show gowrie was a student of padua it is also probable that in he attained his majority he certainly had his arms richly illuminated and he added to his ancestral bearings what crawfurd describes thus on the dexter a chivaleer garnishd with the earls coat of arms pointing with a sword upward to an imperial crown with this device tibi soli in workmans ms the figure points to the crown with the open right hand and the left hand is on the swordhilt the illuminated copy of once in the possession of crawfurd must be the more authentic the figure here points the sword at a crown which is tibi soli for thee gowrie alone now on no known ruthven seal as we saw does this figure appear not even on a seal of gowrie himself used in thus it is perhaps not too daring to suppose that gowrie when in italy in added this emblematic figure to his ancestral bearings what does the figure symbolise on this point we have a very curious piece of evidence on june ottavio baldi wrote from venice to james now king of england his letter was forwarded by sir henry wotton baldi says that he has received from sir robert douglas and is sending to the king by his nephew a cambridge student a strange relique out of this country he obtained it thus sir robert douglas while at home in scotland had heard speech of a certain emblem or impresa left by gowrie in padua meeting a scot in padua douglas asked where this emblem now was and he was directed to the school of a teacher of dancing there the emblem hung among other devices and remembrances of his scholars douglas had a copy of the emblem made and immediately acquainted me with the quality of the thing says baldi we agreed together that it should be fit if possible to obtain the very original itself and to leave in the room thereof the copy that he had already taken which he did effect by well handling the matter thus hath your majesty now a view in umbra of those detestable thoughts which afterwards appeared in facto according to the said earls own mot for what other sense or allusion can the reaching at a crown with a sword in a stretched posture and the impersonating of his device in a blackamore yield to any intelligent and honest beholder from baldis letter we learn that in the device left by gowrie at padua the figure pointing a sword at the crown was a negro thus varying from the figure in workmans ms and that in the illuminated copy emblazoned in and possessed in by crawfurd next we learn that sir robert douglas had heard talk of this emblem in scotland before he left for italy lastly a mot on the subject by the earl himself was reported to the effect that the device set forth in a shadow what was intended to be executed in very deed now how could sir robert douglas in scotland hear talk of what had been done and said years ago by gowrie in padua sir robert douglas was descended from archibald douglas of glenbervie ob who was ancestor of the catholic earl of angus flor this archibald of glenbervie had a son archibald named in his fathers testament but otherwise unknown rather senior to gowrie at the university of padua and in the same faculty of law was an archibald douglas he may have been a kinsman of sir robert douglas himself of the glenbervie family and from him sir robert while still in scotland may have heard of gowries device left by him at padua and of his mot about in umbra and in facto but even if these two douglases were not akin or did not meet still keith lindsay and ker of newbattle all contemporaries of gowrie at padua might bring home the report of gowries enigmatic device and of his mot thereanent had the emblem been part of the regular arms of ruthven sir robert douglas and every scot of quality would have known all about it and seen no mystery in it it will scarcely be denied that the assumption by gowrie of the figure in his livery pointing a sword at the crown and exclaiming for thee only does suggest that wildly ambitious notions were in the young mans mind what other sense can the emblem bear how can such ideas be explained in an anonymous and dateless ms cited in the life of john earl of gowrie by the rev john scott of perth it is alleged that elizabeth in april granted to gowrie then in london the guard and honours appropriate to a prince of wales the same mr scott suggests a royal pedigree for gowrie his mother wife of william first earl was dorothea stewart described in a list of scottish nobles as sister of umquhile lord methven now henry stewart lord methven lord muffin as henry viii used to call him was the third husband of the sister of henry viii margaret tudor wife first of james iv then of the earl of angus by whom she had margaret countess of lennox and grandmother of james vi then of lord methven now if margaret tudor had issue by henry stewart lord methven and if that issue was dorothea mother of john third earl of gowrie or was dorotheas father or mother that earl was elizabeths cousin now burnet touching on the gowrie mystery says that his own father had taken great pains to inquire into that matter and did always believe it was a real conspiracy upon the kings death gowrie stood next to the succession of the crown of england namely as descended from margaret tudor by henry burnet says francis lord methven margaret and methven says burnet had a son made lord methven by james v in the patent he is called frater noster uterinus our brother uterine he had only a daughter who was mother or grandmother to the earl of gowrie so that by this he might be glad to put the king out of the way that so he might stand next to the succession of the crown of england if this were true the meaning of gowries device would be flagrantly conspicuous but where is that patent of james v burnet conceivably speaks of it on the information of his father who took great pains to inquire into the particulars of that matter so that he could tell his son one thing which none of the historians have taken any notice of namely our gowries tudor descent and his claims failing james and his issue to the crown of england now burnets father was almost a contemporary of the gowrie affair of the preachers of that period the kings enemies burnets father knew mr davidson ob and mr robert bruce and had listened to their prophecies he told me says burnet of many of their predictions that he himself heard them throw out which had no effect davidson was an old man in bruce for his disbelief in jamess account of the conspiracy was suspended in that year though he lived till and doubtless prophesied in select circles mr bruce long lay concealed in the house of burnets greatgrandmother daughter of sir john arnot a witness in the trial of logan of restalrig thus burnets father had every means of knowing the belief of the contemporaries of gowrie and he may conceivably be burnets source for the tale of gowries tudor descent and royal claims they were almost or rather quite baseless but they were current in fact dorothea stewart mother of gowrie was certainly a daughter of henry stewart lord methven and of janet stewart of the house of atholl we find no trace of issue born to margaret tudor by her third husband lord methven yet gowries emblem adopted by him at padua in and his device left in the paduan dancing school do distinctly point to some wild idea of his that some crown or other was for him alone at the trial of gowries father in we find mention of his challenginge that honor to be of his hignes blud but that must refer to the relationship of the ruthvens and the king through the angus branch of the douglases a this question as to the meaning of gowries emblem came rather early into the controversy william sanderson in published lives of mary and of james vi he says i have a manuscript which relates that in padua the earl of gowrie among other impressa sic in a fencing school caused to be painted for his devise a hand and sword aiming at a crown b mr scott in replied that the device with the ruthven arms is engraven on a stone taken from gowrie house in perth and preserved in the house of freeland a ruthven house there is also i have been told a seal with the same engraving upon it which probably had been used by the earls of gowrie and by their predecessors the lords of ruthven a but we know of no such seal among gowrie or ruthven seals nor do we know the date of the engraving on stone cited by mr scott in his opinion the armed man and crown might be an addition granted by james iii to william first lord ruthven in ruthven took the part of the unhappy king who was mysteriously slain near bannockburn mr scott then guesses that this addition of implied that the armed man pointed his sword at the crown and exclaimed tibi soli meaning for thee o james iii alone not for thy rebellious son james iv it may be so but we have no evidence for the use of the emblem before moreover in gowries arms in workmans ms the sword is sheathed again the emblem at padua showed a blackamore or negro and sir robert douglas could not but have recognised that the device was only part of the ancestral ruthven arms if that was the case the blackamore was horrifying to ottavio baldi as implying a dark intention here we leave the additional and certainly curious mystery of gowries claims as shadowed in his chosen emblem i know not if it be germane to the matter to add that after bothwell in had seized james by the aid of our gowries mother and sister he uttered a singular hint to toby matthew dean of durham he intruded himself on the horrified dean hot from his successful raid described with much humour the kidnapping of the untrussed monarch and let it be understood that he was under the protection of elizabeth that there was a secret candidate for jamess crown and that he expected to be himself lieutenant of the realm of scotland bothwell was closely lie with lady gowrie dorothea stewart and our gowrie presently joined him in a band to serve elizabeth and subdue james b appendix b the

dark staircase from a door of the dininghall on the first floor such a door existed according to lord hailes but when he wrote no traces of this arrangement were extant if such a door there was henderson may have slunk into the hall out of the dark staircase and slipped forth again at the moment when robertson in his first deposition swore to having seen him but murray of arbany cannot well

that there was any harm in an invitation to join a hunting party james is next accused of trying to stifle the rumour about this letter by a direct denial this means that craigengelt gowries caterer

declared that he had no promise of benefit to his family but calderwood declares or says that others declare that sprot was really condemned as a forger which is untrue but confessed to the gowrie

official draft of his last moments from its interlineations each signed by the clerk of council appears to have been drawn up on the spot or hurriedly as soon as sprot was dead this is the aspect of
