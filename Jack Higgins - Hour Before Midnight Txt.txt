jack higgins in the hour before midnight for ken and janet swinhoeand the other amy one i suppose he must have died during the night but i only became aware of it in the heat of the day not that it made much difference not even the stench of putrefaction in that place everything died except me stacey wyatt the great survivor there had been times when i would have greeted death as a friend cooperated with him actively but that was long agotoo long now i waited in a limbo of my own devising proof against all they could do to me id been in the hole for three days now which was what it was called by prisoner and guard alikea place of darkness and furnace heat where you rotted in your own filth and died from lack of air it was the fourth time id been put down since theyd brought me to the labour camp at fuad each dose coinciding with one of major husseinis inspections in the june war he had been one of the thousands whipped in sinai and left to stumble home through one of the worst deserts on earth he had seen his command crumble men die around him by the hundred from thirst and the sun had burned its way into his brain starting a fire that could never be put out leaving him with a hatred for israel which had developed into a kind of paranoia he seemed to see jews everywhere a constant threat to egypts safety as i was an enemy of his country tried and convicted by law of subversive activities i too must be a jew who had somehow managed to conceal the fact from the court the previous july id brought a fortyfoot launch in from crete with gold bullion for a gentleman from cairo who was supposed to meet me on a beach at rѓs el kanѓyis part of a complicated exchange process by which someone somewhere finally made a fortune i never did find out exactly what went wrong but a couple of uar gunboats appeared rather inconveniently plus a half company of infantry on the beach the economy benefited to the extent of half a ton of gold and john smith this years unknown american citizen went down for seven years after six months in a city gaol they transferred me to fuad a fishing village ninety miles from alex there were about thirty of us there mostly political offenders condemned to work on the roads in chain gangs although in this case we were building a new pier we were guarded by half a dozen peasant conscripts and a civilian overseer called tufik a large fat man who sweated a lot and smiled all the time he had two wives and eight children and treated us with remarkable gentleness under the circumstances although i think he was due a bonus if we finished by the end of july which meant that he needed all the labour he could get and didnt want anyone to die on him the man who had gone to a happier place during the night had been a special case a bedu from the south who had repeatedly tried to escape a fierce proud animal who had never slept under a roof in his life for him any kind of prison had been an automatic deathsentence and everyone had known that even tufik but there was general camp discipline to consider and hed gone into the hole to encourage the others hed already been there a week when i joined him i was wearing a kind of wooden halter padlocked around the neck my wrists chained to it at shoulder level it was impossible to lie down or even to stand for if i tried within those narrow confines the ends of the halter caught against the rough walls jarring my neck painfully so i sat there in the heat floating in my own dark limbo reading my favourite books page by page an excellent mental exercise or when that palled returning to the next phase of a monumental and highly personal course of selfanalysis i had started with childhood the earliest memorieswyatts landing ten miles from cape cod and my fathers family who had never liked me although i hadnt realised that fact until his death in korea in nineteen fiftythree when i was ten it was only afterwards that it was made plain that the wyatt blood in me was tainted for my mother was sicilian so to sicily we went to the great cool villa on the cliffs above the sea outside palermo to my grandfather vito barbaccia to whom men touched their hats who ordered the police from here to there like chessmen who scowled and made the politicians tremble vito barbaccia capo mafia lord of life and death i was working my way through my freshman year at harvard when there was a sudden banging above my head a chain rattled and from the scraping i knew that the stones were being pulled away when the wooden trap was lifted the sunlight flooded in momentarily blinding me i closed my eyes blinked and looked through a soft golden haze that told me it was late afternoon major husseini crouched at the edge small and wizened dried up by the sinai sun that had deranged him his olive face pitted from the smallpox a couple of soldiers stood beside him and tufik was there look ing distinctly unhappy so jew husseini said in english for although my arabic had understandably improved over the past ten months he considered it an insult to use the language of his fathers with someone like me he stood up and laughed contemptuously look at him he gestured to the others squatting in his own excrement like an animal he looked down at me again do you like that jew you like to sit there smeared with your own dung its not so bad major i told him in arabic a monk once asked bodidharma what is buddha the master replied dried dung he stared down at me in a kind of bewilderment so perplexed that he momentarily lapsed into arabic himself what are you talking about youd need brains to make sense of it the trouble was that as id used arabic they all understood the skin tightened across his cheeks and the eyes contracted he turned to tufik have him up hang him in the sun for a while ill deal with him when i get back something to look forward to i said and for some reason started to laugh weakly there wasnt much to fuad forty or fifty small flatroofed houses around a wide square a crumbling mosque no more than a couple of hundred inhabitants it was miserably poor like most of these egyptian villages although the new pier was supposed to change all that the sea was about four hundred yards away the blue mediterranean nice to be beside if you were on the beach at antibes i got a quick glimpse of it before they removed my halter and strung me by the wrists from a kind of wooden gallows in the centre of the square it was supposed to be painful and would have been under normal circumstances but i had been through so much during those past months that pain in itself meant very little to me any longer in the heat of the day it would have been unpleasant but not now in the late afternoon in any case i had discovered from past experience that by focusing on some object in the middle distance a kind of selfhypnosis could be induced that made two or three hours seem considerably less beside the guard post a united arab republic flag drooped from a whitepainted flagstaff and beyond three men and a boy were driving a flock of several hundred sheep in from the desert the thick cloud of dust raised by their hooves was blown towards the village like spreading smoke and the flag listed momentarily it was all very biblical very old testament except that one of the shepherds carried an automatic rifle which proved something although i wasnt sure what god but i was dry i closed my eyes and breathed deeply for a while when i opened them again nothing had changed the same square the same squalid little houses the same uncanny lack of people they had sense and were staying indoors while husseini was around tufik emerged from his office with a canteen of water and crossed towards me sweat springing from every pore it was an effort for him to scramble up on to the old packing case that the two guards had stood on when stringing me up but he made it and forced the neck of the canteen between my teeth he gave me a short swallow and poured the rest over my head you will be reasonable mr smith when he returns promise me that it will only be worse for you if you annoy him further he stared at me anxiously mopping his face with a soiled handkerchief i was intrigued for one thing hed called me mister certainly the first time that had happened and he was worried about metoo worried it didnt really make sense but husseini arrived before i could take it further his landrover scattered the sheep a hundred yards on the other side of the village and braked to a halt outside the guard post husseini got out and came towards me he stood perhaps ten yards away staring up at me his eyes full of hate then turned abruptly and went into the guard post the sheep arrived flooding in between the houses spilling across the square as they pushed towards the pool on the far side the boy i had noticed earlier was perhaps ten or eleven small and dark and full of energy running up and down whistling and flapping his arms in the air to keep them on the move his three companions were typical bedu in shabby robes each man with his burnous folded across his face as a protection against the heavy dust raised by the sheep they passed by heads down pushing the flock hard minding their own business bells clanking in the stillness it was very quiet the sun halfway below the horizon now another thirty minutes and the gang would be returning from the pier and their days work the sheep were at the water fighting each other for the best positions and the shepherds squatted against a wall watching them the door of the guard post opened and husseini emerged and came towards me the two soldiers at his heels when they cut me down i collapsed in a heap on the ground he said something or other i couldnt quite catch what it was and they picked me up between them and followed him across the square to tufiks place the fat man lived alone except for some old woman who came in each day to cook and wash for him and the house he had commandeered doubled as an office there was a rolltop desk two wooden chairs and a table husseini barked an order and the two soldiers sat me on one of the chairs and bound my arms firmly it was then that i noticed his whip real rhino from the look of it guaranteed to take the flesh from a mans spine he took off his tunic and started to roll up his sleeves very carefully tufik looked frightened to death and sweated more than ever the two soldiers stood against the wall and husseini picked up the whip now jew he said bending it like a bow in his two hands to start with a dozen after that we shall see major husseini a voice said softly in english husseini turned sharply and i lifted my head beyond him in the doorway stood one of the shepherds his right hand went to his burnous pulling it away revealing a tanned wedgeshaped face and the kind of mouth that looked as if it might twist into a smile at any moment but seldom did grey eyes cold as water over stone sean i croaked sean burke could that be you as ever was stacey his left hand came out of his robe holding a browning automatic his first shot took husseini in the shoulder twisting him round so that i looked into his face as he died the second blew away the back of his head driving him past me and into the wall the two soldiers stared stupidly eyes widening in horror their rifles still slung from their shoulders and died that way as a machine pistol smashed through the window and cut them down in two long bursts there was a kind of silence and tufik was the first to speak the words falling over themselves to get out i was worried terribly worried i thought you werent coming that something might have gone wrong burke ignored him he came forward slowly and leaned over me stacey he said and touched my cheek gently with his left hand stacey there was pain on his face something i had never seen before and then that terrible killing rage for which he was so notorious he turned on tufik what have you done to him tufiks eyes widened what have i done effendi but i am the one who has made all this possible ive just decided i dont like your prices the browning swept up tufik cried out in fear and cowered in the corner i shook my head and said weakly leave him alone sean he could have been worse just get me out of here there was a momentary hesitation and then the browning disappeared inside the robe tufik slid down on to his knees and started to cry weakly i might have known who the other two would be piet jaeger the south african one of the few survivors of our old company in the katanga campaign and legrande the ex oas man burke had recruited in stanleyville when we had reformed jaegar was driving husseinis landrover and legrande helped burke lift me into the back seat nobody said very much and there was obviously some kind of timetable in operation fuad was still quiet as the grave when we drove out along the socalled coast road passing the column of prisoners marching in from their days work on the way you havent got long i whispered burke nodded were dead on time dont worry a mile further on jaeger swung off the road and took us through sand dunes to the edge of a broad flat beach as he switched off the motor another sound filled the air and a plane came in off the sea no more than two or three hundred feet above the surface of the water legrande produced a verey pistol and fired a flare and the plane turned sharply and dropped in for a perfect landing it was a cessna i recognised that much as it taxied towards us but there was no time to stand around they hustled me forward as the cabin door swung open and pushed me inside the others followed and as legrande fastened the door the cessna was already turning into the wind her engine note deepening burke held a flask to my mouth and i choked as brandy burned its way into my stomach when the coughing had subsided i smiled weakly where to now colonel first stop crete he said well be there in an hour good thing too you could do with a bath i took the flask from him and swallowed again and leaned back in my seat as a warm and wonderful glow spread throughout my body life began again that was all i could think of as the cessna lifted into the air and turned out to sea the sun died behind the horizon and night fell two i first met sean burke in lourenco marques in portuguese mozambique in the early part of in a waterfront cafe called the lights of lisbon i was playing piano at the time one of the more useful byproducts of an expensive education but wholly for money for reasons which arent important at the moment i was an aimless drifter at the grand old age of nineteen working my way from cairo to the cape in easy stages i was in lourenco marques because id only had enough money to take me that far on boarding the coastal steamer at mombasa which didnt worry me particularly i was young and fit running so hard from the past that my only concern was to discover what lay beyond each days horizon in any case i liked lourenco marques it had a kind of baroque charm and in those days at least a complete absence of the kind of racial tensions id noticed elsewhere in africa the man who ran the lights of lisbon was named coimbra a thin cadaverous portuguese with one interest in lifemoney he had a hand in most things as far as i could judge and didnt have a scruple in the world whatever you wanted coimbra could get it for you at a price we boasted the finest selection of girls on the coast i noticed burke the moment he came in although his enormous physique would have made him stand out anywhere i think that was the thing which struck one most about himthe air of sheer physical competence and controlled power that made men move out of his way even in a place like that he was dressed for the bush in felt hat shooting jacket khaki pants and sand boots one of the girls made a pass at him a quadroon with a skin like honey and the kind of body that would have had a bishop on his knees burke looked through her not over her as if she simply didnt exist and ordered a drink the girl was called lola and as wed been more than good friends i felt like telling him he was missing out on a damn good thing but maybe that was just the whisky talking in those days i wasnt too used to it and it was dangerously cheap when i looked up he was standing watching a glass of beer in one hand you want to lay off that stuff he said as i poured another it wont do you any good not in this climate my funeral i suppose that was the right kind of reply for the tough footloose adventurer i fondly imagined myself to be at that time and i toasted him he challenged me calmly his face quite expressionless and when i raised the glass to my lips it took a real physical effort the whisky tasted foul i gagged and put the glass down hurriedly a hand to my mouth his expression didnt change the barman tells me youre english which was what i thought he was at the time for his irish upbringing was indicated more by tricks of speech and phrasing than accent i shook my head american you dont sound like it i spent what they term the formative years in europe he nodded i dont suppose you can play the lark in the clear air as ever was i said and moved into a reasonably straight rendering of the beautiful old irish folk song it lacked john mccormack but wasnt bad though i do say it myself he nodded soberly when i finished youre goodtoo good for this place thanks i said is it all right if i smoke ill tell the barman to send you a beer he replied gravely he returned to the bar and a moment later one of coimbras flunkeys tapped him on the shoulder there was a short conversation and they went upstairs together lola came across yawning hugely youre losing your touch i told her the englishman she shrugged ive met his kind before half a man big in everything except what counts she moved on and i sat there thinking about what she had said working my way through a slow blues at that time i was inclined to think she was talking into the wind probably out of a kind of professional pique at being snubbed a man didnt have to be the other thing just because he wasnt particularly attracted to women although ive never seen any virtue in not indulging at every opportunity in what is one of lifes greatest pleasures as far as im concerned the sicilian half of me discovered women early i came to the end of the number i was playing and lit a cigarette for some reason there was one of those sudden lulls that you sometimes get with a crowd anywhere everyone seemed to stop talking and the whole thing became curiously dreamlike it was as if i was outside looking into the packed room and things moved in a kind of slow motion what was i doing here on the rim of the dark continent africa all around me faces everywhere looming through the smoke black white brown and subtle variations in between riffraff not even a common humanity holding us together all running from something suddenly id had enough in a way id taken a look not so much at myself as i was then but at what i would soon become and i didnt like what id seen i was hot and sticky sweat trickling from my armpits and i decided to change my shirt i realise now of course that i was only looking for some excuse to go upstairs my room was on the third floor coimbras apartment on the second the girls being down below as a rule it was quiet up there because that was the way coimbra liked it but now as i paused at the end of the passage i was aware again of that same strange stillness i had experienced earlier the voices when i heard them seemed far away and i walked on aware that someone was speaking angrily the first door opened into a kind of anteroom i went in cautiously and moved through darkness to where a thousand fingers of light pierced a lattice screen coimbra was seated at his desk one of his heavies gilberto at his back holding a gun herrara the man who had brought burke up from the cafe leaned against the door arms folded burke was standing a couple of yards away from the desk legs slightly apart hands in the pockets of his bush jacket i could see him in profile and his face might have been carved from stone you dont seem to understand coimbra was saying no one was interested in your proposition its as simple as that and my five thousand dollars coimbra looked as if he was fast losing his patience i have been put to considerable expense in this matter considerable expense im sure you have now you are being sensible major in business these things happen one must be prepared to take risks for quick returns and now you must excuse me my men will escort you this is a rough district it would desolate me if anything were to happen to you im sure it would burke said dryly gilberto smiled for the first time and hefted the luger in his hand and burke took off his bush hat wiping his face with the back of his right hand looking suddenly beaten but i could see what they could not inside the crown of his hat an old shortbarrelled bankers special was held in place by a spring clip he shot gilberto from cover so to speak slamming him back against the wall turned and covered herrara who was starting to draw i dont think so burke said and i was aware of the power in the man the vital force he made herrara face the wall and searched him quickly and coimbra man of surprises to the end opened a silver cigar box and produced a small automatic i had a friend once who took up golf and was a scratch man within three months he had a natural flair for the game just as some people have language kinks and others can rival computers in mental calculation on one memorable sunday afternoon during my first month at harvard another student took me to a local pistol club id never fired a gun in my life yet when he put a colt woodsman in my hand and told me what to do i experienced a new feeling the gun became a part of me and the things i did with it in one short hour had astonished everyone there so i was a natural shot with something of a genius for hand guns but i had never aimed at a human being what happened next seemed so natural that in retrospect it was frightening i flung open the door dropped to one knee and grabbed for gilbertos luger where it lay on the floor in the same moment i shot coimbra through the hand burke swung crouched for action a tiger ready to spring his own gun in one hand herraras in the other although i didnt realise it then it said a lot for his control that he didnt shoot me as a reflex action he gave me one brief glance and i thought he would smile instead he opened the outside door listened then closed it again the kind of place where people mind their own business i told him he walked slowly to the desk gilberto crouched against the wall clutching his chest blood at the corner of his mouth his eyes were open but he was obviously in deep shock coimbra had gone very pale and held his right hand under his left arm as if trying to stop the bleeding burke touched him between the eyes with the barrel of his revolver five thousand dollars even then coimbra hesitated and i put in quickly theres a safe inside the walnut cabinet by the door burke thumbed back the hammer of his revolver with an audible click and coimbra said hastily the key is in the cigar box under the tray get it burke told me bring whatever you find there was certainly considerably more than five thousand dollars in the cash box i brought to the desk although i never did find out exactly how much burke took the lot the neat packets of banknotes vanishing into the capacious pockets of his bush jacket one must be prepared to take risks for quick returns isnt that what you said coimbra but coimbra was past caring and fainted across the desk herrara still leaned against the wall hands flat burke turned and hit him almost casually striking with clenched fist at the base of the skull herrara went down with a groan the bankers special was returned to its clip inside the crown of the bush hat and he replaced it on his head adjusting the angle of the brim in the mirror he turned to face me first rule in the bush he said walk dont run remember that on the way out we left by the side entrance which was usually kept open for those clients who wanted direct access to the girls and didnt welcome publicity a ford truck was parked just around the corner from the cafe an african dozing behind the wheel burke told me to get in the back spoke to the driver and joined me as the truck started to move i said where to now the old army airstrip at caruba do you know it ive only been in town a couple of weeks that job at the lights of lisbon wasnt intended to be my lifes work i was just trying to raise the price of a ticket to cape town any special reason a man has to have an aim in life he accepted it looking quite serious and nodded that was good shooting back there where did you learn when i explained he was obviously surprised at that time i didnt realise how good i must have looked because it wasnt until later that i learned that i acted instinctively like a real professional who always aims for the shootinghand with his first bullet knowing that a dying man can still get off a shot at him we moved out through the edge of town there were no longer any street lamps and we were shrouded in darkness after a while he asked if i had my passport i reached for my wallet instinctively and nodded about all i have got and then as if it had only just occurred to him he said my name is burke by the waysean burke stacey wyatt i hesitated didnt i hear coimbra call you major thats right i was twenty years in the british army paratroops left last year ive just been granted a commission by the katanga government the congo i said im forming a special unit to help keep order coimbra was supposed to find me a few men the bastard didnt even try now ive got an old dc waiting at the airstrip and no one to fly out in her except me the words were out without thought and impossible to go back on even if id wanted to there was pride for one thing but there was more to it than that for some reason i found that i wanted his approval i dont suppose a psychologist would have had much difficulty in analysing the situation id lost my father too early in life for a growing boy plus the whole of that side of my family now i was running hard trying to erase the memory of the events of the last few terrible months that had taken my mother and had left me with only one individual on top of earth who really cared for memy grandfather the one person i was afraid to love burkes voice cut in on my thoughts you mean it he said softly coimbra was the first person i ever shot at in my life i told him i think i should make that clear in fairness to you four hundred thousand francs a month he said and all found including a shroud i hear its rough up there he changedaltered completely became almost a different person he laughed out of the darkness reached over and squeezed my arm ill teach you staceyeverything you need to know well cut a path from one end of the congo to the other and come out laughing with our pockets full of gold thunder rumbled beyond the horizon like distant drums and rain started to fall heavy and warm thumping against the canvas roof the air was electric i was seized with excitement i suppose the simple fact was that i wanted to be like him tough unafraid not caring able to look the world straight in the eye and stare it down god but i was happy thenhappy for the first time in years as the truck lurched through the night filling my nostrils with the dust of africa three burkes bastards that was the name some newspaperman came up with after that first foray into katanga we lost a lot of men but others lost more and the newspaper stories certainly helped recruiting they built burke up into something of a legend for a while and then forgot him but by then our reputation as an elite corps was secure there was no more difficulty in finding men and burke was able to pick and choose and they were marvellous daysthe best i had ever known hard living hard training i felt my strength then for the first time tried my courage and found as i suspect most men do that i could keep going when afraid which when you come down to it is all that really matters burke was never satisfied during one lull between engagements he even forced us through paratroop training dropping over lumba airport from an old de havilland rapide a month later we used it for real and parachuted into a mission station in the kasai just ahead of a force of simbas we pushed our way out through a couple of hundred miles of unfriendly bush bringing eight nuns with us they made burke a colonel for that little jaunt and i got a captains commission around the time i would have been in my third year at harvard life was good then full of action and passion as it should be and the money poured in as he had promised it would two years later those of us who were left were lucky to get out in what we stood up in contrary to popular opinion most mercenaries in the congo were there for the same reason that young men used to join the foreign legion it was what happened when you experienced the reality that was the trouble i had seen what was left of settlers who had been quartered on the buzz saw of a lumber mill i had also known mercenaries who had been in the habit of disposing of prisoners by locking them inside old ammunition boxes and dropping them into lake kivu but only when they were too tired to use them for target practice in between the two extremes i had changed but piet jaeger hadnt altered in the slightest he came from the sort of bush town in the northern transvaal where they still believed kaffirs didnt have souls and was one of the few survivors of the original commando strangely enough when one considered his background piet was no racialist he had joined us because the chance of a little action and some money in his pocket contrasted favourably with the family farm and the kind of father who carried a bible in one hand and a sjambok in the other which he was as likely to use on piet as the kaffirs who were unfortunate enough to work for him he had stayed because he worshipped burke had followed him gladly to hell and back and would again without a qualm i watched him now in the mirror as he removed my beard with infinite care a bronzed young god with closecropped fair hair a casting directors dream for the part of the young ss officer torn by conscience who sacrifices himself for the girl in the final scene legrande leaned in the doorway his amiable peasant face expressionless a gauloise drooping beneath the heavy moustache as i said most of those who went to the congo were in search of adventure but there were exceptions and legrande was one of them a killer who destroyed without mercy an oas gunman hed come to the congo for sanctuary and in spite of my youth had always shown me a kind of grudging respect i suspect for my skill at arms as much as anything else very carefully piet removed the hot towel and stood back and a stranger stared out at me from the mirror bones showing in the gaunt sunblackened face dark eyes looking through and beyond still and quiet waiting for something to happen flesh on your bones thats all you need piet said good food and lots of red wine and a woman legrande said with complete seriousness a good woman who knows what shes about balance in all things plenty of those in sicily so they tell me piet said i glanced up at him sharply but before i could ask him what he meant a woman appeared from the terrace and hesitated uncertainty on her face as she looked at us she was obviously greek and perhaps thirty or thirtyfive its hard to tell with peasant women at that age she had masses of night black hair that flowed to her shoulders an olive skin the lines just beginning to show and kind eyes legrande and piet started to laugh and piet gave the frenchman a shove towards the door well leave you to it stacey their laughter still echoed faintly after the door had closed and the woman came forward and put two clean towels and a white shirt on the bed she smiled and said something in greek it isnt one of my languages so i tried italian remembering theyd been here during the war that didnt work and neither did german i shrugged helplessly and she smiled again and for some reason ruffled my hair as if i were a schoolboy i was still sitting in front of the dressing table where piet had shaved me and she was standing very close her breasts on a level with my face she wore no perfume but the dress she had on a cheap cotton thing had just been laundered and smelt fresh and clean and womanly filling me with the kind of ache i had forgotten existed i watched her cross the room and go out through the window and i took a few very deep breaths it had been a long time a hell of a long time and legrande as always had put his finger right on the spot i took off my robe and started to dress the villa was sited on a hillside a couple of hundred feet above a white sand beach it was obviously a converted farmhouse and someone had spent a small fortune making it just right i sat at a table on the edge of the terrace in the hot sun and the woman appeared with grapefruit and scrambled eggs and bacon on a tray with a very english pot of tea my favourite breakfast burke of course he thought of everything i dont think ive ever tasted anything quite like that meal sitting there on the edge of the terrace looking out over the aegean to the cyclades drifting north into the haze there was a curious air of unreality to it all and things carried the knifeedge sharpness of the wrong kind of dream where was i here or in the hole i closed my eyes briefly opened them again and found burke watching me gravely he wore a faded bush shirt and khaki slacks an old felt hat leaving his face in shadow and carried a martini carbine keeping your hand in i asked he nodded ive been shooting at anything that moves its that kind of morning how do you feel considerably improved that doctor you provided pumped me full of one good thing after another thanks for the breakfast by the way you remembered ive known you long enough havent i he smiled that rare smile of his that almost seemed to melt whatever it was that had frozen up inside but never quite succeeded seeing him standing there in the felt hat and bush shirt i was reminded again of that first meeting in mozambique he was just the same magnificently fit with the physique of a heavyweight wrestler and the energy of a man half his age and yet there were changesslight perhaps but there to be seen for one thing the eyes were pouching slightly and there was an edge of flesh to the bones that hadnt been there before if it had been anyone else id have said theyd been drinking but liquor was something hed never shown any interest inor women if it came to that hed always barely tolerated my own need for both it was when he sat down and removed his sunglasses that i received my greatest shock the eyesthose fine grey eyeswere empty clouded with a kind of opaque skin of indifference for a brief moment when anger had blazed out of them back at fuad in the labour camp i had seen the old sean burke now i seemed to be looking at a man who had become a stranger to himself he poured a cup of tea produced a pack of cigarettes and lit one something id never seen him do before and the hand that held it trembled very very slightly ive taken up a vice or two since you last saw me stacey boy he said so it would seem was it bad back there not at first the prison in cairo was no worse than youd expect anywhere it was the labour camp that wasnt so good i dont think husseini had been right in his head since sinai he thought there was a jew under every bed he looked puzzled and i explained he nodded soberly when i finished ive seen men go that way before there was silence for a while as if he couldnt think of anything to say and i poured another cup of tea and helped myself to one of his cigarettes the smoke bit into the back of my throat like acid and i choked he started to rise immediately concerned what is it whats wrong i managed to catch my breath and held up the cigarette something i had to manage without back there it tastes like the first one i ever had dont worryill persevere but why start again i inhaled for the second time it tasted rather better and i grinned i agree with voltaire there are some pleasures its well worth shortening life for he frowned and tossed his own cigarette over the balustrade as if attempting to right some kind of balance for what i had said went completely against his own expressed beliefs for him a mana real man was completely selfsufficient a disciplined creature controlling his environment subject to no vices no obsessive needs he sat there now a slight frown still in place staring moodily into space and i watched him closely sean burke the finest most complete manatarms i had ever known the eternal soldier an achilles without a heel on the surface and yet there were depths there as i have said he seldom smiled for some dark happening had touched him in the past lived with him still his spiritual home was still the army the real army i was certain of that by all the rules he should have had a staggeringly successful career in it during his brief moment of fame in the congo the newspapers had unearthed his past in detail born in eire son of an angloirish protestant minister who had fought passionately for the republic in his day burke had joined the irish guards at seventeen during the second world war and had soon transferred to the parachute regiment hed earned a quick mc as a young lieutenant at arnhem and as a captain in malaya during the emergency a dso and promotion to major why then had he resigned there was no official explanation that made any kind of sense burke himself had said at the time that the army had simply got too tame and yet there had been a story in one paper cautiously told and full of innuendo that hinted at another explanation the possibility of a courtmartial had he not resigned that would have sent him from the army utterly disgraced and i remembered again our first meeting at the lights of lisbon what was it lola had said of him half a man big in everything except what counts it was possible all things were possible in this worst of all possible worlds but that was not true that my real self simply couldnt accept on a morning like this it was a beautiful world this world outside the hole a place of warmth and air and light sweet sounds sun and colour to dazzle the mind he stood up and leaned on the balustrade looking out over the sea quite a place isnt it i nodded who owns it a man called hofferkarl hoffer and who might he be when hes at home an austrian financier cant say ive heard of him you wouldnt he isnt too keen on newspaper publicity is he rich a millionaire and thats by my standards not your yankee one as a matter of fact that was his gold you were running the night the gypos jumped you which was an interesting piece of information millionaire financiers who indulged in a little gold smuggling on the side were about as rare within my experience as the greater bluetailed goose herr hoffer sounded like a man of infinite possibilities where is he now palermo burke said and there was a kind of eagerness in his voice as if by asking id made things easier for him which explained piets remark about the girls in sicily when you got me into the plane i asked you where we were going i said you told me crete firststop presumably sicily is the second a hundred thousand dollars split four ways plus expenses stacey he sat down again and leaned across the table fingers interlocking so tightly when he clasped his hands the knuckles showed white how does that sound to you for a contract i said a contract in sicily he nodded a weeks work at the most and easily earned with you along the whole thing was beginning to fall neatly into place by me you mean stacey the sicilian i presume sure i do whenever he got excited the irish side of him floated to the top like cream on milk with your sicilian background we cant go wrong without you i honestly think we wouldnt stand a chance thats very interesting i said but tell me something sean where would i have been sitting right this minute if this sicilian business hadnt come up if you hadnt needed me he stared at me caught at one fixed point in time like a butterfly pinned to a collectors board tried to speak and failed you bastard i said you can stick your hundred thousand dollars where grandma had the pain his hands came apart fists clenched the skin of his face turned milkwhite with the speed of a chemical reaction and something stirred in the depths of those grey eyes weve come a long way since the lights of lisbon havent we colonel i got up without waiting for a reply and left him there in the cool shadows of my bedroom anger possessed me like a living thing and my hands were shaking there was sweat on my face and i opened the top drawer in the dressing table to search for a handkerchief instead i found something else a pistolthe kind of sidearm i had always carried a replica of the one the egyptians had relieved me of on that dark night a thousand years agoa smith and wesson special with a two inch barrel in an opensided spring holster i fastened the holster to my belt slightly forward of the right hip pulled on a cream coloured linen jacket i found behind the door and slipped a box of cartridges into one of the pockets i found a pack of cards on a table in the living room as i knew i would where legrande and piet were around and went out taking a path down the hillside to the white beach below one way of releasing tension is as good as another and in any event it was obviously time to see if id forgotten anything four in facetoface combat any soldier in his right mind would rather have a good rifle in his hands than a pistol any day of the week in spite of what they say in the westerns a normal handgun isnt much use beyond fifty yards and most people would miss a barn door at ten paces having said that theres no doubt that with someone who knows what hes about theres nothing to equal a good handgun for close quarters work i used to favour a browning p automatic which is standard issue in the british army these days mainly because it gave me thirteen shots without having to reload but automatics have certain snags to them lots of bits and pieces that can go wrong and no professional gunman ive ever met would use one from choice in an ambush at kimpala i had a simba bearing down on me like an express train a threefoot panga ready in his right hand i shot him once then the pin fell on a dud round it doesnt happen all that often and in a revolver the cylinder would have kept on turning but this was an automatic the browning jammed tight and my friend doped up to the eyeballs kept right on coming we spent an interesting couple of minutes on the ground and the memory stayed with me for some time afterwards from then on i was strictly a revolver man only five rounds if you leave one chamber empty for safety but completely dependable when i got down to the beach it was calm and still the sea like a bluegreen mirror the sun so strong that the rocks were too hot to touch and light bounced back from the white sand dazzling the eye and objects blurred became indistinct i took off my jacket and loaded the smith and wesson carefully with five rounds then hefted it first in my left hand then in my right already the old alchemy was beginning to work heat burned its way through the thin soles of my shoes scoured my back became a part of me as this gun was a part the butt fitting easily to my hand nothing special about it no custombuilt grip or shaved trigger a firstrate factorymade deadly weapon just like stacey wyatt i took out the pack of cards lined five of them up in a thin crack on the edge of a lump of basalt and marked out fifteen paces there had been a time when i could draw and hit a playing card five times at that distance inside half a second but a lot had happened in between i dropped into a crouch drew and fired arm extended gun chesthigh the echoes died flatly away across the oily sea i reloaded at once and went forward two hits out of five even if the other three rounds hadnt been too far off target it still wasnt good enough i returned to the firing line adopted the conventional target stance gun at eye level and fired at each card in turn taking my time i got all five as i had expected put up fresh cards and tried again i still stayed with the target stance but this time emptied the gun fairly rapidly once more a hit on each card i was ready to go back to square one again i put up more cards turned and found burke at the bottom of the path he stood there watching anonymous in his dark glasses and i turned on the firing line drew and fired and five shots so close together that they sounded like one continuous roll as i reloaded he went forward and got the card four hitsthree close together one at twelve oclock a whisker higher and it would have missed altogether a little time stacey he said thats all you need he held out his hand and i gave him the smith and wesson he tried the balance for a moment then pivoted and fired using his own rather peculiar stance right foot so far forward that his left knee almost touched the ground gun straight out in front of him he had five hits three close together the other two straying towards the right hand edge i showed him the card without comment he nodded gravely no visible satisfaction on his face not bad not bad at all a tendency to kick to the right a little maybe you could lighten the trigger all right youve made your point i started to reload why didnt you bring the heavy brigade with you piet and legrande he shook his head this is between you and me staceyno one else a special relationship is that what youre trying to say just like america and england he didnt exactly boil over but there was anger there pulsating just beneath the surface of things all right so i got out a little later than id intended have you any idea how much organising it took what it cost he stood there waiting i think for some gesture from me and when it didnt come turned abruptly and walked to the waters edge he picked up a stone pitched it away from him halfheartedly then slumped down on a rock and sat there gazing into the distance looking strangely dejected for the first time since id known him he seemed his age i bolstered the smith and wesson and squatted beside him i offered him a cigarette without a word and he refused with a small and peculiarly characteristic gesture of one hand as if brushing something away from him whats happened sean i said youre different he moved the sunglasses ran a hand over his face and smiled faintly looking out to sea when i was your age stacey the future held a kind of infinite promise now im fortyeight and its all somewhere behind me it sounded like the sort of remark hed spent a lot of careful work on beforehand a characteristic of the irish that didnt just start with oscar wilde i get it i said this is dust and ashes morning he carried straight on as if i hadnt said a word life has a habit of catching up on all of us sooner or later i suppose you wake up one morning and suddenly for the first time ever you want to know what its all about when youre on the margin of things like me its probably too late anyway its always too late to ask that kind of question i said from the day youre born i was aware of a certain irritation i didnt want this sort of conversation and yet here i was in midstream in spite of the faint suspicion id had for a while now where burke was concerned that somehow i was being conned caught in a spiders web of irish humbug served up by a talent that wouldnt have disgraced the abbey theatre he glanced at me and there was urgency in his voice when he said what about you stacey what do you believe in really believe in with all your guts i didnt even have to think any more not after the hole i shared a cell in cairo with an old man called malik what was he in for some kind of political thing i never did find out they took him away in the end he was a buddhista zen buddhist knew by heart every word bodidharma ever said it kept us going for three months you mean he converted you there was a frown on his face i suppose he must have thought i was going to tell him i couldnt indulge in violence any more i shook my head lets say he helped shape my philosophy me im a doubter i dont believe in anything or anybody once you believe in something you immediately invite someone else to disagree from then on youre in trouble i dont think hed heard a word id been saying or perhaps he just didnt understand its a point of view which gets us precisely nowhere i flicked what was left of my cigarette into the water just how bad are things about as rough as they could be not only the villa belonged to herr hoffer it seemed the cessna was also his and hed provided the cash that had gone into the operation that had got me out of fuad do you own anything besides the clothes you stand up in i asked thats all we came out of the congo with he pointed out or do i need to remind you there have been several bits of banditry in between as i recall he sighed and said with obvious reluctance i might as well tell you we were in for a percentage of that gold you were caught with at rѓs el kanѓyis how big a percentage everything we had we could have made five times its value overnight it looked like a good proposition nice of you to tell me i wasnt angry it didnt seem to be all that important any more and i was interested in the next move no more wars seani asked what about the biafrans couldnt they use a good commando they couldnt pay in washers in any case ive had enough of that kind of gamewe all have so sicily is the only chance it was obviously the moment hed been waiting forthe first real opening i had given him the last chance staceythe last and only chance one hundred thousand dollars plus expenses i held up my hand no sales talk just tell me about it god but id come a long long way in those six years since mozambique little stacey wyatt telling sean burke what to do and he took it that was the amazing thing its simple enough he said hoffers a widower with a stepdaughter called joannajoanna truscott american no english and very uppercrust from what i hear her father was a baronet or something like that shes an honourable anyway not that it means much these days hoffers had trouble with her for years one scrape after another sleeping aroundthat kind of thing how old is she twenty the honourable joanna truscott sounded promising she must be quite a girl i wouldnt knowweve never met hoffer has business interests in sicily something to do with the oilfields at a place called gela you know it it was a greek colony aeschylus died there they say he was brained by a tortoise shell dropped by a passing eagle he gazed at me blankly and i grinned i had an expensive education sean remember but never mind what about the truscott girl she disappeared about a month ago hoffer didnt notify the police because he thought she was off on some binge or other then he got a ransom note from a bandit called serafino lentini an old sicilian custom how much oh it was modest enough twentyfive thousand dollars did he go to the police burke shook his head apparently hes spent enough time in sicily to know that doesnt do much good wise man so he paid up thats about the size of it unfortunately this serafino took the money then told him hed decided to hang on to her for a while he also indicated that if there was any troubleany sign of the law being brought inhed send her back in pieces a sicilian to the backbone i said does hoffer have any idea where hes hanging out the general area of a mountain called cammarata do you know it i laughed the last place god made a wilderness of sterile valleys and jagged peaks there are caves up there that used to hide roman slaves two thousand years ago believe me if this serafino of yours is a mountain man the police could chase him for a year up there without even seeing him and helicopters dont do too well in that kind of country the heat of the day does funny things to the air temperature too many downdraughts as bad as that worse than you could ever imagine the greatest bandit of them all giuliano operated in the same kind of territory and they couldnt catch him even when they brought in a couple of army divisions he nodded slowly could we do it stacey you and me and the heavy brigade i thought about it about the cammarata and the heat and the lava rock and about serafino who might already have handed the girl on to the rest of his men when i replied it wasnt because the thought made me sick or angry or anything like that from the sound of her the honourable joanna might well be having the time of her life i dont honestly think i was even thinking of my end of the money it was more than that something deepersomething personal between burke and me which i couldnt have explained at that moment even to myself yes i think it could be done with me along its just possible then youll come he leaned forward eagerly a hand on my shoulder but i wasnt going to be caught that easily ill think about it he didnt smile showed no emotion of any kind and yet tension oozed out of him like dirty water and in a second he was transformed into the man id always known good lad ill see you later then back at the villa i watched him climb the path and disappear for the moment id had enough shooting the sea looked inviting and i moved a little further along the beach stripped and went in at that point the cliffs merged into hillside sparsely covered with grass and wild flowers grew in profusion i climbed halfway up and lay on my back the sun warm on my naked flesh staring through narrowed eyelids at a white cloud no bigger than my hand allowing my whole body to relax making my mind a blank another trick hardwon from those months in prison the world was a blue bowl and i floated in it drowsing in the scented grass and slept waking was a return to a heavy stillness i was aware of flowers the grass at eyelevel like a jungle the woman watching me from a few yards away was it an accidental encounter or had she been sent by burke i wasnt angry but strangely calculating considering the circumstances i watched her through slitted eyes apparently still asleep making no move she stayed perhaps two or three minutes her face quite expressionless then went away carefully when she had gone i sat up dressed and went down to the beach again feeling rather excited in a way the whole thing had become a kind of game with burke making a new move as i countered the old one the cards were where i had left them together with my box of ammunition and when i moved to the firing line i had never known such power such certainty i drew fired and was reloading within the second my old self again the stacey from before the hole and yet not the same this time i fired lefthanded drawing on the cross from my waistband and knew before i checked what i would find five hits five hits on each card tightly grouped i tore them into very small pieces scattered them into the sea and went back up to the villa i slept during the afternoon waking just before night fell and yet i lay there without moving when burke entered the room to check on me and softly departed when it was quite dark i got up pulled on a pair of pants and ventured on to the terrace i could hear voices near at hand followed the sound and paused at the window of what was obviously his bedroom he was sitting at a desk in one corner and piet was standing beside him his fair hair golden in the lamplight burke glanced up at him and smileda new kind of smile one id never seen beforepatted his arm and said something piet went out like some faithful hound about his masters business burke opened a drawer produced what looked suspiciously like a bottle of whisky uncorked it and swallowed which for a man who didnt drink was quite a trick he put the bottle back in the drawer when the door opened and the woman entered i got ready to leave mainly because whatever else i am im no voyeur but there was no need he simply sat there looking very much the colonel and talked presumably in greek which i knew he spoke well after a couple of years in cyprus during the emergency i eased back into the shadows as she left and moved back to my room the whole thing was certainly packed full of human interest and drama and i lit a cigarette lay on the bed and thought about it all the storythat was the really weak link the story about the honourable joanna and the rampant serafino oh it was possible but strangely incomplete like a bach fugue with page three missing somewhere thunder rumbled menacingly the gods were angry perhaps oh might zeus forgive us the old greek tag drifted up from some dusty schoolroom to haunt me along with winedark seas achilles and his heel and cunning odysseus i didnt hear her come in but when lightning crackled out to sea it picked her from the night standing just inside the french window i made no sound when it flared again she had come closer the dress on the floor behind her the ripe body a thing of light and mystery dark hair brushing the full breasts in the darkness following her hands were on me her mouth her flesh against mine in one single savage movement i had her by the hair my hand tightening cruelly what did he tell you to do i demanded anything i wanted anything to keep me happy her body arched in pain and yet she did not struggle and when the lightning flickered again highlighting the heavy breasts i saw that her eyes were turned towards me and there was no fear there my ringers slackened in her hair and she subsided i gently patted her face her lips turned into the palm of my hand so it had come to this stacey the satyrfill one half of his bed for him and keep him happy the rest was easy just like my english breakfastburke thought of everything only the piano was missing and hed probably tried hard enough to get hold of one i went to the french window and stood looking out at the flickering sky suddenly and for no accountable reason the whole thing struck me as really being very funnya monstrous game for children with motive laid bare to such a degree that it was ridiculous burke wanted meneeded me in exchange i got twentyfive thousand dollars and all my more carnal needs supplied now what wellbred satyr could complain at that i nodded slowly right let it be so i would play his game through as i had done before but this time perhaps a rule or two of my own might be in order behind me was the softest of movements and i sensed her presence there in the darkness i reached out and pulled her close she was still naked and shivered slightly i could smell the mimosa heavy and clinging on the damp air the whole electric world waited for a sign it came and the heavens opened rain falling straight from sky to earth the freshness filled my nostrils drowning the womanly scent of her i left her there moved out on the terrace and stood face turned up to the rain mouth halfopen laughing as i hadnt laughed in a long long time ready to take on the world again and beat it at its own dark game five it was holy week when we arrived in palermo something which id completely forgotten about we drove in the thirtyfive kilometres from the aerodrome at punta raisi and the black mercedes saloon which had met us bogged down in the crowded streets it finally came to a halt in deference to a religious procession which wound its way through the crowds an ornate madonna rising on a catafalque high above our heads during the whole of the run from crete burke had been moody and irritable and now he lowered the window and looked out with illconcealed impatience whats all this a procession of the mysteries i told him this kind of thing goes on during holy week all over sicily everything else grinds to a halt theyre a very religious people it doesnt seem to have rubbed off much on you he commented sourly piet jaeger glanced at me anxiously how much he knew of what had been said between burke and myself of the hardness of the bargaining i wasnt sure but the change in our relationship had been plain enough during the past three days oh i dont know i said didnt you notice the virgin had a knife through her heart thats sicily for youthe cult of death everywhere id have thought i fitted in rather nicely he smiled reluctantly you could be right at that i turned to piet youll love it its one hell of a place on all saints day the children are given presents from the dead the graves are probably the best kept in the world piet grinned obviously relieved but legrande who was sitting beside the driver was hot and tired his eyes tinged with yellow which didnt look too good maybe one of the several fevers hed picked up in that viet prison camp after dien bien phu was about to plague him what is this a conducted tour he demanded i ignored him and leaned out of the window as the mercedes pushed its way through the crowd the girls were a little more fashionably dressed than when i had last been here and so were the younger men but i could smell incense and candle grease hear voices chanting beyond the square the crowd parted and the penitents appeared looking remarkably like the local chapter of the ku klux klan in pointed hoods and long white robes no nothing had changednot down there beneath the surface where it counted about seven miles out of palermo on the coast road to messina you come to the beaches of romagnolo a favourite spot for citydwellers at weekends hoffers villa was a couple of miles further on it didnt look more than a year or two old and had obviously been specially designed to fit into the hillside site rising above us on three different levels with what looked like a moorish garden crowning the highest roof the whole was surrounded by a high wall and we had to wait to be identified at the gates by a guard who carried an automatic rifle slung from one shoulder why the private army i asked burke hoffers a rich man since this business with the girl hes been getting worried maybe theyll have a go at him next which seemed reasonable enough kidnapping was after all one of sicilys oldest industries and in any case id been to parties at houses in bel air where the gatekeeper was armed sicily wasnt the only society where the rich got neurotic about the prospect of someone trying to take it away from them on the other hand hoffer certainly seemed to cover all his bets even our driver a burly normansicilian with ginger hair was wearing a shoulder holster a fact which his tightfitting chauffeurs uniform made rather too obvious there was a scent of wistaria in the air and i could see the purple blooms in profusion on the other side of the drive it was all very lush very mediterranean with palm trees carefully placed to make every vista please and yet its very harmony was vaguely unsettling things were a little too perfect a design on paper product of some expert mind planned to produce results in the shortest possible time an instant garden the mercedes braked in a gravelled circle in front of the entrance and a couple of houseboys came down in a hurry to get the bags as they went back up the steps a woman appeared in the porch and looked down at us languidly she was small dark haired and with the kind of body that can only be described as ripe she was sicilian to the backbone twentytwo or three by my judgement although she looked older as southern women often do she was wearing black leather riding pants a white silk shirt knotted at her waist and a cordoban hat and who might that be piet demanded hoffers girl friend ill see what the situation is burke went up the steps and they held a brief whispered conversation that died as i joined them hoffer isnt here at the moment burke told me had to go to gela on business last night but hes due back later on this afternoon id like you to meet signorina rosa solazzo rosa my good friend stacey wyatt her english was excellent she held my hand briefly but didnt remove her sunglasses a pleasure mr wyatt ive heard a great deal about you which might have been true or could have been merely conventional politeness hoffer didnt sound like the sort who needed any confidante and from the look of her it seemed more likely that he kept her around solely to help him through those long night watches she turned to burke rooms are arranged for you the servants will take you up i suppose youd like to shower and change so ill order the meal for an hour from now she left and we followed the houseboys through a large cool hall where everything seemed to swim in green and gold and up a short flight of stairs to the second tier of the building piet and legrande shared but burke and i were honoured with separate rooms mine was long and narrow one wall consisting of sliding glass doors opening to a balcony overlooking the garden the furniture was english and in excellent taste the carpet so thick that it deadened all sound and when i tried the other door i found my own bathroom the houseboy put my bag on the bed and left and i went and turned on the shower when i came back into the bedroom burke was standing by the window he managed a smile the rich full life eh something like that i dont know about you but im going to have a shower he was obviously eager to please and moved to the door at once a good idea ill see you downstairs in an hour but i had other plans i gave myself about a minute and a half under an icecold needlespray and changed pulling on a clean shirt and a lightweight suit in blue tropical worsted a pair of goldframed sunglasses completed the outfit i hesitated over the smith and wesson but this was sicily after all i clipped the holster to my belt on the righthand side left the room quickly and went downstairs there seemed to be no one about and i paused on top of the steps outside the front door the mercedes was still there the driver going over the windscreen with a wash leather rosa solazzo said from behind you are going somewhere mr wyatt i turned and said cheerfully yes into palermo if thats all right with you but of course ill tell ciccio to take you wherever you want it was nicely done and without the slightest hint of hesitation the local dialect in sicily is similar to the italian spoken in the rest of italy except for one or two different vowel sounds and an accent you could cut with a knife she switched over to it as we went down the steps the american wants to go into palermo she told ciccio take him wherever he wishes and watch him closely you do that ciccio i said as he held open the door for me and ill slice your ears off or at least that was the gist of what i told him in the kind of sicilian you hear on the palermo waterfront and nowhere else his mouth sagged in surprise and the solazzo womans head snapped round i ignored her frown got in the back of the mercedes ciccio slammed the door and slid behind the wheel he glanced at her enquiringly she nodded and we moved away i made him drop me in the piazza pretoria because it seemed as good a place as any and id always been fond of that amazing baroque fountain and the beautifully vulgar figures of river nymphs tritons and lesser gods at the northern end of the bay monte pellegrino towered in the late afternoon sun and i went on past the beautiful old church of santa caterina turned into the via roma and walked towards the central station in a side street i came across a small crowd waiting to go into a marionette theatre they were mainly touristsgerman from the sound of them they were certainly in for a shock even in decline the old puppet masters refuse to change their ways and the speeches are delivered in the kind of sicilian dialect that even a mainland italian cant follow on the way in from the airport id noticed one or two of the old handpainted carts with brass scrollwork drawn by feathertufted horses but on the whole most of the farmers seemed to be running around on threewheeler vespas and lambrettas so much for tradition but just before i reached the via lincoln i saw a carriage for hire standing at the kerbside just ahead of me it was past its prime the woodwork cracking the leather harness splitting with age and yet it had been lovingly cared for the brasswork glinting in the sunlight and i could smell the wax polish of the upholstery the driver looked about eighty years old with a face like a walnut and a long white moustache curling up around each cheek from the moment i spoke he quite obviously took me for a sicilian in palermo it is necessary to make a bargain with a horse cab driver for any journey however short which can be rough on the tourist but i had no troubleno trouble at all when i told him where i wanted to go his eyebrows went up a look of genuine respect settled on his face which was hardly surprising after all no one visits a cemetery for fun and to a sicilian death is a serious business everpresent and always interesting our destination was an old benedictine monastery about a mile out of town towards monte pellegrino and the cab took its time getting there which suited me perfectly because i wanted to think did i really wish to go through with this was it necessary to that there could be no answer for when i considered the matter seriously i discovered with some surprise that i could do so with a complete lack of any kind of passion which certainly hadnt been the case at one time once my mind had been like an open wound each thought a constant and painful probe but now the sun had gone down and clouds moved in from the sea pushed by a cold wind when we reached the monastery i told him to wait for me and got down excuse me signor he said you have someone laid to rest here someone close my mother strange but it was only then at that moment that pain moved inside me rising like floodwater threatening to overwhelm me so that i turned and stumbled away as he crossed himself a side entrance took me through a large cloister with arcades on each side in a small courtyard a delightful arabic fountain sprang into the air like a spray of silver flowers and beyond through an archway was the cemetery on a fine day the view over the valley to the sea was quite spectacular but now the lines of cypress trees bowed to the wind and a few cold drops of rain splashed on the stonework the cemetery was large and very well kept used mainly by the cream of palermos bourgeois society i followed the path slowly gravel crunching beneath my feet and for some reason everything assumed a dreamlike quality blank marble faces drifted by as i passed through a forest of ornate ornaments i had no difficulty in finding it and it was exactly as i had remembered a white marble tomb with bronze doors a lifesize statue of santa rosalia of pellegrino on top the whole surrounded by sixfoot iron railings painted black and gold i pressed my face against them and read the inscription rosalia barbaccia wyattmother and daughter taken cruelly before her time vengeance is mine saith the lord i remembered that other morning when i had stood here with everyone who mattered in palermo society standing behind me as the priest spoke over the coffin my grandfather at my side as cold and as dangerously quiet as those marble statues at the right moment i had turned and walked away through the crowd broken into a run when he called had kept on running till that famous meeting at the lights of lisbon in mozambique there was a little more rain on the wind now i could feel it on my face i took a couple of breaths to steady myself turned from the railings and found him standing watching me marco gagini my grandfathers strong right arm his bulletproof waistcoat his rock i read somewhere once that wyatt earp survived tombstone only because he had doc holliday to cover his back my grandfather had marco he had the face of a good middleweight fighter which was what he had once been the look of a confident gladiator who has survived the arena the hair was a little more grizzled there were a few more lines on the face but otherwise he looked just the same he had loved me this man taught me to box to drive to play poker and winbut he loved my grandfather more he stood there now hands pushed into the pockets of his blue nylon raincoat watching me a slight frown on his face how goes it marco i said easily as always the capo wants to see you how did he know i was back someone in customs or immigration told him does it matter he shrugged sooner or later the capo gets to know everything so its still the same marco i said hes still capo i thought rome was supposed to be clamping down on mafia these days he smiled slightly lets go stacey its going to rain i shook my head not nowlater ill come tonight when ive had time to think you tell him that it had been obvious to me from the beginning that he had been holding a gun in his right hand pocket he started to take it out and found himself staring into the muzzle of the smith and wesson he didnt go white he wasnt the sort but something happened to him there was a kind of disbelief there at my speed i suppose and at the fact that little stacey had grown up some slowly marco very slowly he produced a walther p and i told him to lay it down carefully and back off i picked the walther up and shook my head an automatic isnt much use from the pocket marco id have thought youd have known that the slide nearly always catches on the lining with your first shot he didnt speak just stood there staring at me as if i were a stranger and i slipped the walther into my pocket tonight marco about nine ill see him then now go he hesitated and sean burke moved out from behind a marble tomb five or six yards behind him a browning in one hand if i were you id do as he says he told marco in his own peculiar brand of italian marco went without a word and burke turned and looked at me gravely an old friend something like that where did you spring from rosa got another car out quick and i followed the mercedes into townno trouble it got interesting when we discovered you had someone else on your tail who was he a friend of my grandfather he wants to see me he must have one hell of an information service to know you were here so quickly the best he moved to the railings and read the inscription your mother i nodded you never did tell me about it and i found out that i wanted to which was strange it was as if we were on the old footing again or perhaps i was in that kind of mood where i would have told it to anyone i said my mother was sicilian that my grandfather still lived here but i dont think i ever went into details not that i recall i believe you mentioned his name but id forgotten it until i saw it again just now on the inscription there i sat on the edge of a tomb and lit a cigarette i wondered how much i could tell him how much he could possibly understand to the visitor the tourist sicily was taormina catania syracusegolden beaches laughing peasants but there was another darker place in the hinterland a savage landscape sterile barren where the struggle was not so much for a living but for survival a world where the keyword was omerta which you could call manliness for want of a better translation manliness honour solve your own problem never seek official help all of which led to the concept of personal vendetta and was the breeding group for mafia what do you know about mafia sean didnt it start as some kind of secret society in the old days thats right it came into being in a period of real oppression in those days it was the only weapon the peasant had his only means of any kind of justice like all similar movements it grew steadily more corrupt it ended up by having the peasant the whole of sicily by the throat i dropped my cigarette and rubbed it into the gravel and still does in spite of what the authorities in rome have been able to do but what has this got to do with you my grandfather vito barbaccia is capo mafia in palermo in all sicily number one man lord of life and death there are something like three million sicilians in the states now and mafia moved over there as well and became one of the main branches of syndicated gangsterism during the last ten years quite a few mafia bosses in the states have been deported theyve come back home with new ideasprostitution drugs and so on an oldfashioned mafioso like my grandfather doesnt mind killing people but he just doesnt go in for that kind of thing there was trouble you could put it that way they placed a bomb in his cara favourite way of getting rid of a rival in those circles unfortunately it was my mother who decided to go for a drive my god there was shock and genuine pain on his face i carried on believe it or not but i didnt know a damn thing about it or maybe i didnt want to know i came home on vacation after my first year at harvard and it happened on the second day my grandfather told me the facts of life the same evening did he ever manage to settle up with the man responsible oh im sure he did i think we can take that as read i stood up im beginning to feel rather hungry shall we go back im sorry stacey he said damned sorry why should you be ancient history now but i believed him for he seemed sincere enough the wind moaned through the cypress trees scattering rain across the path and i turned and walked back towards the monastery six i went to bed for a while after wed eaten sleep came easily to me at that time simply by closing the eyes and i seldom seemed to dream when i opened them again it was seventhirty by the bedside clock and almost dark somewhere i could hear the murmur of voices and i got to my feet pulled on a bathrobe and padded across to the glass doors that opened on to the terrace burke was standing in the courtyard below one foot on the rim of the ornamental fountain his companion was a thickset man with closecropped white hair who looked in better shape than he probably was thanks to a tailor who knew how to cut cloth there was nothing ostentatious about him hed resisted the impulse to wear more than one ring and displayed only the regulation inch of white cuff as if following someones instructions to the letter i think it was the tie which spoiled thingsguards brigade which didnt seem likelyand when he produced a platinum case and offered burke a cigarette he looked about as real as his garden he accepted a light turned away slightly running a hand over his hair with a rather feminine gesture and saw me standing there at the edge of the balcony he had obviously cultivated the instant smile hello there he called im karl hoffer how are you fine i said you provide excellent beds his voice was the first surprise pure americanno austrian accent at all as far as i could judge he smiled at burke heh i like him then looked up at me again were just going to have a drink why dont you join us good chance to talk business five minutes i said and went back into the bedroom to dress as i went down to the hall rosa solazzo appeared from the dining room followed by one of the houseboys carrying a tray of drinks all the best dresses were english that year hers must have set hoffer back two hundred guineas at least a cloud of red silk like a flame in the night setting her hair and eyes off to perfection please she said reached up and straightened my tie there that is better i felt very foolish this afternoon i didnt know shed spoken in italian and i replied in kind didnt know what oh about you that your mother was sicilian and who told you that colonel burke lifes just full of surprises isnt it i said shall we join the others as you wish i think she took it as some kind of dismissal but she certainly didnt seem annoyed although i suppose a woman in her position can seldom afford the luxury of that kind of emotion hoffer and burke had moved to a small illuminated patio where another fountain which was an exact duplicate of the first lifted into the night they were sitting at a wrought iron table and rose to greet me hoffer had the kind of outofseason tan that usually argues a lamp or more rarely someone rich enough to follow the sun on closer acquaintance he was older than i had imagined his face a network of fine seams and in spite of the ready smile there was little joy in the china blue eyes we shook hands and he waved me to a seat sorry i wasnt here when you got in im having to run down to gela three or four times a week now you know the oil game i didnt but i remembered gela a greek colony in classic times mainly as a pleasant little coastal town on the other side of the island with some interesting archaeological remains i wondered how the derricks and refineries were fitting in and accepted a large vodka and tonic from rosa she dismissed the houseboy and served us herself dropping unobtrusively into a chair in the background when she had finished which seemed to indicate that hoffer trusted her all the waysomething id been wrong about he certainly didnt waste any time in getting down to business mr wyatt colonel burke recommended you highly for this job which is why we went to so much trouble to get you out that was real nice of him i said and the irony was in my voice for all to hear except hoffer apparently who carried on in fact i dont think its overdoing it to say that were all depending on you boy he put a hand on my knee which i didnt like and there was the sort of edge to his voice that you get with the kind of american wheatbelt politician whos trying to persuade you hes just folks after all any minute now i expected him to break into a chorus of i believe in you and i couldnt have that lets get one thing straight mr hoffer im here for twentyfive thousand dollars plus expenses in advance he straightened abruptly the head went back the eyes hardened into chips of blue glass i expected him to argue about the terms because burke actually looked alarmed and moved in fast im sorry about this mr hoffer stacey doesnt realise hoffer cut him off with a motion of one hand that was like a sword falling never mind i like a man who knows his own mind so long as we all know where we stand he was another manhard competent with the kind of ruthless edge he would have needed to get where he was even his physical movements were different he snapped his fingers for another drink and rosa solazzo came running half in advance he said to you and burke and if we fail to get the girl out youre that much ahead of the game and the other two your affair burke was frowning mainly i suppose because he felt he was being cut out of things he nodded slightly which surprised meor did it really in any event i shook my head and said to hoffer not good enough jaeger and legrande get the same terms or we dont go he didnt even argue all right ill let you have a cheque you can draw in palermo tomorrow but made out to colonel burke he holds the bank until the job is over one way or the other some insurance for me against anyone preferring a bird in the hand fair enough burke was obviously furiously angry but i ignored him and emptied my glass rosa came over to get me another hoffer said can we get down to business now how do you intend to tackle this thing youre certain serafino is in the cammarata i said he nodded that definitely seems to be his home ground every enquiry ive been able to make confirms it you know the area i believe ive been there its wild country you dont need to tell me i had to drive up there alone to make the first payment and you met him serafino he nodded face to face at a bridge on what passes for the main road near a village called bellona what was he like i can show you he produced a wallet took out a photo and gave it to me i got that through someone i know in the police our friend has been through their hands more than once it was typical of police photography the world over reducing the subject to a kind of neanderthal man capablefrom his appearanceof rape or murder and most things in between i shook my head this doesnt tell me a thing what was he like describe him twentyfive or sixmedium height dark hair long dark hair he didnt approve of that one of those swarthy faces you get round herethey tell me its the arab blood from saracen days typical sicilian sounds just like me i said if you like he wasnt in the least put out hes lost an eye since the photo was taken and he laughed a lot treated the whole thing as if it was one big joke and he hadnt liked that either his right hand clenched into a fist and stayed that way i think bellona sounds like a good place to start i said hoffer seemed surprised is that such a good idea the impression i get is that most of the villagers in the area work hand in glove with people like serafino i looked at burke you play the tourist ill pass myself off as a hirecar driver he nodded suits me i turned to hoffer not the mercedes something that isnt too ostentatious can you manage that certainly is there anything else youd like yes tell me about the girl he looked slightly bewildered joanna but i thought the colonel told you all you needed to know id like to hear about her from youall about her in a thing like this its important to know as much as you can about people that way you can have some idea in advance about how they might behave in a given situation he was full of approval that makes sense all right where should i begin when you first met her would do for a start which was when she was twelve years old her father had died of leukaemia two years earlier hoffer had met her and the mother at st moritz one christmas and the marriage had taken place shortly afterwards and had lasted until four months previously when his wife had been killed in a car crash in france i understand the girl was rather a handful i said presumably her mothers death didnt help he seemed to slump wearily ran a hand across his face and sighed where do you begin with a thing like this look wyatt ill put it in a nutshell for you when joanna was fourteen her mother found her in bed with the chauffeur and he wasnt the first shes been nothing but trouble ever sinceone rotten little scandal after another then why are you bothering he looked surprised then frowned as if it hadnt occurred to him before a good questioncertainly not because of any great affection shes no good she never has been and i honestly dont think she ever will be maybe it isnt her fault but thats the way it is no i suppose when it all comes down to it i owe it to my wife she was a wonderful woman the seven years she gave me were the best wyatt anything else can only be afters he certainly sounded sincere and the presence of rosa solazzo didnt alter my judgement in the slightest i was certainly the last man in the world to hold the fact that he needed a woman around against him one thing puzzles me i said i can understand you not going near the police in sicily they are worse than useless in a case like this but didnt it ever occur to you to approach mafia what good would that do burke laughed stacey has this mafia thing on the brain mr hoffer there are reasons hoffer waved him down sure i tried mafia theyre still behind most things here dont believe all this crap you hear about rome having stamped it out thats just for the tourist trade they dont want to scare anyone away did you get anywhere he shook his head it seems serafino lentini doesnt like the mafia the impression i got was that theyd like to get their hands on him too staceys grandfather is something to do with this mafia thing burke said isnt that so stacey hes going to see him tonight hoffer frowned your grandfather vito barbaccia i said i think for effect more than anything rosa solazzo sucked in her breath and dropped her glass hoffer stared at me incredulously in the following silence you are vito barbaccias grandson youve heard of him i take it heard of him who hasnt and you are seeing him tonight i nodded and he shook his head i cant get over it youve met him burke asked hoffer smiled twiceat parties but never to speak to only royalty gets that close burke looked at me a frown on his face and i realised that everything i had told him at the cemetery hadnt really registered certainly not the fundamental fact of just how important my grandfather was i drained my glass and got to my feet well i think ill take a turn round the garden before dinner why not hoffer nodded to rosa show him the sights angel theres a fish pond round the back thats quite a showpiece mr wyatt now he was calling me mr again strange how the barbaccia affected people and rosa rosa had gone very pale and when i smiled at her she dropped her gaze fear in those dark eyes barbacciamafioso i suppose that to her the two were interchangeable when i tucked her arm in mine she was trembling hoffer obviously used a firstrate local chef we had narbe di san paolo which is a kind of ravioli filled with sugar and ricotta cheese and fried and cannolo probably the most famous sweet in sicily consisting of a tube of flour and egg filled with cream the others drank marsala which is too sweet for me and i had a bottle of zibibbo from the island of pantellaria a wine which is flavoured with anis the sort of thing you either like at once or not at all we dined on the terrace a rather conventional little group with piet and legrande very much on their best behaviour laterthe wine having taken effect things livened up a little piet gave all his attention to rosa though strictly at a superficial level and even legrande unwound enough to smile once or twice the coffee was yemeni mocha probably the best in the world i took mine to the edge of the terrace to drink the laughter was louder now and no one appeared to notice as i faded away i went up to my room got the smith and wesson in its spring holster from the drawer and snapped it to my belt i pulled it clear a couple of times to make sure things were working all right and burke came in he closed the door and leaned against it expecting trouble im not sure i replaced the smith and wesson buttoned my jacket and slipped half a dozen spare rounds into my lefthand pocket and marcos walther in the right id like to come with you he said it might help i looked him straight in the eye and he held my gaze grave and serious i nodded if you like he smiled in a kind of reliefhe was doing a lot of smiling these daysand slapped me on the shoulder the old firm eh stacey boy but it could never be that again nothing was more certain why as we went down the stairs i wasnt too happy about having him at the back of me seven monte pellegrino which is about three miles to the north of palermo towers into the sky at the western end of the conco doro its an interesting place soaked in blood and history like the rest of sicily during the punic wars hamilcar barca held it against the romans for three years but in more modern times it became famous mainly because of the cult of santt rosalia after whom my mother had been named my grandfathers villa was at the foot of the mountain just outside the village of valdesi i suppose when you thought about it hed come a long way he was born in velba a village in western sicily which was depressingly typical of the region a dung heap where most children died in their first year and life was roughly equivalent to what it had been in england in mediaeval times his father was a sharecropper and the living that gave was of a kind that barely maintained life of his early years i knew little for certain but by the time he was twentythree he was a gabellotto a mixture of tax collector and land agent whose function was to screw the sharecroppers down and keep them that way only a mafioso could have the job so he was on the way up at an early age god knows what had happened in betweena killing or twoperhaps more which was the usual method for any youngster to make his way in the honoured society he might even have spent some time as a sicario a hired killer but i doubted that it didnt fit into the codehis own very individual conception of what was honourable and what was not the idea of making money out of prostitution for example filled him with horror because he believed in the sanctity of the family and gave to the church on the other hand the organisation he served had killed so many of its opponents over the years that in many towns murder was a commonplace the lights of the car picked out a couple of old women trudging towards us festooned with baskets what in the hell was that supposed to be burke demanded theyre coming in for tomorrows market at this time of night the only way they can secure a good pitch he shook his head what a bloody country i looked into the night at the lights of the city thats one sicily but out there in the darkness is another a charnel house for generations the breadbasket of the roman empire based completely on slave labour ever since then the people have been exploited by someone or other i didnt really take it all in he said this mafia stuff i thought it was all in the past i can think of one place thats had better than a hundred and fifty killings in four yearsa town of less than twenty thousand inhabitants you wont find me a place in the world of comparable size that can match that but why he said i just dont get it people play games of one sort or another all the time havent you ever noticed that i dont follow you i could have told him that hed been playing soldiers all his lifeeven in the congobut there would have been no point he wouldnt have understood what i was talking about and id have offended him needlessly let me put it this way in the suburbs of los angeles or london the struggle to keep abreast of the next man the cut and thrust of business or even an affair with someone elses wife adds that little touch of drama to life that everyone needs and what does that prove nothing in particular in sicily its an older game thats all and rather more savage the ritual of vendettaan eye for an eye neither more nor less and the rules may seem a little barbaric to outsiders we kiss the wounds of our dead touch our lips to the blood and say in this way may i drink the blood of the one who killed you even thinking of it touched something inside mea coldness like a snake uncoiling you said we burke observed you include yourself in i stared out into the distance where an early cruise ship passed beyond the headland a blaze of lights a world of its own i thought of school in london at st pauls of wyatts landing of harvard and laughed in any village in sicily if i spoke my grandfathers name and declared my relationship there would be men who would kiss my hand youre in another world here sean try to get that into your head but i dont think he believed menot then it all seemed too improbable belief would come later there was no resemblance at all between the barbaccia villa and hoffers place to start with the walls were at least two thousand years older for like most country houses it had been built on a roman site they were about fifteen feet high and the villa itself was of moorish origin and stood in the centre of a couple of acres of semitropical garden ciccio braked to a halt and sounded his horn the gatekeeper wasnt armed but then he didnt need to be a man appeared from the lodge behind him wrestling with two bull mastiffs of a breed common to the island since norman times and another came out of the bushes holding a machine pistol the gatekeeper wore a neat khaki uniform and looked more like an insurance clerk with his moustache and steelrimmed spectacles there was a kind of impasse while he and his friends stared at us and the dogs didnt bark which was somehow even more sinister i opened the door got out and approached im expected i said you must have been told one man signor not three no car passes through these gates except the capos a rule of the house i produced the walther very carefully from my pocket and there was a hollow click as the gentleman with the machine pistol cocked it i passed the walther through the bars butt first my calling card send it to marcomarco gagini hell tell you who i am he shrugged all right you can come in but the others stay outside with the car marco came round the bend of the drive on the run and slowed to a halt he stared past me at the mercedes at burke and ciccio then nodded open the gateslet them in the gatekeeper started to protest you know the ruleonly house cars allowed inside marco shook him by the lapel fool does a man kill his own grandfather get out of the way he wrenched the walther from the gatekeepers hand dropped it into his pocket and pushed him towards the lodge the gates it seemed were electronically controlled they swung back with a slight whisper and marco joined us ill ride up to the house with you we got into the rear beside burke and ciccio drove on slowly things have changed i said to marco getting into fort knox would be easier an electronic device runs round the top of the walls he told me seriously so no one can get in that way usually as you just heard cars other than our own arent allowed through we discovered an explosive device in one a few years back when the capo was giving a party if it had gone off it would have taken the villa with it a nice way to live perhaps the irony in my voice escaped him or else he chose to ignore it there have been eight attempts on the capos life in the last few years we have to be very careful who is this man you have brought with you he added in exactly the same tone a friend of minecolonel burke he thought i might need some help i can feel the gun in his pocket most uncomfortable tell him it will not be needed i know enough italian to understand that much burke said and transferred his browning to the other pocket the mercedes halted at the bottom of a broad flight of steps that lifted to a great oaken door banded with iron which id always understood had had an arrow or two in it in its day i think that until that moment nothing had possessed any reality for me i was home again which was what it came down to and it was as if some part of me some essential partsimply didnt want to know burke followed me out and marco told ciccio to take the mercedes round to the courtyard at the rear it moved away smoothly i turned and found my grandfather standing at the top of the steps he was as large as burke and looked smaller only because his shoulders were stooped a little with age at that time he must have been sixtyseven or eight and yet there was still colour in the long hair and carefully trimmed beard if i say he had the look of a roman emperor i would be referring to the period when it was possible for a restless adventurer with no scruples to rise from the ranks it was a remarkable face there was ruthlessness there and arrogance but also pride and a blazing intelligence and he was as elegant as ever many of the old time capo mafias chose to look as slovenly and as unkempt as possible in society as if to emphasise their power and importance but not vito barbaccia the sharecroppers son had left his rags behind him long ago he wore a cream lightweight suit that had london stamped all over it a pink shirt and dark blue silk tie the cigar was as large as ever and the ebony walking stick i remembered well because if it was the same one it housed a couple of feet of razorsharp steel he didnt speak as i went slowly up the steps to meet him i paused a little below his level and he gazed down at me still without a word and then his arms opened the strength was still there he held me close for a long moment then gave me the ritual kiss on each cheek and pushed me to arms length youve grown staceyyouve grown boy i motioned to burke who came up the steps and i introduced them my voice seemed to belong to a stranger to come from far away under water and my eyes were hot he sensed my distress squeezed my arm and tucked it into his own come well go in and marco will give you a drink colonel while i have a word or two with this grandson of mine my throat was dry as we moved through the great door strange how you can never stop loving those who are really important to you in spite of what they may have done it was like stepping back into the past when i went into the study it was as impressive as ever the walls lined with books most of which he had read a log fire crackled cheerfully loud in the silence and my mother gazed down at me from the oil painting above that hed commissioned from some english artist one year i think when i was fourteen and i was there too in framed photos that documented every stage of growth the piano was in the same place by the window the bechstein concert grand hed imported especially from germany only the best i stood looking down at the keyboard and picked out a note or two the door clicked open behind and closed again when i turned he was watching me we stood there looking at each other across the room and i couldnt for the life of me think of a single thing to say and again with that enormous perception of his he knew and smiled play something stacey its in tune i have a man out from palermo regularly a long time i said the places ive been didnt have pianos like this he stayed where he was waiting and i sat down paused for a moment and started to play ravel pavane on the death of an infanta i only realised what it was halfway through by some trick of memory or association the last piece i had played in this house on the night before my mothers funeralher special favourite i faltered and his voice broke in harshly go ongo on the music took possession of me then as real music always did flowing like water over stones neverending i forgot where i was forgot everything but the music and carried straight on into a schubert impromptu i finished the last note died and when i looked up he was standing looking up at the portrait he turned and nodded gravely its still there stacey after all this time she would have been pleased id never have made the concert platform you know that i said i think you always knew but she didnt is it so bad for a mother to have hopes for her son he smiled up at the portrait again she used to say everybody had a talent for something what was yours the words were out before i could bite them back and instantly regretted his head swung sharply the chin tilted but there was no eruption he took a fresh cigar from a silver box and sank into a wing back chair beside the fire a brandy stacey for both of us you look like a man who drinks now then we talk i moved to the cabinet on the other side of the room where the crystal goblets and decanter stood on a silver tray i read about you boy a couple of years back oh yes i was surprised but tried not to show it a french magazineparis match they did a feature on mercenaries in the congomainly about your friend but you were there standing just behind him it said you were a captain thats right i carefully poured the brandy and he went on then there was a report in one of the rome newspapers about how you were all chased out with your tails between your legs i refused to be drawn that would be about two years ago now what have you been up to since this and that i went towards him a goblet in each hand as a matter of fact im just out of prison the egyptian variety nothing like as pleasant as the ucciardone in palermo or doesnt the mafia control it any more the ebony stick stabbed out sweeping back my coat exposing the smith and wesson in its holster so marco was right and i wouldnt believe him this is what you have become eh sicariohired killer my grandson strange the anger in his voice the disgust but then no real mafioso ever thought of himself as a criminal everything was for the cause for the society i handed him his brandy am i worse than you in any way am i worse than you when i kill it is in hot blood he said a man dies because he is against meagainst mafia and you think that sufficient reason he shrugged i believe it to be so it has always been so the stick came up and touched my chest but you stacey what do you kill for money not just money i said lots of money which wasnt true i knew it and i think he did also i can give you money all you need thats just what you did for a great many years and you left and i left he nodded gravely i had a letter from some lawyers in the states just over a year ago they were trying to trace you your grandfatherold wyatt had second thoughts on his death bed there is provision for you in the willa large sum i wasnt even angry they can give it back to the indians you wont touch it would i walk on my mothers grave i was getting more like a sicilian every minute he seemed well pleased i am glad to see you have some honour left in you now you will tell me why you are here i do not flatter myself that you returned to sicily to see me i crossed the room and poured another brandy bread and butter worknothing to interest you the stick hammered on the floor i asked you a question boy you will answer all right if it will make you feel any better burke and i have been hired by a man named hoffer karl hoffer he frowned slightly thats the man austrian but speaks english like an american has interests in the oilfield at gela i know what his interests are what does he want you to do i thought mafia knew everything i said his stepdaughter was kidnapped some weeks ago by a bandit called serafino lentini hes holding her in the cammarata and wont send her back in spite of the fact that hoffer paid up like a soldier and you are going to get her back is that it you and your friend think you can go into the cammarata and bring her out with you again he laughed that strange harsh laugh head thrown back stacey stacey and i thought youd grown up i very carefully smashed my crystal goblet into the fire and started for the door his voice when he called my name had all the iron of hell in it i turned a twelveyearold schoolboy again caught in the orange grove before harvest that was seventeenth century florentine does it make you feel any better i shook my head im sorry there was nothing more i could say unexpectedly he smiled this serafino lentiniyou are kin on your grandmothers side third cousins you know him then i havent seen him for many years a wild boyhe shot a policeman when he was eighteen and took to the maquis when they caught him they gave him a hard time youve heard of the cassetta in the good old days under mussolini it had been frequently employed by the police when extorting confessions from the more difficult prisoners a kind of wooden box a frame to which a man could be strapped and worked on at leisure it was supposed to be forbidden now but whether it was or not was anyones guess what did they do to him the usual thingsthe hot iron which left him blind in one eye and they crushed his testiclestook away his manhood burke should be listening to this does nothing change i said nothing he shook his head and watch hoffer he is a hard man millionaires usually are thats how they get there i buttoned my jacket its time i was going a long day tomorrow you are going to the cammarata i nodded with burke just for a drive tourists having a look round i want to see the lie of the land i thought wed try bellona the man who owns the wineshop is the mayor his name is cerdadanielo cerda he took his blue silk handkerchief from his breast pocket and held it out show him this and tell him you are from me he will help you in any way he can he is one of my people i folded the handkerchief and put it in my pocket i thought serafino didnt like mafia he doesnt he said tranquilly reached for my hand and pulled himself up now we shall join the others i must talk with this colonel burke of yours he interests me burke and marco were sitting together in the salon an exquisite room which my grandfather had kept to the original moorish design the floor was of black and white ceramic tiles and the ceiling was blue vivid against stark white walls beyond a wonderful carved screen another relic of saracen days was the terrace and the gardens i could hear water gurgling in the old conduits splashing from the numerous fountains in other days it had been said that whoever held the meagre water supplies of the island held sicily and mafia had done just that they were talking behind me and i heard burke say in his terrible italian you must be very proud of your garden signor barbaccia the best in sicily my grandfather told him come i will show you marco stayed to finish his drink and i followed them out on to the terrace the sky was clear again each star a jewel and the lush semitropical vegetation pressed in on the house i could smell the orange grove although i couldnt see it the almond trees palms swayed gently in the slight breeze their branches dark feathers against the stars and everywhere the gurgle of water my grandfather pointed out the papyrus by the pool another arab innovation and suggested a short walk before we left he moved towards the steps leading down to the garden burke paused to light a cigarette and then everything happened at once some instinct product perhaps of the years of hard living sent a wave of coldness through me and i froze ready to jump like some jungle animal sensing an unseen presence below the steps five yards on the other side of the gravel path the leaves trembled and a gun barrel poked through my grandfather was already on his way down i sent him sprawling with a stiff left arm drew and fired three times a machine pistol jumped into the air there was a kind of choking cough and a man fell out of the bushes and rolled on to his back i dropped to one knee beside my grandfather are you all right there will be another he said calmly hear that sean i called ill cover you came the reply in a voice like icewater roust him out marco came through the french windows in a hurry the walther in his hand and a shotgun blasted from the bushes over to my right too far away to do any damage you have to be close with those things marco dropped from view and i took a running jump into the greenery i landed badly rolled over twice and came up about six feet away from number two he was clutching a sawnoff shotgun in both hands the lupara traditional weapon used in a mafia ritual killing i took one hell of a chance simply because it seemed like a good idea to keep him in one piece to talk and fired as i came up catching him in the left arm he screamed and dropped the lupara not that it did much good as he straightened and backed away burke shot him between the eyes from the terrace he looked about seventeen a boy trying to make a name for himself to gain respectthe kind mafia often used for this kind of work the other was a different breed a real pro from the look of him with hard bitter eyes fixed in death my grandfather pushed the jacket aside with his stick and said to marco you told me he could use a gun look at that id shot him three times in the heart the holes covering no more than the width of two fingers between them there was very little blood i could hear the mastiffs barking and the guards arrived as i reloaded and slipped the smith and wesson back into its holster how did they get in the old man frowned and turned to marco how about that you told me this place was impregnable marco motioned to the guards without a word and they went off in a hurry dogs and all i stirred the man on the ground with my foot so theyre still trying not for much longer he said grimly i can assure you all bills will be paid i owe it to your mother i was shaken but i turned to burke thats mafia for you just one big happy family will there be any trouble over these two my grandfather shook his head ill have the police come and take them away as simple as that but of course it would however be wiser if you were to leave before they get here he called to marco who was rooting around out there in the garden somewhere to send the mercedes round then took me by the arm and walked a little way off if you could play the piano like you can shoot stacey a shame isnt it i said but my mother was right about one thing we all have a talent for something he sighed go with god boy come and see me when you get back from the cammarata eh ill do that ill expect you he turned and held out his hand colonel my thanks later after we had passed through the gates burke lit another cigarette and when the match flared i saw sweat on his face i wondered if he had been afraid but that didnt seem possible are you all right i asked at first i thought i wasnt going to get a reply and then it came delivered with some bitterness christ knows what they did to you in that place you were in but it must have been bad he was at last facing the fact that i had changed really changed which suited me perfectly i sat there looking out to sea thinking not of what had just happened at the villa but of karl hoffer and the honourable joanna and serafino lentini the great lover who desired her so much that he insisted on keeping her just for himself serafino who had lost his manhood according to my grandfather under police torture was incapable of the physical act of love now why had vito barbaccia capo mafia arch schemer gone out of his way to tell me that eight hoffer was as good as his word and provided a fiat saloon for the reconnaissance trip he also threw in rosa solazzo for good measure his argument was that being a woman she would provide good cover and strengthen our story but i suspected she was there to look after his interests as much as anything the final meeting on the following morning was a hurried one he was flying to catania on business in the cessna and wanted to be away early so that he could be back that evening to hear what i thought about the situation on our return no mention was made of the shooting match at the villa something else i found interesting on the way back burke had asked me to keep it to myself and seemed to think that it might upset a respectable businessman like hoffer to be associated with that kind of violence but ciccio had been there and must have heard the shooting at the very least although he had been his usual phlegmatic self on the way back i found it hard to believe that he hadnt passed news of the disturbance on the route we followed was one normally taken by tourists driving across the island to agrigento certainly those in search of spectacular scenery i did the driving as originally planned burke sat beside me and rosa solazzo had the rear seat to herself she looked very attractive in a navyblue trouser suit cut on rather mannish lines offset by a more than feminine ruffled blouse in white nylon a red silk scarf bound round her head peasantfashion completed the outfit plus of course the ever present sunglasses she didnt attempt to make conversation but read a magazine when i stopped at the village of misilmeri about ten miles out to buy cigarettes and asked if she wanted anything her only reply was a shake of the head obviously her presence limited conversation between burke and myself but in any case he didnt seem much in the mood and slouched back in his seat sombre and brooding as if carrying the weight of the world and there was that slight tremble in his hands again for the first time i found myself wondering whether he was up to what lay ahead on the other hand hed shown no signs of having slowed down any during the affair at the villa the shot which had killed the boy with the lupara had been a difficult one and yet he had been right on the button having said that early warning signs of some kind of deterioration showed clearly and they didnt look good for the time being i pushed it out of my mind and concentrated on enjoying the trip it was almost the end of spring harvest orange groves ripening in the warm air and flowers everywhere red poppies anemones and in some places blue iris spread like a carpet into the distance another week and the iron hand of summer would grasp the land by the throat and squeeze it dry leaving in the high country a wilderness of thirst a gaunt north african land of rock and sand and lava the further we moved away from palermo into the heart of things the more i realised how little it had changed out here one didnt see the threewheeler lambrettas and vespas so common in the farming area immediately adjacent to palermo here one moved through a mediaeval landscape through poverty of a kind to be found in few places in europe we passed an old peasant riding a donkey a little further on a line of gaunt women baskets on their heads dressed in fust black as if mourning their very existence skirts trailing in the dust who turned brown seamed faces to watch us pass old before their time and the villages seemed just the same most of the houses windowless the door the only source of light and air opening into a dark cavern that housed in many cases pigs and goats as well as people and in the villages mainly women old men and thin hungry looking children living out their lives against a dying landscape in one such place i stopped outside a small trattoria and we sat at a rough wooden table in the shade and the proprietor an old old man with white hair brought a bottle of passito icecold from the bottom of his well it was about eleven oclock but already very warm and when a ring of solemnfaced children surrounded us we could smell the sourness of their unwashed bodies dont they have any men around here burke demanded he looked tired and was sweating a lot great damp patches soaking his shirt beneath each arm most of them have emigrated i told him ive heard it said that in some provinces eightyfive per cent of the population is made up of women and children he looked disgusted and wiped sweat from his forehead what a bloody country rosa solazzo had disappeared into the back to find whatever passed for a toilet in those parts and rejoined us in time to hear his comment she obviously didnt approve this is one of the poorest areas in europe colonel burke in summer it has the same climate as north africa the land is barely cultivated and what water there is is controlled by the mafia these people are born without hope what else can they do but try and get out not that she had a hope in hell of making him understand the people she was speaking of were her peopleshe was one of them had probably started life in just such a place as this burke laughed with a kind of contempt you seem to be doing all right anyway she pushed her way through the children and got into the fiat i emptied my glass and shook my head as burke poured himself another i wouldnt if i were you strong stuff passito that was enough of course to make him fill the glass to the brim i left him there and got behind the wheel again i found my cigarettes and offered one to rosa im sorry about that he doesnt understand she was bitterly angry i dont need your regrets at least he only speaks from ignorance but you and your kindyou and mafiaare responsible for most of this so i was still mafioso i turned away and she leaned across and touched me on the shoulder no i am angry with him and i place it on you you will forgive me i couldnt tell what was going on behind the dark glasses did she imagine she had gone too far and was trying to recover her ground or was she afraid at the very thought of offending vito barbaccias grandson or was it at all possible that she was just sorry my answer amply fitted every contingency thats all right burke was on his third large glass he finished it stood up and sat down abruptly looking surprised you warned him about passito rosa asked he isnt in the mood for advice she started to laugh revenge particularly where women are concerned is always sweet we moved into the high country now the great craggy solitudes around monte cammarata the mountain itself towering almost six thousand feet into the sky burke had lapsed into a kind of stupor and rosa leaned her arms on the back of my seat and we talked softly our voices dropping a degree or two as the crags closed in around us we turned off the main road zigzagging up into the hills the valley deepening beneath us a hell of a country home of runaway slaves and bandits since roman times during the war this had been the most strategic point in the italiangerman defence system when the allies invaded the island and yet the americans had passed through unheeded thanks it was said to the fact that most of the italian troops had deserted after a mafia directive the road narrowed but we had it all to ourselves and i kept close to the wall climbing slowly in second gear in a cloud of dust the only living things we saw were a shepherd and his flock high up above a line of beech trees and then we rounded a shoulder and found bellona a hundred yards away for many years because of the constant state of anarchy and banditry in rural sicily the people have tended to congregate in villages much larger than are found elsewhere in europe bellona was smaller than most although that was probably to be expected in the sparsely populated high country several streets slanted down to a square mostly open sewers if the stench of urine was anything to go by and thin children played listlessly in the dirt i pulled up outside the wineshop there were three wooden tables with benches placed in the shade and two men sat drinking red wine one of them was old a typical peasant in shiny dark suit his companion was a different breed a short thickset man of forty or so with the kind of face that doesnt tan and dark deepset eyes something makes a mafioso the peculiar stare the air of authority a kind of detachment from other men this man was cerda i was certain of that as he got to his feet and moved to the car what can i do for you signor he asked as i got out to meet him burke was by now looking really ill great beads of sweat oozed from his face and he had a hand screwed tightly into his stomach were on our way to agrigento i said one of my passengers has been taken ill he leaned down and looked at burke and then rosa and i added are you the proprietor he nodded what is he american irish he put away a bottle of passito at the last stop wouldnt be told tourists he shook his head well get him inside i said to rosa better to wait out here signorina can i get you anything she hesitated then smiled slightly coffee and make certain they boil the water ill send my wife out at once signorina cerda said perhaps you would care to sit at one of the tables she got out of the car as we took burke in between us there was a cracked marble bar half a dozen tables and a passage beyond cerda kicked open a door and we went into a small cluttered bedroom obviously his own we eased burke on to the bed and loosened his tie a couple of hours and hell be over the worst cerda said a hell of a hangover but hell be able to travel ill be back in a minute he left presumably to arrange about the coffee and i lit a cigarette and went to the window a minute or so later the door clicked open again and when i turned he was leaning against it a hand behind his back and now we talk who are you youre quick i said he shook his head no one in his right mind on the way to agrigento turns off to drive ten miles over the worst road in sicily for fun youre right of course im going to take something out of my righthand pocket so dont shoot me it isnt a gun the handkerchief had roughly the same effect as a holy relic i thought for a moment that he was going to kiss it he took an old colt automatic from behind his back probably a relic of the war and put it down on top of a chest of drawers so you are from the capo i felt sure you were of the society from the moment i saw you but one can always be wrong strange that we have not met before im in palermo every month on business for the society ive been away for a few years just returned i decided to give him all guns im the capos grandson his eyes widened and for a moment i honestly thought he might genuflect but of course i remember your mother god rest her he crossed himself an american father that was it i thought there was something not quite sicilian about you what about your friend hes working with me but the story about the passito was true enough he grinned well leave him to it cooler in the kitchen anyway it was a large square room with one small window so that it was in semidarkness in spite of the bright sun outside he brought a bottle of wine to the table filled a couple of glasses and motioned me to sit his wife flitted from the stove like a dark wraith a tray in her hands and vanished through the door now what brings the capos grandson to bellona serafino lentini i said he paused his glass halfway to his lips then lowered it again youd like to get your hands on serafino he laughed mother of god so would i and the capo told you to see me i dont understand the society has been after serafino for nearly two years now hes given us a lot of trouble and the people round go for him in a big way he swallowed some of his wine and sighed very discouraging what is he trying to be i said another guiliano a robin hood he spat on the floor serafinos just like the rest of us out for number one but he does the shepherds a few favours from time to time or stops some old woman from being evicted so they think the sun shines out of his backside six months ago near frentini he held up the local bus that was carrying wages to a cooperative shot the driver and a bank clerk the driver died two days later a real hard man i commented wild he said never grown up mind you he suffered greatly at the hands of the police when he was younger lost the sight of an eye i personally think hes never got over it but what do you want with him i told him as much as he needed to know and when i was finished he shook his head but this is madness you could never hope to get anywhere near serafino here i will show you he opened a drawer and produced a largescale survey map of the region it showed the whole monte cammarata area in detail here is where serafino is staying at the moment he indicated a spot on the map on the other side of the mountain about fifteen hundred feet below the summit theres a shepherds hut up there beside a stream he uses it all the time except when hes on the run i showed my surprise youre certain he smiled sadly let me tell you the facts of life knowing where serafino is and catching him there are two different things every shepherd on the mountains worships him every goatherd they have a signalling system from crag to crag that informs him of the approach of anyone when theyre still three or four hours hard climbing away ive tried to catch him with local men who belong to usmountain men weve always failed how many men does he have with him at the moment three the vivaldi brothers and joe ricco i examined the map for two or three minutes then asked him to describe the area in detail i didnt need to make notes id done this sort of thing too often before in the end i nodded and folded the map can i keep this certainly its impossible you realise that on the contrary i smiled i feel rather more confident than i did earlier now i think ill go for a walk id like to have a look round ill see you later i paused in the street door halfblinded by the sudden glare and put on my sunglasses rosa was seated at the wooden table nearest the car the tray in front of her she wasnt alone the two specimens who lounged on the edge of the table were typical of the younger men still to be found in the region features brutalised and coarsened by a life of toil shabby patched clothing broken boots cloth caps that anywhere else in europe belonged to another age rosas back was stiff and straight and she smoked a cigarette and stared into space one of them said something i couldnt catch what and got what was left of her coffee in his face to a sicilian male a woman is there to be used to do what she is told to be publically humiliated by one would be unthinkable several of the watching children laughed and he reached across the table in a fury and yanked her to her feet his other hand raised to strike i grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him round we stared at each other for a long moment and the expression on his face was already beginning to alter as i slapped him backhanded i didnt say a word his hand went to his cheek his friend plucked at his sleeve they walked backwards faces blank turned and hurried away rosa joined me buttoning her jacket what would you have done if theyd both had a go at you shot them but they didnt i pointed out no youre right they knew better than to tangle with mafia and how would they know thats what they were doing dont play games with me mr wyatt have you looked in the mirror lately there is mafioso stamped clear for all to see the selfsufficiency the power the quiet arrogance why you didnt even speak to that poor wretch that was the most humiliating thing for all for you or for him she raised a hand and i warded it off poor rosa you wear nylon underwear and dresses from london and paris and feel guilty about it why are there brothers and sisters still living in a sty like this something like that she nodded you are very clever arent you mr wyatt stacey i said call me stacey now lets take a walk beyond the village we found a pleasant slope that lefted gently towards the first ridgeback the dark line of forest beyond then bare rock and the peak very faint shimmering in the heat haze i had brought binoculars from the car and i spread the map cerda had given me on the ground and carefully checked certain features with reality can it be done she asked as i folded the map and put the binoculars into their case i think so but youre not going to tell me how i thought you only came along for the ride she hit me on the shoulder with a clenched fist i think you are the most infuriating man i have ever met good i said now lets forget everything else except how pleasant this is well spend the afternoon like carefree lovers and tell pleasant lies to each other she laughed head thrown back but when i took her hand in mine she let it stay there on the slopes we found knapweed with great yellow heads ragwort and bee orchids and silveryblue gentians we walked for an hour then lay in a hollow warmed by the sun smoked and talked i was right she had started life in a village very similar to bellona in the province of messina an uncle on her mothers side a widower had owned a small cafe in palermo and his only daughter had died he needed someone to take her place in the business and no sicilian would dream of bringing in an outsider when there was someone suitable in the family she had married at eighteen the middleaged owner of a similar establishment who had obliged by conveniently passing on a year later my impression was that hoffer had used the place and had taken a fancy to her but she was a little reticent about the details the important thing was that shed been able to make herself into what he wanted a sophisticated woman of the world which couldnt have been easy even with her guts and intelligence she fired a few questions at me in turn and i actually found myself answering nothing important of course and then she slipped badly its incredible she said youre almost human its so difficult to imagine you killing as ruthlessly as you did last night so you know about that i said who told you why colonel burke the answer was out before she could stop it i was there when he told karl was anything ever going to make sense again i laughed out loud and she asked me what was so funny life i said one big joke i pushed her on her back and kissed her she lay there staring up at me her face smooth the eyes quite blank making no move to stop me as i unbuttoned her blouse and slipped a hand inside and cupped it around a breast the nipple blossomed beneath my thumb and i noticed tiny beads of sweat on her brow i kissed them away and laughed there can be no doubt whatsoever that the trouser suit has been the greatest protector of a womans virtue since the chastity belt almost an impossible problem but not quite she said no not quite i kissed her again and this time her arms slid around my neck pulling me close she was really very desirable but so untrustworthy we came down to the village a different way on our return and i got a look into the walled garden at the rear of the wineshop from a couple of hundred feet up a red alfa romeo was parked in the barn and two men were talking in the entrance when i got the binoculars out i discovered it was cerda and marco gagini rosa had walked on ahead some little way picking wild flowers i didnt say anything to her or indeed to cerda when we returned to the wineshop burke was on his feet again by then looking and acting pretty foul i put him into the rear seat for the return trip and rosa sat beside me he controlled his temper for at least a hundred yards and then exploded well arent you going to tell me for christs sake what did you find where serafino hangs out and we can get at him i think so remember the mission at lagona where we parachuted in for the nuns he frowned thats what youre suggesting now its the only way i said can you get the gear together he nodded no difficulty there ill have it flown in tomorrow from crete look are you sure about this ill give it to you word by word when we get back i told him now why dont you try to get some more sleep he laughed sourly sleep ill never sleep again he subsided into the corner and i swung the fiat into the first bend and came out in a cloud of dust when i glanced into the mirror i was smiling we reached palermo just before evening and there was one more thing to be done before we returned to the villa as i reminded burke we called at hoffers bank presented his cheque and had it converted to a bill of exchange to be drawn upon a firm of swiss merchant bankers i designated we left it on deposit in the bank vault from which it could be retrieved on presentation of a key they gave us plus his signature burke wasnt pleased at all mainly because id pushed him into it and he never liked that the clerk gave me a large manilla envelope to put the bill of exchange in and i let burke seal it which seemed to make him feel a little better i told him he could hang on to the key and he put it carefully away in his wallet for some reason he still didnt look really happy i was rather pleased about that nine when we reached the villa hoffer hadnt returned rosa disappeared to take a bath which was exactly what i wanted to do but burke seemed to come to life again youd better have some coffee and a shower before hoffer comes back i told him if he sees you like this hell start worrying about his investment it had an effect of sorts to hell with hoffer he needs me and he bloody well knows it now lets have words i want to know what you found up there today i humoured him to the extent of following him out through the lounge to the terrace piet and legrande were sitting at a table playing cards a bottle of something between them piet jumped to his feet at once as burke arrived that inner glow on his face again thank god legrande said its been as lively as a graveyard around here today when do we see some action soon enough burke found time to smile at piet and squeezed his arm bring us some coffee theres a good lad and well get down to business piet went out on the double and burke took his chair put the tray with its bottles and glasses on the floor and looked up at me all right stacey lets have it i unfolded the map cerda had given me and spread it across the table first of all i went through my conversation with the mafioso mayor then indicated where he thought serafino to be piet returned with one of the houseboys and coffee on a tray round about then it only took me a couple of minutes to give them a description of the terrain ending with my own solution to the problem legrande looked glum having served with a colonial parachute regiment in indochina and later algeria hed as much experience of that kind of thing as burke and probably more i dont like it he said a night drop into country like that is asking for it all we need is for one of us to break a leg and were in real trouble its the only way i said otherwise we might as well pack our bags and go home staceys right burke said briskly weve no choice now lets get down to the details i stood up youll have to manage without me im going out he looked at me with a frown dont be absurd weve got to get this thing organised thats your job youre supposed to be in charge i spent a long hot afternoon sorting the situation out for you while you lay flat on your back tanked up to the ears i found myself leaning on the table caught in our first public confrontation it was as if piet and legrande werent thereas if we were quite alone there was a slight puzzled frown on his face something close to pain in his eyes he wanted to ask me why i knew that instead he said quietly all right stacey if thats the way you want it he went back to examining the map and i straightened legrande looked completely mystified but piets face was white and angry i ignored them both and went out i showered then pulled on my old bathrobe and went back into the bedroom towelling my hair at that precise moment the door opened and piet jaeger came in he slammed it shut and glared at me what in the hell are you playing at you shamed him in front of all of us the man whos done more for you than anyone else in the world ill tell you what he did for me i said he taught me three things to shoot my enemy from cover instead of face to face to kill not to wound and that a bullet in the back is to be preferred to one from the front quite an education oh there have been one or two other items in between but those are the salient features you owe him everything piet was almost beside himself he saved you twice we said no walking wounded at lagona but when the chips were down and you got it in the leg what did he do so he made them carry me out id love to know why you rotten bastard his south african accent had noticeably thickened hes worth three of you any day of the week you arent fit to walk in his shadow in a way i was sorry for him i suppose a lot of his anger came down to plain jealousy he loved burke i realised that now and had probably always suffered me in silence i had been with burke from the beginning and he was rightby all the rules i should have been given a bullet in the head the mercenary law to save me from falling into the hands of the simbas alive but burke had ordered them to carry me out for piet that must have been about as easy to take as a lump of glass in the gut go on get out of it i said go and smooth his wrinkled brow or whatever you do together in the night watches he swung hard the kind of punch that would have knocked my head from my shoulders had it landed i made sure it didnt allowing myself to roll backwards across the bed i didnt fancy my chances in any kind of fair fight he hadnt been in jail lately so he was fitter than i was and had a two stone advantage in weight he scrambled across the bed trying to get at me got caught up in the sheets and fell on his face i kicked him in the head which didnt accomplish much as i was barefooted but it shook him for a moment and by the time he was on his feet i had the smith and wesson in my hand by god ill have you now wyatt he plunged forward and i shot the lobe off his left ear he screamed like a woman and his hand went to the side of his head as blood spurted he stared at me in horror and then the door burst open and legrande appeared a second later he was pulled out of the way and burke entered the browning in his hand he got between us fast ill say that for him for gods sake whats going on here youd better get your bloody lover boy out of it if you want to keep him in one piece i said this time i only nicked him id be just as happy to make it two in the belly and he can take his own sweet time about dying a good ninety per cent of my anger was stimulated and i even allowed my gun hand to shake a little the total effect on burke was remarkable the skin tightened across the cheekbones something stirred in his eyes and for a moment hate looked out at me i think it was then at that precise moment that i knew we were finally finished that whatever had been between us was dust and ashes he allowed the browning to drop to his side turned and took piet by the arm better let me have a look at that for you they left without a word legrande hesitated and said slowly look stacey maybe we should have words id never seen him look so troubled go on get out of it i said im sick to death of the lot of you i gave him a shove into the corridor and slammed the door i had a hard job keeping my laughter down so now it was stacey the wild man let them sort that out it was only later alone in the silence that i discovered that my hand really had begun to shake i threw the smith and wesson on to the bed and dressed quickly id hung on to the keys of the fiat and when i went down to the courtyard it was still there as i climbed behind the wheel legrande arrived and opened the other door ive got to talk to you stacey i dont know which way im pointing i shook my head you wouldnt be welcome where im going as far as the village then theres a cafe there we could have a drink suit yourself but i cant give you long he scrambled in and i drove away he lit one of his eternal gauloise and sat back an expression of settled gloom on his hard peasant face he looked more like a basque than anything else which wasnt surprising as he came from a village just over the border from andorra he was a close man one of the most efficient killers i have ever known but not i think by instinct he was not a cruel man by nature and i had seen him carry a child through twenty miles of the worst country in the congo rather than leave it to die he was a product of his time more than anything a member of the resistance during the war he had killed his first man at the age of fourteen later had come the years of bloody conflict in the swamps of indochina the humiliation of dien bien phu followed by a viet prison camp men like him who had been through the fire swore that it would never happen again they read mao tsetung on guerrilla warfare and went to algeria and fought the same kind of war against the same faceless enemy fighting fire with fire only to find at the end a greater humiliation than ever legrande had come down on the side of the oas and had fled to the congo from yet another defeat i wondered sometimes what he lived for and sitting in the small cafe in the candlelight he looked old and used up as if he had done everything there was to do he swallowed the brandy he had ordered and called for another whats wrong between you and the colonel stacey you tell me he shook his head hes changedjust in this last six months hes changed god knows why but somethings eating him thats for sure i cant help you i said im as much in the dark as you are maybe piet can tell you they seem thick enough he was surprised thats been going on for years now ever since the kasai i thought you knew i smiled i only believed in storybook heroes until recently how long has he been drinking it came with the general change and he goes at it privately too i dont like that do you think hes up to this thing we wont know that till it happens i finished my brandy and got up must go now jules can you get back all right he nodded and looked up at me a strange expression on his face maybe hes like me stacey maybe hes just survived too long sometimes i feel ive no right to be here at all can you understand that if you think that way for long enough you lose all sense of reality his words haunted me as i went out to the fiat and drove away the bechstein sounded as good as ever as i waited for my grandfather to appear i tried a little debussy and the first of the three short movements of ravels sonatina after that i got ambitious sorted out some music and worked my way through bachs prelude and fugue in e flat minor lovely icecold stuff that still sounded marvellous even if my technique had dulled a little over the years when i finished there was still no sign of him i went looking and was surprised to find him sitting on the terrace with a bottle and a couple of glasses in front of him i didnt want to disturb you he said ive been listening from here it sounded fine at a distance he smiled and filled a glass for me it was marsala and very good not one of my favourites but i couldnt have said so had my life depended on it because suddenly and for no apparent reason there was an intimacy between us something very real something i didnt want to lose how did you get on in the mountains he asked me didnt marco give you a report hasnt he returned yet he managed an expression of vague bewilderment which didnt impress me in the slightest marco has been in palermo all day as he is every friday its the biggest day of the week for us receipts to check the bank to see you know how it is in business i smiled all right well play the game your way i saw cerda who told me where he thinks serafmo may be found catching him there is another matter with a shepherd whistling from every crag but it could be done is it permitted to ask how i told him and he frowned slightly youve done this sort of thing before oh yes im quite the commando but to jump into darkness in country like that sounds a more than usually dangerous practice possibly but it can be done why stacey why do you want to do this thing why do you live this way theres always the money he shook his head weve been into thatnot good enough no when i look at you i see myself forty years ago mafioso branded clean to the bone which is another way of saying i like to play the game i said and a savage bloody little game it is but its all ive got that and burke i stood up and moved to the edge of the terrace and he said softly you dont like him it goes deeper than that everything i am he made people keep telling me that and im tired of hearing it i turned to face him he taught me that if youre going to kill it may as well be from the back as the front that theres no difference but hes wrong i desperately wanted him to understand more than i had ever wanted anything he sat there looking at me gravely without the rules its nothingno sense to any of it with them theres still something to hang on to he nodded a slight smile on his face something else you brought out of this hole of yours stacey i suppose so then it was worth it he took out a cigar now go back to the piano like a good boy and play me your mothers favourite piece again the music was absolute perfection and brought her back to me like a living presence all the sadness of life all its beauty caught in an exquisite moment that seemed to go on for ever when i finished there were tears on my face when i got back hoffer had returned and there was some sort of council of war going on in the lounge burke looked completely different hed shaved and wore a khaki shirt with epaulets which gave him a certain military air but the change went deeper there was a briskness about him an authority i had not seen since my return when i went in he glanced up from the map and said calmly ah there you are stacey ive just been going over things with mr hoffer piet stood in the background a wad of sticking plaster moulding his left ear legrande beside him the south african simply didnt look at me as i went to the table this is one hell of a good idea hoffer said rubbing his hands together colonel burke tells me its primarily your suggestion burkes voice was flat and colourless as he cut in the trouble is getting to serafino before he realises were in the area his camp as we understand it is about four thousand five hundred feet up on the eastern slopes of the mountain the idea is that we make a night drop on to a plateau about a thousand feet below the summit on the western side then you cross over and catch him with his pants down hoffers choice of phrase was unfortunate under the circumstances but burke nodded we should get over the summit at least by dawn on the other side theres a forest belt about a thousand feet down oak birch some pine i understand once we reach that well have plenty of cover on the final stretch hoffer seemed genuinely excited as he examined the map you know something for the first time i really believe theres a chance lets all have a drink on it another time if you dont mind i said i could do with an early night its been a long day he was pleasant enough about it and as no one pressed me to stay i left them and went up to my room not that i could sleep when i did go to bed i lay there with the french windows open because of the heat and after a while it started to shower it was round about that time that rosa arrived she took off the silk kimono she was wearing look no trouser suit when she got in beside me she was shivering though from desire or cold was uncertain and whether she was there for herself or hoffer didnt really seem to matter it was nice lying there in the darkness holding her in the hollow of my arm listening to the rain even when she fell asleep on me ten as i found out later burke didnt go to bed instead he flew to crete in the cessna to pick up a few things we were going to need and was back just before eleven on saturday morning sunday being the conventional day of rest seemed as reasonable a time to catch serafino napping as we were likely to find which meant going in that night there was almost a full moon which didnt please burke much but he was impatient to be off now that the ball was rolling again and bustled around full of energy checking everything we used a small private airstrip not far from the villa a cow pasture really with a hangar that was barely large enough to get the cessna inside the plane was the model with eight seats and we had those out for a start a particularly good point was the airstair door amidships which would give us a clear exit something we badly needed if all four of us were to get out in time to drop in a nice tight group the pilot a man called nino verda was ex italian air force about thirty from the look of him and according to hoffer the best money could buy he needed to be to fly that kind of country in the dark graze a six thousand foot mountain and give us an eight hundred foot drop over that plateau was going to take genius we were using the x type parachute the kind british paratroopers used before they changed to the new nato one burke preferred the x type it got you down faster and could be guided with greater accuracy the reserve chutes were of the same type and identical with those we had used in the congo our weapons were unconventional by some standards but proved in combat the only realistic test we were using the chinese ak assault rifle probably the most reliable automatic combat rifle in the world at that time and the new israeli sub machine gun the uzi which was better than the sterling in every way two grenades each a commando knifethe list seemed endless burke even had a kit inspection with each mans camouflaged jump suit laid out together with every item of equipment and he went over the operation with the map and a stopwatch so many times that even piet jaeger looked sick by late evening towards me he seemed no different and i suppose any touch of formality in our relationship could have been put down to the exigencies of the situation at dinner hoffer was joviality personified only the best was good enough although burke put his foot down as regards alcohol but the food was excellent surprisingly i found an appetite for it and rosa was there wearing her best looking absolutely magnificent afterwards burke took us through the plan again in detail including the walkout if everything went well which he estimated would take eight or nine hours to the point on the bellona road where we were to be met by hoffer himself with the necessary transport he shook hands with us all solemnly when burke had finished and made a little speech about how much he appreciated what we were doing and how he hoped before long to have his stepdaughter with him again god willing which i thought was pushing it a bit far later when i was changing in my room rosa appeared she zipped up the front of my camouflaged suit and kissed me on the cheek from you or from hoffer i said from me she touched my face briefly come back safe she hesitated in the doorway and looked at me a strange expression on her face she wanted to speak wanted like hell to tell me something and was desperately afraid of the consequences i felt a sudden rush of affection for her shook my head and smiled dont say it rosa not if youre truly afraid of him but i am she said her face white he can be cruel oh so cruel stacey you couldnt imagine tell me about it when i return when it doesnt matter any more i opened the door and kissed her as a woman should be kissed moulding her ripeness into me i survive all things rosa solazzo especially the hoffers of this world after she had gone i buckled on my belt with the smith and wesson in its spring holster and adjusted my beret the man who stared out at me from the mirror was a stranger someone from before the hole what then was he doing here it was quite a thought but the wrong time to be asking questions like that and i left and went down to join the others the cruising speed of the cessna is up to two hundred and sixtyone miles per hour which meant that we could expect to be over the target in twenty minutes we delayed takeoff for an hour because the night was still too bright for burkes liking but the overcast promised by the met forecast didnt materialise and he reluctantly gave the word to go at one am verda had logged an internal flight to gela with the authorities at punta raisi just in case questions were asked which meant flying through the great divide anyway a minor divergence would take him into the area of the drop and within minutes he could be back on course again including the training burke had given us in the congo i had jumped nine times in all so this would make tena nice round number i had never particularly enjoyed the experience a paratrooper is a clumsy creature hampered by the requirements of his calling the x type parachute weighs twentyeight pounds and the reserve chute around twentyfour a fair weight to start with add to that a supply bag carrying anything up to a hundred pounds and its hardly surprising that the only movement possible is downwards even removing the passenger seats from the interior gave us barely enough room to manoeuvre with all that equipment burke had rigged a static line of his own devising and he and verda had carefully removed the airstair door which was fine as long as no one fell out before we got there a lot of things were going through my head as i squatted on the floor in line as the cessna lifted smoothly into the air the die was cast now we were on our wayno turning back and i still wasnt certain about anything except that everyone in sight seemed to be lying to me including rosa for some unaccountable reason that one hurt and when i analysed my feelings i realised with a shock that i had liked her really liked her she had guts and her own special brand of integrity and i knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that her final appearance in my room had been completely personal she had come to say goodbye because she wanted to and not because hoffer or anyone else had pressured her we were flying at eight thousand feet now and the view was certainly spectacular chains of mountains peaks and ridges white in the moonlight the valleys between dark with shadow the journey passed completely without incident and was so short that it was something of a shock when the red light verda had rigged blinked rapidly several times when i looked out of the window i could see the jagged peak of monte cammarata the western slope and then as we slanted down the dark saucershaped plateau which was the dropping zone the waterfall next to it bright in the moonlight a clear marker verda swung into the wind and turned coming in so close to the rocky precipice that lifted to the summit about the plateau that the heart moved inside me we got a brief idea of what it was going to be like and then he swung the cessna into the void as he turned to come in again burke who was the lead man stood up and slipped on to the static line piet followed suit then legrande and i brought up the rear my stomach was hollow mouth dry and i shuffled forward with the others caught in a nightmare of suspense the red light blinked once then twice the cessna rocked in some kind of turbulence and burke went out through the door piet must have been right on top of him legrande hard on his heels and then it was my turn the wind howled past the gaping doorway only a madman could venture out there i told myself and fell headfirst somersaulting i released the supply bag i had been clutching tightly in my arms and it fell to swing twenty feet below on the end of a line clipped to my waist and i was swinging too beneath the dark khaki umbrella the most beautiful sight in the world at that moment when you jump at eight hundred feet it takes exactly thirty seconds to hit the deck which doesnt give you long to sort yourself out that close to the rock face there were downdraughts and i started to oscillate as usual once you were out in the open the light didnt seem anything like as good i caught a brief glimpse of one chute then another like dark thistledown drifting into the shadows beside the waterfall and then i was moving in fast myself the trouble with a nightdrop is that usually you cant see the ground which accounts for the high proportion of broken limbs on that type of operation people being caught by surprise and landing too stiffly that was one thing i liked about the supply bag dangling down there at the end of a twenty foot line unless you are oscillating alarmingly the bag hits the deck first with a solid thump warning you to get ready i just made it in time the supply bag thudded into the ground and i followed a split second later rolling into a patch of surprisingly springy turf i rolled again and came to rest a shoulder of rock nudging me in the ribs i lay there winded and someone came close and leaned over me there was the gleam of steel and i got my hand up just in time the smith and wesson ready i was only going to cut your line piet jaeger said are you sure it wasnt my throat you were aiming for another time he said when you arent so useful when we dont need you any more he sounded as if he meant it and sliced through my belt line and pulled my supply bag clear i struggled out of my harness and got rid of the chute now that i was down the light seemed much better and i could see burke and legrande approaching carrying their chutes and supply bags the frenchman was limping but it turned out to be nothing serious in his case his oscillation had been so great that he had hit the ground before his supply bag when unprepared hed obviously had a bad snaking but he made light of it as we unpacked the supply bags held the commando rucksacks containing food and water our weapons and extra ammunition and when they were empty went into a convenient crevasse together witih the parachutes we squatted in the shelter of the rocks and burke passed round a flask of brandy i took a long pull and found myself smiling grateful to be alive two feet on solid earth again as the warmth spread through me theres no point in hanging about he said straight up to the top from here weve got to get over and into those trees while its still dark which didnt give us long because dawn was officially at ten past four and we moved out at once in single file i took the lead because in theory at least i knew more about the terrain than anyone else and followed a route which took us straight up the side of the waterfall it was a marvellous night the moon almost full a tracer or two of cloud aroused stars glittering everywhere the mountains marched into the distance ridge after ridge of them and far to the east moonlight glittered on etnas snowy peak the valleys were dark but four thousand feet below and a couple of miles to the right in the general direction of bellona a single light gleamed i wondered if it could be cerda sitting up and wondering how we were making out for nothing was more certain than that my grandfather would have kept him fully informed a good actor cerda one had to admit that even the gun behind his back had all been part of the show he had behaved in a way it was reasonable to suppose i would expect him tovery clever his one flaw had been his apparent ignorance of the presence of joanna truscott in the mountains hardly likely in a man who knew everything else there was to know about serafino still an excellent performance with marco keeping out of the way in the back room you really couldnt trust anyone in this affair or so it seemed to me then it was just after three when we made the summit and i dropped into a hollow between rocks and waited for the others i was tired and i suppose the truth was that i wasnt really fit enough for this kind of game yet on the other hand the others didnt look too good either legrande particularly and burke seemed to be having difficulty with his breathing he passed the brandy round again probably as an excuse to have one himself so far so good weve got just under an hour to get down a thousand feet or so if we can do that i think well have it made he nodded to me all right stacey so was still leading the way i stood up and moved out more conscious than ever that he was at the back of me it wasnt easy going at all the ground was rough and treacherous and with the moon almost down the light on that side of the mountain was very bad indeed in places there were great aprons of shale that were as treacherous underfoot as ice sliding like water at the slightest movement i paused after half an hour on a small plateau and waited for them in the east there was already a perceptible lightening of the sky on the rim of the world and i knew we were not going to make it unless the going changed completely piet arrived first seemingly in excellent shape and then legrande who slumped to the ground and looked pretty tired to me burke brought up the rear and i noticed again that his breathing wasnt good what have we stopped for he demanded i shrugged i thought we could all do with a breather to hell with that well never make it at this rate he sounded good and angry and i cut him off with a quick gesture okayyoure the boss i started down again pushing myself hard taking a chance or two on occasion at one point sliding a good hundred feet on a great wave of shale that seemed as if it would never stop moving not that it did any good in the grey light of dawn we were still three hundred feet up from the first scattering of trees ive never felt so naked in my life as when i led the way down that final stretch of bare hillside it was exactly twenty minutes to five when i reached the outer belt of trees eleven as the greyness spread among the trees we crouched in a circle and had something to eat burke seemed fine when sitting down and his breathing was normal again but legrande looked his age and more the lines on his face etched knife deep he was getting old that was the trouble too old for this sort of caper even piet looked tired and cold crouched there with the mist curling from the damp ground the heavy brigade thats what wed always called legrande and him there had been occasions when the sight of those two arriving shoulder to shoulder smashing their way through with the force of a runaway train had been enough to make you stand up and cheer but not any more times changed and people changed with them that was life and the pattern of things i shivered slightly i did not like this kind of grey dawning it reminded me of too many similar ones and a lot of good men gone i lit a cigarette which tasted foul but i persisted and burke moved over and unfolded his copy of the map we cant be more than five hundred feet above this shepherds hut where hes supposed to be hanging out it might be an idea if you made a quick reconnaissance well wait here ill give you threequarters of an hour he added in a low voice i think legrande could do with the rest he looks shot to me i got to my feet i think youve got a point there ill see you later i moved down through the trees on the rockier slopes they were corkoak and hollyoak but then i entered a belt of beech and pine and the going became a lot easier a fox broke cover giving me so much of a fright that i almost ended his days for him which would have been fatal for all of us but there was plenty of wildlife on the mountain besides serafino and his boys wildcats and martens and the odd wolf although they all tended to run the opposite way at the first smell of a man i made good progress now and broke into a trot my rifle at the trail sliding down the occasional slope on my backside and within fifteen minutes of leaving the others i had descended a good three hundred feet there was a freshwater stream over on my right i worked my way across lay on my belly and splashed water on my face it seemed as good a route down as any and it was more than likely that any shepherd building a hut would place it as close to water as possible especially when you considered what it was like in this country during the summer it was the voice i heard first a kind of smothered gasp that was cut off sharply i paused dropping to one knee there was silence then a vigorous splashing and another sharp cry i had seen the honourable joanna truscott twice in my life both times on photos which hoffer had shown us in one she had been dressed for skiing in the other for a garden party at buckingham palace it was difficult to accept that the girl i watched now from the bushes floundering naked in a hollow among the trees where the stream had formed a small pool was the same her hair was tied back into a kind of eighteenth century queue and her face neck and arms were gypsybrown from the sun the rest of her was milk white and boyish the breasts almost nonexistent although the hips could only have belonged to a woman she scrambled out and rubbed herself down with an old blanket i didnt bother looking away for one thing she didnt know i was there and for another there was something rather sexless about her strange how some women can set one aflame with all the fury of a petrolsoaked bonfire in an instant and others have no effect whatsoever she pulled on a pair of old trousers that had definitely seen better days a mans shirt green woollen sweater with holes in the elbows and bound a red scarf around her head knotting it under her chin as she sat down to pull on a pair of spanish fell boots i stepped out of the trees and said cheerfully good morning she was a tough one all right and good morning to you she replied calmly and started to get up no need to be alarmed i said rather unnecessarily my name is wyattstacey wyatt im from your stepfather karl hoffer ive three friends waiting for me now up the mountains weve come to get you out god what a fool i was she was on her own and unguarded obviously free to roam at will why on earth that didnt strike me at once ill never know it had been a strenuous nightperhaps i was tired what am i expected to dostand up and cheer she said coolly in that beautifully clipped uppercrust english voice how did he tell you to dispose of me gun knife or blunt instrument i stared at her in astonishment and at the same time some kind of light started to dawn she had turned away from me slightly when i got the front view again she was holding an old beretta automatic pistol in her right hand and looked as if she knew exactly what to do with it would you mind going into rather more detail i told her im afraid im not with you why dont you pull the other one she suggested crisply i was still holding the ak at the trail i dropped it at my feet and put the uzi beside it look no hands she wasnt impressed what about the thing in the holster i removed the smith and wesson laid it down then walked back three paces squatted against a hollyoak and took out my cigarettes like one she shook her head i want to live to a ripe old age if you think its worth it i lit one myself now im going to talk and youre going to listen and then you can shoot meif you still want to well see she said calmly only make it quick i havent had any breakfast so i told her in a few brief sentences and when i was finished her expression hadnt altered in the slightest let me get this straight my stepfather told you i was abducted by serafino lentini and held to ransom that he paid up but that serafino decided to have his own wicked way with me after all and kept the money into the bargain thats about the size of it a lie mr wyatt from beginning to end i thought so she showed her surprise i dont understand i happen to know that because of injuries sustained under police interrogation some years ago serafino lentini isnt physically capable of taking that kind of interest in any woman but if you knew that if you realised there was something phoney about my stepfathers story from the beginning why did you come ive always been insatiably curious i grinned the money was good and he made you sound rather interesting tell me did you really sleep with the chauffeur when you were fourteen i certainly cracked that iron composure of hers with that one her eyes widened she gasped and what i can only describe as a virginal flush tinged her cheeks sorry i said its obvious now that he has an unusually inventive streak you want the facts ill give them to you she wasnt pointing the beretta at me any longer and she looked mad as they say about life insurance im worth more dead than alive my mother left me everything in trust with my stepfather as executor something of a mistake on her part im twentyone in another three weeks and get personal control of the whole thing if i die before then hoffer gets the lot two and a half million sterling it certainly made what he was paying us sound very marginal indeed the only true thing he appears to have told you she went on is the fact that he gave serafino lentini twentyfive thousand dollars but for a different reason i was to be ambushed when driving alone to visit friends at villabla one evening robbed and shot dead beside my car where i would be easily found and identified apparently just another victim of a bandit outrage but serafino wouldnt play he intended to at first standing there beside my car that evening after he and his men had stopped me i thought my last hour had come i dont think ill ever be as close to death again what made him change his mind hes told me since that he liked the look of me that i reminded him of his younger sister who died in childbirth a year ago i think the real truth is that he doesnt like my stepfather it seems they had dealings before although hes never told me much about that then why did he do business with hoffer at all he wanted moneybig money hes enthusiastic about only one thingthe idea of emigrating to south america and leaving this life behind i think im alive because it suddenly struck him that it would be rather amusing to take hoffers money and not carry out his side of the bargain so he whisked you off to the mountains ive been with him ever since doesnt it ever worry you that he might change his mind on another whim she shook her head not in the slightest since i explained the real facts of the situation he and his men are only too well aware which side their bread is buttered on but of course i said softly all theyve got to do is keep you alive long enough and youll have all the money in the world exactly once things are settled satisfactorily ive promised to get them out to south america with a hundred thousand pounds to split between the four of them so now all was revealed or was it a great deal that had puzzled me was now explained but there were several things which still didnt make any kind of sense she voiced one of them for me one thing i cant understand what were you supposed to do once you got your hands on me take you to hoffer hes meeting us himself on the beflona road didnt he expect me to say anything to you werent you supposed to notice when you got here that i wasnt the slave of serafinos passion that he made out which had been worrying me for some time and yet i could think of no possible explanation except for the one she offered me herself a moment later which takes us back to square one she said the only logical explanation that you dropped in to finish me off along with serafino and his men then my stepfather goes to the police wringing his hands giving them some story about how hes been afraid for my life and didnt dare seek official help before but now he cant go on the police make an official search and find whats left of us wouldnt they want to know who was responsible there are several groups in the mountains just like serafino and his men and theres no love lost she shrugged it would be reasonable to suppose that one of them was responsible all very sad but nice and tidy for my stepfather when you think of it it is the only explanation that makes any kind of sense her hand started to bring up the beretta again it was her eyes that warned me and the sudden pinched look about the mouth not that i was particularly alarmed i came up in an unnecessarily spectacular spring got my shoulder to her knees and had her on her back in a moment once on top the war was over although a certain amont of wriggling continued until i clamped a knee across each of her arms i held up the beretta and slipped the safety catch it just wont fire until you do that try again i dropped it on her chest got up and turned my back on her i lit another cigarette an ostentatious bit of theatricality and when i turned again she was standing staring at me in bewilderment the beretta swinging loosely from one hand and pointing directly into the ground but it still doesnt make sense she said she was rightit didnt the only thing which filled her true circumstances was that we had been sent to kill her and we had not or had we it was suddenly cold and my throat went dry no it wasnt possible and i tried to push the thought away from me burke would never have stood still for a thing like that in any case i wasnt allowed to take it any further someone jumped on my back an arm clamped around my throat and down i went someone once said that god made some men big and some small and left it to colonel colt to even things up as a philosophy where violence is concerned its always appealed to me and like most relatively small men ive never been much good at the handtohand stuff the arm about my throat was doing a nice efficient job of cutting off the air supply i was choking there was a roaring in my ears somewhere the girl was shouting and then he made the mistake of moving position and i managed an elbow strike to his privates it was only half a target and there wasnt much zip behind it but it was enough i was released with a curse rolled over twice and fetched up against a hollyoak tree not that it did me much good my head went back with a crack and the muzzle of a rifle was shoved into the side of my neck twelve the mi calibre is the semiautomatic rifle that got most american infantrymen through the second world war which meant that the one which was about to blow a hole in me now had been around for quite a while on the other hand it had obviously been cared for like a lover the stock was polished the gunmetal shone with oil and the whole thing looked as lethal as anyone could wish just like the man who was holding it serafino lentini serafino stop the girl shouted in italian you mustnt shoot himyou mustnt he was wearing an old corduroy suit leather leggings to his knees and the face beneath the cloth cap was recklessly handsome in spite of the weekold stubble of beard and the dirty black patch over the right eye a gay lad this a bravo straight out of the sixteenth century i could almost see him in doublet and hose a kiss for a woman a blow for a man i smiled remembering the old joke very funny except that with this boy youd probably get a knife in the gut if you got in his way the two men behind him were just a blur it was his face that loomed large for me in all the world at that moment he grinned wolfishly and pushed off the safety careful i said cursed is the man who spills the blood of his own the old sicilian proverb had about the same effect as a good stiff hook to the chin his eye that one good eye of his seemed to widen but most important of all the barrel of the mi was removed from my neck quick he said who are you barbaccias grandson were kin through my grandmothers family mother of god but i remember you as a boy the safety catch clicked on again the most reassuring thing to happen for some time once when i was fourteen my old man went to see the capo on family business i had to wait at the gate i saw you walking in the garden playing with a dog all white with black spots i forget what they call them dalmatians i said and remembered old trudi for the first time in years the capos american grandson in his pretty clothes god how i hated you that day i wanted to rub mud in your hair he produced a stub of cigar from one pocket lit it and squatted in front of me i heard you and the capo didnt get on after they got your mother that way he spat mafia pigs still from what i hear hes almost swept the board clean i wanted to ask him what he meant but the occasion didnt seem appropriate he reached over and fingered my jump suit whats all this when i first saw you through the trees i thought theyd brought the troops in again by now i had everything in focus including the girl and the two specimens who were examining the assault rifle with interest they were in the same unshaven condition as serafino the same ragged state each of them had a shotgun slung from the shoulder i sat up wearily i cant go through all that again ask her he didnt argue simply turned and went to joanna truscott they moved away a little talking in low tones and i got my cigarettes out as i lit one the man who was taking a sight along the barrel of the ak lowered it and snapped a finger i tossed the packet across there was a definite physical resemblance between them and i said youre the vivaldi boys i suppose the one with the rifle nodded thats right im augusthes pietro dont expect much from him though he tapped his head he has his difficulties and he cant speak pietro did a semblance of a jig and his mouth opened exposing half a dozen black stubs and nothing else he had a great foolish grin that reminded me strongly of the cheshire cat i suppose he had exactly the same smile on his face as he blew someones head off in fact the head might very well be mine which was a cheering thought and then serafino came back and i could tell from the look on his face that everything was going to be all right its ironic he said when i remember how often old barbaccia has tried to have me put down but then we are not of the blood a nice distinction but sufficient can i have my weapons back i asked i dont know about that we could do with them ourselves he was obviously unwilling but decided to make a gesture give him the popgun back hang on to the others august handed me the smith and wesson looking more than happy and i pushed it into the spring holster had they only known it at that range i could have given each of them a bullet in the head within the second we went down through the trees in a line serafino and i together at the rear apparently he still had hoffers twentyfive thousand buried in an old biscuit tin somewhere in the area he thought the whole thing very funny and laughed frequently in the telling so ive killed a few people in my time thats life he scratched his face vigorously i did a couple of jobs for hoffer when he was having trouble with construction workers on the new road through the mountains leaned on one or two and then we dumped some trade unionist down a crevasse and then he gets in touch with me through a friend and lays out this job concerning the girl did you know who she was not a hint he told me she was a blackmailerthat she could ruin him unless she had her mouth closed for keeps id insisted on payment in advance so i had the cash anyway and when i saw her i liked her he grinned ruefully not that im half the man i used to be so shed nothing to worry about there yes i heard about that he laughed uproariously life its a bastard eh no i liked her for the way she stuck out her chin and stood up straight when she thought i was going to shoot her it put me off her standing there like some princess from rome then it struck me as how funny it might be to put one over on hoffer seeing i already had the cash hes a rat and anyway i dont like mafia he spat again i stumbled put off my stroke to such an extent that i almost lost my balance i grabbed him by the arm hoffer is mafia didnt you know one of those american syndicate boys the yanks deported during the last few years and my grandfather hadnt said a word does the girl know not really he shook his head oh she thinks hes a swine all right but this is only her second visit to sicily to her mafia is the two lines in the tourist handbook that says its a romantic memory which was reasonable enough what would she know spending the greater part of the year at some fancy english boarding school and most of the rest following the social round in france switzerland and the usual places we had something in common there so hoffer is working for the society over here do me a favour serafmo seemed surprised you know the rule once in never out hes the last of half a dozen similar what happened to the others two pressed the starters in their alfas and went straight to hell the rest were ventilated in one way or another as i remember they had the knife out for barbaccia but they made a big mistake the old wolf was a match for all of them the attempt on his life i said the bomb which killed my mother who was responsible for that who knows he shrugged any one of them does it matter barbaccia will have had all of them before he is through my flesh crawled at the enormity of it vito barbaccia lord of life and death he was well named i shuddered and went after serafino who was striding ahead whistling cheerfully the shepherds hut looked as if it had been there since time began it was constructed of rocks and boulders of various sizes the gaps in between filled with dried mud and the low roof consisted of sods on top of oak branches at that point the stream had turned into a brawling torrent descending rapidly through several deep pools disappearing over an apron of stone about fifty yards below the hut was built into a sloping bank in a clearing beside the stream and looked remarkably homely a couple of donkeys grazed nearby with three goats and half a dozen chickens moved in and out of the undergrowth pecking vigorously at the soil a boy of eighteen or nineteen presumably the joe ricco cerda had mentioned crouched over a small fire feeding the flames beneath a cooking pot with sticks except for his youth and red norman hair he was depressingly similar in appearance to the rest of them the same cloth cap patched suit and leather leggings the same sullen brutalised features he got up staring at me curiously and the vivaldi brothers joined him crouching to help themselves with a dirty and chipped enamel mug to what vaguely smelled like coffee serafino and joanna truscott sat on a log by the stream and he produced from somewhere another piece of cigar and lit it he looked up into the grey morning still it doesnt make sense he shook his head id give a lot to know what hoffer is playing at perhaps the whole thing is simpler than we think joanna said maybe he assumed you would do anything for money he could be right there i agreed but somehow it didnt sound too funny because it sent me off on another train of thought one i wanted to avoid but serafino wouldnt let it alone these friends of yours you can trust them theyre not making a monkey out of you i thought about it hard and tried to sound confident anything is possible in this life but i dont think so theres one way to find out of course and what is that ill go and see them he nodded biting on his cigar a frown on his face joanna truscott said you could make them an offer on my behalf if you like it would be nice to turn the tables on my stepfather for once she picked up a stick snapped it between her hands he married my mother for money did you know that when she wouldnt give him any more he got rid of her are you certain of that she nodded not that i could prove it he thought hed get everything because he knew she loved him loved him to distractionbut he made a mistake she left me everything and now hes in troublebad trouble what kind he needs moneya great deal of money hes frightened too so mafia was in this after all all right wait for me here i looked at my watch saw that it was an hour since i had left burke and the others which meant they would already be on their way down ill be about half an hour i thought they might stop me from going but nobody moved when i looked back from the edge of the trees joanna truscott had taken off her red scarf and the blonde hair gleamed as the first rays of the early morning sun broke through the clouds i ploughed up the steep slope pushing through the undergrowth and the going was so hard that i had little time to concentrate on anything else except making progress but i wasnt happy the trouble was that in my heart id never believed hoffers story for a moment certain aspects of it were always manifestly impossible and if id seen the flaws why hadnt burke but then i couldnt believe the second possibility hed done many things in his timeaided and abetted by me on occasion killed ruthlessly and often without compassion but as a soldier it was inconceivable that he would have agreed to murder a young girl for money in any case it would not have been possible with the rest of us there so deep in thought was i that it was with a sense of surprise that i found myself at the spot by the stream where i had met the honourable joanna earlier i paused to catch my breath and a stick cracked behind me hold it right there piet jaeger stepped from behind a tree his assault rifle levelled at my belt stacey what happened we were getting worried burke moved out of the trees with legrande and piet jaeger went to stand point at the edge of the little clearing automatically he was a good soldier always had been ill say that for him well what happened burke said again did you have any luck he frowned suddenly wheres your rifle in custody i said one of serafinos boys took a fancy to it he went very still youd better explain i moved to the side of the stream away from jaeger and legrande and sat on a boulder burke lit a cigarette and squatted before me his rifle across his knees okay what happened you were supposed to scout not make contact i found the girl up here on her own having a swim no guards no restraint when i told her who i was from she expected me to kill her she what a look of astonishment appeared on his face as for serafino and his boys i went on they arent sweating over her fair white body in turn as hoffer implied theyre working for her by staying up here she says alive its as simple as that i gave him the whole story in detail even the girls suspicions about her mothers death and i watched him closely all the time when i was finished he got to his feet and stood there staring down into the water jiggling a handful of pebbles at least it explains a few things hoffer had a word with me just before we left he said he was worried because the girl had a history of what amounted to a kind of mental instability that shed had treatment a couple of times without success he said she was sex mad and probably enjoying every moment of her experience he seemed to think she might kick up a fuss about coming with us he said she very easily became hysterical and was capable of making the wildest accusations he turned youre sure she isnt i shook my head ive spoken to serafino he told me he was hired to kill the girl and changed his mind because he wanted to do hoffer down he doesnt like him the bastard burke threw the pebbles he was holding into the water viciously neither do i the main thing which had worried me was now explained and i was conscious of a definite easing of tension and a sudden rush of affection for burke coupled with a kind of guilt because i had even admitted the possibility that he was capable of such an act he produced his packet of cigarettes for the second time it was empty and he threw it into the stream i gave him one of mine and when he lit it i saw that his hands were shaking he stared out across the water god what a fool ive been i knew there was something phoney about the whole thing from the beginning i knew that and yet i still let it all happen why sean i asked oh the money was good and it was the only offer i was likely to get he shrugged you change when you get old youll find that out you grab at straws take the wrong chances look the other way when you shouldnt because all of a sudden the years are rolling by and youve had it he choked suddenly on a mouthful of smoke and doubled over struggling for breath while it lasted it was anything but pleasant i got an arm around him and he leaned hard on me as he coughed up half his lungs after a while he managed to get his breath and smiled wanly okay now he slapped his chest im afraid the old lungs arent what they used to be and in that there was the answer to many things how bad is it he tried to smile and failed bad enough and then he told me not as i was beginning to believe cancer but something as bad some rare disease in which a funguslike growth spread like a poisonous weed to choke him there was no cure and drugs could only halt what was an inevitable decline to say that i felt guilty at the general way in which i had misjudged him would be an understatement i was sick to my stomach there was no excuse i should have realised from my knowledge of the man that there had to be some logical explanation for his unlikely behaviour i came up with the most banal sentence in the world im sorry sean he smiled and slapped me on the shoulder never mind that now stacey boy whats to be done thats the thing i told him about joanna truscotts offer i dont know what she has in mind but nobody would lose by it and id like to put one over on hoffer so would i he said with some passion ill put it to piet and legrande they tood together in a huddle talking and i realised again how tired legrande looked as they moved to join me thats it then burke said weve got half our money in advance anyway now well see if we can make the bastard sweat a little he seemed to swallow suddenly and stopped dead so that for a moment i thought he was having another attack but nothing could have been further from the truth my god he said were all forgetting something something absolutely bloody perfect hoffer will be waiting with our transport on the bellona road from noon on you think we could give him a nasty surprise he smiled slightly that smile of his that was not really a smile at all looking completely his old self again a thoroughly dangerous man we can have a damn good try but were wasting time talking wed better join up with the others as quickly as we can and sort out some sort of plan we moved out fast in single file with me in the lead i felt full of energy strong enough to take on anything a weight lifted from my body and brain as for burke however unfortunate his condition there was relief in it for me as an explanation of the inexplicable change in conduct i had found in him i paused on the edge of the clearing perhaps thirty yards away from the hut our approach had obviously been noted and there was no one in sight i waited for the others to join me and told burke i would go down alone to pave the way the brothers vivaldi and joe ricco had looked capable of anything and i didnt want any unfortunate misunderstandings at this stage i called out to serafino as i ploughed down the slope through the undergrowth hands above my head when i was halfway across the clearing the door opened and he peered out cautiously holding my assault rifle ready its all right i said everything is fine joanna truscott appeared at his shoulder her face uncertain youve managed to persuade them better than that hoffers going to show up himself this afternoon on the bellona road to pick us up could be hell get one hell of a surprise id spoken in italian and serafinos face lit up heh i like that i could cut the bastards throat personally okay stacey wyatt call your friends down he whistled sharply and the vivaldi brothers and joe ricco appeared from different places on the edge of the clearing serafmo grinned apologetically i never like to take chances i waved burke and the other two down and the girl moved to my side youre certain my stepfather will be there himself thats what the man said burke was halfway down to the clearing now the others just behind him and i grinned and gave joanna truscott a little push towards him well here she is sean the purpose of the exercise and in a single terrible moment i recognised the expression on his face had seen it too many times before but by then it was too late the rifle snapped to his shoulder and he shot her through the head thirteen i owe my life to jules legrande who shot me down in the same second that burke killed the girl the ak assault rifle packs one and a half tons of muzzle energy when it goes off and the bullet it fires was designed by the chinese not only to stop a charging marine but to lift him off his feet and deposit him a yard to the rear which meant that i was flat on my back when piet jaeger opened up with his uzi sub machine gun serafino was the only one who got off a shot from the hop as he went down a lucky one that blew away the top of legrandes head as far as i could see but i was already rolling into the cover of the fallen log on the other side of the fire the uzi kicked dirt in a fountain towards me that died abruptly as the magazine emptied and i got to my feet and ran into the trees head down my right arm swung uselessly blood spurting from a hole in my shoulder there was no pain i was too shocked to feel any that would come later for the moment i had only one driving passionto survive i stumbled on and behind me there were the cries of the dying some confused shouting and then several bullets passed uncomfortably close severing branches and twigs above my head the uzi opened up again jaeger working it methodically from side to side splashing a route through the undergrowth if i stayed where i was i had a few seconds more to live at the most and that wasnt good enough not with the bills i had to pay i swung sharply to the right forced my way through a screen of bushes and went headfirst into the stream the icy coldness sharpened me up wonderfully i surfaced took a deep breath and went under if id had to rely on my swimming alone ive had got nowhere i found it impossible to use my right arm but the current was fiercer than i had expected and seized me in a grip of iron pulling me out from the shore so that when i surfaced again i found myself in the central channel there was a cry from the shore and jaeger burst through the bushes he plunged kneedeep into the water and as he raised the uzi and started to fire burke joined him i went under again and a few moments later the water was rocked by a sudden turbulence the breath was squeezed from my body and i was lifted bodily i was aware of burke standing there of his arm moving like a flail the grenade curving through the air to land a yard away it was the torrent which saved me sucking me under into the central passage between great granite slabs so that i had already passed over the smooth apron of rock at the end of the reach and was falling into the pool twenty feet below when the grenade went off the water was nine or ten feet deep at that point i touched bottom surfaced and the current swung me across to the other side to ground gently on a shelving bank of black sand beneath a line of overhanging bushes in a moment i was into their shelter still driven by that fantastic reserve of energy that is in us all and which only comes to the fore in periods of real stress and danger i looked for the densest thicket i could find crawled into it and lay there shivering i discovered that the smith and wesson was still with me thanks to its spring holster and i got it out awkwardly with my left hand and lay there waiting the woods were silent i was alone in a primeval world the undergrowth closing in on either hand somewhere nearby a bird called sweetly and was answered and then there was the murmur of voices they seemed to come from another place to have no connection with me at all and certainly i made little sense out of what was said the only thing i did hear clearly was the sentence can you see the body delivered in a harsh south african accent that could only belong to jaeger it at least meant that they thought me dead presumably killed by the second grenade burkes voice answered then there was silence lying there on my belly i was aware of something digging into my chest and remembered rosas parting gift i unscrewed the top of the flask with my teeth and swallowed like liquid fire the brandy burned its way down and exploded in a warm glow there was a single shot presumably someone being finished off i lay there and waited my arm more painful by the minute and thought of burke who had tricked me no more than that had beaten me all along the line i also considered how i would settle with him i thought of that a great deal and with variations and drank more brandy and waited the waiting game is the hardest one to learn but it is the only one for a soldier if he wants to survive once in the kasai i crouched with burke and four other men in a three foot trench while the ground above us was raked with heavy machine gun fire burke told us we must school ourselves to patience that to go now would be madness but one by one the others cracked made a run for it and were chopped down five hours later when darkness fell burke and i crawled away in perfect safety my shoulder had stopped bleedingi think because of my immersion in the icecold waters of the stream and the hole where the bullet had entered had closed into two rather obscene purple lips and it had gone straight through thank god which i discovered when i probed about gingerly with the tips of the fingers of my left hand the edges of the exit hole seemed to have come together also and although i had obviously lost blood there was no immediate need to bandage myself up i gave it an hour and then started to work my way cautiously through the trees to the top of the apron i could see the hut the smoke from the fire but there was no sign of life there was a movement in the bushes over on my right and i crouched waiting and then one of the donkeys appeared a kite called harshly swooped over the clearing and soared again he finally went down and perched on the roof of the hut something hed never had done if a human had been anywhere around that decided me i stood up and moved cautiously towards the clearing when i got close the kite flapped away and left me alone with the dead the first body i came to was legrandes although he was barely recognisable and was minus his camouflaged jump suit which theyd presumably taken off him because it would have excited comment serafino and his three friends lay so close together that the sprawling limbs actually touched each other in death serafino smiled savagely teeth bared and i judged him to have been shot seven or eight times the others were in a similar position except for joe ricco who had obviously turned to run and had taken his dose in the back i could see it all now quite clearly the girl had been right hoffer had intended death and had planned it with burkes connivance now he would go to the police reluctantly tell his story of the kidnapping of the ransom payment that had failed to secure the girls return and the police would have to go through the motions would lay on their ritual search of the area as they had done so many times before expecting serafino to stay one step ahead as usual only this time it would be different this time when they started at the usual place they would find this butchers shop aftermath as the girl had suggested to me earlier of a fight between rival gangs theyd light a few candles in the cathedral in palermo hoffers friends would commiserate and hed wipe away a tear with one hand while he was signing the papers that gave him two and a half million with the other the girl sprawled partially on one side and when i turned her over i sucked in my breath her face was a mask of blood flies settling already i had seen death in all its obscene variations often enough and yet i sat back on my heels feeling suddenly faint overwhelmed by the pity of it all the tragedy of what had happened to this young girl i thought of burkeof how he had fooled me fooled me right up the end taking jaeger along with him even poor ageing legrande presumably on the promise of a larger reward than had ever been suggested to me quite a performance when you thought of it then something snapped inside and i found myself cursing him wildly out loud i think i became wholly sicilian the rage boiling over in a torrent of hate in this way may i drink the blood of the one who killed you someone had spoken the ancient formula aloud i gently touched her face her blood stained my fingers i raised them to my mouth it was at that moment that she gave a low moan and stirred no one could have been blamed for believing her to be dead so terrible was her appearance she owed her life to the quantity of blood which had poured down from the wound covering the face and turning it into a hideous death mask the fire was almost out but the water in the old iron kettle was still warm i carried it across in my left hand and poured half of it over her face washing most of the blood away instantly she moaned her head moved to one side then back again i crouched got out my handkerchief which was soaking wet and gently sponged the rest of the blood away the bullet had gouged a furrow in the flesh starting just above the right temple and continuing along the side of the skull it was still bleeding but not a great deal and the bone showed through i had the usual combat medical pack in a side pouch on the right leg and i got it out the waterproof cover came off in my teeth and exposed the contentstwo field dressings and three morphine ampoules in a small plastic box i jabbed two of the ampoules into her arm one after the other she was going to need all the help she could get in the next few hours because getting her out of here was going to be rough i hesitated over the third ampoule debating whether to use it on myself but decided against it in the end i would need all my wits about me and it was a reasonable assumption that the very real pain i was beginning to feel in my shoulder would keep me up to the mark i raised her to a sitting position got a knee behind her and allowed her to sag back against it there was three feet of bandage on each end of the field dressing and by the time i got it all wound round her head the morphine had done its work all strain left her face and when i eased her on to her back she looked calm and relaxed only her extreme paleness indicated that something was wrong after transferring my holster from my right hip to my left i managed to bandage my shoulder with the other field dressing rather imperfectly then i took the sling from serafinos mi and buckled it about my waist in such a way that my right arm was strapped firmly against my side the sun was really beginning to get through the clouds now and when i checked my watch i saw that it was only just coming up to seven am i got out my copy of the map which due to a nylon backing was still in one piece in spite of its soaking and had a look at the situation hoffer had said he would be waiting at a certain map reference on the bellona road from noon on which i saw no reason to doubt even if he didnt actually turn up in person someone was certain to be waiting there with transport with only themselves to worry about burke and piet jaeger would make excellent time spurred on no doubt by the thought of a good job well done in fact it was more than likely that they would reach the rendezvous with time to spare in my case i had no option but to make for bellona and i couldnt see myself doing it in less than six or seven hours and there was always the possibility that my limbs might give out on me on the way my body refusing to keep going i shivered slightly as the sun touched me conscious for the first time of how wet i was i got rosas flask out and drank a little more brandy joanna truscott lay still and quiet her arms neatly arranged on either side she might have been sculpted from marble and resting on top of her own tomb for all the life she showed if i left her and pushed myself hard i might make it to bellona in five or six hours always supposing i didnt collapse on the way even for a man as efficient as cerda it would take an hour or so to get together a rescue party and the return trip back up into the high country would take even longer it came down to this then if i left her she would lie here alone for fifteen to sixteen hours at the very least and probably longer by then she could be dead which was something i had no intention of allowing to happen she was going to live and i wanted to be there to see hoffers face when he found out the animals which earlier had grazed so peacefully had disappeared obviously stampeded by the noise of the shooting there were some bridles hanging by the door i took one a little way into the woods and finally found a couple of goats and one of the donkeys nibbling a bush together the donkey allowed me to get the bridle on him with no fuss and i led him back to the clearing and tethered him by the hut the animal had obviously been kept to carry in supplies for serafino and his men which meant there must be a pack saddle somewhere i found two inside the hut both of the same distinctive local pattern made of wood and leather with a great vshaped wooden trough in which sacks could be carried the brandy had gone to my head and for the moment the pain in my shoulder seemed to have receded a little i dragged one of the saddles out and managed to heave it on to the donkeys back at the third attempt god knows what would have happened if the animal had had a temper or turned awkward at all but it stood there placidly nibbling at the ground as i tightened the girth getting joanna truscott up was much more difficult but after a struggle i managed to get her on to her knees and knelt in front of her myself allowing her to fall across my left shoulder i deposited her on her back in the wooden trough and none too gently but she made no sound and lay there face turned to heaven her legs dangling on either side of the donkeys rump i got a blanket from the hut and covered her as well as i could and then tied her into position with a length of old rope when i was finished i was sweating i sat down and felt for my cigarettes automatically a wad of sodden paper stained with yellow was all that remained and i crossed to the bodies and found a packet in riccos breast pocket a popular local brand cheap and nasty but better than nothing i smoked one through had another swallow of rosas brandy then i wrapped the end of the donkeys bridle firmly around my left hand and moved out buddhists believe that if the individual practises meditation long enough he may eventually discover his true self and enter into that state of bliss that eventually leads to nirvana at the very least a kind of withdrawal into the inner self is possible so that the external world fades and time in its accepted sense ceases to exist the old jew i had shared a cell with in cairo had instructed me in the necessary techniques had saved my life in effect for i had only survived the hole because of it on many occasions i had withdrawn from the world floated in warm darkness had surfaced to find a day two dayseven threehad passed and i was still alive stumbling through the wilderness that was monte cammarata that morning something very similar happened time ceased to exist the stones the sterile valleys and barren hillsides merged with the sky like a picture out of focus and i moved blindly on i was conscious of nothing one moment i was stumbling along in front of the donkey the next a voice said quite plainly there are two kinds of people in the world pianos and piano players burke had said that to me sitting at a zinctopped bar in mawanza i was drinking warm beer because the electricity supply had been cut and the ice box behind the bar wasnt working and he was at his eternal coffee the only thing he would drink in those days we were halfway through that first contract in katanga had lost half our men and were going to lose most of the rest before it was over sitting there at the bar a machine pistol at my elbow my face staring back at me from a bulletscarred mirror the situation had all the ingredients to hand of every hollywood adventure film ever made i remember there was gunfire in the streets the thud of mortar bombs and now and again the steady rattle of a heavy machine gun as they tried to clear snipers from the government offices across the square by all the rules and because i was not quite twenty years of age it should have been romantic and adventurous just like an old bogart movie it wasnt i was sick of killing sick of the brutality the total inhumanity of it all i was at the end of my tether ready to go straight over the edge and burke had sensed it instinctively hed started to talk quietly and calmly he was enormously persuasive in those days or perhaps it was just that i wanted to believe that he was for me then remember there had to be no flaw in him before he was finished he had me believing we were on a kind of holy crusade to save the black man from the consequences of his own folly always remember stacey boy there are two kinds of people in this world the pianos and the piano players an unnecessarily complicated metaphor to suggest that there were those who let it happen and those who did something about it but at the time i had believed him in any case the local police turned against us late that evening and i was too busy trying to save my skin during the week that followed to have time for anything else now standing there on the mountainside those words floated up from the past to haunt me and remembering the incident so clearly i realised with a kind of wonder that he hadnt given a damn about me personally it had been himself he was thinking about as it had always been he had to straighten me out to his way of thinking because he needed me because i had become as essential to him as a gun in his hand a firstrate deadly weapon thats what i wasall i had ever been i plodded on the donkey trailing behind my brain still filled with the past which meant burke his relationship with piet jaeger had obviously been different in kind and he had certainly never put a foot wrong that way with me presumably because his instincts had warned him off as i have said in the beginning he barely tolerated my need for women and my propensity for hard liquor now looking back and remembering how his attitude had changed to a kind of goodhumoured acceptance where those things were concerned i wondered to what extent he had come to realise that their existence made it much easier for him to mould me to his purpose who was i then stacey wyatt or sean burkes creature no to hell with that i was myself alone another kind of piano player a man who played for himself and no one else we had been on the move now for the best part of four hours and when i stopped to check on the girls condition she looked exactly the same but she was still breathing the only important thing for myself i had moved past pain floated beyond it as i had done so many times in the hole my shoulder existed only as a dull ache i had forgotten that i had a right arm at all and when the sun clouded over and heavy raindrops spattered the rocks about me i stumbled on quite cheerfully stacey wyatt the great survivor in late spring or early summer when the first real heat begins violent thunderstorms are common in the sicilian high country and occasionally a drenching downpour settles firmly over the mountains for half a day or more i think looking back on it that it was the rain which saved us some people are rainwalkers by natureit gives them a shot in the arm just to be abroad and feel it beating down on them ive always been one of that happy band so the rainstorm which broke over the cammarata that morning gave me a psychological lift to start with but there was more to it than that suddenly the earth came alive i was no longer moving through a dead world there was a freshness to everything perhaps i had become a little delirious because i found myself singing the famous old marching song of the foreign legion that legrande had taught me a couple of centuries before when we were still brothers before corruption had set in the rain was hammering down now and i went over a rise that blocked the end of a small valley looked down through the grey curtain and saw bellona beside the white smear that was the road i laughed out loud and shouted to the sky ill have you now burke by god ill have you now i turned to reach for the donkeys bridle and found that joannas head had moved to one side that her eyes were open she stared blankly at me for a long moment and then with infinite slowness smiled i couldnt speak simply touched her gently on the cheek took the bridle and stumbled down the hillside tears of a kind mingling with the rain on my face fourteen that final hour on the lower slopes was worst of all for the sparse turf soaked by the incessant rain proved difficult to negotiate i slipped and lost my balance twice and once the donkey slid to one side tearing his bridle from my grasp bringing the heart into my mouth for a moment it had seemed he would roll over and the result would have been catastrophic joanna truscotts eyes were closed again and i presumed she had sunk back into unconsciousness i got a grasp on the donkeys bridle close to the muzzle and started down the next bank holding his head up with what strength i had left and willpower time again ceased to exist but now i suspect because i had become more than a little lightheaded we floundered down through mud and rain together and once i was aware of someone pleading with the donkey in the most reasonable of tones to stand up like a man and keep going and then the same voice broke into song again the same faint trumpet call that had echoed from the hoggar mountains of the southern sahara to the swamps of indochina i seemed to sink into a well of darkness where nothing existed only a tiny flickering point of light at the end of a long tunnel came out into it blinking and found myself hanging on to the bridle for dear life with both hands at what point i had unstrapped my right arm i dont know only that i had used itpresumably had needed toand that blood soaked through the field dressing it was beautifulthe most beautiful colour i had ever seen vivid against the muted greens and browns of my camouflaged jump suit the world was a wonderful exquisite place the blood mingling with the green and the grey rain falling sheep poured over a bank top like a flood of dirty water and milled around me and beyond a ragged shepherd stared turned and ran along the track towards the village i passed the place where i had sat with rosa lain with her in a hollow in the sun lovely lovely rosa who had wanted to warn me but who was too afraid afraid of karl hoffer there was blood below my feet now which was strange i shook my head and the stain turned into a red alfa romeo in the yard behind cerdas place two hundred feet below there was confused shouting men running along the track towards me once as a boy i fell from a tree at the barbaccia villa and had lain unconscious for an hour until marco had found me he looked just the same now not a day older which was surprising the same expression a mixture of anger and dismay and love strange after all those years i lay in the mud and he held me up against his knee all rightall right now stacey i clutched at the front of his expensive sheepskin coat hoffer marcohoffer and burke theyre mine you tell vito that you tell the capo this is mine mine alone my vendetta my vendetta i shouted the words out loud and the men of bellona stood in a silent ring faces like stone the furies in some greek play awaiting the final bloody outcome with complete acceptance the cracks on the ceiling made an interesting pattern rather like a map of italy if you looked at it long enough including the heel but no sicily sicily i closed my eyes a hundred different things crowding into my mind when i opened them again marco was standing by the bed hands in the pockets of his magnificent sheepskin coat thats a beautiful coat i said he smiled the kind of smile id known so often as a boy how do you feel i was wrapped in a heavy grey blanket when i opened it i found that i was still in my jump suit that my shoulder had been rebandaged with what looked like strips of white linen torn from a sheet i pushed hard and found myself on the edge of the bed feet on the floor watch it marco warned youre lucky to be alive youre wrong i replied utterly and totally wrong im indestructible im going to live for ever he wasnt smiling now and when the door opened and cerda came in quickly i realised from the expression on his face that i must have shouted i saw that the smith and wesson was on a small bedside locker reached for it and held it against my face the metal was so cold it burned or that was the sensation i looked up into their troubled faces and smiled or thought i did where is she in my bedroom cerda replied i was on my feet and lurching through the door pulling from marcos outstretched hand cerda was ahead of me by some strange alchemy had the door open and beyond the dark sad woman that was his wife turned from the bed in alarm the honourable joanna lay quite still her face the colour of wax another cleaner bandage than mine around her head i turned to marco whats happening shes not good stacey ive spoken to the capo on the telephone the nearest doctor is two hours away by road but hes been instructed to come she mustnt die i said you do understand that sure i do stacey he patted my arm theres a private ambulance on the way from palermo two of the best doctors in sicily on board shell be all right ive looked at her myself its nasty but its no death wound youve nothing to worry about except hoffer i said he thinks she is dead for him its essential that she is i looked at him and nodded slowly but then you know about that dont you all about it he didnt know what to say and tried to smile reassuringly forget hoffer stacey the capo will deal with him its all arranged how long for i demanded a weeka month he used me didnt he marco he used me like he uses you and everyone else i found that i was still holding the smith and wesson in my left hand and pushed it into the holster not any longer i settle with hoffer personally i turned and looked at the girl if she was not dead she would be soon or so i thought at the time well go now i told marco in the alfa meet them on the way he frowned no better to wait stacey a rough ride in the car after the rain the surface will have gone on most of the mountain roads hes right cerda put in if the rain dont stop soon there will be no roads left at all in which case the ambulance will never get up here i pointed out patiently cerda frowned and turned to marco who shrugged helplessly maybe hes got a point after that everything happened in a hurry they wrapped joanna in blankets and carried her out to the alfa in the courtyard stuffed the well between the rear and front seats with more blankets and laid her across them i sat in the passenger seat and cerda leaned in to fasten my seat belt you give my respects to the capo eh he said tell him i handled everything just like he told me sure i will i said leaned out of the window and called in english as we drove away up the mafia right up but i think the significance of that eloquent and ironic english phrase was completely lost on him i was right about the mountain roads and the heavy rain to say that they dissolved behind our rear wheels may sound like something of an exaggeration but it was not far from the truth i dont suppose we topped twenty miles an hour on the way down if wed gone any faster wed have plunged straight over the edge in places and the alfa wasnt built to fly not that i was worried there was a kind of inevitability to everything the sicilians are an ancient people and that side came uppermost in me now out of some strange foreknowledge i knew the game was still in play the climax yet to come that was inevitable and could not be avoided neither by me nor burke it also helped of course to remember that marco driving a car sponsored by my grandfather and certain business associates had once come third in the mila miglia i closed my eyes and slept when i opened them again we were drawn up at the side of the main road beyond vicari as i discovered later and i had lost two hours they were already carrying joanna truscott into the rear of the ambulance on a stretcher i tried to get up and found that my legs refused to move and then the door opened and i lurched sideways into the arms of a greybearded man in a white coat i recall marco vaguely somewhere in the background but mainly my friend with the grey beard and the goldrimmed spectacles surprising how respectable a doctor could lookeven a mafia doctor joanna was laid out on the other side i recall that and the man leaning over her and then greybeard loomed large again the interior light shining on his spectacles the syringe in his hand i tried to say no tried to raise an arm but nothing seemed to function any longer and then there was that darkness againwe were becoming old friends fifteen beyond through the open french windows a line of poplars stood like soldiers waiting for a sign black against flame the burnedout fire of day long white curtains ballooned in a tiny breeze ghostlike in the cool darkness of the room rebirth is always painful but my return to life was eased by one of the most beautiful evenings i have ever known i was sane again calm and relaxed no pain anywhere until i moved and touched off some spark in my right shoulder there was a nurse at the end of the bed reading a book by the light of a small table lamp she turned at my movement the starched white cap like the halo around the face of a madonna when she leaned over me her hand on my forehead was cooler than anything i had ever known she left closing the door quietly it reopened almost at once and greybeard came in how do you feel he asked in italian alive again a remarkably pleasant sensation where am i the barbaccia villa he switched on the bedside lamp and took my pulse composed and grave the inevitable stethoscope was produced and probed around in the area of my chest for a while he nodded to himself of course and stuffed it back into his pocket your shoulderit pains you a littlewhen i move behind him the door opened i could sense his presence even before i became aware of the distinctive aroma of his havana and then he moved into the light his face dark and brooding calm as always caesar borgia sprung to life again eternal and indestructible do you think youll ever die as if following my thought processes perfectly he smiled so hes going to live on us this grandson of mine eh tasca oh he will survive the bullet although much work will be needed on the shoulder if he is not to suffer some permanent stiffening dr tasca looked down at me in a kind of mild reproof you should not have used the arm young man that was unfortunate i didnt bother to argue and he turned back to my grandfather no it is his general condition that worries me physically speaking he is balanced on the edge of a precipice a slight nudge and he goes straight down hear that my grandfather just prevented himself from prodding me with his stick you want to die young eh can you make me a better offer i tried to sound gay and flippant but tasca obviously didnt approve at all i understand you have been in prison i nodded of a kindegyptian labour camp variety with the chain gang his face for the first time registered some kind of concern now we know he turned again to my grandfather when he is on his feet he must come to me for a thorough examination capo he could well have tubercular lesions and there are definite signs of incomplete recovery from blackwater fever which could mean kidney damage not only will he need treatment but careful nursing and rest several months of complete inactivity thank you doctor kildare i said youve made my day tasca looked completely mystified by the remark but in any event my grandfather dismissed him back to the girl now i want to talk to my grandson alone to my shame it was only then that i consciously gave her a thought youve got joanna truscott here too how is she he pulled a chair forward and sat down shes doing all right stacey tascas a specialist in brain surgery the best in sicily he brought a portable xray unit with him and gave her a thorough examination shes luckythe skull isnt fractured shell have a bad scar probably for life but a good hairdresser can fix that shouldnt she have gone to hospital he shook his head no need she couldnt have better treatment if she did and its safer here i tried to sit up my stomach hollow hoffer knows then he pushed me gently back against the pillow only that his stepdaughter is dead not officially of course so that the world can be told but hes spoken to me already on the telephone and told you he shook his head he asked for a general council meeting tonight hes due here in half an hour i dont understand i said what general council did you think i was mafia all on my own stacey he laughed sure im capocapo in all sicilybut the big decisions are made by the council we have the rules and they have to be obeyed even i cant break them he shrugged without the rules we are nothing the honoured society i shook my head all right maybe im not thinking too clearly but i still dont see what hoffer is doing coming here first you tell me what happened in the mountains we go on from there are you trying to tell me you dont know some only now be a good boy and do as i say so i told him in detail including my various suspicions about things from the beginning and he took it all without a sign even my deliberately graphic description of the massacre when i was finished he sat there in silence for a moment why did you go stacey that is what i cant understand you knew this man burke was not being honest with you you distrusted hoffer you knew that even i was not telling you the whole truth and yet you still went god knows i said and thinking about it in retrospect i honestly couldnt explain it even to myself some kind of death wish i suppose the words were my own and yet at their saying every instinct in me rebelled no to hell with it it was burkealways burke something between us that i cant put into words even for myself something i had to prove i cant say more than that you hate this man i think this is the truth of it i thought about that for a while and said slowly no more than hatemuch more he took me with him into a dark world of his own creating made me into what i am not moulded me to his purpose up there on the mountain he told me he is a sick man some kind of oblique explanation for his behaviour i think he was trying to find in it an excuse for his own conduct but he lies even to himself he was in decay long before his lungs started to rot he needed no excuse ah now i perceive a glimmer of light he said you hate him for being something other than you previously thought he was he was right of course but only partially so you could have something there in the early days when i first met him he seemed the only really substantial thing in a world gone mad i believed in him completely and later nothing i shook my head i was the one who changed he didnt he was always what he is now thats the terrible thing the sean burke i thought i knew in lourenco marques and after never actually existed the silence enveloped us and i lay there thinking about it all finally i looked up at him again you knew what they intended didnt you in part only and guessed the rest hoffer was deported from the states some years ago after a prison sentence for tax evasion he worked with cosa nostra then came to us here in sicily with several of his old americansicilian mafia associates they brought in new ideas as i told you drugs prostitution other kinds of vice i didnt want them but they were all mafia once in never out thats right the council said they were entitled to be in so you took them he nodded mostly they were good administrators ill say that for them hoffer for example took over the running of our oil interests at gela on the face of it he did a good job but i never trusted himor his associates and these were the men who worked against you nothing is as simple as that sometimes together often individually they would give me trouble they thought it would be easy that they could fasttalk the stupid old sicilian peasant into the ground take over when that failed they tried other methods including the bomb that killed my mother you knew they intended to kill you if possible and still you worked with them i shook my head sharkstearing each other to pieces at the smell of blood still you dont see he sighed the council is mafia stacey not vito barbaccia alone the rules said they were entitled to be in the other business was personal and you killed them all according to the rules is that what youre trying to tell me any one of them could have been behind the bomb that killed your motheror all of them then why is hoffer still around drop by drop is better i have my own way of doing things he said grimly hoffer is a very stupid man like all men who think they are clever he married this english widow this aristocrat for her money unfortunately she was smarter than he realised and soon sized him up for what he really was she wouldnt give him a penny why didnt she leave him who knows with a woman love perhaps so he eased her out of this world into the next with a carefully contrived accidenthe still doesnt realise that i know about that by the waythen discovered she had left him nothing everything to joanna exactly except that under the terms of the trust he was next in line if the girl died before coming into her inheritance once she came of age he was finished she could make a will on the spot leave it to charity or some obscure cousinanything no point in even killing her then he got to his feet and moved to the window and stood there a dark shadow again but he wasnt simply motivated by greed in his desire to lay hands on his stepdaughters fortune he was afraid he faced a death sentence he used our money mafia money in various bullion deals mainly in egypt hoping to make a personal killing unfortunately someone tipped off the authorities on two occasions his boats were caught redhanded someone informed the authorities someone called vito barbaccia i laughed until i started to choke and he hurried to my bedside and poured water into a glass i gulped some down and handed the glass back to him at least id made him look anxious its really damned ironic isnt it i told him didnt you know that i was in one of those boats thats how i came to be in an egyptian prison for once in his life id stopped him cold a hand stretched out towards me there was utter dismay on his face stacey he stammered what can i say i did this to you forget it i said its too funny to be tragic now let me have the next thrilling instalment he sank down into his chair again obviously still shaken all right hoffer had to have his chance to recoup so that the society shouldnt suffer the council met to consider his case he confessed frankly but tried to make out that the deals had been intended to benefit the society not that it did him any good even if that was the truth hed had no authority from the council to proceed he admitted his liability and asked for time to get the money together and time was given there was no reason to refuse he told the council that under the terms of his wifes will he had been left substantial business interests in america that he could realise these within two or three months and have more than enough money to put things right and the council believed him why should he lie if he didnt come up with the money he would be taken care of no matter where he tried to run but you knew he was lying he nodded tranquilly the true measure of hoffers stupidity lies in the fact that he cant accept that an old sicilian peasant is smarter than he is ive always been one step in front of himalways i saw a photostat of his wifes will even before he knew the terms why didnt you tell the council i was interested i wanted to see what he would come up with and be one step ahead of him as usual you knew that his solution was to get rid of his stepdaughter before she came of age let us say that after having seen the actual will it had occurred to me as a likely possibility later i got wind of the business with serafino of how it had gone wrong and then i turned up and brought you up to date i was getting angry again if you knew the girl was with serafino because she wanted to stay out of hoffers way till her birthday you must have known that the purpose of our little foray into the mountains as outlined to me was a lie that the only reason there could possibly be for going in there was to destroy her my voice had risen slightly what in the hell did you think was going to happen when we got there and i found out or did you think i was lying to you did you think id become a murderer of young girls dont be stupid stacey he said coldly you are my fleshi know you that kind of deed we leave to the hoffers and the burkes of this world men without honour honour i laughed wildly didnt you realise that burke would have to kill me because he knew id never stand by and see them murder the girl that you by your silence were sending me to my death as surely as hoffer but i had no choice dont you see he said patiently listen and try to understand stacey the council gave hoffer timetime to recoup their money and how he did that was of no particular concern they expected either cash on the barrel on the due date or his headnothing less but once a member has been given time he is entitled to follow his operation through without interference from within the society if i had warned you that he intended to have the girl killed urged you to prevent it i would have been guilty of breaking one of the oldest of mafia laws death at last for vito barbaccia is that what you are saying death he seemed genuinely surprised you think that frightens me but i thought i had made it clear to you the rules are there for all to obey even the capo without them we are nothing they are the strength of the society the reason we have survived oh no stacey he who breaks the rules deserves to diemust die it occurred to me for the briefest of moments that i might be going out of my head i was moving into an unknown country now with attitudes and rules of behaviour as archaic and formalised as a court of chivalry in the middle ages thinking was an effort but i managed to say it still doesnt hang together i didnt know hoffer was mafia but he knew i was your grandson and i made it clear to burke that i had discussed our mission with you but why should that worry him the story of his stepdaughters kidnapping was acceptable enough including his reasons for handling it quietly and the thought that his story about the money from the trust fund had been accepted by everyone including me what could this affair of the truscott girl have to do with that which made enough sense to get by certainly it was as acceptable an explanation as anything else that had been offered to me in this nightmare world of mafia politics which still leaves us with the fact that you could have warned me i said slowly you could have given me some kind of an idea of what was going on told me at least that hoffer was mafia on that first night when i discussed things with you only by breaking our law stacey and that i could not do hoffer knew that and i had everything to gain by remaining silent it was hoffer who brought you into the affair hoffer and this man burke who lied to you if you turned against them hoffer could blame no one but himself this council of yours might have other ideas i said they might find it difficult to believe that your grandson wasnt working under your direct orders which remains to be seen he said but you must come to the meeting stacey and see for yourself it should be rather amusing amusing if i had been close enough i think i might have struck him at the moment i could have been killed up there dont you understand i loved youive always loved you in spite of everything and you sent me to my death without a word for the sake of a few stupid archaic rulesa game for schoolboys with no sense to it he frowned to your death staceyyou really believe that he laughed harshly yes all right i was going to keep you out that first night when you came to see me by force if necessary but then i talked to my grandsonsaw him in action saw him for what he was mafioso just like his grandfather only better and this burke this hollow man this dead thing walking with the grave stench already on himyou think i believe my grandson couldnt handle him his voice had dropped to a hoarse whisper and he leaned close to me one hand on the edge of the bed to support his weight i stared at him hypnotised dont you see stacey hoffer had to have his chance the rules said so but i wanted him flat on his belly grovelling because i believed that of all of them he was the man most likely to be responsible for the death of my daughter i wanted his scheme to fail so i allowed the best the most ruthless mafioso i have ever known to wreck it for me a wave of greyness scoured my body and i shivered as he sat back and calmly lit another cigar its just a game to you isnt it the more complicated the better you could have had hoffers head blown off at any time you wanted at home in the streetbut that wouldnt have been good enough it had to be a classical drama they always last longer he stood up his face calm flicked ash from a lapel and adjusted his tie theyll be here soon ill send marco with some clothes for you the door closed behind him i stared up at the ceiling blankly for a moment then swung my legs to the floor stood up and tried to walk i made it to the french windows turned and went back i was more than a little lightheaded and my shoulder hurt like hell when i moved it but at least i could get around which was all i needed i was rummaging through the drawers of the dressing table when marco came in he dropped a suede jacket whipcord pants and a white nylon shirt on the bed and produced the smith and wesson is this what you are looking for he tossed it across i pulled it from its holster hefted it for a moment in my left hand then swung the cylinder to one side and spilled the cartridges on to the coverlet i reloaded it carefully snapped the cylinder home and pushed it back into its holster there was a wallet that also he produced it from his pocket and gave it to me making no comment when i checked the contents are they here most of them and hoffer not yet i discovered that my hands were trembling slightly help me get dressed we mustnt keep them waiting sixteen they met in the salon and i sat in a wicker chair on the terrace behind a vinecovered trellis marco at my shoulder and watched i had a perfect view and the acoustics were excellent there were eight of them including my grandfather and in appearance they were a pretty assorted bunch three of them were real oldstyle capos carefully dressed in deliberately shabby clothes a fourth had taken off his coat exposing cheap and gaudy braces the others were all wearing expensive lightweight suits although no one could approach my grandfathers magnificence sitting there at the head of the table in the cream lightweight suit he had worn on that first evening hoffer wore dark glasses presumably an affectation and nodded soberly at what was said to him by the man on his right he looked composed enough and i wondered what was going on in his mind my grandfather lifted a small silver bell and at its ring the low buzz of conversation was instantly stilled every head turned towards him and he let the silence hang for a moment before saying karl hoffer asked for this meeting specially i dont know what hes going to say any more than you do but i guess we all know what its about so lets listen hoffer didnt get up he seemed calm but when he removed his dark glasses for a moment he looked tired and when he started to talk the voice was grave and subdued altogether a most convincing performance when i faced the council some months back in order to explain my conduct in certain unfortunate business transactions i promised to repay the society every penny of the money lost owing to my imprudence i asked for six months time enough for me to realise certain assets in the states left to me by my late wife i know some of you here thought i was still buying time that the society would never see its money others thank god were willing to trust me that remark on any other occasion would have been enough to make me laugh out loud there wasnt a man at that table who would have trusted his neighbour for more than five minutes at any one time outside the rigid framework of mafia law they knew it and hoffer knew it unlessand this seemed incrediblehe really was so stupid as to think them a bunch of unwashed sicilian peasants he could walk over whenever he pleased have you come to tell us you cant pay karl there was an edge of malice in my grandfathers voice and he spoke with illconcealed eagerness even hoffers performance paled by comparison with this one why no vito hoffer turned to him the dark glasses back in place again ill have been in a position to settle within the period granted or so my american lawyers tell me as it happens owing to an he hesitated then continued with obvious difficulty to an unfortunate and for me personally most tragic happening i am now in a position to be able to assure the council that replacing the societys money lost through my negligence is now the least of my troubles he certainly got a reaction from most of them there was a stir a murmur of voices and then my grandfather raised his hand maybe youd better explain karl hoffer nodded its simple enough as you all know my dear wife died in a car crash in france a little while back quite naturally she left the very considerable fortune inherited from her first husband in trust for her daughter joanna under the terms of that trust i was to inherit if the girl failed to reach her majority he clasped his hands together knuckles showing white looked down at the table even now i find it hard to believe but i have it on the most reliable authority that my stepdaughter met her death in the area of monte cammarata this morning under the most tragic circumstances if there is one thing a sicilian loves it is a good story and by this time hoffer had them by the throat my stepdaughter was kidnapped some weeks ago by a bandit many of you know only too wellserafino lentini the man in the braces spat on the floor at the name and there was a general stir i didnt come to the council with my troubles because i knew it couldnt help as we all know serafino lentini was no friend to the society even though hes been used as a sicario on one or two occasions you speak of him in the past tense karl my grandfather remarked may we take it that is where he now belongs the only good news i bring the council tonight hoffer said the police as we all know are helpless in these affairs so when lentini sent a message demanding ransom i scraped the necessary amount together met him myself as stipulated on the bellona road he took the money and laughed in my face when i asked for my stepdaughter he had decided to keep her for himself strange my grandfather cut in smoothly i had always understood that serafino lacked some of the essential equipment necessary to a don juan hoffer paused glancing at him sharply and countered with exactly the right remark it was not me he was attacking in behaving in this way he was showing his contempt for the societyfor all of us he shrugged and spread his arms wide i couldnt sit back and do nothing while the wretched girl suffered untold indignities at the hands of his men in the past i have had the occasion to use the services of an irish soldier of fortune a colonel burke well known for his exploits as a mercenary in the congo it seemed to me that a man of his stamp might be able to do what no one else could penetrate the fastnesses of the cammarata and bring my stepdaughter to safety i flew to crete where i met burke who agreed to take on this hazardous undertaking with the assistance of three men who had served under him in the congo hed even got me interested now and the silence in the salon wouldnt have been out of place in a cathedral cloister it was when colonel burke and his men arrived that i discovered an amazing thing one of them was the capos grandson a young man named wyatt the ball was well into barbaccias court he caught it neatly had i suspected been waiting for it he coughed and managed to look serious you all know my daughter and her son came to live with me after her american husband was killed in korea she died as the direct result of the action of some filthy assassin who had intended to end my days unfortunately my grandson blamed me in part for what had happened to his mother it was obviously the night for the baring of souls we became estranged and the boy then aged nineteen ran away i lost sight of him for some time then learned he was serving in the congo as a mercenary he came to see me the other night with this man burke and told me why they were in sicily i was astonished at his story because i couldnt understand why karl had not come to me for help but i presumed he had his reasons help hoffer spread his arms again appealing to the assembled council how could anyone help my only hope lay in burke and his men and then as if it had only just occurred to him he turned rather uncertainly to barbaccia i had nothing to hide it seemed to me under the circumstances that the fewer who knew about the affair the better for the girls sake no question of that my grandfather nodded after all my grandson gave me a full account of what they intended to do parachute into the cammarataa daring conception by now of course the atmosphere had changed and there was not a man there who didnt realise that beneath the surface something special was going on between hoffer and my grandfather im sorry the girl was killed barbaccia said i know she was close to you karl to lose a daughter gives more than pain i know capo hoffers voice was hoarse god knows how but i must tell you in the fightthe gunfight between colonel burkes party and serafinos menyour grandson also met his end dying i understand in a vain attempt to save my stepdaughters life i saw it all then the reason for hoffers performance his detailed account of the whole affair leading up to this final devastating blow delivered in public before everyone who counted my grandfather shrivelled dropped his stick became an old man in an instant stacey he said hoarsely stacey is dead hoffer didnt actually smile in triumph but even he couldnt control the tiniest quiver at the corner of his mouth my grandfather chose that precise moment to descend he produced a fresh cigar and struck a match his old self again very good karl excellent you could have gone a long way in the society if only you hadnt been so stupid marco tapped me on the shoulder but i was already on my feet and moving into the salon there was no thunderclap as jove descended from heaven but the result was about the same hoffer had gone very pale mostly from shock but also i suppose at the instant realisation that his goose was cooked to the other i was simply an intruder and the fattest most harmless looking man there produced a mannlicher automatic with all the speed of a real pro my grandfather waved him down my grandson stacey wyatt gentlemen who according to our friend here died gallantly on cammarata this morning in a vain attempt to save the life of joanna truscott as a matter of interest that young lady is under medical care in another part of the villa at this very moment hoffers hand dropped to his pocket and death stared out at him from the smith and wesson in my left hand no stacey not here here he is inviolate my grandfather called it is the law the gentleman in the flashy braces relieved hoffer of a walther and i pushed the smith and wesson back into its holster and now the truth my friends barbaccia snapped a finger and marco who had moved in behind me took a grey document from an envelope unfolded it and laid it on the table a photostat of the will hoffer referred to which only came into my hands this afternoon i wondered how many of them believed that it is in english but there are enough of you here who understand that language to satisfy the council that hoffer lied that his wife left him nothing that there were no business assets in america that he could realise to fulfil his debt to us he looked at hoffer would you deny this go to hell hoffer told him my grandfather continued his one hope was to murder the girl but lentini doublecrossed him so he tried this man burke but they needed someone who knew the country and spoke the language and burke produced my grandson my grandson who believed until the very moment that he was shot down in cold blood together with serafino and the girl believed as i did until i read this will and heard his story that he was on the mountain to save the girl by the grace of god and the incompetence of this man burke he survived and managed to get the girl to bellona there was nothing hoffer could say nothing that would do him the slightest good with the hardfaced gentry standing around that table he answered in the only way his animal nature would allow striking to hurt all right barbaccia you win but i put the bomb in your car that killed your daughter with my own hands he spat in my grandfathers face marco took a quick step forward my grandfathers hands flattened against his chest no marco leave it he is a dead man walking he wiped his face with a handkerchief and dropped it on the floor the man burke he is at your villa hoffer blaming burke i suspect more than himself for his downfall nodded good now get out outside the gate you are on your own hoffer turned and lurched towards the french windows he was crossing the terrace when i caught up with him but as i swung him around marco already had me by the arm my grandfather just behind moving with amazing speed for a man of his age no stacey not here here at the council meeting he is inviolate it is the law break it and you die too to hell with your bloody laws i said and he slapped me across the face i staggered back and hoffer laughed shrilly thats goodi like that thats what i gave rosa solazzo last night wyatt only more she wanted to warn you you didnt know that did you i dont know what you did to her but that stupid bitch must have liked it i tried to get at him and marco and two of the others held me back want to know what i did with her he laughed again i gave her to ciccio he always panted for her the original bull that one hell have tried every variation known to man by now and a few of his own thrown in for fun he wanted to hurt and he succeeded i called him every dirty name id ever known and they held me there as he went through the garden to his mercedes parked outside the gate it was only when he started up and drove away that my grandfather ordered them to release me i turned and pushed my way through the group and went back to my room i stood there in the darkness my shoulder throbbing sweat soaking the nylon shirt and thought of rosa poor rosa so shed decided to stop being afraid after all and had left it too late i remembered what hoffer had said about ciccio and at the thought of that animal sweating over her i cracked completely the only decent thing in this whole stinking business as far as i was concerned had been that girls futile gesture in trying to save me i went out through the french windows on the run and moved through the gardens to the courtyard at the rear there was a choice of three cars in the garage but i took marcos red alfa mainly because it had automatic gears and would be easier to manage with one hand the fact that hed left his keys on show also helped they must have heard me go the moment i rounded the house but the gatekeeper was standing in the door of the lodge and recognised me as i arrived the gates opened a split second later too late for marco who came down the drive on the run and still had ten yards to go as i took the alfa into the night with a surge of power about three miles outside palermo i saw flames in the night and several cars blocking the road i braked and pulled in behind a slowmoving line of vehicles that was being waved on by a policeman on the wrong side petrol spilled across the road buring fitfully and beyond where it had crashed headon into the concrete retaining wall a mercedes saloon blazed fiercely i leaned out of the window as i approached the policeman what happened to the driver what do you think he waved me on and i moved into the night so that was mafia justice swift and certain and my grandfather had had his revenge but the rest was minethe rest was my vendetta no one on earth was going to cheat me of that seventeen it was still holy week in palermo something i had forgotten and the streets were crowded mainly with family groups everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves and when it started to shower no one took the slightest notice the municipal fireworks display got going just as i turned into the via vittorio emanuele and drove towards the cathedral gigantic coloured flowers blossoming in the night and all around me i saw that strange mixture of carnival and piety so peculiar to sicily there was little traffic for this was a night for walking but progress was slow as in most cases the crowd simply flooded out from the pavements into the centre of the street i was sweating again and still conscious of the lightheadedness id noticed earlier perhaps it was the drugs id had or maybe i was simply perilously close to being at the end of my resources whatever the reason i felt like an outsider looking in alienated from everything around me it was a nightmare scene that needed a dante to do it justice the noise of the fireworks the multitude of exploding colours the voice of the crowd and beyond the penitents in sackcloth barefooted in the rain three at the front of the procession staggering under the cross our lady floating in the darkness above the flaring torches the chanting swelled until it filled my head like the sea whips rising above the heads of the crowd cracked symbolically as they descended the stench of incense of hot candle grease was nauseating almost more than i could bear and then the tail of the procession passed the crowd parted and i moved on i put the window down breathed deeply on the fresh damp air and gave some thought to the situation which faced me at the villa first there would be the man on the gate with his automatic rifle and no other way in unless i could climb over that fifteen foot concrete wall which didnt seem likely with one arm out of commission in the villa itself the two houseboys i could discount them for a start and the kitchen staff which left ciccio piet jaeger and burke against them on my side i had my left hand the smith and wesson and five rounds in the chamber enough considering the mood i was in any professional gunman is faced with two kinds of killing the first is in hot blood an instant heat generated by a particular situation usually in defence of his own life or his employers the second is a different proposition altogether a cool calculating business where the situation is carefully assessed the risks worked out in advance but even that isnt enough the mental preparation is just as important the windingup of the whole personality like a clock spring so that when the moment comes there is an instant readiness to kill in the final analysis thats what separates the real professional from the rest of the field a willingness to kill without the slightest hesitation something most people can never hope to do but i could stacey wyatt could had done it enough times before would do it tonight and probably again strange how the thought the possibility of my own death never occurred to me just as it never occurs to the professional criminal that he might get caught on his next job i slowed and paused briefly because of traffic congestion where the bridge crosses the fiume oreto on the messina road my face was hot probably a fever starting and i put my head out into the rain it was cool and refreshing and then a strange thing happened for a brief moment for an instant in time the sounds of the traffic faded all sounds in fact except for the rain swishing through the trees on the other side of the road and it was like nothing id ever known before and the scent of the wistaria in the garden of the house beyond filled the night unbearable in its sweetness it was a fragile moment broken by a peremptory horn behind and i drove on pulled back into some kind of reality but was that true who was i what in the hell was all this about what was i doing here when i ran from sicily at my mothers death i ran from a lot of things from pain i suppose and out of revulsion at the cruelty of life and from my grandfather whom i loved deeply and who now stood revealed as a monster who battened on the misery of the poor and ordered death with the certainty of god but in running from barbaccias grandson i was also fleeing from the boy the wyatts of wyatts landing had refused to accept i was running from the stacey wyatt life and circumstances had made me and i had a chance to find myselfmy own true selfme and no one else for a time it had worked had gone well i had made it to mozambique and lourenco marques could have made it further and arrived at some kind of destination under my own steam knowing myself as far as anyone can hope to or at least knowing what i could do on my own but for me there had been the lights of lisbon i had met sean burke had become another kind of stacey wyatt and that was very much that until the hole i suppose most men have their lights of lisbon but only a few know the hole well i had come to know it well had been in filth and darkness had survived had found another stacey wyatt someone id never known before who asked questionsasked questions about a lot of things my return to sicily had been not only inevitable but essential i saw that now i had to see again that incredible figure so much a part of my youth vito barbaccia lord of life and death capo mafia in all sicily my grandfather who kept telling me i was mafioso just like him only better and who in my heart i knew already saw me at the head of the council table when he was gone but he was wrong i wasnt the man burke had created the hired killer posing as a soldier and i wasnt my grandfathers version either to hell with both of them who was i then i had gone into the mountains eyes open knowing the situation was not what it seemed with some vague notion of beating burke at his own game whatever that game was i had lost but so had he beat him now i had to on his terms and on his own ground if ever i was to be free however bloody that encounter might prove however savage the prospect it could not be evaded i had stood in his shadow too long a fierce anger flooded through me then and as i swept round the next bend and found myself in the final stretch hoffers villa floodlit in the night three hundred yards up the road a kind of madness took possession of me i put my foot down hard and took the alfa into the night with a burst of power the engine howling like a wolf the guard saw me coming but by the time he realised my intention there was nothing to be done he started to unsling his automatic rifle thought better of it and jumped for his life as the alfa ripped the bronze gates from their hinges and continued up the drive what happened next was very much the fortunes of war the unexpected that decides who wins or loses a lambretta came round the bend of the drive slowly because the rider had obviously only just started i braked instinctively swung the wheel over with my one hand and slid broadside into the shrubbery in a wave of gravel the lambretta too had skidded as the rider braked desperately spinning in a circle so that the machine halted pointing the way it had come it was one of the houseboys dressed in his best obviously ready for an evening on the town as i scrambled out of the alfa the smith and wesson ready in my left hand i caught a glimpse of his white terrified face and then he gunned the engine and roared out of sight back towards the villa i could have had him with no trouble but this wasnt his affair and i let him go even though it meant he would arouse the house that burke and jaeger would know who it was perhaps the truth is that i wanted them to know i didnt get time to consider because a couple of bullets pumped into the alfa as the gate guard arrived and i ran for cover my right arm was hurting like hell but the pain sharpened me made me come alive again it was raining harder now and i crouched in the bushes and waited as i had waited in other places other jungles than this for the slightest rustle the breaking of a twig by some process of association the lagona operation came back to me when we had parachuted in and brought out the nuns from their beleagured mission it had been a bad time the beginning of the rains and thick bush all the way and then i remembered for some strange reason that burke had wanted to go in by armoured convoy id been the one who suggested the drop and hed objected because we would have no vehicles to come out in but i had pointed out that we would have surprise on our side on our way back fighting our way through them before theyd realised wed even been in and in the end he had agreed as he always did and at the first briefing it had somehow become his own idea how many times had that happened how many times right through to the cammarata it had been staring me in the face for years and i had not seen it before blinded by my belief in the man and i was aware of a strange release of tension almost as if i had been set free from something a kind of fierce joy surging through me am stacey wyatt and no one else that thought echoed in my head as a twig snapped several things happened somewhere in the night a voice called up on the roof and i picked up a stone and tossed it into the bushes my friend of the gate was no bargain whatever hoffer had paid him he jumped out of the shrubbery and fired several times where my stone had landed i shot him through the upper part of his right arm he cried out and spun round dropping his rifle we faced each other in the rain the statue of some greek goddess behind him watching blindly there was no fear in his eyes perhaps hoffer had made a better bargain than he knew if you want to live talk i told him what happened to signorina solazzo shes been locked in her room all day and ciccio is ciccio with her he has been he shrugged i dont know its nothing to do with me she has the room with the gold door on the second floor he gripped his arm tightly to arrest the flow of blood ciccio told me you and the frenchman were dead he was wrong wasnt he the others are here somewhere about i nodded hoffer is dead barbaccia caught up with him at last go nowwhat happens has nothing to do with you he faded into the bushes as a rifle cracked the unmistakable thud of an ak and a bullet chipped a piece out of the greek statues head as i went to one knee someone dropped back out of sight behind the retaining wall up there in the moorish roof garden i called softly its me seanstacey im coming up there was no reply but the floodlights which dotted the garden were dowsed suddenly i dont know whose bright idea that was but it suited me perfectly i moved out at once through the welcome darkness scrambled over the low wall of the ground floor terrace and went into the lounge through the open french window the hall was a place of shadows dimly lit by a single lamp but i had to keep moving for speed in attack is the only hope of success against odds i went up the stairs like a wraith close to the wall moved along the corridor past my own room and went up to the second floor there was no sound i paused in the shadows by the golden door and thought about it for a moment the next door along the landing was faced with leather and opened to my touch from the look of it it had been hoffers and the usual sliding glass doors opened to the terrace on the other side i went back into the corridor flattened myself against the wall and said softly rosaare you there her voice was clear and sharp run stacey run there was the sound of a blow and three bullets splintered the door i went through hoffers room on tiptoe moved along the terrace and peered in rosa was lying on the floor wearing a housecoat ciccio was over by the door with his back to me he was barefooted wore pants and a singlet and held a gun in his right hand rosa started to get up as ciccio opened the door cautiously i stepped into the room shot him through the hand as he started to turn he yelled the gun jumping out on to the landing and disappearing over the edge rosa had been weeping and her face was badly bruised and her right shoulderi noticed that as the housecoat slid down to her waist exposing the upper part of her body her naked breasts she covered herself mechanically an expression of wonder on her face staceystacey it is you they said you were dead she flung her arms about my neck and held on tight i didnt take my eyes off ciccio for a moment no im not dead i said but hoffer ismafia justice thank god she said fiercely i wanted to warn you stacey last night after i left your room i wanted to go back you were righti was afraid afraid for many reasons but hoffer was suspicious he beat me then gave me to thisthis animal ciccio stepped back and i took her forward through the shadows to where light filtered in from the landing the bruises on her face were worse than i had realised and something moved like fire in my belly hes had his way with you she didnt attempt to pretend her head went back and there was still pride there he has my marks on him also i turned and at the sight of my face ciccio went back quickly still clutching his bloody hand please signore he forced a fake mantoman smile this woman is a whore from the back streets of palermo everyone knows what she was before signore hoffer took her in he smiled again eagerly his back to the stairs and rage boiled like lava inside me you find it funny you like a joke then laugh this off i kicked him in the crutch with all my strength he screamed as he doubled over and my right knee lifted into his face sending him back down the stairs he rolled over twice and crashed to the floor below he lay there for a moment and then incredibly got to his feet and lurched out of sight dangling what looked like a broken arm i turned to rosa the day you start feeling shamed about your past just let me know ill let you have a few choice items from my own that should make you feel about as soiled as a vestal virgin by comparison im going to leave you now burkes waiting for me upstairs in the roof garden no stacey there are two of them they will kill you i dont think so on the other hand anythings possible in this life i took out my wallet and handed it to her if it goes wrong whatever you find in there should help you along the way more than a little now get dressed and wait for me downstairs in one of the cars i started to turn and she caught me held me to her yet did not kiss me she said nothing but her face was eloquent enough when i pulled gently away she did not try to stop me eighteen the door at the top of the stairs stood open the garden was floodlit again a place of wonder and delight sweetly perfumed in the rain i paused to one side of the door and considered the situation for a while then moved along the landing tried another door and found myself in a study of sorts the room was in darkness the inevitable glass doors that formed the other side standing open which way would he expect me to come that was the thing i stood there in the darkness drained of all emotion suddenly tired caught by some strange fatalism that seemed to say it didnt really matternothing mattered we were on our predestined course burke and i what would be must be i went out through the glass doors in three quick strides and dropped into the green jungle of the garden his voice sounded clearly over here stacey i know youre there you and me sean i called no one else as ever was stacey boy the more irish he sounded the less i trusted him piet isnt here he went up to the airstrip with our baggage were getting out tonight which was a lie had to be because whatever else hoffer had paid him there was the bearer bond for fifty thousand dollars in that bank vault in palermo and as today was sunday he couldnt possibly have collected it on his return he wasnt going to leave that but trapped by that strange fatalism i decided to play his game and stepped out through the ferns into a narrow path between vines he stood at the end on the terrace beyond a wrought iron table his hands behind his back what are you holding there sean i called nothing stacey dont you believe me after the mountainafter cammarata both hands came into view empty im sorry about that but i knew youd never stand still for killing the girl he shook his head and there was a kind of admiration in his voice but you staceyyou christ you are indestructible i thought you in pieces youre losing your touch seanold age i said if youre interested you didnt do much of a job on the girl either shes doing fine hoffers the one whos in trouble explaining himself to the devil about now i should think that got through to him and the slight smile left his face youre a bloody swine sean i said you always were only i never saw it before nothing on earth could excuse what you did up there on the mountain you and hoffer should get on fine when you next meet you wouldnt kill me in cold blood stacey after all weve been through together he spread his arms wide thats just the way i intend to do it i told him and rosa screamed from the doorway behind me i swung dropped on my face pain tearing at my right shoulder as piet jaeger jumped from the vines no more than seven or eight feet away for some odd reason the weapon he clutched in both hands was a lupara which had presumably belonged to one of hoffers men just the thing for assassination at closequarters i shot him three times two bullets catching him in the heart the third in the throat as he went down dropping the lupara i turned the smith and wesson ready and looked into the browning rigid in burkes hand stuck it in my belt at the rear he explained whos slipping now arent you going to shed a tear for lover boy i asked his face went very still you bastard ive wanted you like this for a long time but you needed me didnt you i said i only discovered that tonight you only had them carry me out when i was wounded on the lagona job because i was essential to you without me you were nothing i laughed harshly the great sean burke thats a joke every move you ever made every plan originated in my head without me you were nothing and i thought you were some kind of god you wouldnt even have got into the cammarata without me or come within ten miles of serafino and the girl you poor bloody fool he said you think i needed you for the cammarata job you think thats why i brought you out of egypt instead of leaving you to rot youve got a better story try this he savoured every word as he spoke hoffer wanted vito barbaccias head but getting at him was impossible until he hired me and i remembered my old friend stacey wyatt in the hole at fuad the problem was getting into the barbaccia villaall visitors cars left outside the gate but would that apply to barbaccias grandson it was worth a try i stared up at him and he laughed out loud the only time id known him to do it the two gunmen at the villa that nightthey were in the boot of the car thats how they got in my idea stacey just like troy and the wooden horse worth bringing you out of fuad for and it nearly worked how true it all was i had no means of knowing but it seemed unlikely that it would have been the only reason for bringing me out of fuad no he had needed me for cammarata however much he tried to deny it to himself now on the other hand i had certainly mentioned my grandfather to him in the distant past and a name which meant nothing to him then would have assumed a new importance when first heard from hoffer so he had used me again ironic that in this case i was also the one who had foiled him but i now understood why he had been so quick to shoot the boy with the lupara that night in the garden the only way of guaranteeing a still tongue i got to one knee and he shook his head youre wasting your time ive been counting one in the garden one on the stairs three for piet that makes five which is all you ever carry in that thingunless you reloaded on the way up a gamea monstrous game in which we each played our parts i shook my head and dropped the smith and wesson into my pocket no youre right its empty this is it then stacey he said weve come a long way since the lights of lisbon i picked up the lupara you know what this is surehoffer showed it to me the mafia favour themthe traditional way of finishing off a vendetta not much use beyond six feet youd have to get close stacey ill get close i said stood up and thumbed back the hammer you never amounted to a row of beans without me at your back lets see how good you are on your own he was right of course a sawnoff shotgun spreads so quickly that i hadnt a hope in hell of really hurting him where he stood which was a good twenty paces away i started to walk staring death in the face and rosa cried out sharply somewhere i heard a car engine and then another the slam of doors voices in the night mafia arriving too late there was only the rain and burke standing there at the end of a dark tunnel his face frozen every line etched deep the eyes boring into me so that we were caught together in our own timeless moment and then a strange thing happened the browning wavered he took a step back and then another i dont know what it was that caused it perhaps my relentless approach my apparent contempt for sudden death the expression on my face whatever it was he cracked came apart at the seams stay away from me stay away he took three quick paces back lurched into the low retaining wall and went over with a desperate cry i stood there swaying slightly then dropped the lupara rosa was there holding on to me tightly crying into my shoulder i stroked her head absently then moved to the wall and looked down at him broken across the steps of the terrace sixty feet below when i finally turned my grandfather was there and marco together with three hard looking gentlemen who clutched machine pistols as if thoroughly accustomed to their use youre too late i said all over barbaccia moved towards me youre all right me im fine just burke and his boy friend dead and a couple of hoffers thugs chipped up a little what do you think ill get ten years fifteen rome doesnt like this sort of thing any more its bad for the tourist trade he put a hand on my shoulder stacey listen to me all this is nothing burke and his friend go so deep under the earth that no one ever finds them the others i fixi fix everything they know better than to cross mafia thats good i said thats marvellous because to tell you the truth ive had enough gaols to last me a lifetime and ive got other plans like taking the first plane to anywhere out of sicily tomorrow he looked completely shocked reached out an uncertain hand stacey you dont know what youre saying you must stay with me stay with you i laughed out loud i wouldnt cut you down if you were hanging ive news for you i made a very interesting discovery tonight i found out who murdered my motheryou did it was the cruellest thing i could have said however true and he wilted became old before my eyes i turned and pushed my way past his bully boys feeling suddenly very very tired i got as far as the door and staggered a little and then there was an arm supporting me rosa was there her face full of pride and she had stopped crying let me help you stacey can you cook as well youve never tasted pasta like it then youre the girl for me only one stipulation we do things right at the first opportunity im sick of irregular habits she started to cry again as we descended the stairs and i patted her shoulder my clothes will still be in my room i suppose pack a bag for me and whatever you need for yourself and dont forget your passport ill see you downstairs and ill have my wallet she gave it to me and went into her room and i made it down to the hall under my own steam it was raining harder than ever when i went into the garden and moved along the terrace at the front of the villa he seemed peaceful enough lying there in the rain although from the look of him his spine was broken and the back of the skull was crushed i thought about a lot of things standing there but mainly of that first time wed met at the lights of lisbon if only one could hold moments for ever if only people didnt change but that was not possible life was not like that now i was tired now all i wanted to do was shelter from the darkness in some corner of warmth and if i was lucky luckier than most people ever are rosa would provide that rosa and the piece of paper worth fifty thousand dollars that reposed in the lining of my wallet and i smiled wryly remembering him solemnly sealing the manilla envelope containing the blank withdrawal form id substituted for the real thing that day at the bank poor seanpoor sean burke i took out the smith and wesson dropped it on his chest and left him there in the rain a poor exchange perhapsfor him but not for me the end praise for jack higgins and his bestselling novels the presidents daughter all of higginss skill in weaving together a tight
