old stories told by travelers great songs that bards have sung of mossflower summers faded gone when redwalls stones were young great hall fires on winter nights the legends who remembers battles banquets comrades quests recalled midst glowing embers draw close now little woodlander take this to sleep with you my tale of dusty faroff times when warrior hearts were true then store it in your memory and be the sage who says to young ones in the years to come ah yes those were the days book one the maid from the sea abbot bernard folded his paws deep into the wide sleeves of his garb from a viewpoint on the threshold of redwall abbeys west ramparts he watched the hot midsummer day drawing to a glorious close late evening light mellowed the red sandstone abbey walls turning them to dusty scarlet across the flatlands cloud layers striped the horizon in long billows of purple amber rose and cerise bernard turned to his friend simeon the blind herbalist the sun is sinking like the tip of a sugar plum dipping into honey a perfect summer evening eh simeon the two mice stood silent awhile before simeon turned his sightless face toward the abbot father abbot how is it that you see so much yet feel so little do you not know there is a mighty storm coming tonight the abbot shook his head disbelieving yet unwilling to deny simeons unerring instinct a storm surely not simeon chided abbot bernard gently perhaps you have other things on your mind my friend maybe you have not felt the cooling breezes die away the air has become still and hot the birds stopped their evensong much earlier than usual even the grasshoppers and the buzzing bees have ceased what little noise they make listen the abbot cocked his head on one side perplexed i hear nothing simeon chuckled dryly that is because you are hearing the sound of silence bernard one thing i have learned in my life is to listen to the sounds of mossflower country every sound carries information so does every silence this is going to be a mighty storm one that we have not seen the like of in many a long season taking simeon by the paw abbot bernard led his blind companion down the rampart steps and across the lawn toward the main abbey building simeon sniffed the air mmmm i smell hot apple pie and raspberry cream pudding and scones fresh from the oven too with damson preserve spread on them wed best hurry before the moles get here or therell be none left the abbot quickened his pace how dyou know the moles are coming bernard bernard did you ever know sister sage to serve raspberry cream pudding and no moles to arrive right again simeon your powers of observation leave me in the shade oh i must tell young dandin to beat the log alarm itll warn anybeast still outdoors to come in simeon grimaced oh dear do we have to suffer that noise again young dandin is a bit overenthusiastic at beating a hollow log with two clubs abbot bernard smiled reflectively yes he does rather put his heart into it doesnt he still i wish everyone were as willing in their duties as our dandin if ever redwall abbey gets a bell ill be the first to vote him as bellringer the two mice made their way between the flowerbeds which dotted the dark greensward an ominous grumble of thunder muffled its way over the far horizon to the northwest abbot bernard turned in the doorway of the abbey attempting to conjure up his powers of smell hmmm cider poured cold from the cask eh simeon the blind herbalist wrinkled his nose wrong its pear cordial the father abbot of all redwall tried not to look amazed even though simeon could not see him he might sense his abbots expression oo far far over the horizon far to the northwest far across the oily blue green billows which were rising lashing their tops into rippling white peaks of foam far over the abysses and deeps of the heaving seas far from the peace and calm of redwall abbey stood gabool the wild clouds of jet black and slate gray boiled down out of the sky to meet the lashing waves a blast of hot wind like the gust from hellfurnace doors set gabools scarlet cape fluttering as he stood on the high cliffs of his island defying the elements thunder boomed out forked lightning ripped through the lowering vault of the sky gabool drew his jewelhilted sword and waved it at the storm as he roared and laughed in exultation the deadly curved blade with its sharp double edges hummed and sang against the wind gabool the wild ruled the seas he was the dread lord of terramort island king of the searats warlord of all rodent corsairs captain of captains no creature alive was a fiercer fighter than gabool from the lowly position of a young scullyrat he had fought his way up to be the biggest the most savage the cruelest and the most ruthless in all the seas and oceans there had never been a rat like gabool the wild huge gold hoops dangled from his ears his fangs were replaced by sharp jutting gold canines each one set with a glinting green emerald below his weird yellow bloodflecked eyes an enormous dark beard sprouted and curled spilling down to his broad chest silk ribbons of blue and red woven through it whenever gabool moved his rings bracelets medals and buckles jangled gold turquoise silver ivory plunder from the far places of the high seas strange weapons with shimmering twisted blades were thrust into the purple sash about his waist dangerous to serve and deadly to trust he stood laughing in the teeth of the gale satisfied that the creature who had dared go against him was now fish bait on the seabed thunder crashed overhead as the skies released a deluge of whipping lashing rain lightning crackled around the rocky tor illuminating the barbaric figure as if even the high heavens were challenging him the warlord of all waters threw back his huge head and shrieked out his battle cry to the storm gaaaabooooool oo the pitifully tiny figure of a mousemaid was hurled about like a chip of bark in the eastward rush of high roaring seas tormented rolling waves whipped to a frenzy by the screeching wind billowed and swelled long combing chariots pulled fiercely along by tossing white stallions of foam and spray the mousemaid partially stunned dared not even let one paw free to undo the rope about her neck her numbed paws clung grimly to a jagged spar of driftwood as she plunged wildly about in the maddened waters now on top of a wave high as a castle hurtling down blue green valleys into a trough that yawned like a deep dark monster mouth now being spun sideways with the spume now being flung backwards from greater heights to vaster depths the rope became tangled around the wooden spar painfully the little maid tried to bite at the hemp seawater gushed into her mouth and she retched as the water threatened to choke her a flailing end of rope struck her across the eyes unthinkingly she let go of the spar it whipped off in a different direction from her with both paws tearing feebly at the rope circling her neck she was shaken about like a small fish upon rod and line all consciousness was finally beaten from her body when the spar struck her across the head and the helpless figure was lost amid the pounding crashing seas obscured by the boiling cloud curtains above the maelstrom not even the stars or moon were witness to the fate of the little mousemaid victim of gabools cruel whim close to the north side of the abbey building a new construction was under way astride the wooden scaffolding of a halffinished bell tower young dandin pounded doggedly away at the hollow beech log thonkthonkthonkthonk though he was a sturdily built little mouse he felt himself driven aback by the blasting wind shaking rainwater from his eyes he bent his head against the onslaught of the storm and continued stubbornly thwacking the log with two hefty yew clubs whenever dandin raised his gaze slightly he could see the fringe of surrounding mossflower woods swaying and hissing rustling and sighing like a restless ocean dandin come down youll catch your death up there the young mouse peered over the scaffold shielding his eyes against the deluge draped about with a clean wornout floursack mother mellus the redwall badger stamped a huge paw upon the wet sward dyou hear me young mouse i said down this instant dandin blew rainwater from his whiskers smiling roguishly he called back right this instant marm just like you say without a backward glance dandin threw himself from the tower and came plunging earthward to the accompaniment of the badgers startled growls not more than a fraction from the ground he stopped falling and swung there dangling by a strong vinerope harnessed about his waist dandin touched his nose with a wet paw came as quick as i could marm a huge paw cuffed him roughly about the ears as mother mellus freed him from the encircling vinerope tucking him firmly in her elbow crook like a baby she hurried in out of the rain scolding dandin as he complained loud and long put me down im not a baby i can walk no youre not a baby youre a young pickle dyou hear and you should know better throwing yourself from a high tower like that by the weasels whiskers you scared me out of ten seasons growth i know what im doing it was completely safe now will you put me down i can stand on my own paws you know ill put you down you young rip next time ill tan your hide so hard you wont be able to sit down until berrypicking just let me catch you jumping from high places like that again whatd you do if the vines snapped eh then we wouldnt have to dig a grave youd go so far into the earth when you hit the ground youd be able to shake paws with the taproots of an oak be still you little blaggard or youll feel the back of my paw young abbey beasts these days i dont know scolding and arguing by turns the young mouse and the old badger went inside the abbey mother mellus kicked the huge door shut behind her leaving the storm to rage on outside across great hall in the cozy surroundings of cavern hole abbot bernard sat at head of table with brother simeon on his left paw and foremole the mole leader on his right lanterns twinkled around the homely festive board moles jostled shoulders with mice hedgehogs sat next to otters and squirrels the abbey infants were allowed to sit at table with their elders they were mainly woodland orphans gathered in by mother mellus baby mice small hedgehogs a young squirrel and twin otters who had been brought by their parents little ones who were known as dibbuns they were sat on the table edges facing the brothers and sisters of redwall the good mice who tended and cared for them redwall fare was famous throughout the length and breadth of mossflower the abbey grew all its own produce and redwall cooks were experts foremole had his nose buried in a raspberry cream pudding speaking in the rustic mole language through mouthfuls of his favorite sweet hohurr baint nuthen loik rabserry pudden no zurr oi could eat

elder too betcher oim eldern they an woiser mayap at the head of the table the abbot paused with a hot scone between paw and mouth the log poundings stopped where is dandin simeon took a sip from a foaming tankard of october ale in the kitchen cant you hear him hes getting a dryingdown dry clothes and a good tellingoff from mellus the reprimands of mellus and the protests of dandin echoed loudly down the corridor between the kitchen and cavern hole keep still your ears are saturated owow i wont have any ears left the way youre going ouch and im not wearing that great big habit it belongs to fatty brother john ooh you ungrateful little scamp how dare you call brother john a fatty when he was good enough to lend you his spare robe hey come here come back i say the smack of wet paws on the floor of the passage to cavern hole announced the culprits escape dandin scampered in he sat between foremole and a squirrel named rufe brush grabbing a wedge of speckled nutcheese he jammed it between two slices of oat farl and began munching pouring himself a beaker of cold strawberry cordial as he did flagg the big otter winked at dandin and passed him a bowl of otters hotroot sauce to dip his farl into aye aye matey run afoul of ma mellus again have ee quick an dip yer bows now yonder she comes dandin ducked beneath the table just in time mother mellus came bustling by a clean linen bonnet tied about her great striped head she nodded to the abbot and took her place at the far end of table in a large armchair sitting two young mice on her lap and a baby mole on the arm of the chair she soon forgot dandin as she occupied herself feeding the dibbuns wiping chins and generally taking charge come on now little one eat up your woodland salad pudding later no dont lika sala wanna pudden salad first pudding later you want to grow up big and strong like me dont you no wanna stay lickle an eat pudden alia time abbot bernard reached beneath the table and nudged dandin you can come out now young mouse mother mellus has her paws full with those dibbuns you did a fine job as log banger dandin though there was no need to stay out in the storm so long dandin sat up proudly and reached for a raspberry cream pudding thank you father abbot i stayed out until i knew all our abbey creatures were inside safe and dry its my job blind simeon smiled well done young dandin youre just the type of mouse redwall abbey needs one day when the abbey is fully built and completed who knows you could be our next abbot dandin wrinkled his nose not too pleased with the idea abbot bernard laughed heartily no abbotship for you eh young rip its easy to see that you come from the line of gonff the mousethief i wish that martin the warrior had left ancestors behind simeon held up a paw maybe he did my friend not direct descendants but spiritual ones martin was a warrior and the founder of redwall his presence is all around us in these very stones i have never talked with a creature whom i felt was actually touched by martins spirit but then we have never needed such a one in this time of peace however i feel that one day before my seasons have run i will meet some creature whose life has been touched by the shadow of our warrior rufe brush looked up from a plate of hazelnut cream and apple pie not on a night like this you wont simeon listen to that rainstorm any creature out on a night like this must be drowned by now simeon was about to answer when he suddenly turned his face aside and clasped a table napkin to his nose whaaaw somebeasts eating wild garlic a fat mole named burgo several places down with a clothespin fitted snugly upon his nose was tucking into a big basin with a spoon he waved a paw at simeon burr nor cn oi stan the smell o garleck oi do dearly luvs the taste of it tho ats whoi oi keeps moi snowt pegged garleck woild soup nuthin loik et zurr amid the laughter that followed dandin turned to rufe brush by the fur rufe that rain sounds as if it were trying to knock our abbey down you were right anybeast out in this must be well drowned by now fort bladegirt stood at the edge of the high rocks which towered above terramort cove the big window of its banqueting hall facing out to sea it had a courtyard and a high wall which ran around its perimeter where the ground was open though part of the actual fort building integrated with the outer wall where it overhung the cove the entire structure was built from solid rock with heavy wooden doors at the entrances both to the fort and courtyard on three sides it was overlooked by hills gabool the wild had taken it as his by right indeed whoever owned bladegirt was absolute king of searats as long as he could hold it inside the fort chaos and misrule were the order of the day corsair rats left their ships to come ashore after long plundering voyages they made their way to bladegirt in droves leaving their ships at anchor in the cove roistering fighting gambling and drinking the searats enjoyed their shore leave after the hardships of a life at sea in the high banqueting chamber gabool sprawled on a carved rock throne which he had made more comfortable by covering it with the skins of his slain enemies he stared with loving fascination at a great bell dominating the center of the floor monumental in its size the prize stood reflecting the torchlights and revelry through its burnished sheen copper silver brass and gold had been used in its casting heaving himself up gabool strode forward sword in one claw a chalice of wine in the other as he traversed the perimeter of his greatest prize grinning like a child with a new toy he tapped his swordblade against the marvelous bell the soft musical note vibrated gently like a giant harp strummed by the wind as he walked gabools restless eyes roved up and down from the strange figures embossed around the top to the intricate words ranging around the wide base of the great bell gabool was puzzled as to their meaning but they were pretty decorations which made his prize all the more fascinating to look upon blood n thunder capn give it a good belt an lets hear it ring out a burly drunken searat named halfnose pulled a wooden cudgel from his belt and thrust it toward gabool with lightning speed the warlord grabbed the club and crashed it down on halfnoses skull at the same time landing a thrusting kick into the drunkards belly which sent him reeling into an open cask of wine halfnose slumped across the wine his head submerged gabool roared with laughter drink or drown seascum nobeast comes near gabools bell the carousing searats shrieked their appreciation at his joke gabool pointed at halfnose with his sword if he ever gets out o there give him a cup of wine t revive him this caused further merriment except from the table where bludrigg captain of the ship greenfang sat with his mates though gabool laughed as heartily as the others bludrigg had not escaped his notice everyone was laughing but not bludrigg bludrigg the surly bludrigg the argumentative bludrigg the troublecauser the seadeck lawyer gabool watched him closely bludrigg who could sense the scheming mind behind his kings false merriment things between the king of searats and his captain had been building to a head for a long time gabool decided to settle accounts with bludrigg now gulping wine from the chalice and allowing it to spill freely into his beard gabool pretended to stagger drunkenly he winked in a friendly manner and thrust his sword point down into a chest of booty tottering over to the table gabool banged the halfempty chalice down in front of the greenfangs captain bludrigg me old matey cmon drink up bludrigg s face was sullen as he thrust the chalice aside dont want no wine i can drink all i want aboard me ship all around the hall they stopped drinking singing and gambling an air of expectancy settled over the searats gabool blinked as if trying to shake off the effects of the wine and swayed slightly food then cant have my captain starvin roast meat fruit fish sugared preserves here bring m friend bludrigg some vittles bludriggs swordclaw fondled the hilt of his sheathed scimitar leave the food gabool i eat well enough gabool sighed shaking his head as if in puzzlement he sat next to bludrigg and threw a comradely claw about his shoulders hmmm no wine no food no smile on me old shipmates face what dyou want then bucko bludrigg shook gabools claw off he stood upright knocking the chair over behind him his eyes blazing with suppressed rage at the drunken warlord i want my share of the plunder theres been none from the last three sailings im tellin you gabool i want my portion of the booty an ill have it tonight come hell or high water from around the packed hall there were murmurs of agreement gabool spread his arms wide and smiled blow me down is that all why didnt you say so sooner bludrigg was lost for words the expected clash had not come now he felt slightly foolish in front of his crew he shrugged mumbling halfheartedly he tried excusing himself as if he were complaining on behalf of his searats well i never thought its just that my crew were startin to complain they thought youd forgotten us gabool looked injured he went over to the chest of booty where his sword stood upright amid a heap of armlets goblets baubles and shiny stones drawing forth the sword he turned one or two items over with its point until he found what he sought gabool flicked the sword up as a shiny gold coronet studded with gems slid along its blade aharr friend bludrigg the best for you a crown fit for a king bludrigg felt a sudden rush of confidence he had done it gabool was notoriously mean with plunder but he bludrigg captain of the greenfang had actually got the better of gabool the king of searats had backed down before him bludriggs chest swelled as he accepted the beautiful coronet from gabools swordblade and placed it on his head a cheer rose from the company as gabool spread his arms wide extending the sword away from bludrigg he addressed them see yer scurvy waveriders pay attention you jetsam of the oceans i am gabool the wild this is how i repay me friends without warning gabool swung a powerfully savage blow with his sword and reward my enemies even the hardened searats moaned in horror as the head of bludrigg thudded to the floor the coronet rolled in front of gabool he picked it up on the dripping sword blade and held it forth to the assembly would anyone else like to wear the crown mateys oo heralded by the call of seabirds eastern sunrays flooded warm and golden into a sky of calm blue reflected in the millpond sea below the angry storm had passed leaving summer serenity in its wake the sun warmed the wet bundle on the flotsamstrewn tideline until it stirred seawater and bile flooded from the mousemaids mouth as she coughed feebly the damp paw set tiny flies buzzing as it reached for her throat and began weakly grappling with the knotted rope the wooden spar lay across her back a seabird landed upon it the added weight caused the mousemaid to vomit more salt water forth with a gurgling groan startled the bird rose noisily into the air cheated of the carcass it had taken for dead other seabirds began to wheel and circle overhead a tiny crab tried nibbling at the maids rough wet burlap dress gave up and scuttled away finally undone the rope fell away from her bruised neck painfully she shifted the spar and rolled over onto her back the mousemaid lay still awhile some of the more venturesome seabirds spiraled lower rubbing sand and grit from her face with the back of a paw she opened both eyes immediately shutting them again against the glare of sunlight small wavelets trickled and lapped gently away from the shore the tide was ebbing the mousemaid ventured to explore the wound that the spar had inflicted upon her head she winced and left it alone turning over again she shielded her eyes with her paws and rested on the firm damp sand soaking up the lifegiving rays of the comforting sun a large speckled gull landed close to her readying its dangerous beak it stalked slowly forward the mousemaid watched it from between her paws within a necklength of her prostrate body the sea gull stood upon one webbed foot and began bringing its beak down in an exploratory peck thwack she swung the wetsandweighted end of the rope it was knotted and her aim was good the ropes end thudded solidly into the birds right eye with a squawk of pain and distress the sea gull did an awkward running takeoff flopping into the air and dispersing its alarmed companions the little mousemaid began dragging herself laboriously up the beach her throat parched mouth dry head aching limbs battered almost numb by the pounding seas she reached a tussock of reedgrass in the dry sand above the tideline pulling the grass about her she lay down in the safety of its shelter as sleep descended upon her weary body strange thoughts flooded her mind she could not remember who she was she had no name she could recall apart from the stormy seas that had tossed her up there was no memory of anything it was all a cloudy gray void where had she come from where was she now what was she doing here where was she going her last thought before sleep enveloped her brain was that she was a fighter she could beat off a large sea gull with a ropes end even lying stranded and halfdead from exhaustion and she had survived the sea she was alive dawn arrived clad in hushed rosiness upon the wake of stormtorn night abbot bernard had not lain abed he was up and about concern for his beloved redwall had driven sleep from his mind the ravages of galeforce winds and rain would need repairing he made a swift tour of inspection finishing up on the east battlements leaning back upon the strongly hewn stones bernard allowed himself a sigh of relief there was not much that any weather conditions no matter how severe could do to the abbey however there were broken branches and wrecked tree limbs overhanging the ramparts to the east and north with here and there some illfated sapling or hollow woodland monarch toppled against the walls inside the grounds had largely been protected by the outer structure a few crops flattened fruit bushes in disarray and a loose window shutter on the gatehouse blown awry the father abbot descended the wallsteps thankfully and went to summon foremole to head a repair crew they could attend to the damage after breakfast the calm after the storm also had its effect upon the inmates of redwall abbey young creatures tumbled out of the abbey building into the sunlit morning whooping and shouting they teemed into the orchard to gather fruit brought down by the winds of the gale the otter twins bagg and runn frisked and bounded around the apple and pear trees to the strawberry patch then lay on their backs squeaking with laughter as they gobbled up the juicy fruit inventing fictitious reasons as to why the berries were lying there heehee look what was blown down from the strawberry trees by the wind last night heeheehee durry quill gabe quills little nephew joined them he sat in the strawberry patch trying to decide which was the biggest berry eating all the possible candidates as he listened to the otters durry was not at all sure whether he should believe they had come from a strawberry tree strawbrry trees dont see no strawbrry trees where be they bagg coughed hard to stop himself tittering he put on a serious face as he explained the logic of fictitious strawberry trees to the puzzled little durry teehee er harumph what you never seed a strawbrry tree dear oh dear why theyre great giant things with blue speckly leaves very light of course only weigh as much as two goosefeathers thats why the wind blowed em all away whoosh straight oer the top of the abbey walls the gullible durry looked from one to the other half convinced runn nodded serious agreement and continued the story sright i seed it meself from the dormitory window way away they blowed all those poor old great strawbrry trees carried off by the wind to the gongleboo mountains where the grunglypodds live a halfeaten strawberry dropped from durrys open mouth grunglyboos mountain where gronglepodds live where be that under a nearby pear tree dandin stood paws on hips with his friend young saxtus the harvest mouse both smiled as they listened to the two otters leading durry quill astray with their tall tales saxtus bit into a windfall pear and grimaced dont know why we came out here to eat fruit most of these windfalls arent even ripe yet taste this pear hard as a rock dandin sat down with the otters and durry no thanks ill try my luck with all these berries that fell from the strawberry trees he looked over the top of a large strawberry at bagg and runn strawberry trees indeed you two should be ashamed of yourselves telling a poor little hedgehog such whopping great fibs saxtus sat down with them keeping his normally solemn face quite straight dandins right yknow otters that tell lies get carried off by the big pink waterbogle bagg tossed a strawberry into the air it missed his mouth and bounced off his nose as he remarked airily oh the pink waterbogle weve been carried off twice this summer by him havent we runn runn giggled teeheehee ill say we have we told him so many whoppers he said hes not carrying us off anymore from the direction of the damson and plum trees simeons voice interrupted saxtus dandin brother hubert wants you for your redwall history and recording lessons he is not getting any younger and someday we will need a new recorder traditions must be upheld come on young scamps i know youre there the two young mice dropped flat in the strawberry patch dandin holding a paw to his lips shush its simeon lie low he might go away the steady pawsteps of the blind herbalist came nearer simeon called again come on you two i know youre hiding in the strawberry patch saxtus tugged baggs tail and winked at the young otter bagg winked back as he called out its bagg and runn simeon were the only ones here simeon appeared chuckling im going to count to three and if you two otters and that nephew of quills arent off to the abbey kitchen to help with the chores ill tell mother mellus to come and fetch you with a hazel twig as for saxtus and dandin unless you want me to give you an extra lecture on the value of nightshade and campion as herbs youll come out now and stop lying there trying to breathe lightly i may not have eyesight but my ears and nose have never deceived me yet saxtus and dandin stood up ruefully wiping away dew from their novices habits wordlessly they followed simeon to the gatehouse at the entrance to the outer walls simeon strode boldly ahead a smile hovering about his lips hmm pity the strawberry trees got blown away in the storm you could have climbed up one and hidden in its branches brother hubert sat at his desk in the gatehouse though redwall abbey was of no great age he was surrounded by old books parchments and scrolls dust was everywhere it settled in layers on furniture and shelf alike providing a fine patina to the tomes and volumes piled willynilly coating the yellowed parchments and writing materials lazily drifting in a slow swirl around the morning sunlight shafts flooding through the window hubert kept his head bent to the task of recording the abbeys daily life the long feathered quill pen waving back and forth as he wrote saxtus and dandin stood in front of him listening to the scratch of quill on parchment keeping a respectful silence until brother hubert spoke to them looking over the top of his spectacles hubert blinked severely what is punctuality saxtus spoke out the respect we show other creatures by being on time hmm you two young brothers have more respect for strawberries than you do for me is that not right saxtus and dandin stood in silence brother hubert put aside his pen tell me in turn our abbey charter dandin you may begin dandin swallowed hard looked at the ceiling for inspiration shuffled his paws and began hesitantly er to be brothers and sisters of peace and goodwill er living together in harmony under the protection of redwall abbey er er forsaking all unnecessary forms of violence not only to mossflower its trees grasses flowers and insects but to all living creatures brother hubert nodded at saxtus to continue he did so with much more confidence and less hesitancy than dandin to help and comfort the dispossessed harbor orphans and waifs offer shelter to all creatures alike give clothing warmth and food to any beast or creature that is deemed in need of such to educate and learn particularly in the healing arts comfort the sick nurse the injured and help the wounded dandin received brother huberts nod to continue from saxtus er er help the wounded er lessee now er oh yes to take our food from the earth and replenish the land by caring for it er husbanding crops and living in harmony with the er seasons always to honor and protect our friends and brethren only raising paw to do battle when our life at redwall is threatened by treachery and the shadow of war at these times every redwall creature should show courage fortitude and obedience to the father abbot albeit the taking of another life must always be justified and never carried out in a wanton manner brother hubert came out from behind his desk well done saxtus and very clearly spoken as for you young dandin you stammer and hesitate you seem to have difficulty in remembering except that is until you come to the part that deals with treachery war and battle dandin looked down at the floor gnawing at the side hairs of his paw brother hubert leaned back against the desk took a beaker of cordial blew some dust from its rim and took a sip before continuing right saxtus tell me what has been going on in great hall for three seasons now saxtus stroked his chin thoughtfully going on great hall er er oh is it the making of some cloth picture is that what you mean brother hubert brother hubert polished his spectacles upon his habit sleeve i dont know are you asking me or telling me my my what a pair of little puddenheads see if you can tell him dandin this time it was dandins turn to brighten up in great hall for the past three seasons actually its three and a half the brothers and sisters also many woodlanders are combining their skills to make a wonderful tapestry this will depict our founder martin the warrior showing how he battled with villainous vermin foxes rats stoats ferrets and weasels even a huge wildcat like that awful tsarmina martin the warrior wasnt bothered by those evil beasts oho no he got his famous sword and buckled on his bright armor took up his shield and drove them from mossflower country wham blatt he whirled his deadly blade the rats screamed the foxes dived into hiding swishl chop martin was right after them and he whirled his sword an enough enough you bloodthirsty young scamp how do you know all this dandin smiled a reckless light burned in his bright eyes because the father of my fathers father was gonff the prince of mousethieves martin the warriors famous companion he could steal the nose from under your eyes while you were watching and he was a great balladmaker brother hubert nodded wisely yes indeed an unusual fellow by all accounts thief rogue warrior questor but all for the good of other creatures he married the lovely columbine if my memory serves me rightly so he could not have been too bad a creature never let me catch you stealing young dandin wait there was something i meant to tell you ah yes i have it here somewhere he began rummaging among piles of old records until the dust flew finally coming up with a small object by this time all three were coughing and spluttering amid the dust hubert shepherded them outside into the cool shadow of the ramparts before he presented dandin with the item it was a small flute beautifully made from a piece of straight applewood bored out by a redhot iron rod and wonderfully carved and it had an ornamental letter g near the mouthpiece i was looking through some ancient records brother hubert explained they said that the family of gonff lived down at old saint ninians church for six generations before gonff moved away from redwall abbey however he was presented with a flute by abbess germaine our first abbey mother but apparently gonff thought it was far too splendid and fancy for him he preferred a reed flute so he left this behind i think this is the flute it carries his initial and looks very old im sure it belongs rightly to you dandin do you think you can play it dandin gazed at the flute his eyes shining ill certainly try brother hubert dusted his habit before returning to the gatehouse good perhaps well hear you at the abbots midsummer jubilee feast saxtus squinted at the sun whens that brother three days hence though some of the older brothers and sisters have been planning it for quite a while now our father abbot is very modest and does not want to cause too much fuss so we have kept it quiet we didnt want to get you young ones too excited still i suppose youve got to know at some point both young mice leapt for joy hugging each other and laughing aloud at the prospect of the great event hurray abbot bernards jubilee feast redwaaaaaaalll brother huberts dry dusty old features broke into a wide grin go on now be off with the pair of you no doubt youll be needed to help with the preparations sister sage was not on duty serving breakfast that morning she took herself off for a breath of fresh air on the ramparts enjoying the soft breeze that drifted over mossflower woods she came down from her morning stroll along the walltop to join brother hubert and together they watched the two young mice hopping and leaping like wild crickets across the sunlit lawns and flower beds toward the abbey kitchens sister sage chuckled and shook her head cowslips look at those two young uns would you it makes you feel good to be alive on a summertide with that she hopped off after them capering madly despite her long seasons brother hubert attempted a small caper until dust arose from his habit and his glasses fell off he looked about quickly to see no creature had been watching then hurried into his gatehouse the midday sun glinted off the waters of the far northwest sea as thickheaded revelers from the previous night hauled anchors to sail out and scour the seas or range the coasts in their constant search for plunder and booty slaves and trinkets gabool the wild watched them from the high window of his banqueting hall waveblade blacksail rathelm and greenfang four good craft laden with the rakings and scrapings of seas and oceans murderers all gabool had conferred captaincy of the greenfang on garrtail an upandcoming member of the searat brethren but dull and wholly servile to his master gabool lord of all waters dull garrtail might be but gabool knew that it would not stop him gossiping to the master of the darkqueen saltar brother of bludrigg garrtail knew that the darkqueen habitually ranged the seas to the south he would make sure his path crossed with saltar there was little doubt the corsair master of darkqueen would hear the tale of his brothers death chapter and verse gabool tore at a leg of roasted kittiwake and chewed reflectively saltar had the reputation of being a hard searat to cross though they had never matched blades gabool knew saltar to be a corsair hook fighter using a vicious metal hook to impale opponents before slaying them with his curved sword gabool spat the meat away and hurled the kittiwake leg out of the window watching it bounce off rocks on the sheer face until it hit the sea below he laughed slyly two could play at that game taking a long dagger from his waist sash gabool went to the far end of the hall a colored cloth wall hanging held outward by a wooden rail near the ceiling reached from on high down to the floor gabool pushed it to one side and found the crack in the stonework behind it he jammed the long dagger handle first into the crack so that it was wedged with the blade pointing outward then let the wall hanging fall back into place though he was a renowned fighter and a fearless one gabool never took chances particularly since the incident with the mousemaid standing back gabool surveyed the trap good the wall hanging looked like any other in the hall perfectly harmless now his restless eye was caught by the great bell he wandered around its wide perimeter fascinated by the object surely no searat king had ever taken such a magnificent prize gabool pinged it with his long curving claws sounded it by banging his rings and bracelets upon its brazen surface amazed by the clear musical noises it made tingling humming and vibrating he bared his lips leaning close in he bit lightly at it making his gold teeth reverberate with the echoes from the bell gabool stroked the cool curving object as he crooned softly speak to me beauty we must get to know each other well i am gabool the wild your owner but you need not fear me your voice will call to my fleet one day your tones will terrify my enemies you will be the voice of gabool when i set you atop of my fort and let your tongue swing free then ah then you will boom out across the waves so that all the seas will know gabool is king on a sudden impulse gabool dashed off slamming the door behind him he took the downward stairs three at a time deeper and deeper into the depths of his own lair two guards were standing at the entrance to the prison cells gabool whirled upon them with a snarl get out of my sight and leave me alone here as the guards fled gabool made his way to a cell that was little more than a cage he lounged against the bars grinning at the pitiful creature locked up inside well bellmaker ready to work for me yet joseph the bellmaker was chained by his waist to the wall the floor of the subterranean cell was awash with sea water which seeped through from outside joseph had once been a powerful wellfleshed mouse but now his cheeks were sunken and dark circles formed around his eyes starvation and ill treatment had taken their ruthless toll on the bellmaker though as he raised his head both eyes burned with remorseless hatred for his captor i would sooner be eaten by the fishes of the sea than serve you rat gabool continued as if he had not heard the prisoner you can do it joseph i know you can a bell tower strong enough to hold the great bell right on top of my fort where the whole world will hear it joseph pulled forward straining at the chain in the enclosed space his voice shaking with pentup rage never i would not soil my paws with your mad ideas and evil schemes that bell was made for the badger the lord of salamandastron enemy of all seascum it will never ring for you gabool drew his sword and clashed it against the cell bars hells guts dyou think i care who it was made for you fool the bell is mine now mine to do what i like with its voice will sound for me alone i gabool warlord of the waves say this joseph slumped down shaking his head in despair youre mad completely insane and evil kill me do what you want with me i dont care anymore gabool sheathed his sword drawing close to the bars he whispered low and your daughter the bellmakers face betrayed the agony his mind was suffering no please you wouldnt harm her you couldnt shes so young and and dont you dare hurt my daughter gabool now sorely regretted drowning the bellmakers daughter still if the old buffoon thought she was alive there might be a bit of fun here gabool decided to toy with his victim if you build my bell tower i will let you see her again but not until youve carried out the work joseph tugged at the chain he bit his lip until blood showed torn by the decision he knew he had to make gabool listen i would not put a single stone atop another for you why because it would mean death torture or slavery for countless other good creatures dont you understand rat my conscience would not let me after i saw what they did to the captain and crew of our ship when searats captured us i know it means that i may never see my young one again it tears my heart apart but i must do the right thing for the sake of others gabool summoned up all his cunning his black soul driving him on to wickedness belying the smile on his face as he threw his claws wide haharr very stubborn joseph but i can see that youre a good creature sometimes i wish that id never been born wicked but decent like you i suppose ill have to think of somethin else now but hark bellmaker im sure youd like to see your daughter again wouldnt you matey tears of gratitude beaded in the unsuspecting prisoners eyes she means more to me than anything please let me see her gabool took the keys from a wallspike hells gates i must be getting soft in me old age come on then they stood in the banqueting hall barbarian and bellmaker joseph looked around him dragging his chains as he did where is she gabool touched the great bell with his sword not so fast shipmate if you wont build me a bell tower then at least tell me what these little pictures and strange words round the top n bottom of my bell mean joseph shuffled anxiously around the bell his mind preoccupied with thoughts of his daughter as he reluctantly read off the rhyme at its base i will ring for wedding times when two hearts unite i will toll the hours out all daytime and through night i will wake good creatures up from their beds each morning or toll when theyre in danger a clear and brazen warning for all the family son and daughter husband and goodwife i will boom a sad farewell when they must leave this life for many great occasions for many different reasons listen and my voice youll hear throughout the changing seasons though i may boom clang peal or toll command and use me well but hark beware the evil ones who would misuse this bell gabool stared hard at joseph trash ill have it filed off one day what about the little drawins an pictures round the top what do they mean bellmaker joseph spread his shackled paws only the lord of salamandastron knows that he gave me a parchment with those drawn upon it who knows what goes through the minds of the great badger rulers of the fire mountain they are creatures of destiny ive told you all i know now can i see my daughter gabool led him to the open window of course matey i cant show you the exact spot where she lies but i can show you how to find her for gabool it was but the work of a moment one swift push in the late afternoon the mousemaid cast a long shadow as she wandered the deserted beach alone hunger thirst and attacks of myriad gnats and sandflies had wakened and forced her to desert the hiding place over one shoulder she still carried the knotted rope a long line of pawprints in the sand behind her emphasized the desolation of sea sand and sky seemingly inhabited only by predatory seabirds she had tried gnawing at some young seaweed washed up on the tideline but the heavy salt taste in the maidens dry swollen mouth caused her to spit it away swaying slightly she shielded her eyes from the hot orb of the sun and gazed about fresh water was nowhere to be had turning inland she made her weary way toward a large outcrop of sand dunes to the south some perverse dogged spirit drove the mousemaid onward though often she would be toppled over by the hot shifting sand of the dunes rolling downhill she would pick herself up wipe grit from her eyes and begin climbing again it was on top of one difficult dune she encountered the first sign of life that was not a seabird it was a small lizard eyes halfclosed basking in the heat the reptile did a sideways shuffle watching her warily the maiden tried several times to communicate managing only a croaking noise the lizards head weaved from side to side as it snapped badtemperedly at her you norra frog you make frognoise wharra you want the mousemaid managed to gasp out a single word water the small lizard moved its head up and down its throat pulsating water faraway you norra lizard you die soon never make it to drinkwater too far soon now they eat you she followed the creatures upward nod gulls were beginning to circle overhead the scavengers of the shore sensing when a living thing was becoming weaker and more defenseless the maid grasped the knotted rope and swung it calling at the sky in a hoarse voice im not finished yet youll see when she looked down the lizard had gone without a backward glance she descended the other side of the dune half stumbling half falling the foot of the dune was in shadow before her lay a sandy flatland dotted with scrub and coarse grass the little mousemaid rested awhile in the welcoming shade idly her paw sank into the sand as she leaned back suddenly she sat bolt upright the sand was firm and damp just beneath the surface realization that she was not on the seaward side of the dunes brought with it the shining hope of one precious thing water scrabbling dizzily her strength failing rapidly the maid began digging with all paws soon she was rewarded by darker damp sand her paws made a delicious scraping noise as she tossed sand out of the shallow hole digging with the urgency of desperation she was finally rewarded with one wet paw she sat sucking her paw as the moisture seeped through the ground into the hole forming a small muddy pool throwing herself flat the little mousemaid shoved her head into the hole and drank greedily disregarding the gritty sand and ooze as lifegiving water flowed down her throat new vitality surged through her gurgling with delight she lifted her head and found herself staring into the predatory eye of a gannet that had been sneaking up on her thwackl thwopl with eyeblurring speed she belted the knotted rope twice into the birds face it stumbled fell over sticklike legs buckling under it the mousemaid advanced swinging her weapon with battle light in her eyes and a clear angry voice come on what dyou want the water or me come on ill fight you you great featherbed the twirling knot struck the gannet a further three times before it managed to flop off into the air with a halfstunned squawk the little mousemaid felt the blood thrumming in her veins she tore up a nearby plant and shook it at the sky that goes for all of you ill kill the next one that comes after me dyou hear she found herself shouting at an empty evening sky the birds had gone in search of less ferocious prey inspecting the plant she had pulled from the ground she noticed that the root was attached to a fat white tuber without further hesitation she began munching upon it the tuber tasted good something like raw turnip evening gave way to night as the maid sat at the foot of the dune bathing the wound on her head with a corner of her burlap smock which she had soaked in water from her newfound well dabbing at the cut with one paw and devouring a root held in the other the mousemaid talked aloud to herself enjoying the sound of her own voice no name no memory no idea where i am ha i know ill call myself storm because it was the storm that brought me here yes storm i like that she held the rope up and twirled it and you are my faithful gullwhacker there weve both got new names now this is good ive got you the shade from my sandhill water and food storm settled down in the sand as the warm summer night closed in on her wish i knew who i really was though her voice sounded small and lonely amid the scrub and desolation a pale golden moon peeped over the dunes at the little mousemaid sleeping by the foot of the hill clutching a piece of knotted rope for all the world like some infant in slumber nursing a favorite toy the famous kitchens of redwall abbey were abustle with activity that night friar alder the thin lanky mouse in charge of it all added wild plumjuice to an enormous hazelnut crumble he had just pulled from the oven alder blew on a scorched paw complaining loudly not enough time thats all ive been given just not enough time who do they think i arn a magician less than three days hence and ive got to supervise a fullblown abbots midsummer jubilee berry tarts cream puddings twelve different kinds of breads cheeses and salads not to mention a surprise cake bagg and runn the otter twins followed alder waving their paws and repeating his every word in comic imitation breads cheeses and salads not to mention a surprise cake owch friar alder had turned quickly and dotted them both between the ears with a wooden spoon i told you not to mention a surprise cake now off you pop the pair of you go and help dandin and saxtus dandin and saxtus were being taught the art of woodland summercream puddingmaking by a charming little red squirrelmaid named treerose though they were paying far more attention to the pretty cook than to the recipe now to make woodland summercream pudding we need a deep earthenware bowl pass me that one please dandin and saxtus fought each other to grab the bowl and give it to treerose calmly she took it from them with a disarming smile great sillies you nearly broke it fighting like that right now pay attention first a thick coating of redcurrant jelly inside the bowl next roll out your sweet chestnut pastry very thin like this bagg runn stop eating those blackberries i need them for the pudding the twin otters bounded away to torment some other creature their mouths stained purple from the berries they caught a young bankvole named petunia and kissed her cheeks until she was covered in purple otterlip marks petunias mother grabbed them and set about them with a soggy dishcloth dandin and saxtus roared laughing but treerose merely pursed her mouth primly and reprimanded them theres nothing funny about those two ruffians watch me or youll never learn now make sure the sweet chestnut pastry is well bedded into the redcurrant jelly around the sides of the bowl then we coat the pastry with an extrathick layer of yellow primrose cream having done that we take the blackberries and starting from the bottom of the basin we place them on the cream pressing just lightly enough to make them stick to the cream teh tch you great clumsy fellows not like that youll burst the berries wipe your paws and watch me blushing furiously dandin and saxtus wiped their paws as the young charmer carried on efficiently now im going to coat these thick almond wafers with some light honeycream like so you see how easily they stick to the blackberries when i use them as the next layer there thats that all that remains now is for me to spoon the applecream into the center until the basin is full to finish off cover the whole thing with a short hazelnut pastry glazed with clear honey to give it a nice shiny crust open that bottom oven door please owch ooch yagh woop great silly mice use oven cloths to protect your paws out of the way ill see to it you two are as much use as moles up a tree dandin and saxtus sucked their scorched paws and stood watching red with embarrassment as treerose the perfect little miss efficiency swung the oven door wide popped the pudding inside and shut the door with a few deft movements mother mellus wandered over trimming the edges from a strawberry flan hello treerose how are the two star pupils doing clumsy as ducks on an iced pond mother mellus treerose turned and flounced off the badger ruffled the ears of the crestfallen mice never mind tell you what if you get me some cider from gabriel quill to bake my horse chestnuts in ill let you try one each the pair dashed off happily to the wine cellars mellus chuckled as she helped herself to a pawful of apple cheese and nut salad that sister sage was chopping poor old dandin and saxtus that young treerose is enough to turn any novices head and set him on his tail she does it all the time sister sage topped the salad off with crushed mint dressing yes i can remember a young mouse being like that about me when i was a snip of a mousemaid brother hubert would you believe mellus chuckled deeply what you mean old dusty drawers hubert surely not oh he was quite a handsome young dog at one time we studied together under sister verity she was a stern old stickler hubert shed say stop staring like a hungry owl at sage and get on with your work sister sage patted her rotund little waist that was when i fell out of love with hubert and into love with food ah well thats the salad whats next pears in custard with wild cherries mmmm my favorite oo in the wine cellars dandin and saxtus followed gabe quill his nephew durry carried the lantern for them as gabe pointed out some of his specialties see that liddle keg yonder aye that un well thats the best wild plum brandy ever fermented

foremole and his team had decided to make the biggest raspberry cream pudding ever seen in mossflower country alder threw his hat down and danced upon it flour raspberries honey and cream everywhere i cant stand it foremole ignored him but a fat mole named buxton waved a reassuring paw at the harassed alder burr doant you afroight yerself maister usns knows wot were about a young mole named danty

those moles are certainly teaching friar alder a thing or two bernard his kitchen will never be the same again indeed simeon excuse me a moment will you brother ash would you help those little mice to roll that great cheese theyre trying to move if it falls on one of them hell be flattened oh treerose i dont wish to interfere but is that a woodland summercream pudding i can smell beginning to burn in the ovens treerose had been bustling about efficiently attending to several things at once however she had forgotten the woodland summercream pudding she had put in the oven some time before panicfaced she dashed off to attend to it simeon nodded in admiration your sense of smell is getting better bernard thank you simeon but i had a double motive treerose is very pretty but far too efficient and snippy it will teach her that even the best of us can make mistakes also i would hate a woodland summercream pudding to be burnt in the ovens especially hers to tell the truth and i wouldnt tell her treerose does make the best woodland summercream ive ever tasted treerose arrived at the ovens grabbed up a cloth and swung the door wide my pudding its gone i smelled the crust edges just begin to scorch so i pulled it out for you she turned to see rufe brush standing by her pudding which was set on the big flat cooling slate rufe was a roughlooking squirrel not given overmuch to hanging about kitchens or joining the growing band of treeroses admirers he sniffed at the pudding before sauntering off looks all right to me treerose watched him go what a fine bushy tail wellpointed ears and powerful shoulders mother mellus banged a ladle upon a saucepan come on all you dibbuns bedtime now abbot bernard yawned i think ill join the dibbuns simeon me too bernard its been a long day and were getting no younger my friend ill just take a stroll first and check that all the outer gates are secured simeon the blind herbalist placed a paw on his friends shoulder right ill come with you no you wont i can sense your weariness besides what could you see in the dark that i could not feel ten times better day and night are alike to me you are right of course good night simeon good night bernard sleep well the abbot went off to his room knowing that shortly the kitchen fires would be damped for the night the cooks would retire and peace would settle over his beloved redwall abbey oo as gabool predicted the ship greenfang had crossed bows with darkqueen the huge black galley commanded by saltar upon hearing of the death of his brother bludrigg the corsair captain put about piling on sail and oars as he set course for terramort isle the whips cracked belowdecks as drivers flogged the galley slaves on to greater efforts the searat atop of the mizzenmast scoured the waves for sight of land below his claws the wide sails bellied out on the night breeze saltar stood in the bows putting a fine edge to his curved sword on an oilstone bleakeyed and grimfaced the searat muttered beneath his breath ill send you down where the fish will eat your flesh and the sea water rot your bones gabool the wild there was never any love lost between me and bludrigg but he was my brother and blood must be repaid with blood terramort rocks sighted off the starbd bow capn the lookout called down we can drop anchor in the cove afore dawn with this wind behind us saltar sheathed his sword and began polishing the needletip of his cruel gaff hook scowling at the dark lump on the horizon which marked the black forbidding rocks of gabools pirate kingdom ledder douse all lights when were close enough to harbor furl in all sails tell the crew to arm up and stand ready theres killin to be done tomorrow saltars first mate ledder went aft to carry out his orders with the hook swinging from a neck cord and his sword at his side saltar stood leaning on the forward rail he had never lost a fight or left an enemy alive gabool the wild might rule terramort and fort bladegirt but saltar had heard as had every other salty searat the story of how he was nearly bested by a mousemaid the corsair spat viciously over the side at the curving bow wave lord of all seas king of searats huh youll find out tomorrow gabool youll learn that saltar the corsair is no mousemaid oo in the banqueting hall of fort bladegirt gabool stood giving instructions to three fortslaves dormice who had been captured in a land raid stand on his shoulders you polish up round the top where the ring is you be still and dont put yer bare paws on the metal youll have pawmarks all over me bell of course you know what that means dont you doing his best to stand still and not to touch the bell the ragged slave called over his shoulder yes master pawmarks all over the bell mean whipmarks all over our backs gabool slouched down on his throne he picked idly at a dish of fruits crystallized in sugared honey and poured a goblet of wine thats right three lashes each for every pawmark if i were you id rip me shirt up and wrap it round me paws save yerself a lot of whipping the three slaves hurried to comply with the suggestion tearing up the pitiful remnants of tattered shirts and bandaging their paws with the strips a thin gray rat with a patch over one eye came running lord the darkqueerirs sails have been sighted where away to the north she should drop anchor here by dawn gabool stroked his beard thoughtfully good are the troops standin ready mate aye lord five score to board the darkqueen and sail her off once saltar and his crew step ashore fifty archers halfway up the cliff and a hundred more fully armed with pikes and spears to form his reception committee just as you ordered youve done well graypatch have a cup o wine and some of these sweetmeats with me dawn will soon be here graypatch pulled out a meanlooking dagger and tested its edge last dawn saltarll ever see eh lord aye he can go and visit his brother bludrigg at hellgates and you me old shipmate you can wear a velvet patch when youre captain of the darkqueen hey you polish harder put your skinny back into it yes master the unfortunate slave polished harder gabool laughed maybe youre hungry dyou like eating fish yes master i like eating fish gabool winked at graypatch as he called back to the dormouse slave well if you dont rub harder the fishll like eating you hahaha the thin bodies of the slaves shook and quivered with effort as they rubbed and polished at the great bell with all their might gabools jokes were not to be taken lightly gabool and graypatch took their wine and sweetmeats over to the window where they could watch the darkqueen sail in upon the tide graypatch watched the savage searat ruler and reflected as he sipped his wine that gabool was becoming more difficult to tread around they had been shiprats together since their young days gabool commanding graypatch obeying that was the way it had always been however for some time now graypatch had been looking more to his own ends when a searat king began murdering his captains on the slightest pretext times were becoming perilous now the patcheyed rat was sure of it gabool was drunk with his own power and had become dangerous anybeast could be slain at his whim but not graypatch offers of captaincy and velvet patches did not impress him such offers could easily turn into a blade between the ribs if gabool saw fit in his fertile brain graypatch began forming his own plans as he laughed and joked with his unpredictable companion while all the time the darkqueen rode the waves to terramort dawn broke mistily over the dunes promising another hot summer day the mousemaid storm awoke to find herself surrounded by toads during the night the well she had dug had filled up with water and all around storm the toads were closing in on her and the precious water she closed her eyes again feigning sleep her paw grasped gullwhacker the knotted rope as she watched them through partially closed eyes it was a dangerous situation many of the toads were armed with tridents she waited until a large male natterjack was practically standing over her before springing into action whop gullwhacker came down with such a resounding force upon the toads head that he was laid out senseless storm whirled the rope shouting aloud back off slimyskins or ill whack you into the middle of next season a huge overweight speckled toad hopped heavily forward flanked by two toughlooking young ones armed with the fearsome threepointed tridents the fat one blinked several times his throat bulging and quivering grroikl this is our land this is our water grrokk you are not allowed to stop here go now or die oykamon has spoken rrrebb storm was not about to go and she did not mince her words you can speak all you want fatface this is my land and my water this little bit right here i am called storm gullwhacker i come from the sea and im going nowhere but ill fight to stay here oykamon puffed himself up to full swell grriokk you are very insolent for a mouse krrrr we are too many for you if you fight you will die here grakk storm sprang forward with a yell swinging her rope the toads backed off slightly she laughed scornfully right then ill die here but ill take a few of you with me well come on froggies whos first or are you going to sit there clicking and grocking until i die of old age at a signal from oykamon the toads advanced storm dipped the knotted end of gullwhacker into the well water to make it heavier two toads sprang at her recklessly she jumped upon one knocking the wind completely out of him as she scored a bullseye on his companions snout with her weapon two more rushed from behind her storm thwacked at them wildly as she did one young toad ran in on her blind side and stabbed her footpaw with his trident maddened with pain she hurled herself upon him throttling with one paw and belaboring with the rope in the other now toads began hopping in on top of her their weight carrying her to the ground although she fought ferociously every bit of the way suddenly a cry rang from the dunetops eeeeuuulaliaaa there was a croak of alarm from the attackers followed by the pounding of swift paws in the next moment toads were flying through the air like birds as three hares attacked with lance butts teeth bared and eyes wide the three tall creatures moved with the practiced ease of natural fighters their long ears streaming out behind them as they skillfully kicked with big supple hindlegs each a sandycolored seasoned warrior brooking no nonsense from their flabby adversaries thudding thwacking and tossing with immense energy they drove the toads from storm belaboring and punishing without once using their lance points the hares defeated the toad band swiftly storm sat up nursing her wounded paw as the oldest of the hare trio strode lankily to the well good egg i say young un is this your water may i storm nodded dumbly the hare drank his fill spitting out the grit he pulled a wry face and made a leggy oldfashioned bow pshaw tastes pretty yucky dont it allow me to introduce us i am colonel clary family names meadowclary of course but you can call me clary everybeast does this young wag over here is none other than the celebrated brigadier thyme and the young gel is our ward the honorable rosemary hon rosie to you capital now pray tell me whom i have the honor of addressing marm though youre a bit young to be a marm arent you storm stood up favoring her uninjured footpaw she threw the rope across her shoulders squinting at the odd trio my names storm gullwhacker this is my gullwhacker dyou like it hmph brigadier thyme snorted through his stiffly waxed whiskers adequate for the purpose i suppose but theres nothing like a lance butt for dealing with toads young mouse you take it from me the toads had begun to regroup indignantly oykamon repuffed himself grrogg i will collect many more toads we will be as many as the sands of the shore then you will all die krrrrik hon rosie had an earsplitting laugh every creature present winced as she launched into it whooyahahahah fraid well be long gone by then you old frogwalloper sorry we cant stop around and be slain wot duty calls oykamon spat badtemperedly krroik go then death awaits you if you return to this place the other toads shuffled forward aggressively shaking their tridents colonel clary strode decisively forward he twirled his lancetip disarming the leading toad with a flick clarys eyes grew hard right pay attention you slimy rabble we are the long patrol from lord rawnblade of salamandastron nobeast stops us we range where we please and when carrying out orders if you take one more step forward we will use our lancetips not the blunt ends then you will really see death visit this spot back off now marshspawn you there leader chappie tell all ranks to retreat or youll be the first to have your gizzard decorated by lancepoint oykamon croaked out some sullen orders and the toads retreated hastily hon rosie turned to storm i say can you walk on that bally hoof storm tested her injured footpaw ill be all right where are we going somewhere you can get proper fodder n drink old gel you dont want to be hangin about this thumpin great wasteland twiddlin your paws brigadier thyme inspected the paw hmm not much wrong with that fetlock young mouse the

footpaw it felt very comfortable and easy thank you rosie it feels as good as new colonel clary had been pacing restlessly up and down he shielded his eyes and took some bearings from the sun good egg ladies got all the latest in shrubbery foot fashions sorted out now tophole then we can get going actually i was thinking of heading noreast into the woodland fringes we could have lunch there and visit old pakatugg what dyou say thyme hmmm yes why ever not best idea under present circs wot it took some time for storm to fall in with the hares mode of speech they seemed to treat everything in a very casual offpaw sort of way but they were usually correct in their judgments oo by early noon they had left the flatlands behind them the gritty expanses mottled with sparse vegetation shimmered in the summer heat with the dunes a hazy halfmirage in the distance more dunes stood out ahead pawsinking shifting sand dunes that were difficult to surmount topping one such sandhill they found themselves facing a fringe of pineclad woodland dark green and shady a haven from the glare of the midday sun brigadier thyme marked out a vast hornbeam and led them to it he held up a cautionary paw keep mum chaps old pakatuggs close i can feel it in m whiskers a pointed dart whistled past thymes ear burying itself in the hornbeam from somewhere close by a gruff angry voice rang out youre

impatiently oh come out you old buffoon you know its us listen ill even give you the bally password takatugg treefleet we bring you good things to eat there now come out you old barkwalloper storm had to bite her lip so as not to laugh at the odd creature who dropped down from a nearby spruce pakatugg treefleet was a fat old squirrel he carried a long hollow blowpipe and a pouch of darts sticking out of his ears wound about his tail and paws and covering all his body were leafy twigs he resembled a small moving bush with eyes huh landotters whatve you brought paka for lunch pakatugg growled fiercely through the two teeth remaining in his mouth brigadier thyme sniffed were not landotters were hares and if your manners dont improve laddie you wont be dining on oatscones and mountain cheese followed by berry n barley bake pakatugg nearly tore the knapsack from thymes back oatscones mountn cheese where hoho not so fast laddie buck take us to your hideout first we want to put the old nosebag on in comfort yknow pakatugg led them into the woodland to a small gurgling stream lilacs wildrose shrubs and trees overhung the spot turning it into a shady green grotto and the rocky outcrop which edged the stream was covered in soft moss gratefully they sat down the old squirrel went to fetch them water real son of the land old pakatugg colonel clary whispered to storm no harm in the blighter as long as you feed him and obey his silly little rules the chaps an absolute fanatic on secrecy passwords blindfolds secret signs the bally lot well see if he can get you to red wall storm

willowerb tea put the kettle on when i saw you comin a while back now out wi the grub landotters digging in their packs the trio turned out the promised repast together with some extra delicacies they had brought along storm could not recall when she had tasted a meal so delicious the hares sipped gratefully at the fragrant rosebay willowherb tea nibbling at this and that pakatugg however launched

bee to an ant it is we might as well have a rousin good snooze tomorrow we travel to salamandastron as for you young storm youre bound for a new life at jolly old redwall abbey what dyou think of that but no answer came from the young mouse she was curled up asleep on the moss in the green stillness with gullwhacker her rope weapon clutched tight in both paws dandin was composing songs for the abbots feast he sat in the shade of a great spreading oak trilling on his flute running through old songs tunes and ditties saxtus sat with him as did several of the moles and redwall creatures they joined in choruses of wellknown songs and called for dandin to sing some more the moles would not be satisfied until dandin rendered their particular favorite sing us ee song bout zur gonffen an ee gurt cake dandin dandin nodded and picked up his flute it was one of his own special ballads telling of how his ancestor gonff prince of mousethieves stole a cake baked by abbess germaine first mother of redwall abbey he trilled an introduction on gonffs own flute before launching into song it happened in the springing time when all the leaves were green and once again abbess germaine abaking cakes had been she stirred them good and mixed them fine with honey nuts and flour then put them out to cool awhile until the teatime hour but then along came bold sir gonff his eyes atwinkling bright a cake hed set his heart upon for suppertime that night he took the greatest cake of all from off the window ledge and hid it in a secret place close by the forest edge the abbess came to check her cakes about the midnoontide and found the mousethief with a bow and arrows at his side why stand you there o gonff said she with bow and arrows armed my good abbess the thief replied you must not be alarmed i saw an eagle steal your cake he swooped then flew away so i stand guard upon your cakes lest he returns today the abbess chose another cake which to sir gonff she gave take this reward young mouse she said because you were so brave and when upon each baking day my lovely cakes i make ill save a special one for you for your kind actions sake the moles fell about rolling on the grass with helpless merriment ahurr hurr hurr yon zur gonffen ee wurr a tricky un boi ecky ee wurr a villyun aroight a scrumpin ee gurt cake hohurrhurr come on there saxtus called to a mole named willyum what about a song from you willyum youre the champion mole singer arent you willyum heaved his tiny fat body up from the grass he needed no second bidding smoothing down his velvety coat and polishing his nose he clasped his huge digging paws in front of him and began singing in the traditional manner of the moles his voice a deep rusty bass surprising in one so small oi luvs a woodland stew oi do oi do loik apple tart an good october ale that foams is dear unto moi eart of rabsrry cream oi oft do dream et makes moi eyes to shine tis a fact that oi loiks anythin when oi sets daown to dine o mole mole daown thee ole doant youm eat none o mine else oi wont get a bite to ate when oi sets down to diiiiiiinnnnneeee he bowed and kissed his paws to the company as they applauded wrinkling his nose until his round black eyes were almost lost behind chubby cheeks turning to saxtus willyum returned the compliment now et be thoi turn to sing a song zurr sackuz saxtus waved his paws blushing modestly no no im the worst singer in the abbey my voice sounds like a mad owl with his beak trapped in a log dandin clapped his friend upon the back go on you dusty old bookworm youre as dry as brother hubert ah ive got an idea why dont you recite us a poem youve learned lots of them from those old books and parchments in the gatehouse go on saxtus have a go saxtus remained seated he shuffled and coughed nervously oh all right if you really must but im not too good at this sort of thing right here goes this is a rhyme i found on a scroll in the gatehouse some seasons ago im not sure what it means but i like the words saxtus summoned up his courage and began reciting the winds icy breath oer the land of death tells a tale of the yet to come cross the heaving waves which mark ships graves lies an island known to some where seas pound loud and rocks stand proud and blood flows free as water to the far northwest which knows no rest came a father and his daughter the mind was numb and the heart struck dumb when the night seas took the child hurled to her fate by a son of hellgate the dark one called the wild you whom they seek though you do not speak the legend is yet to be born one day you will sing over stones that are red in the misty summer dawn an eerie silence had fallen over the young creatures sitting beneath the oak in the sunlit midday grounds of the abbey saxtus fidgeted with embarrassment as they stared at him treerose the pretty squirrel was the first to break the silence well that was a silly nasty little rhyme i didnt like it one bit theres no story and no point to it what a load of old mumbo jumbo she shot off up the trunk of the oak showering them with leaves and twigs as she did to break the mood dandin began applauding loudly hurray well done saxtus very good the others joined in until they were interrupted by mother mellus come on young uns bring any of those dibbuns you can find along with you lunchtime come on its being served in the orchard turnip n mushroom flan with beetroot and scallions followed by honeysuckle sauce and acorn dumplings and i want to see clean paws before anybeast gets served as they washed their paws in a rain barrel by the abbeys south wall dandin questioned saxtus where in the name of fur did you learn that poem it was very strange told you didnt i it was on some dusty old scroll in the gatehouse i read it when brother hubert dozed off now the confounded thing seems to have burnt itself into my memory blind simeon joined the friends dipping his paws into the butt with them yes some things have a habit of doing that dont they still who knows they may come in useful through the seasons to come id be glad i remembered it if i were you young saxtus would you brother i certainly would there is much knowledge in ancient writings actually i was standing near the oak when you recited it you were right the words do have a certain ring to them oh and dandin would you like something to remember also yes please brother simeon what is it remember to leave some of those acorn dumplings for us old ones we cant make it to table as fast as you young uns dandin smiled as he winked at saxtus come on then brother hold our paws well lead you round to lunch and youll get as much as anybeast well see to it the two young friends led the blind herbalist off to the orchard astounded by his perception of their movements dandin why did you wink at saxtus when you said you would take me to lunch i meant nothing brother why do you ask because i remember a similar wink passing between those two little otter villains bagg and runn when they said they would assist me in to supper i ended up in the dusty old gatehouse while they dashed off and scoffed up all the oat muffins with clover butter but you wouldnt do a thing like that to me would you this time it was saxtus who winked at dandin we couldnt brother youre holding our paws far too tight earlier that same morn the darkqueen had nosed her bows into terramort cove as ledder gave the order a doublefluked anchor splashed into the clear water saltar the corsair came ashore with his crew they were fully armed but relaxed by the sight of the empty cove the searats were still wading through the shallows to the shingled beach when the rocks in front of them came alive with a hundred of gabools fighters armed with long spears and crosshilted pikes saltar cursed beneath his breath but showed no alarm standing with his crew kneedeep in the shallows he faced the bristling pikes boldly bilgerats whats all this about wheres gabool blaggtail the leader of the shore party shrugged in fort bladegirt he said youre to come up ledder waded up level with saltar drawing his scimitar and what if we choose not to blaggtail waved his pike twice in the air fifty archers stood up in the rocks above his head each one with a shaft notched to his taut bowstring gabool said to tell you he only wishes to be hospitable the sound of darkqueens anchor being hauled up caused saltar to turn around his worst suspicions were confirmed the ship was drifting gently out into open water graypatch and five score grinning searats lined the decks dont worry shipmate he called out to saltar in a mocking voice shell come to no harm well take her for a sail around the bay while youre jawin an chattin with gabool ledder made as if to hurl his sword at the sneering graypatch but saltar muttered in his ear stow it mate leave this to me saltar strode up the beach pushing blaggtails pike to one side as he went come on lets go and see what his high lordship wants the banqueting hall tables were piled high with food and drink gabool threw himself down in his throne at the head of the biggest table he was wearing no sword and smiling expansively hey you seascum here comes the best captain in me fleet and his brave crew sit down saltar old messmate and you me favorite waverobbers pull some chairs up and fill those bellies only the best for the best saltars crew fell to with a will splashing wine tearing meat grabbing and stuffing for all they were worth the king of searats indicated that saltar sit next to him the corsair did as he was bid one claw on his saber eating and drinking nothing gabool laughed aloud ripping a bite from a cooked fish and hurling it over his shoulder he quaffed wine slopping it over the table haharr nought like good food and wine eh saltar i suppose you heard about your brother bludrigg no what about my brother bludrigg saltar lied with a straight face gabool tore a roasted seabird apart in his claws burying his face into the carcass as he gnawed through it and came up grinning had to kill im whipped his head off with me sword saltars expression never altered a flicker what for gabool wiped his greasy claws in his beard dis obedience bein too greedy wantin to take my place as king had to kill im swish that was that old bludrigg lost his head gabool and saltars eyes met betraying nothing but each waiting for the right moment saltar toyed with a goblet of wine was he armed when you killed him no he was tryin a crown on for size haharr slowly saltar stood up his claw grasping the curved sword at his side ive heard youre very good at killin unarmed beasts how about trying one whos got a weapon gabools claw began reaching for a sword hidden beneath the table give us a chance matey you can see im not carryin a sword look now it was saltars turn to laugh hoho then hurry and get yourself one king of searats although i heard that even armed with a sword you were beaten by a little mousemaid gabool sent the table toppling as he kicked it and freed his swordblade his face a mask of ugliness and cruelty as he launched himself forward thats a lie a blackhearted lie and youll die for it saltar automatically the searats stood back this was not only a battle to the death between two famous fighters it was also a contest to decide kingship gabool the wild slashed viciously at saltar the corsair dodged nimbly to one side swinging his sword in one claw as he wound the cord of the steel hook round his other and beckoned with it insulting and taunting in the manner of searats to goad his victim into a false move my brother couldve taken you with a cooking ladle coward gabool circled the light glinting off his golden emeraldstudded fangs im goin to hang you by your hook and let the gulls rip out your lyin tongue crabsbait suddenly they clashed sword ringing upon sword saltars hook ripped through gabools cloak pulling him inward quick as a flash gabool cut his cloak loose with one of the daggers from his waist sash staggering back as saltars clanging blade drove him down the hall youll die screaming gabool ill make you call me king before i put you out of your misery smiling inwardly gabool allowed saltars onslaught to press him backward down the hall though outwardly the warlords expression was grim and he acted as though he were hardpressed panting parrying and dodging the cleaving blade and pointed hooktip this gave saltar the feeling that he had gained the upper claw not as easy as fighting my unarmed brother eh your majesty he taunted gabool but no matter saltar the corsair isnt a mousemaid ill finish the job properly so that when youre hacked to dollrags youll know it was me who did it stumbling over footstools bumping into tables reeling off walls gabool seemed to blunder backward saltars sword threatening to spit him at each thrust the flailing hook coming to within a hairsbreadth of his throat now the king of searats was down on one knee a short distance from the hanging wall curtain saltar smashed mercilessly downward at him gabools sword held sideways deflecting the blows seemed to quaver for one desperate moment a gasp arose from the piratical assembly suddenly gabool fell rolled over and leaping high snatched a walltorch from its brackets he regained his stance on the other side of saltar like lightning the corsair turned aaaaiiieeee gabool struck saltar with the blazing torch driving him backward into the hidden blade behind the wall hanging the trap worked efficiently saltar died instantly an expression of pained surprise stamped indelibly upon his brutal features silence fell over the banqueting hall gabool spat carelessly at the impaled carcass of his onetime enemy turning on his heel he sprang up on the largest dining table scattering cups food plates and drink with a series of resounding smashes the warlord turned upon the gathering of searats gabools eyes blazed his rings and bracelets jangled the gold emeraldstudded teeth showed in a ferocious grin through his matted and beribboned beard pointing to all corners of the hall with his curving sword he roared at the top of his lungs i am gabool the wild king of all searats who am i you carrion of the water speak my name you vermin of the main swords daggers spears and pikes waved in the air there was not one in all the crowd who dared not shout out aloud gabool the wild king of all searats a pounding upon the hall doors echoed in the silence which followed blaggtail threw the doors open to reveal one of the darkqueens prize crew shornear wounded and halfdrowned he staggered in collapsing in an exhausted heap upon the floor raising himself on one claw he pointed out of the window lord graypatch has sailed off with the darkqueen gabool came off the table like a springing panther seizing the wretched shornear he hoisted him to his paws what how did this happen lord he had it all planned with the others i would not go along with his wishes so i was thrown overboard graypatch my faithful old shipmate why would he do this to me he said that you were too dangerous too wild and treacherous graypatch said to us all that anyrat who followed him would at least be able to sleep at night without fearing a knife in his back he said that you were death to any creature your shadow fell upon friend and enemy alike i heard him say that he would take his crew to a place of safety where none could follow gabool absently let shornear drop to the floor well well who would have thought it eh me old messmate graypatch the one searat i thought i could trust turned traitor on me the darkqueen was my best ship blaggtail is there any more of my fleet anchored around the coves blaggtail scratched his chin nightwake and seatalon are beached in the north cove lord they both need careening and recaulking crabdaw too but she was holed and lost her rudder on the rocks none of them are seaworthy gabool scowled where are the rest of my ships waveblade blacksail rathelm and greenfang are all on the high seas lord but they should be back by the next full moon the warlord banged the table to emphasize each of his words as soon as they come in turn em round and get em out to sea again i want the darkqueen back i want to see her heading into terramort cove with graypatchs head stuck on the bowsprit and his crew in chains whoever does this for me will be made seacaptain of all me fleet next only in rank to me immediately three rats sprang forward gabool hailed them riptung catseyes grimtooth pick yourself a crew each get those three craft in north cove shipshape again i want them seaworthy two days from now take my houseslaves and chain em up as your oarcrews in the galleys i will hunt graypatch down do you hear me my fleet will track him across the main from tidesend to hellwaters there will be no place on land or sea where he will hide from the wrath of gabool now go just over half a day of being tugged about blindfolded by the illtempered pakatugg was quite enough for storm she had been scratched by nettles poked by branches and bumped by trees when finally the recluse squirrel called a halt for lunch they sat down beneath a widetrunked sycamore which had pushed itself a fair living space in the dense forest storm unbound gullwhacker from where pakatugg had placed it about her eyes hoi get that blinfold back on right now dyou hear the mousemaid blinked and rubbed her eyes at the shafting sunlight of the green woodland aisles oh go and boil your tail squirrel how do you expect me to eat lunch with a rope round my eyes pakatugg pulled food and drink from his knapsack and sniffed leave it off then but only for mealtimes and dont be gazin all round tryin t get a fix on your bearins eh storm saw that the hares had left a small stone medallion threaded about her neck as she slept it bore a badgers head and a flatpeaked mountain insignia she looked up countering the squirrels remark huh who wants to see your silly old forest its not yours anyhow itd take more than a squirrel dressed as a tree to rule all this whats for lunch pakatugg sat on the rucksack clutching the oatscones and flask he had taken from it well im havin these oatcakes and a sup o this though i dont know what youre dinin on i only said id take you t redwall never said id feed you as well that werent part o the bargain storm could not believe her ears she watched pakatugg smugly munching away at a scone id share half of anything i had with a hungry creature you you greedy branchbound old miser right thats it ive tooken enough cheek from you mouse shut your mouth an get yon blinfold back on right now storm tried hard to keep her voice level no im not going blindfolded and hungry for you or anybeast swiftly pakatugg leaped up and fitted a dart to his blowpipe gotcha now missie do as i bid or ill deaden your paw fer a season wi this dart as storm stood up and reached for her rope the squirrel fired she threw herself sideways hearing the thud as a sharp dart buried itself deep in the bark of a nearby pine launching herself forward the mousemaid thwacked out with her gullwhacker the blowpipe was knocked from pakatuggs mouth he sat down hard his eyes watering copiously as he clutched the end of his nose where the knotted rope had belted him storm stood over him the light of battle in her eyes first you blindfold me then you starve me now you try to wound me sit still and dont make a move squirrel i dont trust you anymore hungrily munching alternate bites from an apple and a scone she watched the squirrel applying a leaf poultice to his swollen snout he was muttering fiercely huh me pakatugg lettin a slip of a mouse break me nose storm shook her weapon grimly listen squirrel im no slip of a mouse im storm gullwhacker so dont think you can bully and trick a creature smaller than yourself ive split this food into two equal halves you can go where you want and take yours with you ill find redwall abbey on my own without having to protect my back against you grumpily pakatugg stuffed half of the provisions into his knapsack he hurried off down the dim trail yelling back derisively yah im glad you did that you liddle fool youll never find redwall alone youll die in this forest wiout pakatugg to guide you storm saw the slight humor of the situation aye and id never have reached redwall being blinded starved and wounded she called back on your way you nasty old fleabag the mousemaid ate a leisurely meal and rested awhile before packing the remainder of her provisions and setting off to find redwall alone there was no trace of pakatugg nor any living creature just the still green summer forest storm tossed her gullwhacker high in the air it landed with the knotted end pointing in the opposite direction to that taken by the squirrel trusting to luck she strode off in the direction the knot had pointed the afternoon wore on hardly a breeze stirred the leafy canopy overhead as the tiny figure trekked resolutely through the maze of tree bush and fern noting from time to time the position of the sun which she tried always to keep at her back knowing that if it set in the west she must be traveling east to restore her confidence in the enveloping silence storm tried to hum odd snatches of songs but she could not remember any with a careless shrug she pushed on the soft swish of her paws through grass and occasional birdsong the only sound that fell upon her ears once she came on a small stream the mousemaid drank and bathed her paws wondering what redwall would look like if ever she was fortunate enough to find it shades of evening turned the forest to a gloomy blackgreen vault as storm plodded on not sure whether she was going in the direction of her goal or traveling in circles gradually every tree leaf and bush began to look the same night closed in on the forest and the mousemaid lost her way completely she strayed from the dim trail and into impenetrable shrouds of wood and vegetation storm kept her confidence up by telling herself that being lost in a wood was better than being lost at sea but the surrounding night and oppressive silence sat heavily upon her spirit she fervently wished that it was daylight or that she could meet another living creature sitting despondently at the foot of an elm she sipped mintwater from a flask ate some white cheese studded with dark roast acorns and decided to await the dawn then she saw the light faintly at first like an elusive willothewisp faraway amid the trees swiftly and silently storm made her way toward it still some distance away she could tell it was a campfire of some sort there was music too some creature was playing a stringed instrument and singing a song in a raucous voice if i were a stone id lie alone amid the earth and clayo til some good beastie picked me up and threw me farawayo lolly too diddle um rinky doo skiddle dum theres bread n cheese n cider said the hedgehog maid who sat to supper but now tis all inside er it was a funnylooking hare dressed in jesters attire half green half yellow he sat by a small campfire tinkling a curious stringed instrument storm decided there was no use beating about the bush she had already met some hares who were friendly boldly she strode in and sat down on the opposite side of the fire the hare winked at her and continued now my grandpa he was by far a dreadful fat old liar its cold in the river tonight he said as he sat upon the fire til my old grandma came along and hit him with the ladle theres another egg been cracked she laughed as she set him on the table doodle oo lolly turn tiddly oodly iddly um i loved a rabbits daughter and she fed me on pots of tea made out of boiling water storm laughed at the odd creature and his comical ditty he twitched his floppy ears now then young mouse me gel what can we do for you storm shrugged not a lot sir im lost you see perhaps i could rest by your fire until dawn the hare shook his head sadly lost i knew a woodpecker once who got lost oh im sorry did you find him again find him of course i found the blighter thats how he came to get lost in the first place who lost you or better still who do you want to be found by nobody lost me and im looking for redwall abbey so how could

instrument ah so thats what its called a harolina what a nice instrument ive never seen one before never seen a blinkin harolina corks no wonder youre lost i say is that a long patrol medal you happen t be wearing this oh yes it was given to me by colonel clary brigadier thyme and hon rosie before storm could say any more a dreamy look crossed the jester hares face making him look extra foolish egads hon rosie the honorable rosemary exquisite creature completely adorable gel doncha know did she mention my name by the way i dont know what is your name tarquin l woodsorrel though she may have called me tarkers or jolly old tark she did mention me didnt she you wouldnt kid a chap would you go on say she did storm saw that the poor fellow was so agitated that she had to lie a bit oh tarkers yes she did nothing but talk about you good egg i knew it go on go on whatd she say er let me see she said you were very handsome a fine singer and a wonderful player and she wished you were on patrol with her tarquin l woodsorrel fell flat on his back kicking his long legs ecstatically into the air absolutelyballyspiffinhunkydory whoohoo storm coughed politely does this mean youll take me to redwall abbey mr woodsorrel abbwall reddymouse course i will you can call me tarquin ill call you early dyknow i couldnt eat a thing right now rosie ah rosie i could live on that sweet name the rest of my life without eating storm curled up by the fire yawning loudly she did not fancy an entire night listening to a lovelorn hare singing the praises of his beloved oh well id best get some sleep by the way my names storm gullwhacker this rope is my weapon actually the ropes called gullwhacker sleep was some time coming to the mousemaid as she had to lie there listening to tarquin composing dreadful love songs and plunking odd chords on his harolina o rosie the hon youre certainly the one ill bet my bally life with your cute little nosie beautiful rosie youd make a lovely wife hmm lessee now what rhymes with wife strife knife life thats it the fire burned to white ash and red embers in the deep nighttime forest almost an hour before he was usually up and about abbot bernard was wakened by the first rays of dawn and a loud knocking on his bedroom door hastily stowing his nightcap beneath the pillows he rubbed sleep from his eyes and tried to look as dignified as a redwall abbot should ahem the doors open come right in please bagg and runn entered bearing a tray between them good mornin father habbot an a happy jubilee to you sir the abbot hid a smile as he propped himself into a sitting position and good morning to you young otters id completely forgotten about my jubilee its a good job you reminded me now whats all this its your breakfast father meadowsweet and sage tea aye and arrowroot curd with strawberries and barleytoast spreaded with honey some hot blackberry muffins too and cold willowcake and greengage jam the abbot held up his paws oh my goodness how will i get through it all its far too much for me ill just have the meadowsweet tea for now how kind and thoughtful of you ill bet you havent had your own breakfast yet how about you two helping me to finish all this it was no sooner a word than a bite with two hungry young otters bagg and runn sat on the bed as morning sunlight filled the room doing full justice to the good breakfast they had prepared while showing the abbot a barkpaper card they had made for him see theres you father standing on the lawn by the pond oh yes what a good likeness and thats a splendid tree im standing by thats not a tree its mother mellus cant you see her stripes of course i thought this one over here was mother mellus no thats simeon looking for herbs and this one is gabe quill rolling out a barrel of october ale for your feast why so it is well done indeed oo the morning blossomed into sunlight fullness redwall abbey stirred itself into life lazy blue smoke from its kitchen chimneys drifting toward the woods where it tangled gently to blend in with tendrils of white mist hanging in the trees preparations were well under way flower garlands decked the long tables set out in the orchard creatures from the outlying woodlands and fields began arriving bringing gifts food and their families with them brother hubert stationed dandin and saxtus on the ramparts over the gatehouse do a slow patrol of the walls if you see any creatures coming in who might need assistance then run down and help them both young mice nodded importantly proud to be helping in such an adult way they puffed out their chests frowned intently and with swinging paws set out on tour of the high ramparts around the outer abbey walls oo friar alder put the finishing touch to his great masterpiece knowing the abbots taste for the savory rather than the sweet he had concocted an invention of his own bernard bread it was a vast loaf of wheatandoat bread almost the size of a grown badger alder opened the big oven doors as he called to his assistant cockleburr lend a paw here cockles the abbots surprise is almost done a small hedgehog came running stumbling and tripping over a

mlad oo the excitement of events to come increased with the advance of late afternoon a pleasant breeze ruffled the grass taking the edge off the intense summer heat the young redwallers and woodland creatures joined by some of the more active elders began an impromptu sports day in the abbey grounds dandin and saxtus however stayed faithfully patrolling the walltops peering over battlements scanning woodland path and flatland highly conscious of their responsible position several times that day they had unbarred the main gates to assist with carrying babies helping the old ones and other useful tasks now they rested awhile together on the northern corner of the west wall watching their companions at play haha look at bagg and runn trust two otters to win the threelegged race what a pair of scallywags eh dandin dandin had turned he was shielding his eyes gazing up the path to the north here look at this saxtus theres two creatures coming toward the abbey dyou know them saxtus peered at the odd pair of figures dogtrotting along the dusty path hmm cant say ive ever seen them before looks like a hare and a mouse dressed as a ragbag go and tell mother mellus will you saxtus ill stand by with the gate open shell probly want to speak with them oo trudging silently along beside tarquin the mousemaid had her first view of redwall abbey she liked what she saw with the dusty brown path running across its front the late afternoon sunlight played over the structure giving it a faded rosy glow behind the stout outer wall with its battlements and ramparts she could see the high spired abbey roof flanked by lower sloping ones peaceful and serene standing homely and solid with the summer green forest at its back redwall now she knew why creatures talked of it with a reverence it appeared to blend with the surrounding mossflower country as a haven of rest and tranquillity in harmony with all nature like some gentle giant of a mother sheltering and protecting her children the badger and the two young mice stood out upon the path as tarquin and storm walked up mother mellus and the hare clasped paws well well tarquin longleap woodsorrel you old bounder stap me vitals mellus are you still alive and growlin you old stripedog saxtus and dandin stood watching as the twro old friends greeted each other dandin eyed the ragged mousemaid she stood by swinging a thick knotted length of rope unconcerned by her filthy appearance or the seascoured sandworn foresttorn loose burlap sacking dress she wore the maid stared boldly back at dandin as badger and hare conversed so how goes it at salamandastron who rules there now oh the old fire mountains still there yknow strong as ever the lord badger there is rawnblade biggest dog badger youve ever set eyes upon

young friend the mousemaid stepped up and spoke for herself im storm gullwhacker this is my weapon the gullwhacker mellus nodded courteously hiding her amusement at the newcomers confident and forthright manner welcome to redwall abbey storm gullwhacker perhaps youd like to be shown around our home dandin saxtus take this young mousemaid inside and see if you can get her some decent clothing and a bath oo while mellus and tarquin continued their conversation in the open gateway dandin and saxtus walked inside accompanied by storm saxtus noticed some of the young ones staring openmouthed at storm er i say storm wed best go and find sister sage shell get you cleaned up and dressed nicely storm swung gullwhacker deftly flicking the head off a daisy nobodys washin an dressin me up mouse im all right as i am saxtus disagreed no no you must do as mother mellus says dandin saw something in the mousemaids face something which reminded him of himself he turned to saxtus leave storm alone friend if she says shes all right then she is let her be as they strolled through the grounds together young red wallers sported and cavorted everywhere storm watched them with amusement in her eyes what are they doing dandin theyre playing its a sort of sports day sports day playing whats that mean saxtus was about to explain when a twinetied leafball rolled in front of them a baby hedgehog came chasing it storm picked up the ball is this something for playing the little hedgehog stood smiling at her with all the innocence of a dibbun gorra see how high you cn frow it storm spun the ball in her paw how high i can throw it lets see she tossed the ball into the air as it came down she swung with the knotted end of gullwhacker it struck the ball spot on sending it soaring into the sky until it was a mere dot dandin saxtus and the dibbun hedgehog gasped in admiration storm smiled good i like playing whattl we play next yeek some distance away treerose was struck on the back by the falling ball rufe brush came sauntering over whats the matter squirrel treerose was furious she grabbed the ball and came marching over to where the three mice stood holding the ball out she chattered fiercely who did that come on own up storm did not realize the ball had struck treerose she stood forward grinning cheerfully and nodded at the squirrel in a friendly way i hit the ball high its called playing dyou want to play treerose went red with temper you dirty filthy little ragamuffin ill teach you a lesson swiftly she lashed out scratching the side of storms face with her sharp little dewclaws before anybeast could stop her storm whacked the knotted rope squarely between treeroses ears the squirrel sat flat on her tail in the dust tears pouring from her eyes storm was perplexed she rubbed her cheek as she turned to saxtus whats the matter with her what did she scratch me for treerose saw rufe brush watching and set up a wail waah she hit me what are you going to do

mousemaid took a step backward keep your paws off me ygreat stripy lump or ill gullwhack you youll what storm swung the gullwhacker you heard me badger now back off mother mellus looked over storms shoulder she smiled and curtsied good afternoon father abbot storm turned to see who the badger was addressing mellus pounced the mousemaid was pinioned by two large badger paws the rope dangling uselessly at her side as mother mellus whispered in her ear gotcha missy now lets see if soap and water and a dress will civilize you you little savage saxtus and dandin fell about laughing as mother mellus carried off a kicking yelling storm yah lemmego paws off you great lump of an abbeydog fight fair like a warrior you big stripy trickster lemmego yaaaaaahhhh grrr tarquin joined them tinkling away on his harolina oh corks old mellus has her work cut out there no mistake well then you chaps dandin and saxtus isnt it allow me to introduce myself tarquin l woodsorrel at yservice i remember redwall abbey quite fondly yknow of course i was only a little sprog last time i was here dyknow i think a chap could do a lot worse than stop here an become the jolly old resident hare wot the two young mice immediately took to the garrulous tarquin dandin especially admired the harolina and the skillful way the hare played it thats a beautiful instrument mr tarquin i play the flute see this is a whistle that belonged to my ancestor do you know frog in the rushes or otter hornpipe i like fieldmouse frolic myself in a very short while young redwallers had gathered round dandin and tarquin clapping their paws hopping and dancing as the pair played merrily complementing each other with instrumental harmonies oo tarquins words proved true storm was no easy mousemaid to deal with as mother mellus sister sage and sister serena soon found out garrr sputch gerrat soap out of me face you murderers mellus held storm firmly by the scruff of her neck as she kicked and lashed about in the tub sage and serena battled gallantly with soap and loofah as bathwater splashed and sprayed all over them and the infirmary floor mellus ducked storms head under the warm sudsy water hauling her up for sister sage to scrub away at the mousemaids neck good golly you could grow a crop in the muck were getting off you missy here give me the soap serena go and get another bucket of water arragh this is worsen bein drowned at sea grrrmmmfff lemmego be still you young rip im soaked to the hide here keep her away from that gullwhacky rope thing sage or shell cause havoc whooshplut just lemme get me paws on my rope ill show you three torturers slipping and sploshing the three battled furiously with slippery storm oo abbot bernard and simeon passed the infirmary door on their way to cavern hole my stars simeon it sounds like a fully fledged massacre in there well guessed bernard youre not far wrong still who knows young storm gullwhacker may prove a clean and valuable member of our little community yes clean at least when mellus sage and serena have finished with her what about the other one the hare oh you mean tarquin hes to be our first resident hare he brought a scroll with him from lord rawnblade the master of salamandastron here ill read it to you it says to abbot bernard of redwall from rawnblade protector of the shores it comes to my mind that the ties between your abbey and my mountain should be strengthened therefore i send this hare tarquin l woodsorrel to you he is frivolous a glutton lovesick and prone to composing dreadful ballads added to this he has an odd sense of humor a strange idea of dress and is disruptive with other hares be that as it may he is a fearless fighter an excellent scout and totally honest i hope you will find his services satisfactory give my good wishes to mellus and all the good creatures at redwall may the seasons be kind and bring you peace with long prosperity rawnblade widestripe lord of salamandastron there what dyou think of that for a reference simeon the blind herbalist gathered up his habit for the stairs ahead at least rawnblade is truthful the hare has his faults but he also has good features the badger lord would not send him to us if there was not something in his clever mind maybe he fears the approach of trouble and has decided that we need a link with salamandastron i like the sound of this tarquin l woodsorrel maybe rawnblades loss will turn out to be redwalls gain i hope you are right my friend your intuition has never let us down oo early evening found storm gullwhacker being propelled forcibly out of the main abbey doors to mingle with the other young creatures of redwall she fought halfheartedly as mellus shooed her out there now go and play my my you look very pretty now storm pretty whats that supposed to mean i feel stupid with this dress on and half the hide scrubbed from me couldnt i wear my old burlap smock please what that scruffy old thing certainly not child i told sister sage to burn it wheres my gullwhacker you havent burnt that too have you no dont worry storm we gave it a good scrub in what was left of your bathwater and its hanging out of the infirmary windowr to dry you can have it back tomorrow now play outside with the young ones but dont get yourself all messed up again its nearly time for the abbots feast dandin could hardly believe his eyes was this pretty mousemaid in the light green linen habit the frowsylooking terror he had encountered earlier that day it seemed hardly possible he held out his paw to her come on storm ill take you round to the orchard you can sit between me and saxtus at the abbots jubilee feast tonight whats an abbots jubilee feast listen do you like singing dancing and as much of the very best food and drink as you can swallow yes is that what its all about youll soon find out come on lets run theres durry quill well race him the two young mice dashed off across the lengthening shadows of the abbey lawn as the birds trilled their evensong to the setting sun rawnblade widestripes massive form dwarfed the hares who stood in front of him the blood of many salamandastron badger lords flowed in his veins and he seemed to fit perfectly into the vast rocky hall of the mountain seated on his throne with the huge broadsword verminfate resting lightly in his hefty paw the wise brown eyes partially closed as he digested the information from the returning hares of his long patrols torches flickered in rockwall sconces of the roughly hewn hall blending with dying rays of the sun as its fiery orb sank into the western seaward horizon silence would follow each report until rawnblade questioned his scouts so you sent this mousemaid storm gullwhacker with pakatugg to redwall a wise move clary they may cross trails with tarquin woodsorrel the abbey will be a good place for them both what news of my bell shorebuck none lord a sandyhued hare leaning upon his spear replied no creature we spoke with knows where the great bell may be rawnblade sighed resting his chin on the sword handle hmmm three seasons late and nobeast knows the whereabouts of joseph or the bell searats have the answer i know it only time will tell fleetleg any more about the ship from the northwest a tall saturnine hare stood forward we sighted her earlier this evening lord she was sailing too far off to be certain but longeyes says that it could be the darkqueen rawnblade sat up straight are you sure of this longeyes the hare called longeyes lounged at the window scanning the horizon he turned to address rawnblade im practically certain lord my eyes see farther than others it looked to me like darkqueen no other ship in gabools fleet has red sails if she had cut in closer to land i would have been able to tell you more but she tacked off windward and traveled north by east did you see who was at the helm it was not saltar lord of that im sure i didnt get much of a glimpse but id guess by his build it was the one called graypatch graypatch hes gabools best steersrat it could mean that gabool has left his island darkqueen is the only ship he would sail in if he did brigadeer thyme ventured an opinion mlord if old gabool has taken to sailin again there could be trouble rawnblade arose he strode across to the window where he stood gazing at the restless sea ebbing and flowing eternally the prophecies carved on salamandastrons walls tell of a time coming soon when trouble will become a byword my destiny and trouble walk the same path paw in paw eat and sleep now my faithful patrols our fortunes and fates are written in these rocks leave the worrying and wondering to the waves and clouds oo a night mist had fallen when graypatch anchored offshore a longboat was lowered to take the reconnais sance crew ashore graypatch stayed aboard with frink his lookout always watching north and west for signs of gabool in pursuit graypatch called down to deadglim his bosun see if you can find a likely spot mate fresh water and cover in plenty deadglim took the scimitar from between his teeth long enough to answer leave it t me skipper ive got a nose for likely coves oo mistshrouded moonless night enveloped deadglim as he led the shore party forward into the dunes he peered into the darkness not much ereabouts lads nought but sandhills here gurd gerrup on yer paws time fer sleepin when were back aboard darkqueen gurd gurd lay still unable to answer because of the toad trident lodged in his throat immediately a score of tridents descended amid the unsuspecting searats the screams of two wounded pierced the still night deadglim waved his scimitar yelling at the silent dunes come out an fight show yerselves you creepin bilgewashers suddenly the dunes echoed to thunderous croaking as countless toads hopped out armed with tridents deadglim knew his challenge had been a foolish one throwing valor to the winds he took to his paws shouting retreat retreat back to the longboat oo from the ships rail graypatch and deadglim could see the tideline teeming with tridentwaving natterjacks deadglim shuddered capn if anybeast ever tells you a toad is slow dont believe it we barely made it t the longboat ahead of those slimy devils there must be thousands of the croakin scum graypatch turned from the rail set another course nor an east fishgill well try our luck farther up the coast jump to it now you swab i dont want gabool hovin over the briny at our wake gabool the wild could not sleep he paced around and around the bell chopping at midair with his sword relating his thoughts to the brazen prize graypatchll curse the day he was spawned when i catch up with him ill boil his skull an bring it here for you to see my beauty see if i dont haharr first bludrigg an then his mizzuble brother saltar corsair huh hes nothin but fishbait now like the other two the scratchy liddle mousemaid an her dear daddy joseph haharr hes the one that made you isnt he gone to fishbait for his foolishness bongggggl gabool jumped back with a yell then he ran around the bell in a wide circle searching and seeking but there was nobeast in the room save for himself gradually he became calm haharr twas only the wind playin tricks striding back to the bell he stroked it fondly belay so what if yer do talk you can tell old gabool all your secrets the bell remained silent the king of searats gazed up with narrowed eyes at the figures embossed around the top of the bellskirt hellsteeth what do it all mean tell me whats all those pretty liddle pictures mice badgers rats ships an all manner othings you tell me im your master now speak dyou hear me speak but the bell remained still and voiceless an inanimate metal object gabools wild temper rose he spat upon the bell and kicked it still no sound came forth in high bad mood he strode from the room turning in the doorway and brandishing his sword at the great bell hell n gullbait youll talk to me afore im done with yer he slammed the door furiously and strode off to his bedchamber behind him in the empty room the bell tolled one booming knell gabools nerve deserted him he cut and ran leaping into bed he threw the covers over his head and lay there shivering cxo sleep was a long time coming to gabool the wild but when it did he wished that he had stayed awake badgers mice searats and spectral ships sailing upon phantom waves pursued him down the corridors of his restless imagination the figures around the bell had come to life to torment him throughout the long dark night oo lord rawnblade too was sleeping his vast form lay sprawled upon the bed near his armorers forge in salamandastron mountain the sword verminfate lay upon the bed close to paw as it always was in his dream the badger lord found he was looking at the bell that he had commissioned joseph the bellmaker to cast for him it was beautiful just as he had imagined it would be shining with a dull sheen graven round top and bottom with the poem and the mysterious pictures which only badger lords could interpret now a shape was materializing through the burnished curve of the bell metal his archenemy gabool the wild curving sword in claw the searat king advanced ornaments jangling golden emeraldstudded teeth glinting in a fiendish smile rawnblades reaction even in sleep was instantaneous he seized his broadsword and leaped from the bed striking out with savage force clangggggl er i say mlord old chap are you all right colonel clary was at his side rawnblade came fully awake rubbing his eyes with one paw he gazed down at the sword in the other what er oh yes thank you clary it was merely a dream my aunts kittens that must have been rather a jolly dream mlud look what you did to that shield rawnblade stared at the shield which had been in the way of his swordswing the thick metal plate had been sheared in half it lay on the floor completely severed absentmindedly the badger lord tested the unmarked blade of verminfate no alarm old friend go back to your rest it was only a dream a dream eh something out of the past perhaps rawnblade lay back on the bed and held the formidable blade tightly no this was something from the future i know it oo gabriel quill stood up amid the tables and multicolored lanterns that graced the orchard he held a tankard of best october ale high and cried righto everybeast lets give a real redwall toast to our abbot every creature stood raising bowls beakers tankards cups and flagons the soft summer night echoed as the multitude called aloud in one voice abbot bernard father of redwall abbey hurraaaaaaah saxtus sat down with a groan holding his middle whoof shouldnt be yelling like that on an overfull stomach tarquin scoffed as he relieved saxtus of his plate emptying the forest trifle strawberry flan pear gateau and hazelnut cream junket into his own oversized wooden bowl he grabbed a spoon and tucked in haw haw whats the matter laddie buck little turn too full is it scrumff old tarkerstl show you how to navigate yer way round a bowl of tucker mmm i say any more of that summercream pudden stuff left grubb the dibbun mole replied as he nodded sleepily forward toward an overheaped plate of woodland sum mercream pudding burr baint no more pudden zur oi snaffled ee last o it snurr buxton and willyum mole immediately left off eating huge portions of steaming bernard bread and dug into either side of grubbs plate eating furiously as the baby moles sleepy head drooped nearer the pudding ho save the choild urry up an scoff quick now

drowned in a plate of pudden do not worry young sire help is at spoon ill save you gromff storm tried to stop spluttering gabe quills giggly buttercup n honey cordial across the table she shook with unbridled laughter at the antics of tarquin and the two moles rescuing the dozing grubb the mousemaid had never been so happy in any of the life she could remember the food the delicious drinks the food the kind abbey creatures the food the good friends about her and of course the food never had she tasted such marvelous things alternating between bernard bread blackcurrant pie summer salad cheese n nut flan mintcream cakes and honeyglazed preserved fruits she held her own with the best trencherbeasts dandin was showing off slightly for her benefit tossing redcurrants up and catching them in his mouth he was quite good at it here watch this storm betcher cant catch redcurrants like me haha who cant ill show you watch unfortunately the giggly cordial had got the better of her storm tossed a redcurrant high and missed it completely it bounced off foremoles head and lodged in the ear of treerose who was feeling tired and sulky whahaah ive gone deaf in one ear she threw something at me foremole flicked the offending redcurrant out onto the grass taking up a great spoonful of otters hotroot soup he held treeroses nose and poured it down her open mouth yurr missie ee doant eat vittles boi stickin em in ee earlugs daown thy mouth et should be agoen loik this liddle missus treerose was not heard to complain again that night she was too busy pouring cold water down her throat to kill off the taste of the otter hotroot soup which it was said could thaw out an icy river in midwinter oo most of the eating was now over and speeches began abbot bernard thanked the friar for supervising the wonderful feast also the helpers layers of table gabe quill for the excellence of the drinks and all present for attending in response various creatures stood up to thank the abbot toast redwall and congratulate their hosts rufe brush called for some dancing but was silenced by an oat scone dancing and jigging was out of the question after having eaten so much so the singing began never being backward at coming forward tarquin was up on his paws chewing the last of a celery surprise as he tuned his harolina finishing the food he launched into the song of the long patrols oh its hard and dry when the sun is high and dust is in your throat when the rain pours down near fit to drown and soaks right through your coat but the hares of the long patrol my lads stouthearts they walk with me over hill and plain and back again by the shores of the wide blue sea through mud and mire to a warm campfire ill trek with you old friend oer lea and dale in a roaring gale right to our journeys end yes the hares of the long patrol my lads love friendship more than gold well share good days and tread long ways good comrades brave and bold drubber mole banged his tankard upon the table amid the applause gurr thatn be a gurt ballad bringen tears to moi eyes it do then it was willyum moles turn to get up and sing the mole song he did it solemnly in the correct mole manner and was cheered loudly though this time it did bring drubber to tears he wept unashamedly burrhoohurr baint nothen loik music to soften a hanimals eart dandin was called upon he rose and performed a newly written tribute to abbot bernard accompanied by tarquin on the harolina long may you rule father abbot long may you reign over all the woodlands of mossflower and the abbey of redwall when i was a young mouse i learnt at the knee of the father of redwall the lessons for you and the lessons for me from the father of us all in those good dibbun days i learnt many kind ways to be honest strong and true and wherever i go ill remember always that i learned them sir from you long may you rule father abbot over all of these creatures and me and may we all say in our own simple way have a happy jubilee every creature present insisted on singing the song again with tarquin calling out the words from a scroll it was a huge success though drubber broke down completely and had to be comforted by danty and buxton yurr now doant ee take on so drub owd lad et be ony a song hurr aye doant be asobben naow take moi ankerchiefy several more singers were called on to perform durry quill sang the comic song why cant hedgehogs fly the otter twins bagg and runn recited the epic poem otter bill and the shaking shrimp this led to more demand for poems and saxtus was finally coaxed up to recite the poem he had memorized in the gatehouse nervously saxtus stood up clasping and unclasping his paws as he began falteringly the winds icy breath oer the land of death tells a tale of the yet to come cross the heaving waves which mark ships graves lies an island known to some where seas pound loud and rocks stand proud and blood flows free as water to the far northwest which knows no rest came a father and his daughter the mind was numb and the heart struck dumb when the night seas took the child hurled to her fate by a son of hellgate the dark one called the wild you whom they seek though you do not speak the legend is yet to be born one day you will sing over stones that are red in the misty summer dawn in the silence that followed before the applause storm gullwhacker gave vent to a hoarse strangled sob which echoed amid the startled revelers a light morning sea mist hung over the waters around terramort isle the last four ships of gabools fleet were returning they silently nosed into the cove sails hanging slack oars shipped as the oily swell carried them noiselessly into harbor the king of searats knew they had returned he had watched them break the night horizon hours before the mist started to descend now gabool would need all his cunning and slyness if he were to win his captains over completely saltar had never been a popular captain neither had his brother bludrigg but the fact remained they were both captains and he had slain them naturally the other four shipmasters orgeye hookfin flogga and garrtail would feel their positions threatened they would need reassuring once they were happy with gabools continuing rule their crews would follow them into the very fangs of hellgates the warlord knew all this and set his plans accordingly the morning remained gray and uncertain as hordes of searats marched past the rock portals into fort bladegirt gabool watched them from the banqueting hall window voicing his thoughts aloud look at em the rakins an scrapins of the earth scum from the wharves taverns an cellars their mothers were bilge rats an their fathers were barrelsloppers murderers thieves pillagers all of em haharr theyd steal the very fires of hell to keep em warm of a winter night and singe the dark ones whiskers vermin after me own black heart haharrhahaharr the warlords description fit every searat from the tip of his ragged tail to the point of his scarred nose they were clad in motley rags some wearing wornout seaboots and threadbare frock coats others dressed in the tattered silks of corsairs brass ear nose and tail rings were much in evidence eyepatches skull bandages missing ears and fearsome scars but every searat was armed to the teeth cutlasses scimitars straight swords sabers claymores daggers dirks bodkins spears and pikes bristled everywhere throughout the barbaric mob gabool sat grimfaced on his throne facing the great bell all around the banqueting tables were piled high with food and drink nervous slaves stood waiting ready to serve their savage captors the searat crews crowded in those who could not find seating leaned against the walls or slouched upon the floor nobody touched a morsel of food an expectant hush settled over all the king of searats was not his usual roaring commanding self claws settled upon weapons ready to fight at a moments notice it was a taut and perilous situation the captains grouped together at one table orgeye of the waveblade hookfin of the blacksail flogga of the rathelm and garrtail of the greenfang they were joined by the masters of the three ships that were under repair riptung of the nightwake catseyes of the seatalon and grimtooth of the crabclaw against these seven gabool was facing mighty odds their cold quick eyes watched him mistrustingly even garrtail who now had his own ship and felt equal to other captains the threat of instant death hung heavy in the air gabools heavy sigh broke the stillness he stood up slowly drawing his curved sword he dropped it the bright blade clattered on the floor in front of him as he pointed to the nearest rat you there matey youve got the look of a poor old searat who dont have two crusts to rub together whats yer name shipmate weltskin sire the ragged searat said in a puzzled voice gabool nodded well you pick up that fine blade weltskin my sword belongs to you now go on take it matey the searat weltskin picked up the sword his eyes shining no common crewrat had ever owned such a weapon gabool faced the assembly throwing his arms wide he appealed to them aaahh shipmates whats it all come to treachery deceit an lies aye thats the sad fact mateys a capn who scorned me bludrigg an his brother saltar out fer revenge who tried to slay me when i was unarmed in me own home gabool shook his head sadly aharr bad weather n black days lads though i knew all the time those two searobbers was plottin against me still an all i offered em welcome an vittles in fort bladegirt their crews too why some of you was there an ate the same food an drank the same drink an saw it all happen base traitors they were messmates id heard them whisperin together they wanted it all my island an your ships you capns there aharr i wish youd been here to see it you wouldve sided with old gabool i know you would faithfulness always has its reward gabool struck the side of the bell with a drinking cup twenty slaves bearing chests of plunder staggered in and turned out the glittering contents at gabools feet necklaces stones bracelets goblets silks and fine weapons cascaded out across the floor in a sparkling heap gabools quick eyes noted the greedy glances the plunder attracted he held out his claws to the seven captains every bright star has seven true points you my shipmasters my good an trusty mates come an take what you want from this lot what use is booty an plunder if a rat aint got friends he can trust the captains stumbled and tripped over other searats in their haste to grab what they could ripping silks and tossing all they could hold into makeshift carriers the seven shipmasters bit scratched and jostled silently as each strove to grab what he thought was more than his fair share when they drew back dragging their portions with them there was still a large mound of loot upon the floor why you greedy old plunderers gabool laughingly upbraided the captains snafflin away without a thought for your crewrats see if you can clear this lot away lads come on its all yours with a wild howl the searat crews threw themselves upon the remainder of the booty scrabbling kicking screeching clawing and ripping they fought for baubles all over the hall gabool laughed madly as he plowed among them he had won the plan was working like a charm now he sowed the seeds of dissension as he roved among the crews whispering is that all you got matey a few earrings an a dagger if i was your capn i would have give you first pick ah but capns is capns they was ever the greedy ones hoho halfnose me ol messmate did you see that capn hookfin he was ashovin an apushin your capn orgeye like he didnt want him to get his proper share id tell orgeye that if i was you mate

been thinkin aright at the time id have made you master of the greenfang never mind matey therell always be another day eh when the plunder had all been claimed the searats threw themselves upon the food ravenously each one mistrusting the other and all of them feeling more loyal to gabool than to their own captains the warlord had yet to play his final card he banged the bell for silence now me

swing that sword weltskin swung the sword several times gabool looked worried no matey no thats no way to twirl a blade here let me show yer how to use that sword weltskin gave the sword to gabool he watched fascinated as the warlord wove patterns in the air with the glittering weapon weltskin s fascination suddenly turned to agonized shock as gabool snicked the tip from his ear with the sword smiling wickedly gabool flashed the blade a little closer to weltskins throat thats how tdo it matey now do you want to lay about while i does another liddle trick with yer neck or do yer want tboard ship an leave this ere carver with ol gabool a second later the searat king was listening to the mad patter of weltskins paws as he dashed headlong for the harbor and the safety of the open sea thrusting his regained weapon into its waist sash gabool threw back his head and roared with laughter redwallers gathered in the open doorway of the infirmary sickbay anxiously peeping in at the still figure of storm laid upon a truckle bed saxtus gnawed at his lip it must have been something i said in that poem oh i wish i hadnt recited the blinking thing now in fact i wish that id never seen it dandin patted his friend reassuringly dont be silly you werent to know that the poem would have that effect upon her its not your fault though i must say storm is the last creature youd expect to fall in a faint like that ive never met a rougher tougher mousemaid in my life simeon turned from a corner table where he was concocting something from strangelooking herbs and roots rough and tough she is indeed i think storm has been through things that would have killed a lesser creature she has tremendous spirit the abbot agreed she has indeed though i dont think her real name is storm gullwhacker i wonder who she really is simeon turned back to his bowl and pestle thats what were about to find out if we can are you ready sister sage sage went to the door mother mellus abbot and brother hubert youd better come in and watch saxtus and dandin you can come in also and you too tarquin but youll have to be very quiet now the rest of you please go to bed its only two hours until dawn there are visitors beds set up in cavern hole for the woodlanders oo storm lay very still sister sage placed a fresh damp cloth across her brow noting the deep scar which ran across her skull sage lifted storms head slightly as simeon administered a small dose of the mixture from a beaker the mousemaid licked her lips made a small noise of satisfaction then settled back as if in a calm sleep simeon took a seat near storms head and spoke gently into her ear you are with friends little one good friends i want you to tell us what happened to you go back to the beginning and tell us all can you hear me do you understand what i am saying storms eyelids flickered she sighed and then began talking as if she were telling a story to a friend at his table in the corner brother hubert wrote swiftly with quill on parchment recording the strange tale the mousemaid called storm gullwhacker her story written down by hubert brother recorder of redwall abbey after moving about restlessly for a short while the mousemaid appeared calm and spoke quite clearly we are half a season out from the deep coasts in the far south my father joseph and i the ship we are sailing in is called periwinkle it is crewed by shrews they are a bit scared because they have never sailed upon blue waters before but captain ash is bold and adventurous he says the only way we can get the great bell to salamandastron is by sea i have never sailed the deep waters before nor has my father every day we see new wonders great fish huge seabirds and wonderful sunsets the great bell is tied on deck my father and i sit to watch the suns dying rays reflected in its shining metal i can hear the pride in his voice as he speaks to me mariel he says surely this is a bell fit for rawnblade widestripe the great badger lord see how the sun sinking in the west turns it to a fiery color that is the copper brass and gold mariel the silver i put in to make its voice sweet my father is strong and very wise he is the cleverest bellrnaker in the world when i tell him this he laughs and says no no the nicest thing i ever made was your name mariel it sounds like a bell ringing clear across meadows on a soft spring morn cant you hear it mariel mariel now we have had to stop hugging the coast and put out to sea because of the reefs inshore all around me is nothing but waves and water it is a bit frightening at times when the big billows ride high with the wind the crew are not very happy now they have lost sight of land my father says everything is shipshape he learned that from captain ash i like the captain and i am sure he will deliver us safely to the mountain of the badger lord something is wrong a great black ship with red sails has been following us since dawn i heard captain ash whisper to my father the word searats my father has taken me below to a cabin i have to lie on the deck underneath a bunk and hide behind some blankets my father tells me to lie still and not move i am not afraid now i am angry i do not think i will like searats i want to come out and fight them if they try to harm us but my father has forbidden me crashing above on deck screaming yelling paws pounding everywhere harsh voices shouting bad things clashing of metal splintering of wood moaning horrible cries i must get out of this place to help against the searats silence now just some cries of injured creatures and the creak of ropes i am trying to lie still but i tremble and shake with rage why am i lying here doing nothing pawsteps banging the cabin door crashes open as i peep between the blankets i can see three big rats fighting over some wine on the cabin table one called gripper snatches the wineflask but the biggest one called saltar kicks him hard and grabs the wine gripper falls to the floor as the ship heaves he rolls under the bunk and bumps into me i yell he rips the blankets off and says hellseyes look what i found a pretty mousemaid he tries to grab me but i bite him kicking him hard in the neck gripper makes strange sounds and clutches at his throat where i kicked him his eyes turn up and he is still saltar laughs and says to the other rat a warrior maid eh ledder shes slain old gripper what a wild one they both pounce on me i cannot fight back because the dead rat is in my way saltar and ledder throw the blankets over me i am bundled up and they punch and kick at the blankets until i go still but i am half conscious now they have taken me on deck i can see through a rip in the blanket that my father and captain ash are tied to the bell they must have fought hard because they are both covered with cuts and bruises the crew are all lying about dead wounded or tied up saltar is saying something to ledder about feeding the fishes now they are oh no no please noooooooooo note by brother hubert here the mousemaid became very upset thrashing about until mother mellus held her down and simeon the herbalist administered more of his potion the mousemaid lay calm for a while then started to speak again i record her words as best as i can cold winter hungry cold oh so cold my father is ill i have seen him once when he was brought up to talk with gabool the wild he will not build a bell tower for gabool to hang the great bell in gabool is very angry he sends my father away back to the cells where he must stay locked up until he agrees to build a bell tower a rat named graypatch says that i should be used to make my father obey but gabool says that he is king of terramort isle he alone gives the orders if hunger cold and illness do not bend my father to his will then he might use me to force him but that is his decision and not graypatchs i do not think graypatch likes gabool i hate him gabool the wild is the cruelest of all searats he is a fearsome sight strange wild eyes golden greenstonestudded teeth and a long straggly beard every beast on terramort fears him gabool calls me skiv he makes me serve all his meals if i am lucky he throws me the scraps from his plate other times when he is in a cruel mood he will say are you thirsty skiv then he pours wine on the floor and makes me lick it up many times i have tried to escape but there are too many guards i am brought back and beaten gabool has threatened to kill my father if i try running away once more but there must be a way ive got to find a way note by brother hubert here the mousemaid started weeping and grinding her teeth simeon said it was pure rage at her helpless position he soothed her with a drop more of potion she is resting now and beginning to relate another incident i wish she would speak more slowly as i am unaccustomed to recording in this speedy manner i am serving at table laying gabools food out he likes roasted seabird and strong wine gabool is in a very bad temper and i know the reason our ship periwinkle was renamed crabclaw by gabool he made a rat named skullgor captain of it but on the first day he sailed it from terramort he was driven back onto the rocks by a sudden squall the ship was holed and lost its rudder gabool has got skullgor in front of him now and he is insulting him goading him to fight i think though gabool is unarmed gabool says skullgor a dead frog would be a better captain than you you are a blunderer and a fool you let that ship run on to the rocks because you did not want to put to sea you yellowlivered coward skullgor draws his sword he is shouting king or no king nobeast calls skullgor a coward go and get your sword gabool well see whos the coward then gabool reaches for a hidden sword he has stowed beneath the table he draws it and makes a leap surprising skullgor i am passing laden with dishes and i bump straight into gabool by accident like a flash skullgor is on him but gabool shouts out and a rat named garrtail stabs skullgor in the back with a dagger gabool jumps up and finishes skullgor off then he turns on me yelling youve collected your last plate skiv i saw your little game trying to get me killed by skullgor eh then go and join him at hellgates now gabool is coming at me with his sword i know he is determined to slay me suddenly i feel a great anger i must live he has no right to take my life i must act fast i snatch up skullgors sword and leap onto the table kicking a jug of wine into gabools face i slash at him with my sword but he has staggered close in his eyes full of wine the sword handle catches him on the skull stunning him he falls beneath the table but as i jump down to slay him they are on me garrtail and a halfdozen others they hit me with something everything goes black note by brother hubert we thought the mousemaid needed calming down bit she lay still momentarily then started to speak again black darkness wind rain i am bound with a rope a heavy rope outside on the high cliffs we are outside the fort i can hear waves crashing against the rocks far below my head aches i am balanced tottering on the cliff edge gabool is with me he is saying something i can hardly hear it for the wind and storm wait a mousemaid bringing gabool down we cant have that can we little skiv saltar said you were a warrior maid he was right you are a born fighter too much of a fighter for your own good lets see how good you are at battling with the sea he pushes me i am falling over the cliff there is a large rock tied to the rope it smashes to bits on another rock as i fall father father the water is cold as ice and high as mountains but i wont die ill come back for you see the water has softened the rope and my paws are free driftwood im cling ing to it father dont let me drown oh its so cold so dark and the sea is like a huge wild animal father father ill come back enough the sight of one so young writhing in mental torment was pitiful mother mellus could stand it no longer sweeping the mousemaid up in her paws she carried her off calling back to those in the sickbay room this little one has had enough me too i cant listen anymore to the sufferings of the poor child we will sleep out in the orchard beneath the trees where it is cool and shadowed from the dawn just mariel and me the door slammed and they were left looking at each other all save blind simeon who summed it up in a few phrases shes right yknow i think we all got carried away listening to the tale of sto er mariel the poor maid needs rest but at least we know who she is now abbot bernard stuffed his paws into wide habit sleeves and yawned right you are simeon i think we all need some rest aahhh bed beckons tarquin threw a dramatic paw to his brow gads how you can think of sleep at a time like this horrifies me particularly when theres so much food left any of you chaps fancy sharing a bite with me ill tell you about the sweetest gel in the entire territory hon rosies her name an absolute whackeroony of a filly an tarquin l woodsorrels the first to say it dandin chuckled sounds like a tale for a long winters night im off to the dormitories g night or is it good day oo down in the orchard tarquin sat stuffing dewberry and sugared apple cake strumming his harolina mournfully o rosie why did you leave me youre enough to give a bally chap the pip laughin in my face ha ha ha ha ha an leavin me in tears as off you trip yowch a hard green apple bounced off tarquins head as mother melluss voice called out from the trees ill leave you in tears if you dont quit your caterwauling and let us get some rest ill wrap that harolina round your head see if i dont no a stiff southerly breeze had sprung up chasing the mist before it the darkqueen under full sail dipped her head as she cut the night sea bow waves scudded spray to fleck her wake ragged clouds swirled overhead with no moon to light them on their way timbers creaked and ropes hummed as the burgeoning canvas pulled the sleek craft across the main graypatch knew it was dangerous to sail the darkqueen in any northerly direction but northeast was better than northwest and he was a bit more familiar with the coastline in the northeast area it was still some time until dawn keep her head in to the shore fishgill graypatch called to his steersrat deadglim sound the water for reefs as ygo frink stay up that topmast and keep yer eyes peeled north and westward any sign of a sail give me a shout im goin below to look at the charts stay on duty now anybeast i catch nappinll be dead afore he wakes up the charts in saltars former cabin were few and sketchy searats were notorious for sailing by instinct and rule of paw graypatch found a scrap of parchment and began drawing his own map of the coast from memory in hmm if i recall right the badgers mountain is further southard then theres the seamarshes and i remember some outlyin cliffs boundin em t the north them dunes is next an the toadlands i reckon were a full nights sailin with the wind behind us got it haha i knew me old brain wasnt rustin somewheres up this coast is a river that runs into the sea eye it comes out of the forestlands and across the shore alls we do is keep a lookout fer the trees agrowin inland to the starboard side i know the rivers somewheres there i can feel it in me bones daybreak found the darkqueen still beating north up the coast the morning was heavy with rolling seamist promising to clear into hot sunshine promises were not much good to the captain of darkqueen however with frink peering to port and fishgill to starboard it turned into a guessing game as to what would show first the trees to landward or the enemy to seaward graypatch paced the deck anxiously a grizzled searat called kybo came scurrying up with bad news just been checkin provisions capn nought but a few breaktooth biscuits left an were out of fresh water graypatch slammed the rail with his claw stow the gab kybo therell be fresh water an vittles aplenty where were bound somewheres along this coast theres land ho graypatch dashed to the starboard rail where away fishgill straight as y look capn the mists aclearin i can see the trees growin green an andsome atop of some dunes inland graypatch clapped kybo on the back and winked with his good eye see i told yer matey hoho lets see if they can find us now fishgill deadglim keep yer eyes skinned for a river runnin out o those trees across the shore ahoy there frink any sign of gabool or his ships on your side nan a sail capn the mists liftin an all i see is a bright day an some seabirds the news cheered graypatch immensely helm down the darkqueen raced along the shoreline as a stiffening breeze sprang up from the south graypatch called all claws on deck where they could watch for the river oo it was early noontide before the river was sighted flowing through a deep defile in the dunes and bubbling out to meet the sea the strain and tension was showing in graypatchs face though his search had been rewarded he knew precious time had been wasted gabools ships would not be meandering about at halfsail they would be hunting at full speed and bound to turn up sooner than later moreover conditions for navigating the river were not favorable it was ebb tide graypatch would have liked to approach the river at high water sailing his ship straight into the forest he cursed aloud knowing the decision he was making would leave them totally vulnerable to attack dropping anchor bow onto the river he addressed the darkqueens crew hark t me lads therell be no flood tide until late tonight so heres the plan were goin to haul the ship through that river which runs across the shore an into the forestlands once were among the trees were safe no onell find us up there its a snug berth lots of fresh water fruits an good meat t be had trust old graypatch me lucky buckos hah tell that t the frogs graypatch well never drag darkqueen oer that long shore any rat with half an eye can see that rivers too shallow graypatchs good eye glared down at the objector a burly searat stow that kind o talk bigfang either we haul her up into the trees or we sit here like ducks at a weddin waitin fer the tide tonight and get ourselves caught by gabools ships now which is it bigfang and the searat crew grumbled and muttered but there was no real objection to graypatchs plan which they knew was their only hope the master of the darkqueen rapped out his orders so be it everybeast aboard ship i mean everyone all of you and whatever slaves are in the galleys i want you all ashore split into two groups either side o that river pullin on the ropes kybo frink get the anchor rope to port and another one as thick to starbd now when i say pull i want yer to put yer backs into it buckos hear me right all ashore oo standing waistdeep in the shallow river graypatch eyed the lines of crew and oarslaves either side of the banks he raised his sword bringing it down with a splash into the water as he yelled pull pull bend yer backs an curse yer mothers pull i say grunting and sweating the crew heaved on the taut ropes across their shoulders digging their claws into the sand for purchase pull you orrible seascum pull you couldnt drag a worm out o bed between the lot of yer pull the ropes creaked and groaned as darkqueen began to move forward fraction by agonizing fraction graypatch waded from the river and took a place at the head of the port rope hoho shes movin me lazy lads pull pull as if you were pullin buckets o dark wine from a barrel pull darkqueen had moved twice her own considerable length when the river shallowed out drastically and she buried her nose in a sandbank bigfang threw down the rope followed by many others he waded into the river and began drinking the fresh running water graypatch drew his sword in high bad temper and began bellowing hoarsely get out of there you worthless idlers get back on your ropes you froghearted backbitin jellyclawed slackers ill carve the hide from your bones ill strangle every jackrat of yer ill across the open sea just beyond the tideline garrtails ship greenfang was bearing down on them under full sail oo mariel your name is mariel daughter of joseph the bellmaker the mousemaid hauled her gullwhacker in from the infirmary window where it had hung to dry she swung it experimentally nodding with satisfaction at the clean knotted hemp i know my name dandin and i know my fathers name i can remember everything now stand aside dandin and saxtus followed her down the stairs across great hall into the abbey kitchens mariel picked up an empty floursack and shook it out she started packing it with any food to paw saxtus nibbled his paw agitatedly what are you doing mariel the mousemaid continued filling the sack packing rations saxtus friar alder and his young assistant cockleburr came bustling up hi there young missy what do you think youre up to mariel tested the weight of the sack and threw it across her shoulder borrowing some supplies friar dont worry ill repay them friar alder held out a restraining paw now hold on a moment please mariel grasped gullwhacker tightly stay out of my way friar please you have all been very kind to me at redwall and i would hate to harm any abbey crea ture but theres something ive got to do and nobeast will stop me cockleburr hopped up and down stumbling on his apron walloping winters friar get out the way ive seen her use that gullywhacker thing dandin jumped between the friar and mariel violence is no answer mariel we are creatures of peace its wrong to offer harm to a redwaller the mousemaid shook her head dont you understand dandin i dont wish to harm any creature in this abbey but i have scores to settle with my enemies look just let me go and leave me alone will you oh and what do you plan to do then storm gullwhacker mariel turned standing in front of the great oven was mother mellus accompanied by the abbot simeon and tarquin my names not storm gullwhacker its mariel she said defiantly blind simeon tapped his way forward until he touched her sleeve then start acting like mariel and not behaving like the old storm gullwhacker we are trying to help you child mariel looked at the floor dont need any help not true mariel there was a touch of firmness in melluss voice as she interrupted every creature needs help how do you suppose we live here in harmony together by helping each other this abbey was not built by one creature it needed cooperation and help tell me where do you think you are going with a knotted rope in a borrowed habit carrying a sack of stolen food suddenly mariel felt helpless in the face of all this peaceful opposition the sack slipped from her paw as she brushed away a threatening teardrop tarquin saved the situation by throwing a rangy paw about her shoulders come on old gel chin up an never say boo to a goose wot tell you what well do lets tootle over to that dusty old gatehouse place an hold a council o war get the stew sorted from the dumplins eh abbot hubert slipped mariel a clean kerchief and stood in front of her as she scrubbed at her eyes splendid idea tarquin a good sensible talk never hurt any creature come on well all go together many heads are better than one the gatehouse proved far too dusty and cramped so they sat on the low steps in the shade of the west rampart the abbot ordered lunch to be sent out to them with cold mint and rose cordial mother mellus folded her paws now where exactly do you plan on going terramort isle mariels answer was loud and clear do you know how to get there or where it is no but dont worry ill find it myself simeon chuckled as the blind squirrel said reaching for a cloud mariel bristled what does that mean that im stupid dont be silly tarquin interrupted oh haha i say scuse me lunch chaps here comes lunch as they sat eating the abbot gave mariel a friendly wink simeon didnt mean anything all he said really was that you need help i think the first thing to do is to find out where terramort isle is at least that will be a start has anyone ever heard of terramort in the past any mention from travelers scrolls books old rhymes anything at all i think i may be of some help there brother hubert had been eavesdropping on the conference from the door of the gatehouse he wandered over cleaning dust from his spectacles hmm is that food i see i think ill join you seating himself comfortably he began helping himself to cheese bread and cold cider simeon coughed politely ahem i dont suppose that youve ever heard of terramort hubert brother hubert blinked over the top of his spectacles on the contrary as soon as i heard the name it brought to mind a young mouse who should have been learning the precepts of redwall abbots in bygone days yes he thought i was dozing and he began leafing through the scrolls of fieldroan the traveler tarquin hastily swallowed a redcurrant muffin fieldroan well theres a thing my father lorquin knew him of course old fieldroan had more seasons to gray his hairs than a hedgehog has spikes when he and the jolly old pater were chums dyknow i thought i recognized that poem young saxtus recited at the feast know bits of it mself blow me if it isnt one of fieldroans very own rhymes brother hubert sniffed severely indeed well as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted fieldroan was a compulsive traveler i met him one winter and sheltered him in the gatehouse through half a season of deep snow he left some of his scrolls with me because they were becoming too bulky to carry about on his journeys this time it was dandins turn to interrupt where are they brother hubert do you have them patience young mouse patience ill have to search them out unfortunately my gatehouse has become a little ahem untidy of late leaving the meal half finished everybody hurried to the gatehouse intent on being the first to discover the scrolls brother hubert scurried about in alarm dont touch anything you dont know my storage system any of you valuable writings could be lost my collating disturbed you old fraud hubert simeon chuckled your system is nothing but layers of dust even i can feel that at a single touch dont worry friend by the time were finished well free the gatehouse of rubbish and dust and provide you with a proper tidy system i think everything will have to be moved out here onto the lawn its the only way well find anything from that jumble oo midafternoon saw the sunlit lawn dotted with piles of manuscripts books scrolls parchments and pamphlets covered in dust the friends sat by the wall sipping cold mint and rose cordial saxtus shook his head for the umpteenth time no it wasnt any of that lot id know them the moment i saw them bagg and runn sat on top of the wallstairs laughing and giggling hoheeheehee whoohahaha what a bunch of dustbags brother hubert tried to ignore them yes id recognize those scrolls instantly myself teeheeheehee recnize them himself yahahahaha they rolled about on the ramparts kicking their legs in the air and wiping tears of merriment from their eyes as they went into fresh gales of laughter mariel liked the funloving otter twins but this was neither the time nor the place for fun and games hi you two she called up to them are you both sitting on a feather or is it just a mad fit of the giggles bagg and runn were laughing too much to answer they fell about slapping their paws down against the wall top and shaking their heads from side to side the laughter was so infectious that mariel and saxtus began chuckling and even brother hubert could not suppress a dry smile simeon turned his sightless eyes toward the walltop now then you young villains whats so funny let us in on the joke please bit by bit the story came out from the laughing twins woohoohoo youre all lookin for scrolls hohoho and youve teeheehee shifted everythin out of the gatehouse haha yahahaha but when you started carryin all that stuff out ohohoho brbr brother hubert hehe heeheehee gave old scrolls to simeon t stick under the gatehouse door an keep it open hawhawhawhaw an i said to bagg ohoohoohoo spose theyre the scrolls that everyones lookin for ahaahaahohohoheehee simeon turned his face to brother hubert who looked guiltily toward the abbot who shook his head in disbelief he was about to say something to mariel but the mousemaid was already at the gatehouse door easing the flattened bundle of scrolls from under it its them all right the scrolls of fieldroan the traveler rubbing dust and sweat from his brow dandin nudged hubert well at least your gatehouse got a good free tidyout brother smiles broke into chuckles which gave way to open laughter all around sister sage shook a quilt out at the infirmary window and began folding it neatly as she reached for her feather duster well its nice to know that all some creatures have to do is sit out on the abbey lawn in the sunshine and laugh all afternoon i must say graypatch drew his sword waving it and roaring as he waded from the stream now well see what yer made of you sons of searats catch em in the shallows afore theyre ashore an massacre every rat of em sharp now its our necks or theirs charge me buckos charge the creenfang had sailed into shore as close as garrtail could take her she listed slightly in the shallows then settled askew garrtail had his crew ready lining the rails they gripped weapons between their teeth and waited his order as graypatchs rats thundered across the sands garrtail vaulted over the side landing chest deep in the sea follow me lucky lads its booty for all aplenty when weve slain that load o turncoats an traitors over the side all of yer quick thinking and speed had given the advantage to graypatch his searats were at the waters edge as garrtails crew came over the rails of the creenfang wading out graypatch called over his shoulder keep to the shallows dont go too deep lads but hold garrtails scum in the deeper waters where they cant fight so good bigfang get back to the darkqueen kybo you go with him get hold of any long boathooks or pikes you can find look lively now im not goin back to terramort with me head in the bows an me body in the stern for gabool to gloat over garrtail was out ahead of his crew realizing the urgency of the situation he waded and cursed as he made his way toward graypatch come an fight you froglivered schemer ill carve you to fishbait graypatch balanced an iron marlinspike in his claw taking careful aim he flung it the pointed missile hissed out across the rippling waves standing almost chestdeep in the water garrtail had little chance to dodge or leap out of the way it caught him between the eyes the captain of the greenfang fell backward into the sea slain instantly his crew on seeing their leader dead milled about in the water betwixt ship and shore all heart for the fight had deserted them now they were without a captain ahoy graypatch lookit what we found bigfang and kybo came splashing into the shallows with two galley slaves all four laden with pikes long boathooks and bows and arrows graypatch snapped out swift orders his clever brain working fast kybo you stay here with half the crew as archers keep pouring arrows at em hard as you can fire high over the pikers bigfang take the other half of the crew and wade a bit deeper stick any of the greenfang crew who try to get ashore an circle behind us deadglim give me yer burnin glass an a bow n arrows with its unanchored keel scraping gently off the sea bottom the greenfang began a slow drift away from shore with the outgoing tide the crew split two ways some trying to swim back to ship the other bolder spirits wading toward shore yelling as they thrust their swords at the pikerats kybo and the archers had easy targets arching their arrows over the top of the pikers into the unprotected backs of those who were swimming to the ship their screams mingled with the angry yells of those with pitifully short swords trying to do battle with long pikes and boathooks oo on shore graypatch had soaked rags in lamp oil and bound them around arrowpoints in the hot sun it was the work of a moment with a burning glass to concentrate the sunrays into flame upon oilsoaked rags kybo followed behind carrying the fire arrows as graypatch waded out testing the wind to make sure it was with him the first arrow blurred high over the heads of the searats like a red comet arcing into the big mainsail of greenfang two others followed swiftly one stood quivering in the stern the other burying itself deep into the mast graypatch amused himself by firing the remaining fire arrows at the helpless rats who were still trying to swim for the ship he laughed aloud as one wretched creature sank with a sizzle and a scream all around the water ran red with blood as the breeze stirred the flames to a roaring inferno bodies of the wounded and the slain followed the blazing greenfang out on the ebbing tide graypatch his single eye illuminated red in the glare called out make sure theres none left alive to tell the tale mates haharr gabool will never know what happened to us an the darkqueen or garrtail an the greenfang dye hear me gabool blast yer eyes lungs n liver wherever ye are as the searats waded ashore bigfang muttered to kybo graypatch is gettin too big fer his seaboots matey thered be no victory today if i hadnt found those bows an arrows mark my words kybo agreed wholeheartedly though under his breath aye did ysee him there yellin an a screamin to kill greenfangs crew down t the last rat ill bet some o those buckos wouldve joined us we all had mateys among that crew but theyre gone to hellgates now bigfang flung his pike upon the sands right you are shipmate i think weve a come out o the frypan into the fire here graypatch is startin to act up as wild as gabool did ye hear the way he was yellin at me fer drinkin water earlier i take that from no searat captain or not still well bide our time eh matey graypatch wandered over and slapped kybo with the flat of his swordblade cmon gullywhumper back aboard the darkqueen we can afford to wait the night floodtide to send us across the shore now no more pullin her on towropes kybo turned to look at the last of the greenfang wiping smoke from his smarting eyes as the blazing hulk drifted seaward oo gabool was in a foul temper most of his servant slaves had gone to the galleys of the three ships under repair and he was left with only four blinking his redrimmed eyes he watched them polishing his bell the warlord was afraid of the night sleep brought with it only nightmares of avenging mice fearsome badger figures and the angry boom of the bell tolling around his brain like a harbinger of doom virtually alone now in fort bladegirt he did not have the satisfaction of asserting his power as king of all searats there was nobeast to plot against to bend to his will only sitting around waiting and festering with hate for his onetime ally graypatch he aimed a kick at a dormouse who was down on all fours furiously rubbing away at the great bell you there scabpaws wheres my food the slave continued polishing not daring to stop as he replied master i am not a cook you sent the cooks away to your ships all i do is polish your bell as you have told me to get me something to eat and drink gabool snarled youre a cook now the dormouse dropped his rag and bowed trem bling master i cannot cook i am only a bell polisher gabools cruel claws dug into the slaves body as he drew him upright glaring at him through sleepless sore eyes get down to the kitchens and light a fire youll find dead seabirds there roast me a few bring wine too get out of my sight as the dormouse picked himself up and scurried off gabool vented his spleen on the remaining three slaves out get out all of you leave me i want to be alone gabool flung a knife at the last dormouse to disappear around the door it clattered harmlessly off the wall and he slumped dejectedly in his chair must be losin me touch shouldve pinned him easily the afternoon sun slanting through the window cast its warmth over him gabools tired eyes began to droop he sighed as his chin slowly sank onto his chest outside the sounds of the restless sea grew distant finally sleep overcame the king of searats his eyes closed and his head slumped gently forward in the quiet summer noontide a badger was advancing upon him a huge warlike badger brandishing a broadsword that made a searat blade look like a toy he turned in fear a mouse had crept up behind him it was the one he called skiv she was carrying a heavy knotted rope and the light of battle was in her eyes somewhere he could hear graypatch laughing a contemptuous mocking sound bongw gabool sat bolt upright wide awake there was no creature in the room save himself and the bell oo well what a riddle tbe sure ill bet even hon rosie couldnt make head nor tail of this jolly old thing wot wot mariel aimed a candied chestnut at tarquin and threw it he merely caught it in his mouth and munched reflectively course yknow ive never seen her solvin riddles and whatnot bet shes bally clever at it though hon rosies pretty good at most things mellus stuck a huge paw under tarquins nose listen doodlehead if i hear you mention hon rosie one more time the friends sat at table in cavern hole they were not to be disturbed on the abbots orders outside in great hall the rest of the redwallers took supper and chased reluctant dibbuns around in an effort to get them washed and up to their beds mariel picked up the scrolls from amid the supperladen table theres no puzzle or mystery about it the whole things a straightforward map in rhyme maybe we dont know what certain things are fieldroan the traveler had an odd way of expressing himself but dont worry ill find out what it all means as i go along saxtus helped himself to more mushroomandcress soup read it again mariel perhaps it may sound clearer if you do mariel drew a deep breath right here goes for the tenth time if i were fool of any sort id leave redwall and travel forth for only fools seek terramort upon the pathway leading north this trail brings death with every pace beware of dangers lurking there sticklegs of the feathered race and fins that in the ford do stir after the ford one night one day seek out the otter and his wife forsake the path go westlands way find the trail and lose your life when in the woods this promise keep with senses sharp and open eyes my nose shall not send me to sleep for buried ones will surely rise beat the hollow oak and shout we are creatures of redwall if a brave one is about hell save any fool at all beware the light that shows the way trust not the wartskinned toad in his realm no night no day fool stay to the road where the sea meets with the shore there the final clue is hid rock stands sentinel evermore find it as i did the swallow who cannot fly south the bird that only flies one way lies deep beneath the monsters mouth keep him with you night and day his flight is straight norwest is true your fools desire hell show to you brother hubert made a show of polishing his spectacles busily complete balderdash and nonsense of course fieldroan was like most old travelers given to tall stories and halftruths the very idea of it sticklegs and fins otters wives sleeping noses and buried ones rising huh truth was a cuckoos egg to that fellow tarquin left off chewing an enormous turnip n leek pastie i say thats a bit strong old boy what reason would old fieldroan have to tell a pile of fibs personally im inclined to believe the bally poem even though i cant make head nor tail of it simeon touched mariels paw what do you think young one after all the decision to travel upon this information is yours mariel patted the blind herbalists shoulder thank you simeon i will tell you what i think i never knew fieldroan so i cannot say if his poem is totally correct but it is all i have to go on if i am to reach terramort so i will do what the rhyme says to rescue my father and return the great bell to lord rawnblade the abbot pursed his lips but that is not all you intend to do mariel the mousemaids voice had a ring of determination which no creature could deny i have only one other thing to do i must slay gabool the wild none of you can know the hatred i bear toward this barbarian he must be sent to hellgates so that decent creatures can live in peace only then will i rest i must do this alone i thank you my friends for all the kindness and hospitality you have shown to me a stranger in your midst continue to live prosper and be happy in your wonderful abbey but do not try to follow me the responsibility is mine alone and i cannot allow any redwaller to risk life and limb on my behalf now i must sleep tomorrow my journey begins oo when the mousemaid had retired to the dormitories dandin looked at the friends around the table in cavern hole i am going with her she cannot achieve her aims alone mother mellus rapped the table youll stay right here at redwall dandin the young mouse turned to the abbot there was no change of verdict dandin we are creatures of peace and also duty you must obey mother mellus you are still a very young mouse in our care but the abbot held up a paw in a gesture of finality no more arguments please the hour is late and sleep beckons t shadows of drifting nightcloud meandered past the moon a light breeze made the hot night more tolerable and trees rustled and sighed in mossflower woods sending their whisperings echoing around the stones of redwall simeon sat propped up by cushions in his armchair near the open window he seldom slept in bed it was sometime after midnight unsure of whether he was half awake or half asleep the blind herbalist felt a presence in the room is that you bernard old friend he said softly into the darkness the voice that replied was not that of the abbot it was strong firm and reassuring a voice that simeon instinctively felt he could trust simeon friend dandin must go mariel needs him the blind mouse felt a light touch against his paw all around was the scent of woodland flowers columbine wood anemones bryony honeysuckle and dog rose the voice spoke again the blood of gonff flows in dandin mariel needs a friend as i once did do not be afraid come with me simeon arose from the chair and left the room guided by his strange visitor though somehow with the odd feeling that none of this was real and he was still sitting in his chair convinced that he was asleep simeon decided to settle back and enjoy the dream oo down stairs and down more stairs along winding and twisting corridors never touching the walls as he usually would yet not putting a paw wrong as he was guided by the friendly presence the blind herbalist practically floated he heard a door creak softly as it opened gliding through simeon sensed that he was in a rock chamber somewhere deep beneath the abbey it was so peaceful and quiet here yet wistful with a breath of summers long gone and autumn mists hanging like dried tears simeon could not suppress a long sigh in the silent calm of the chamber something was pressed into his paws he felt it as the voice spoke again leave this with dandin do not wake him he will understand drawing the thing from its long case the blind herbalist felt it from the smooth pommel stone across the curving hilt and down the perilous blade to the winterkeen tip simeon touched it he had never felt a sword before but the blind mouse knew that had he felt ten thousand swords none would have been fit to compare with this one the balance was perfect wieldy yet light as a feather dangerous but safe as a rock to the paw that held it a blade of death yet of destiny and justice simeon hardly remembered the journey back he dimly recalled leaving the sheathed sword alongside dandin as he lay sleeping then he was back in his armchair wide awake with the cool night breeze wafting on him through the open window the woodland flower scent and a fading voice calling from far off goodbye simeon may the seasons rest easily upon you simeon smiled and settled back in his chair as sleep closed in on him and may the peace of redwall abbey be upon you martin the warrior the sails of the darkqueen had to be tight furled to avoid overhanging trees oarslaves had been brought up from the galleys pitiful wretches they stood on deck using the long oars to punt the massive vessel upriver graypatch stood at the helm supervising the movements moonlight patching down through the night foliage upon his lean figure floodtide had lifted the darkcjueens nose from the sandbank and then with a favorable night breeze she had spread sails and glided across the shore toward the forestfringed dunes oo pakatugg had been following the progress of the ship since he first spotted it offshore from the dunes the recluse squirrel had followed along the shoreline and seen everything from the near mutiny of graypatchs crew as they hauled the darkqueen to the murderous encounter with garrtail and the burning of greenfang pakatugg was on the scavenge anything he could steal from the searats he considered would be his by right when he saw the ship sailing across the beach toward the forest his respect for graypatch grew he would have to treat this searat with some respect a ship in full sail gliding over a beach in the night what a strange sight dawn was peeping over the treetops to a loud chorus of birdsong when graypatch chose an inlet far upriver with no proper anchorage on the pebbly riverbed he ordered darkqueen made fast by stem stern and midship ropes to a sycamore and two elms graypatch felt a real sense of triumph as he gave orders frink deadglim take ringtail lardgutt ranzo an dripnose patrol this forest awhile see what ycan see there must be life hereabouts we crossed a path that was forded by the river durin the night theres always somebeast around to tread that path might be a settlement of some sort anyhow get your carcasses movin an report back to me at noon kybo bigfang fishgill you stay on deck an keep a weather eye out hereabouts im off t me bunk for some rest after steerin all night the rest of you keep your heads down below decks until we know what sort of country this is oo pakatugg tracked the six searats as they patrolled northward through far mossflower woods he could tell they were raw and inexperienced in woodland matters frink who was leading the party walked straight into a bed of stinging nettles tripping on an exposed treeroot and falling headlong yaagh owouch help me mates ow oo these things are alive lardgutt and ranzo pulled him out he sat nursing a rapidly swelling face and cursing chahah me nose look its blowin up like a balloon garr i hate this place trees everywhere a rat cant even take a decent breath give me the open sea anytime ahoy frink over here ringtails been stung by one o those wasp things deadglim pulled the dart from ringtails paw catching a glimpse of pakatugg dodging behind a tree with his blowpipe as he did deadglim inspected the dart and flung it away so thats what a wasp looks like huh weve got some learnin t do before were proper landlubbers im goin back to the darkqueen you lot carry on with your patrollin pakatugg missed the wink which passed between deadglim and the other five the squirrel followed the remainder of the patrol sniggering quietly at their ignorance of woodland lore hey frink what dyou suppose these are strawberries no theyre blackberries or raspberries or somethin anyhow why ask me i dont know dont wanna know either haha why dont you try eatin one lardgutt are yer scared mate who me course im not here watch this how does it taste lardy

loading his blowpipe when a tattooed arm circled his neck and a swordblade pressed against his throat one move an yer fishbait squirrel we might not know much about forests but a searat can sniff the enemy a mile away ahoy lads lookit what i got they flocked around deadglim licking his knifeblade and smiling evilly at pakatugg frink snapped the blowpipe and threw it aside so its our wasp eh whats yer name wasp pakatugg swallowed hard and tried to stop trembling pakatuggs my name frink twitched his tender nose pakatugg eh whatd you call im ranzo hah id call him deadsquirrel or maybe nopaws then again slittongue might be an andsome title fer a squirrel who follers searats round afirin darts at em they bound pakatuggs paws tightly dripnose threw a noose about his neck and gave it a sharp tug move lively matey well see what name capn graypatch can think up for yeh cxo clary thyme and hon rosie stood to attention in the armory at salamandastron lord rawnblade paced up and down a worried frown creasing his broad brow longeyes has reported a smoldering wreck of a ship greenfang its one of gabools there may have been trouble farther north up the coast clary i want you to take your patrol up there fully provisioned and well armed find out whats been going on and report back to me but if you are needed up there by any good creatures then stay and help out as best you can understood clary made an elegant salute with his lance leave it to us sah rawnblade allowed himself a fleeting smile thank you clary move your patrol out whenever you wish oo the badger lord watched them go from his high window the three hares swiftly bounded across the beach sometimes skipping in and out of the small wavelets at the waters edge rawnblade turned back to his forge and quenched a redhot spearhead in water he remembered long seasons back three similar hares young carefree fighters their bodies washed up on the tideline after gabools searats had finished with them rawnblade set the spearhead on the anvil and began beating it with mighty blows his heavy hammer rose and fell sweat mixed with tears and sizzled into the embers of the forges as the ruler of the fire mountain renewed his vow i cannot leave my mountain and these shores undefended but one day gabool one day you will sail back to here and i will be waiting oho gabool all the seas of the world cannot keep us apart it is written that we will meet again we will meet we will meet we will meet rawnblade repeated the phrase over and over with each hammer blow upon the spearhead releasing his pentup frustrations when he finally stopped the spearblade had been battered to four times its size and was thin as a leaf oo from the western flatlands fronting the abbey a chorus of larks wakened mariel she stood stretching and rubbing her eyes for a brief moment until realization hit her it was almost an hour after dawn the mousemaid slung gullwhacker around her neck and opened the door carefully listening for familiar sounds of abbey bustle thankfully she noted silence from outside and inside the building stealing quietly down the corridor mariel could not help a slight sense of bewilderment usually redwall was alive and humming by this time tippawing through great hall she retrieved the knapsack of supplies she had hidden behind a column before supper thanking her lucky stars she dashed across the lawn toward a small wicker gate in the north wall and unbolted it taking one last backward look at the sleeping abbey the mousemaid sniffed wiped her eyes took a deep breath and left redwall with its happy memories behind her flatlands to the left woodlands to the right mariel strode the brown dusty path that wound northward early dew was drying from the lea already it was going to be a hot day she stayed on the side of the path where mossflower provided treeshade strange that the redwallers should sleep so late she thought still it was far better in a way mariel had been dreading any long tearful farewells it would be far easier this way even though she felt rather guilty stealing off like a thief in the early dawn i mariel the mousemaid called aloud to mossflower country swear by this honorable weapon known as the gullwhacker that one day i will return to redwall abbey and all my true friends and dear companions i leave there always providing that i live through the dangers of the task ahead of me that is oh and providing of course that i can find the way back no thats nonsense id find my way back if i had only one leg and the snows were as high as the treetops but what if im slain or i fail in my quest well in that case i solemnly swear that my spirit will find its way back to redwall abbey there thats that i feel much better now even hungry enough for a spot of breakfast without stopping her march she munched bread and cheese from the knapsack a stroke of luck provided a gnarled apple tree hanging its boughs low over the path so she plucked an early russet apple and bit into it noting her find as a lucky omen for the journey ahead woodpigeons cooed within the dimness of woodland depths bees hummed and grasshoppers chafed out on the sunlit flatlands mariel began skipping twirling gullwhacker at her side suddenly filled with a sense of freedom and adventure what better than to travel alone eat when you please rest when you feel the need camp by your own little fire at night and sleep snug in some forest glade the feeling flooded through her with such force that it made her lightheaded and she began singing aloud an old playsong known to mice everywhere the winter o the winter o with cold and dark and driving snow o not for me the winter o my friend i tell you so in spring the winds do sport and play and rain can teem down anyday while autumn oft is misty gray my friend hear what i say when summer sunlight comes each morn the birds sing sweet each golden dawn and flowrs get kissed by every bee while shady stands the tree the summer o the summer o amid its golden peace i go from noon to lazy evening glow my friend i told you so mariel held the final note leaping high in the air and twirling she came down on the far side of the path stumbled and fell rolling over the mousemaid slipped down the side of the ditch bordering the flatlands tut tut dearie me leapin mice what next though i must say old gel you held that last note gracefully hon rosie couldnt have done better bear in mind though she wouldnt have dived nose first into the ditch not the done sort o thing for young fillies wot tarquin lent a paw to pull mariel from the ditch she was completely taken aback at the appearance of the hare where did you come from tarquin i never even heard you following me tarquin l woodsorrel adopted a pose of comical outrage following did i hear you say following marm boggle me ears i wasnt followin you snubnose i was right alongside you mousy miss oh yes seasons of trainin yknow camouflage an all that dodge an bob duck an weave disguises too dyou want to see me become a daisy or a bally buttercup mariel was smiling as she dusted herself off on the pathside but she chided the garrulous hare very clever tarquin but you cant come with melts far too dangerous tarquin adjusted the fastenings of an oversized haversack filled to bursting with food balderdash young un absolute piffle and gillyswoggle im goin my own way just keepin you company on the road to see you dont practice any more ditch divin come on step out lively now leftrightleftrightleitright an all that mariel kept pace with him jogging to match his lanky stride well as long as you know you cant come all the way with me but why are we walking so fast tarquin kept on pawing it out at the double goin to be late for lunch if we dont move smartly come on now keep up it was about lunchtime that they rounded a bend in the path to find dandin awaiting them with a wild summer salad he had gathered to garnish the bread and cheese together with a flask of elderberry cordial he was cooling beneath an overhanging willow the young mouse waved to them hi there good job you made it another moment or two and i was going to start without you mariel placed her paws on her hips chin jutting out angrily what in the name of fur are you doing here dandin smiled disarmingly oh its all a bit of a mystery really the mousemaid turned on tarquin and you how did you know he was here you great lolloping flopear its a plot thats what it is you set this up between you tarquin sprawled on the grass and began constructing a giant cheese and salad sandwich steady on there missy i was waitin outside the north wicker gate for you to appear right through the bally night then about an hour before dawn young dandin here pops out so i merely told him to get a move on an wed meet him further up the road for a spot of lunch rather civilized dont ythink mariel was fuming with temper but she plumped herself down and began eating because the walk had given her an appetite through mouthfuls of food she berated the smiling duo you can wipe those silly smiles off your whiskers you are not coming with me either of you is that crystal clear they both munched away smiling and winking at each other as they nodded agreement with the furious mousemaid when lunch was finished dandin repacked his knapsack and thrust the marvelous scabbarded sword into his cord girdle rightyo tarkers lets get moving i wonder if this pretty mousemaid is going our way dyou think shed like to walk with us doubtless old lad well string along with her a piece dyknow shes an excellent ditch diver you shouldve seen her this mornin looped the loop graceful as yplease straight into the jolly old ditch on her snout stonefaced and in high dudgeon mariel marched on between them tarquin and dandin made perilously light of the situation i say mr woodsorrel thats a strange noise those grasshoppers are making not the confounded grasshoppers laddie buck sounds like some wild creature nearby grindin their teeth hmm not very good for the old molars that temper temper look out shes swinging that knotty rope thing by midafternoon mariel had simmered down somewhat she even let slip the odd smile or giggle at the antics of her comical traveling companions and at one point deigned to talk to them its getting very hot what do you say we take a rest in the shade have a snack and then push on until dark the suggestion was well received they flopped down gratefully with their backs against a treetopped oak when they had eaten all three napped for a while but the long summer day took its toll what was meant to be a short rest for hot dusty eyes turned into quite a lengthy sleep oo dandin was wakened by a paw across his mouth he gave a muffled cry as tarquin hissed a warning ssshh not a sound the young mouse sat up carefully and looked around mariel was standing still as a statue her gullwhacker at the ready the hare bent an ear in the direction of the woodlands opposite somebeast is stalking us he breathed to them both over there behind that yew thicket im sure dandin go with mariel to the left ill take the right well jump the blighter an turn the tables in our favor go paw by paw they crept forward listening to the rustle of the thicket where it was plain some creature was moving about skirting to the left they made out a dark shape in the shadows tarquin yelled out the signal up an at him throwing themselves headlong the three friends pounced upon the miscreant yow ouch whoo eeek yarrgh lerrimgo gerroff young durry quill watched them as they hopped and leaped about like boiled frogs yelling in pain at the spikes embedded in paws and bodies that they had collected from him in their mad plunge he twitched his nose serves ee right fer jumpin on a young lad like that aint you beasts got no manners at all mariel hopped about in agony and frustration ah ah you sure you havent brought the rest along with you ooh ooh i wouldnt be surprised to see mellus simeon and the abbot leap out from behind that hornbeam yonder how many more of you are there am i taking the whole population of redwall along with me ow ooch durry was quite amused at the idea heehee he snickered aloud no no tis only me alone now do you stop a leapin round an let me get those spikes out ill fix ee up never fear they waited in painful silence as durry quill nipped the spikes out with his teeth working smoothly and easily he made a large wad of dockleaf wild cloves and rowan berries ere rub this on where you be stickled twill ease all pains dandin was surprised and delighted it worked like a charm a short space of time and it felt as if he had never encountered a hedgehog spike early evening found them back on the north path with durry explaining himself to the other three travelers my ol nuncle gabe ee wants me to be a cellar og its a good job mind but a young un wants to see summat afore he settles hisself down to a life of cordial wine an ales ho yes i eard all about it ee miz mariel an i couldnt sleep for thinkin about it durry i says to myself durry a young og would be right honnered to tread the roads wi such a fearless mousemaid so i packs me sack gives you a liddle start there i tells a whopper i overslep really anywise i follered ee an ere i be fit as a flea fat as a beetle an ready fer ought they laughed heartily at the honest and earnest hedgehog dandin pointed up the road look theres a ford coming up i can see the sun glinting off the waters hope its not too deep for us to cross quick as a flash a big heron flapped down on the path in front of them his sticklike legs bent as the long snaking neck curved itself ready for a strike the fierce circular eyes contracted and dilated angrily a dangerous pale yellow beak pointed down at them irrrrrraktaan this is my waterrrrrrr rrrrrrun for yourrrrrr lives back come near irrrrrraktaans waterrrrr and you die i am irrrraktaan mighty killerrrrrr graypatchs eye came close to pakatugg and the searats tone was wheedling almost friendly now then matey you know the lay o the land ereabouts dont be afeared of old graypatch or none of this riffraff aboard the darkqueen you just tell me about all the snug little berths an cosy coves in this neck o the woods pakatugg felt a little bolder now that the searat captain had untied his paws and taken the noose from about his neck but he was quite nervous about the horde of grinning searats who lounged on the deck around him this one called graypatch though he sounded different maybe they could talk reasonably feeling naked without his blowpipe and darts pakatugg did his best to muster up a commanding tone theres not much at all in this region youve come to the wrong place far norths where you want to be thats where all you types usually land graypatch bent his head to one side and winked at the squirrel aharr is that so what scurvy luck fer us eh still never you mind weve landed up here an here well stay now ill ask you again messmate nice an polite as you please i want somewhere with peace an plenty to settle down now where dyou suppose thatd be pakatugg mistook graypatchs reassuring manner for weakness and he decided to take a firm line with this ragamuffin rat and his tawdry bunch after all the hares always did it and creatures took notice of them look ive told you once youre wasting your time around here up north is much better for vermin like you still smiling graypatch kicked him in the stomach knocking him to the deck looping a rope around pakatuggs footpaws he rasped out an order haul away buckos pakatugg swung upsidedown in midair suspended above the deck as a gang of searats yanked him higher and higher on the rope graypatch shook his head sadly did yhear that mates he called us vermin pakatugg swallowed hard and closed his eyes as he heard weapons being drawn the searat captain squinted his good eye at the hanging squirrel have ye ever fed the fishes squirrel nno what ddo you ffeed em on a harsh roar of laughter went up from the crew graypatch drew his sword what do we feed em on why you of course those liddle fishesd be right partial to squirrel carved up into tasty strips he slashed at the end of the rope which was secured to the mast pakatugg came down on the deck with a bump graypatch drew a curved dagger from his belt using his sword blade like a butchers steel he rubbed them together putting a fine edge to the dagger blade he grabbed the squirrel by the ear and brandished the dagger with a fearsome yell start from the top and work down to the tail thats the best way no wait theres an abbey not far from here theyve got it all food shelter plunder the lot spare me please graypatch put up his weapons and aimed a kick at the blubbering squirrel ere ringtail dripnose take im below an put im in chains dont be too gentle now and dont feed the slug too well when im ready hell take us to this abbey place aint that right squirrel pakatugg nodded vigorously his tears staining the deck oo colonel clary brigadier thyme and hon rosie had stopped near the sand dunes to take refreshment and a short rest clary was lying back voicing his thoughts to the other two no trouble so far wot longeyes must have spotted the burntout ship a bit further up the coast well patrol further up and camp on the jolly old seashore tonight might even try a shellfish stew eh rosie long time since youve cooked one if we dont catch sight of any bother by tomorrow afternoon late well head back to salamandastron there was a whooshing noise and a trident buried itself in the sand not a pawslength from thyme ears down chaps attack throwing themselves flat facing three directions the long patrol started instinctively pushing the sand around them into a barrier the croaking of countless natterjacks filled the dunes dig your slings and stones out too many for lances clary called to his companions by the left this is all we need that villain oykamon and his slimy mob attackin us when were out on a mission by the right center and by the cringe ill show em hon rosie slung a flat pebble at a toad charging over the hill it connected with a splat knocking the toad out like a light whoohahahahoohah she whooped that bagged the blighter im pretty fair at slingin ill get that big fat rogue you watch whoohahahahoohah good shot rosie thyme waggled a paw in his ear between launching off missiles stone me rosie you could scare em all off with that pesky laughin of yours whoohahahaoohah you are a card thyme no mistake watch that feller to your left oh never mind ill lay him out howzat middle an stump clary got two toads with one of his special bouncing shots corks i say there must be squillions of the reptiles were goin to run out of stones before they run out of soldiers i suspect thyme banged the heads of two venturesome toads who had climbed the barricade and they both fell back senseless one thing you can say about big chief oykamon he keeps his word he said hed be back with a full complement were on a sticky wicket clary old lad any ideas colonel clary glanced up at the sky before launching off another stone funny you should say that thyme matter of fact ive come up with a pretty good wheeze actually itll soon be evenin now the minute it starts gettin darkish keep your eyes peeled for a sight of the old arch baddie himself oykamon rosie youre the best shot choose yourself a jolly good big pebble i want him knocked out cold thatll upset the lads of the sandhills and theyll probly crowd round to see if hes dead then well make a run for it go straight for the sea just about pawdeep and keep goin north toads arent too fussy on salt water so theyll give up following us if we sprint fast enough hows your throwin paw rosie old gel tophole dont fret clary ill put the old bandit asleep until this time next season now lets see which is m biggest stone oh this ones rather pretty nice little stickyout bits whoohahahahoohah luck was on the side of the long patrol that evening and clarys plan ran true to form illuminated by two lanterns oykamon appeared atop a nearby dune his bulging throat pulsating in and out as he bellowed krroikl you were warned longears now you will die knowing the power and might of oykamon krrrikk hon rosie popped up twirling the large rock in her slingshot shall i bowl him a googly clary certainly rosie old gel shut the fat blighter up the rock flew straight and hard whacking oykamon with a force that sent him head over webs clary and thymes slings took the lantern holders out immediately the dunes and shore became a mass of natterjacks croaking and clicking with dismay they hopped speedily over to their fallen leader the hares of the long patrol were up and gone with a turn of speed that would have left a hunting hawk flabbergasted they splashed along the shoreline in the failing light a red bronze sun turning the wavelets to liquid gold as they skimmed and bounced excellent shot rosie an absolute bullseye wot rather he did a full double backflip when that rock beezed him oh dyou think so thanks awfully chaps whoohahahahoohah dandin spread his paws wide back off this bird means business mariel sprang forward the heron struck and she dodged sideways narrowly getting clear of the huge pointed beak which left a deep dent in the path mariel get back hell kill you dandin yelled the heron hopped in on spindly legs flapping his wide wings and screeching irrrraktaan will spearrrrr your hearrrrrt irrrrraktaan knows no fearrrr mariel rolled over and over keeping a fraction ahead of the murderous stabbing beak a movement caught iraktaans quick eye and he glanced to one side there was durry quill rolling past him in a tight ball the heron struck at the hedgehog but his beakpoint encountered a hard spike and bounced back with a pinging noise the moments breathing space was all mariel needed she whirled gullwhacker and struck iraktaan across the legs right on the narrow knee joints the knotted rope wrapped round the herons legs several times he tried to move but crashed to the ground immediately tarquin was there he sat across the middle of iraktaans neck before the great bird could start flapping its wings dandin passed the remainder of the rope across them and stood on the ropes end durry quill tugged and chewed at some bindweed snapping several lengths off ere tie that burd up wi some o this tarquin grabbed a strand and wound it round and round the clacking beak dandin took the rest and hobbled iraktaans legs securely passing it through the joint of one wing and knotting it off breathing heavily they stood up mariel disengaged gullwhacker from the herons legs and whirled it close to the birds head be still be still i say or ill scramble your silly brains the herons eyes rolled madly but he lay still feathers in disarray hissing and blowing through his fearsome beak dandin unsheathed the sword of martin and placed the point at iraktaans crop when we are gone you will be able to free yourself but hear what i say iraktaan follow us and i will slay you with this sword it has taken more lives than there are feathers on your body i am dandin the sword carrier and you can believe my word we wish only to cross the ford in peace stay where you are wait until we are gone then loose yourself iraktaan wriggled a bit and made stifled noises but they ignored him the ford appeared neither too wide or deep but with masses of long trailing weeds waving beneath the surface tarquin took a few paces back as if he were going to rush at it with a hop leap and jump wish me luck chaps here goes dandin stood barring his path wait tarquin remember the old saying look before you leap of course old lad well ive bally well looked and now im goin to jolly well leap oh no youre not i say dandin youve become rather bossy since you started wearin that blinkin sword my name is dandin the sword carrier eh righto give me one good reason why i shouldnt leap and i shant dandin recited the words of the poem which he had memorized this trail brings death with every pace beware of dangers lurking there sticklegs of the feathered race and fins that in the ford do stir well as you can see weve already met the sticklegs iraktaan took care of that our next hazard is fins that in the ford do stir lets try out an idea before we attempt crossing together they went to the waters edge dandin took a crust of bread from his knapsack and tossed it into the ford it drifted on the surface of the water they stood watching the bread like a small goldencrusted boat it moved slowly downstream on the calm river durrey did not seem too impressed my old nuncled say that theres a waste o good food quick as a lightning flash a mighty silver blackbanded body whooshed out of the weeds there was an explosion of water a gleam of needlelike teeth a huge splash and the ford returned to its former calm durry quill grabbed hold of mariels sleeve tightly sufferin spikes what were that tarquin sat down in the dust looking decidedly shaky pike old lad an absolute whopper a fish like thatd rip you up as soon as look at you dandin im never backward in comin forward you were right dandin was pacing the ford edge look theres more than one much more peering carefully into the reeds they were able to make out at least eight of the long sleek bodies noseon to the current they backed water fully grown hookjawed and totally dangerous mariel sat down with tarquin time for thinking caps glad you came with me after all they sat in silence watching the setting sun sink beneath the trees durry quill drew patterns in the dust mayhap we need a bridge tarquin snorted right you are lets start buildin one right away shouldnt take us long middle of next season with a bit of luck durry snorted back at him if brains was bees thered be no honey between your ears why from where im a sittin i can see a great dead tree lirnb among yon bushes whats to stop us usin it as a bridge the hare stood up bowing gracefully to the young hedgehog profuse apologies an all that young master quill forgive me the excellence of your suggestion is only surpassed by your good looks and keen intelligence oo placed across the ford the thick dead tree limb looked wobbly and unsafe as mariel tested it she noted the position of the voracious pike see the fish have come out of the weeds theyre all waiting both sides of our bridge just beneath the surface wed better not put a paw wrong crossing that thing mariel decided that she would go first stepping onto the branch she wound gullwhacker about her neck and held her paws wide to give herself a bit of stability the mousemaid paced forward carefully the branch shaking slightly beneath her tread hungry pike nosed closer their underslung jaws agape as they watched her dont look down mariel dandin called out keep your eyes straight ahead on the other side youre doing fine now she had reached the center the branch dipped slightly its underside touching the water a pike butted the branch with its curving mouth causing it to wobble dangerously mariel went down on all fours gripping the bridge firmly she waited until it ceased moving then scampered across swiftly leaping the final part and landing safe on the other side of the ford well crossed young mouse well crossed i say whos next dandin elected to try with mariel sitting on one end of the makeshift bridge and tarquin holding the other end down dandin held the sword in both paws straight out in front it helped to balance him the young mouse had a surprising natural agility despite the pike nosing against the branch he made it across with ease even leaping ashore with a fancy twirl of the sword tarquin nudged durry quill your turn old chap the young hedgehog blinked his eyes and gulped if i turns out t be a fishs supper tell my old nuncle gabriel that i love him dear an i was athinkin of him even as i was bein ate ah well cmon durry brace up quill if ydont try now ynever will with these few poetic lines durry scuttled out across the branch on all fours it shook and wobbled furiously the others held their breath not wanting to call out advice lest they should upset him the hedgehog was at the center of the bridge when a monstrous pike hurled itself clear of the water arching its sinuous body as it slammed forcibly into the branch durry plopped off into the ford yelling as the pike closed in on him im athinkin of ee nuncle gabe heeeeeelp eulaliaaaaa tarquin l woodsorrel came tearing out along the branch half in and half out of the water the branch flopping up and down madly into the ford grabbing durry by the snout he swung him clear of the pikes jaws kicking one pike savagely and braining another with his harolina the hare carried straight on with his mad dash he sprinted out of the water with durry held tight a damaged harolina and a big female pike latched onto him its teeth sunk into his bobtail tarquin let go of durry and performed a mad war dance on the bank yahwoo leggo ybeast leggo mariel twirled gullwhacker and struck the pike batting it with all her might it separated from tarquins tail and shot through the air landing in the ford with an awkward splosh hooray durry cheered i aint ate and were all safe n dry hah im glad youre pleased young quill look at me a chunk of m bottom and half a tailbob missin whatll hon rosie say when she sees my handsome form disfigured they made camp in a forest glade farther up the road as night fell mariel and dandin setting out the supper tarquin repairing his harolina whilst durry quill put together one of his sovereign poultices for the hares nether end mariel conversed quietly with her friend as they sat eating dandin where did you get that beautiful sword youd never believe if i told you mariel but it came to me in a dream a dream surely youre not serious oh but i am strange though i dreamed i saw a mouse in full armor he just stood there watching me and smiling i felt so peaceful and friendly and at ease with him it was wonderful he said to me dandin go with mariel just those four words then he took his sword and scabbard and laid them at my side i knew it was only a dream a dream which i wanted to last forever but it didnt when i woke before dawn there were the sword and scabbard by my side it must have been the spirit of martin the warrior he founded our abbey martin is guardian of redwall they say he comes whenever the abbey or its creatures are in danger i always thought it was just a nice story until he visited me ill never forget it mariel the mousemaid crumbled a piece of bread and watched the ants bearing the fragments away her face a strange picture of wonderment as you were speaking dandin i remembered it all came back i dreamed of your martin last night he was just as you described him a wonderful brave figure he said be brave mariel follow your hearts desire he was there in my dreams one moment and gone the next i know what you mean when you say youll never forget i was so sad when he disappeared anybeast want more soup if not ill just have whats left in the pot t keep me goin through the old night watches wot i say dandin can you recall the next part of that rhyme thingummy the young mouse thought of his friend saxtus as he spoke the lines after the ford one night one day seek out the otter and his wife forsake the path go westlands way find the trail and lose your life durry sniffed as he beat tarquin to the last of the soup lackaday that sounds cheerful dont it i wonder who the otter n his wife be night closed in on the few red embers of the campfire in the glade as the travelers lay to rest tarquin with his harolina durry with a welllicked soup bowl mariel with her gullwhacker and dandin with the strange ancient sword of martin the warrior orgeye of the waveblade had dropped anchor in terramort cove earlier that same evening confining his crew to shipboard he strode up to fort bladegirt aware of the reception he would receive coming back emptyclawed gabool was in a murderous mood even the slaves were hiding and dared not attend him the king of the searats had gone past sleeping his eyes were completely bloodred but he quivered with a furious nervous energy roaming the banqueting hall drinking wine straight from the flagon orgeye walked in without knocking gabool did not acknowledge him at first but strode about shouting look look at this halfcooked seabird still with the feathers hanging from it he hurled the silver platter splattering food across the walls not a slave to look after my needs me the ruler of all seas wine this tastes more like vinegar theyre tryin to poison me thats it they cant get me while im asleep because i wont go to sleep no sleep no rest for gabool he appeared to notice orgeye for the first time saltar no it cant be i slew him haharr its orgeye my old grogmate belay there i knew you wouldnt let gabool down i knew out of all those slopbacks youd be the one to bring me back the darkqueen an greypatchs mangy skull orgeye moved away until the big table was between him and the warlord gabool listen i scoured the seas to the far west from here and past the horizon i searched the bare rocks and small islands until i ran short of vittles an water for the crew an meself theres no sign of graypatch at all wherever hes taken the darkqueen to well never find him on my oath the flagon narrowly missed orgeye it smashed upon the door cascading bloodred wine everywhere gabool looked madly about for something else to throw garrr you lyin traitor you useless mudsuckin scum if you couldnt find him westard you should have sailed south orgeye was backing toward the door he did not want to be in the same room with this mad creature hold fast there gabool take it easy i only put in to terramort for fresh provisions you say go south right then ill take the waveblade on a southern course soon as ive taken fresh vittles aboard gabool drew his sword and advanced foaming at the mouth vittles you bottlenosed trash vittles ill give ye vittles bucko ill carve yer tripes out and feed em to your scurvy crew set course south an gerrout o me sight you dont get a crust o my bread or a drop of water until you bring me the darkqueen an graypatchs head orgeye barely had time to slam the door and run gabool was tugging and pulling as he cursed and his sword was buried deep in the heavy oak door behind him the bell tolled once he heaved the sword blade from the door and came at the bell silence dye hear me silence boomin an bongin away night an day so a body cant even sleep ill teach yer a lesson two dormouse slaves peering through a crack in the door watched fascinated as the king of searats attacked a bell with his sword the bell clashed and clanged as gabool hammered at it both claws gripping his curved blade the onesided fight could have only one possible outcome the sword blade snapped against the great bell and gabool lay facedown upon the stone floor panting and sobbing as the metallic echoes of the bell swirled around the banqueting hall the dormouse slave turned to his companion did you see that aye that i did it looks like his majesty is two waves short of a tide whoever saw a rat fight a bell right mate and look he lost the great gabools cryin on the floor like a baby squirrel whos lost his acorns hahahaha the laughter rang through into the hall as the two slaves fled back into hiding gabool gritted his teeth at the bell go on laugh yer great brazen lump laugh away but next time ill get a bigger sword oo abbot bernard sat at late supper with simeon mellus and gabriel quill foremole wandered in and sat picking at the barely touched food on the table burr maisters no news of ee young uns then simeon felt the round firmness of an apple as he polished it on his sleeve no news as yet foremole but dont worry theyve got everything on their sideyouth health strength and a sense of adventure i wish that i were with them old as i am mother mellus tapped the table fretfully i wish i were with them too id tan that dandins hide until he turned blue the disobedient little wretch

quiet sort of og good worker too if you were to ask me id say as ee were led astray by that storm gullywhacker my word shes a wild un fer a liddle mouse that she is if the three were gone together then i think it is for the best mother mellus pushed aside her plate how can you say that simeon because either dandin or mariel has the spirit of martin the warrior walking alongside them though i am not sure which one it is abbot bernard looked thankfully toward his friend well bless the seasons tell me more of this friend simeon mellus ever the big practical badger mother stood up from the table im off to my bed cant stop around here all night with young uns missing and you lot yarning away bout longdead warriors martin or no martin first thing tomorrow im putting that big otter wotsisname flagg out on their trail hell bring the rascals back when she had gone blind simeon began recounting his strange but wondrous experience it happened last night as i sat dozing in my chair by the window oh pour me some october ale will you gabe my throats a bit dry somewhere out in the darkness a young blackbird chirruped as its mother drew it under her wing against the allenveloping night oo dawn broke gray with an unexpected shroud of drizzling rain the four travelers were abroad early continuing their northward trek upon the path the flatlands to the west had been left behind after the ford now the forest closed in either side of the path pretty good this wot the jolly old trees leaning over are like an umbrella dontcha think durry shook himself no i dont if taint churnin up the path into mud this rain is a drippin off those trees onto the back of ee neck still as my old nuncle allus says if it be rainin then there do be water pourin from the sky mariel smiled and winked at tarquin a wise fellow your old uncle durry nodded in innocent agreement oh aye nuncle gabes never short of wise sayins there do be no better way o eatin than with ee mouth a full barrels not an empty un an ee can allus tell a squirrel by his tail tarquin chuckled as he tuned his harolina hmm that makes sense durry sniffed a course it do bet you never seed a squirrel wiout one o those lollopin great bushy tails did you er ah no dont spose i did really there that goes to show ee then you can allus tell a squirrel by his tail jus like my nuncle says dandin kept in close to the pathside the rains getting heavier there was a distant roll of thunder lightning illuminated the sky as they trudged on durry whispered to dandin lookit mariels dropped back tears to me shes shiverin an unappy about summat they hurried back to mariel she was clutching herself rain dripping from her face and paws shivering as she faltered along the path dandin looked worried mariel whats the matter with you the mousemaid leaned against a spruce tree thunder the rain and the lightning reminded me of being thrown in the sea by gabool terramort my father tarquin took charge golly you look like a whitewashed duck old thing here dandin lend a paw well get her under some dry trees and light a fire shed better rest up until this lot clears slightly off the path on the east side they found a fir grove durry dug a shallow pit and kindled a small fire with dead branches and dry pine needles with her back against a fir mariel sat dozing soaking in the warmth of the fragrant dry atmosphere beyond the trees the rain pounded hard against the path sending up brown splotches as it churned the dust to mud durry brewed some sage and mint tea and they sipped the steaming liquid gratefully about halfway through the morning dandin became aware that they were being watched by something crouching in the grass on their left slowly he unsheathed the sword signaling with his eyes to tarquin and durry all three rose quietly and moved toward the long grass until they could see the watcher it was a large snake dandin had never seen a snake before though he had heard many stories at redwall of the dangerous poisonteeth he felt a shiver convulse his whole body at the sight of the slithering coils the flickering tongue and the twin beads of cold ruthlessness of the reptiles eyes it came clear of the long grass hissing and weaving its head from side to side as it menaced them dandin unsheathed his sword whispering to tarquin what do we do now it looks very dangerous the hare took the nearest weapon to paw his haversack of food he stood at ease swinging it experimentally as he replied nothing to worry about really old bean see those black markings on the things back well thats supposed to be an adder camouflage i think the bally creatures a bit small for an adder take my word laddie theres lots of harmless grass snakes who mark themselves up with plant dyes an whatnot just so travelers like you an i will think theyre adders an become frightened of em dandin kept his sword pointed at the serpents head dyou think so tarquin course i do old son the confident hare snorted the blighters a fraud a blinkin charlatan right then you dreadful snake thingy move out or ill brain you on the bonce with this havvysack dyou hear the snake however had other ideas it had fixed its reptilian stare on durry quill and was gliding slowly toward him durry stood rooted to the spot trembling and unable to move under the hypnotic spell of the reptiles evil eyes oo sitting in a halfslumber mariel gradually noticed that some creature was talking to her she opened her eyes partially and saw the armorclad figure of the dream mouse warrior whom dandin had called martin his voice was strong and stern mariel rise up your friends are in danger rise up mariel the mousemaids eyes snapped open she took in the situation at a single glance throwing caution to the winds she acted swiftly the snakes eyes were fixed on durry as mariel grabbed her gullwhacker with a mad silent dash and a mighty leap the mousemaid jumped clear over the snakes head bringing the knotted rope down with a mighty crack on the reptiles flat head as she traveled through the air the snake instantly dropped like a limp piece of cord stunned by the sudden impact of the blow durry are you all right durry speak to me the young hedgehog blinked and rubbed his eyes as dandin flung a beaker of cold sage and mint tea into his friends face phwaaw id sooner be in yon ford wi pikes than lookin at that bad thing i dont reckon that were no grass snake tarquin took a quick close look at the snake which was beginning to recover speedily nor do i old fellah still a chaps allowed a mistake or two wot the bally things a real adder oh not a fully grown one ill grant you but nevertheless dandin grabbed the hare shoving him out upon the rainspattered path quick lets get out of here were not stopping to argue with an adder come on the rainll put those fire embers out grabbing their packs they dashed out of the grove onto the path stumbling and squelching as the snakes angry hiss sounded behind them oo mariel felt much better as she ran alongside her companions pounding along the muddy path with the rain bouncing off them they kept up a breakneck pace until they were certain the adder was far behind them farther along the road they halted heads bowed panting and blowing as they fought to regain their breath dandin glared at tarquin dont ever do that again friend tarquin shrugged nonchalantly sorry old bean how was know durry shuddered you shouldve chopped offen its head wi that sword when you ad the chance dandin mariel shook her head no we do not need unnecessary killing durry as long as we are safe and in one piece the adder has a right to life the same as any creature oo by early afternoon the black cloud had shifted the rain halted abruptly and a warm wind chased broken white clouds across a blue sky considerably brightened by the sun the companions took food upon the path walking as they ate steam and vapor rose from their wet fur and clothing as they tramped northward durrys spirits rose even to performing a passable imitation of tarquins flippant attitude ho i say old bean be that a wood pigeon or a great eagle blow me i do believe its carryin me off over the jolly ol treetops to eat me all up ho dearie me i dont spose its a wood pigeon mustve made a jolly ol mistake wot wot tarquin took the ragging in his carefree stride well roast my aunts chestnuts was that a hedgehog or a noisy pincushion no it couldnt be i spose it was a jolly old talkin gooseberry bit too spiky to bake in a pie so somebeast slung it out onto the path and its followin us mariel looped gullwhacker swiftly about tarquins shoulders look out its an adder just dropped out of a tree yaaagh whoohooh dont do that miss you frightened me half t death dandin had been watching the way ahead he pointed forward look theres the otter and his wife durry kept up his banter no taint its the frog an his granfather but dandin was sure of what he could see stop fooling around durry cant you see look on the left side of the path further on it is the otter and his wife mariel smiled yes youre right dandin though i never thought the otter and his wife would look like that it was an illtempered and pawsore crew that blundered their way through mossflower led by pakatugg whom graypatch prodded ahead of them by swordpoint far behind them the darkqueen lay hidden in the creek bigfang as usual was voicing his thoughts aloud we could be traipsin anywheres mates i reckon were lost leavin darkqueen deserted like that me an kybo or any couple of us could have stayed back as sentries i tell yer mates its a bad omen us lost out ere in the forest an darkqueen wiout a guard to watch her graypatch gritted his teeth pushing the reluctant hedgehog pathfinder forward he called back that loudmouth sounds like bigfang again dont worry matey i can hear ye if you like to go back an mount sentry on darkqueen dont let me stop yer take kybo too if yeve a mind aye ycan laze about on the ships deck while yer messmates do all the marchin an fightin for you is that what ye want bigfang knew he was trying graypatchs patience but he continued hoping for some support from the rest of the searats its not like the open sea messmates this filthy jungles so thick you cant tell thither from yon aye i still reckons were lost an it aint right leavin our only ship undefended graypatch tugged on the halter around pakatuggs neck bringing him up sharp his single eye glared so hard at bigfang that the complaining searat took a step back graypatchs tone was dangerously level right bucko get back to the ship go on take two more with yeh if one o gabools craft sailed up that creek fully crewed what dyer think three or even four could do against it eh nothin not a thing addlebrain the snips safe layin hidden in that backwater nobeast is goin to find her i need every fightin rat ive got for what lays ahead now get marchin afore i cuts yer adrift an leaves you for lost in these woods one more word from ye bigfang thats all just one peep unaccustomed to the foreign woodland the crew stumbled on for the remainder of the day insectbitten and nettlestung thrashing at the undergrowth with dagger and cutlass graypatch led his sullen band whilst muttering dire threats to pakatugg on the consequences of leading them astray oo evening shades were drawing close as graypatch and his crew sighted redwall abbey the searat captain tugged sharply on the rope halter dragging the miserable pakatugg back from the path into the cover of mossflower woods graypatch pricked the squirrels chin with his dagger tip so thats redwall abbey eh mate you did well i dont reckon thered be as cozy a berth within a seasons march of here bigfang hefted a spear come on lets rip em apart an take the place kybo and the others moved forward weapons at the ready as bigfang took up the lead position greypatch tripped him he fell heavily half rising to find greypatchs sword edge at his throat didnt take yer long to vote yerself in as captain round ere did it bigfang you said it was a cozy berth lets take it lessn youre scared graypatch kicked bigfang flat on his back his single eye watching the rebellious crewrat scornfully careful isnt scared mate im careful who knows how many are behind those walls or what manner of creatures they are all thats got to be found out then well have the measure o them now take you bigfang youre not scared are yer bucko no youre stupid thickeaded an dimwitted thats you harken you scum anyone wants to challenge me as capn let that rat do it now an well settle it right ere there was a murmur and a shuffle from among the large rough contingent but no rat took up the challenge graypatch nodded with satisfaction he swung his sword and cut through a tuft of bigfangs whiskers before turning confidently away from his former adversary good thats as it should be im capn ere me graypatch twas me that brought you ere without me youd still be servin crazy gabool wonderin whod be next to feed the fishes worryin whether youd looked at him the wrong way an were due to wake up with a dagger in yer back trust me lads an well live off the fat othe land ranzo stood alongside graypatch brandishing a cutlass were with you capn you just issue orders an well be there graypatch lounged against a tree and plucked a lowhanging pear lookit that will yer vittles agrowin on trees by thunder what well do is this well drop anchor ere for the night then at the crack o dawn tomorrow when theyre all nice an peaceful well drop over an pay em a visit he threw the halter over a limb of the tree tugging it slightly so that the miserable pakatugg had to stand on tippaws as fer you matey you stand by ere ill need you on the morrow dont try any funny moves now or there wont be only pears hangin from this tree simeon stood upon the west wall ramparts with his friend the abbot as they did most evenings before turning in more rain tomorrow do you think simeon no bernard it will be a fine hot summerday with hardly a cloud in the sky the weather should stay fine for mariel and her party i wonder where they are now who can say rushing and dashing off on quests and adventures it must be nice to be young and have all that energy simeon smiled talking about energy and youthfulness i think i hear mellus coming from the woods with her party of dibbuns i hope their wildberrygathering expedition was a success abbot bernard folded his paws into the wide habit sleeves success or not maybe it has tired them out and theyll sleep soundly tonight where are they now simeon the blind herbalist inclined his head to one side listening carefully just coming out of the woodlands slightly northeast of here can you see them yet bernard ah yes poor mellus looks as if shes had a full day of it rather her than me i used to take them out when i was younger but we never had a pair like those little otter twins bagg and runn then dont think i could put up with a full days wildberry gathering in mossflower with that pair mellus has seen us shes waving simeon turned in the direction of the badger and waved back mother mellus how did the berry gathering go today melluss gruff boom rang up from the path below it was good simeon i got some herbs that you may need too arrowhead motherwort pennybright oh and some slippery elm bark thank you friend i hope bagg and runn behaved themselves surprisingly they did those two collected more berries than the rest put together that little mole grubb was the naughty one today the wretch covered me in stickybuds while i took my lunchtime nap then he began eating the berries the other dibbuns had collected and he tied three little mices tails together with vines next time he can stay behind in the kitchens and help friar alder to peel vegetables where is he now hey come back here you little rip baby grubb had run off in the opposite direction from the abbey and was scuttling along at a fair rate away he went up the north path chattering to himself burr oim agoen to foind aventures wi gullywhacker an ee others mother mellus broke into a shambling run come back this instant you little rogue youre going to bed grubb trotted off the path into the woodlands graypatch and frink hiding behind a broad oak watched the infant mole unsuspectingly coming toward them the searat captain held a noosed rope ready there aint nothin like a baby ostage to make things easy he whispered to his crewrat grubb trundled along oblivious to all about him he needed a weapon if he was going to join the travelers on their adventure right next to the broad oak was a sycamore sprout little more than a thin stick grubb began heaving and tugging upon it hurr thisll do oi eell make a gurt spearer ho urr as graypatch opened the noose to cast it over grubbs head mother mellus swept the tiny mole up with one huge paw unaware of the searats got you mischiefskin right mladdo bed for you with no supper what have you been told about pulling young trees up by the roots just wait until abbot bernard hears about this you wretch graypatch had pulled back behind the oak he and frink held their breath as mellus strode off with a loudly protesting grubb under her arm boohurr let oi go missus oi wants aventures ill give you adventures you rip adventures in bed gurr when oi get ter be a biggun oill spank ee furr thiz frink wiped his brow and sat down heavily shiver me sails capn did you see the size of that ol badger did i now ysee what i said earlier is true frink careful is best if wed roped the liddle mole that ol badger

its straight off to bed without any go on hurry and get washed up or itll all be gone grubb smiled one of his most winning smiles at his benefactor oi knowed you wudden let a hinfant starve youm a gudd beast zurr simeon joined the abbot to follow up mellus and her herd of dibbuns ah simeon smell that young cockleburr makes the finest cornflower custard ive ever tasted can you smell it simeon looked pensive hmmm i think my senses are trying to tell me something and its not the smell of custard bernard its its oh its probably nothing friend lets go inside youre right that custard does smell delicious oo the four travelers stood facing the rock which reared up from the earth on the west side of the path mariel looked up at it so thats the otter and his wife i expected real otters not a great lump of stone still it does look very lifelike i wonder who carved it tarquin rubbed his paw up and down the smooth brown rock somebeast mustve done this when the land was young more seasons ago than we could ever imagine jolly fine work wot i think the rock once looked naturally like an otter and his wife whoever did it only had to improve on what mother nature had already started eh dandin nodded agreement the rock was a sort of double lump looking not unlike a male otter standing on his hindpaws with a female otter sitting at his side long ago some clever creature had carved the details of the otters faces into the stone giving them a very lifelike appearance the four friends made night camp at the base of the figures on the woodland side tinder and flint kindled a small fire tarquin taking his turn as cook decided on candied dried plums sweet chestnut scones and dandelion cordial they sat around the bright flames which provided an island of golden light against the gloomy vault of the forest in front of them dandin recited the next stanza of the rhyme which provided guide rules for their quest seek out the otter and his wife forsake the path go westlands way find the trail and lose your life when in the woods this promise keep with senses sharp and open eyes my nose shall not send me to sleep for buried ones will surely rise durry quills eyes were drooping he was beginning to nod and frogs will fly on mayday morn while fishes sing aloud at dawn huh i cant make top nor tail of it it all sounds like nonsense to a pore lad whos been hippotized by a serpent mariel stirred the fire with a green twig it may sound like gobbledygook but its proved true so far durry well just have to wait until its light and find out for ourselves i suppose what dyou say tarquin the hare nibbled on a candied plum reflectively dont know really old gel ysee ive never patrolled this far up north strange country very strange take these woodlands west of the path theyre not even mapped yknow im not sure theyre even part of mossflower dandin hunched closer to the fire im certain theyre not they dont have that comfortable homey feeling you always get in mossflower woods this area looks wilder more grim hostile somehow but as you say mariel well find out for ourselves tomorrow i take it we have this statue of the otter and his wife to use as a bearing point and strike out west from it sssnnnnggggghhhhrrrrr durry quill was not listening he was lying on his back with all four paws in the air making the most uproarous noise tarquin sniffed listen to the beast snorin like a flippin hog just as i was going to play a few tunes on me harolina to cheer us up mariel lay down using her haversack as a pillow oh please its bad enough having a snoring hedgehog without the addition of a caterwauling hare singing lovelorn ditties lets all go to sleep while we have the chance of a full nights rest dandin and mariel soon joined durry in slumber tarquin still sat up a little sulky as he fondled his unplayed harolina caterwaulin indeed shows how much mice know about music now if hon rosie were here ill bet she wouldnt object to a chap havin the odd plunk on the jolly old harolina ah well he fell asleep humming and serenading himself quietly a hare beyond compare so spiffin and so fair oh rosie rosie dear my honey hon i wouldnt swap your affections for a heap of confections not for blackbrry pie oh my oh my october ale would surely fail summer salad couldnt stop my ballad hazelnut puddend just taste wooden as for cheese on toast itd make me weep feel so hungry rosie id better go to sleep overcome by weariness the travelers slept at the fringe of the darkened forest whilst on the path the stone figures of the otter and his wife stood like eternal sentinels in the silent watches of the night oo out at sea a shroudlike fog had dropped completely lost without bearings by the stars or the sight of landmarks orgeye abandoned the helm of the waveblade which had been sailing a southern course until the fog descended he posted two searats with weighted ropes to test overboard for shallows and reefs cursing gabool for his uncontrollable mad temper which had driven them into this unknown position orgeye went below to his bunk to await the coming of dawn oo hidden in mossflower woods a mere stones throw from redwall abbey graypatch and his crew also awaited the arrival of dawn oo pacing his bedchamber in salamandastrons mountain lord rawnblade widestripe awaited yet another dawn knowing that each fresh day brought his time of encounter with the searats a little closer oo wandering the empty halls of fort bladegirt on terramort isle gabool the wild awaited a dawn that would dispel his nightmares of ringing bells badgers and avenging mice in fact there were many different creatures in diverse parts each waiting to see what the new day might bring adventure danger victory defeat peace of mind or death book two the strange forest light tendrils of mist clung to the burgeoning greenery of mossflower woods and the rising sun tinged buttermilk hues across a sky of powder blue in the shimmering peace of dawn graypatch shook dew from his claws as he stamped about restoring circulation around limbs unused to sleeping out in the woodlands deadglim sat gloomily chewing on young dandelion stems sulking because his captain would not allow a fire lest the telltale wisps of smoke betray their position graypatch wiped his sword blade dry as the other searats awoke rubbing sleep from their eyes come on hearties the searat captain chuckled youre like a pack of dormice staggerin about after a hard winter rouse yer carcasses the suns gettin up an its going to be a good day to inspect our new home thank yer lucky stars were not out on the seas therell be a fine old fog there thatll last until noon if you was aboard ship now in blue waters you wouldnt be able to see the tail behind your back hahaha gather round now an listen to me ill tell you about the plan ive got charted for us leave it to ol graypatch well soon be livin like kings flagg the otter was always ready and willing to oblige mother mellus had asked that he track down dandin and durry quill she was sure that a fellow as big and capable as flagg would have them back home at redwall in no time at all determined to start his journey bright and early flagg shouldered supplies checked his slingshot and stone pouch then slipped out by a wicker gate in the abbeys north wall scarcely had he let himself out into the woodlands when he became alert watching from the shelter of an ash grove flagg witnessed a curious sight graypatch had assembled his oarslaves mostly dormice and shrews they grouped on the path in a ragged bunch thin and underfed the five score searats who comprised the crew of the darkcjueen lurked in the pathside ditch fully armed graypatch issued his orders lissen now mates you lot stay in the ditch an keep yer heads down as for you scurvy oarpullers you dont breathe a word just follow me an try to look hard done by haharr though that shouldnt be too hard mind though if one of you steps out o line the crew in the ditchll deal with ye ringtail youre in charge down there wait my signal as soon as these country buffers open the big gate to bring us food out ill tip yer the sign an you rush in slay any that look like trouble right off the rest well let live to serve us flagg had heard enough luckily he had asked mellus to leave the gate open until morning the big otter scuttled back through the woods across the fields and slipped inside bolting the gate securely behind him mellus was strolling toward him from the direction of the unfinished bell tower flagg i thought youd be gone by now the otter held a paw to his lips sssshhh not so loud weve got trouble no time to explain now check all the wallgates are tight shut and bolted im going to rouse the others please marm dont stop to ask questions just do as i say like your life depended on it this is urgent the badger caught the tone and look in her friends eyes she nodded wisely and hurried to do his bidding oo the sun was nearly up mist hung low on the path and flatlands as graypatch halted his bedraggled column of oarslaves at the main gate of redwall abbey glancing up he was slightly taken aback to see a line of grim looking abbey dwellers staring down at him from the threshold of the high walls fixing a friendly smile on his face the searat captain called out a greeting good mornin to yer sirs whew its goin to be another scorchin summers day again i wonder could i have a word with whoevers in charge of this marvelous place abbot bernard kept his tone polite i am the father abbot of redwall abbey what can i do for you my son down in the ditch kybo jostled ringtail and sniggered did ye hear that matey his son now we know what graypatchs daddy looks like heehee ringtail silenced him with a smart slap stow yer noise fool be quiet an listen graypatch touched the dagger hidden behind on his belt ah well what better creature to ask for help than the father abbot himself as ycan see sir were poor wretched seafarers who lost our ship in a great storm weve been adrift fer nigh on half a season now wanderin round woodland an plain like birds without wings an were sore in need of a bit o food an water have ye any vittles to spare the abbot nodded tell my friends what you need he stepped back letting flagg and rufe brush come forward graypatch allowed himself a smile they were halfway home good day to you sirs we need water an bread nothin more oh i know we look rough an dirty but were all honest creatures youve nothin t fear from us flagg smiled back how many dyou have with you cully the searat captain shrugged only what ysee here matey if you was to open yer doors we could come in an rest awhile save you the trouble of bringin supplies out to us ive never been inside an abbey rufe brush gripped his javelin tight as he murmured no and youre not likely to get inside this one flagg continued smiling what about that gang hidden in the ditch graypatch waved toward the mistshrouded ditch a look of injured innocence on his villainous face ditch gang what dyer mean shipmate flagg fitted a pebble to his sling ill show you shipmate the stone zinged down plowing a furrow through the ground mist yowhoooo bigfangs head appeared out of the white shroud he was clutching his nose which was bleeding like a tap ringtails voice rang out get down an shuttup yer big oaf rufe brush leaped to the battlements his javelin poised this is for you if you dont shift yourself fast searat graypatch took the warning seriously he dashed across the path and leaped over the ditch landing on the flatlands beyond come on mates out o that ditch an show em who we are the crew scrabbled out of the ditch to stand on the flatlands at their captains side he took his sword from frink and waved it im graypatch master of the darkqueen and this is my crew haharr bet you country bumpkins never clapped eyes on the likes of us we can fight an slay just like we do all over the high seas so listen to me now you woodland clods surrender or ill bring this place down round your ears you know nothin of warfare an were all covered with the scars of many a battle dye hear me young cockleburr friar alders kitchen assistant could stand no more his fighting spirit was roused using his apron strings as a sling he launched a small rockhard turnip at graypatch bubbling brothpans take that you simmering seascum it struck graypatch hard in his one good eye the searat captain fell back completely blinded blackness interspersed with bursting colored stars filling his vision ringtail quickly picked him up supporting him as he shouted at the woodlanders on the walls thats it youve done it now this is war driving the oarslaves in front of them the searats retreated back up the path to the shelter of mossflower the redwallers laughed and cheered congratulating each other on their brave stand cockleburr was delirious he patted flagg heartily galloping gravyjugs we showed them didnt we foremole waddled up his normally merry face creased with worry hurr mayaps ee did but twere only luck maisters themns is searat spawn gurt warriors an wicked cruel slayers ho urr you marken moi words they vermintsll be back doant doubt et the cheering died away simeon spoke up foremole is right were not warriors though we have the might and safety of these walls in our favor we must take extra care in the coming days post lookouts stay within the abbey and its grounds and be constantly on guard against tricks from what i could hear this graypatch sounds to me like a very cunning beast the abbot turned to flagg and rufe brush i leave you in charge of all arrangements unfortunately i am no use at all when it comes to matters of war both of you have my complete confidence you are brave beasts and i trust your judgment what do you say mellus the badger shook her great head halfway between maternal instincts and righteous rage did you see those poor slaves some of them werent much more than dibbuns cant we do anything about them they looked so thin and wretched we must help them somehow flagg placed a gentle paw on mellus i know how yfeel marm i think every creature here would love to give the sorry little things some aid but you must understand we have to defend the abbey were all needed here what good would it do those slaves if redwall fell into the claws of graypatch and his crew saxtus had stayed silent in the background throughout the whole incident but now he felt the time had come for him to speak mother mellus i have never experienced war in my life i do not think i will like it however if it is war then redwall abbey comes first before slaves or even ourselves perhaps if we defeat these searats then we can think of rescuing others meanwhile our abbey is our main concern flagg shrugged hard words saxtus mate but youre right of course oo inland the mist had vanished with the advent of a hot summer morn tempers were also running hot in the woodland camp of the darkqueeris crew graypatch sat back in the shade with a leaf poultice held against his throbbing eye the injury had resulted in temporary blindness with his eye swelled shut the searat captain dearly wished he could lay claws upon bigfang for yelping out aloud and giving the game away but knowing he was at the mercy of his own savage crew he had to wralk a diplomatic tightrope graypatch tried to make light of the encounter yah what are they eh a bunch of root crunchers we could take em with one claw stupid mob of strawsuckers what do they know of fightin an killin eh kybo tried disguising his voice so the captain could not identify him strawsuckers matey huh they still sent us packin we shouldve did like bigfang said and rushed the place soon as we arrived here graypatch knew the voice he made a mental note to see kybo as soon as he regained his sight rushed em what good would thatve done i dont think things would have turned out any different bigfang picked dried blood from his top lip hoho dont you then listen rat if wed rushed em i could have taken that place graypatch tried to control his temper tcha but instead you got a stone on the nose and yelped like a fieldmouse at a funeral go on then bucko tell us what you would have done bigfang was a large barrelchested searat he picked up a dead branch and snapped it in two pieces id have broken em with the element of surprisecharge and kill an hour before dawn i would have set light to those big gates when they burned down the crew would have been in there a slayin an rippin but you know better dont you graypatch what did we do hid in a ditch playin peekaboo like frogs hidin from a hawk and you matey you the great graypatch terror of the waves put out of commission with a turnip by a little cook hahahaha wheedlin round the road like a lame beetle please sir give us bread an water kind sir hah bilgewater some searat invasion that was mates ill tell yer there was a murmur of agreement from the crew tied in a line with the oarslaves pakatugg trembled nervously bigfang had wanted to kill him if there was a power shift among the searats and bigfang became their leader the squirrels life would be worthless on an impulse he yelled out over the rumblings of disagreement graypatch is right theres more sense in tricking your way into the abbey than just burning and slaying ranzo leaped up and knocked pakatugg flat with a spear butt slaves an prisoners tellin us what t do eh shipmates i think were all goin soft in this forest bigfang threw a claw about his shoulders aye ranzos right we were better off with the deck of the darkqueen under us that craftd outrun any vessel on the seas i say we set sail for the open waters in darkqueen whos with me mates a roar of approval went up from the crew they seized their weapons and any supplies lying about forming in a mob with bigfang at their head as they marched off into the woodlands dragging the oarslaves with them bigfang called out to his disabled adversary dont worry graypatch im not goin to kill yer ill leave that to this country see how long youll last in the woods without yer good lamp to see through hoho youll die with the flies crawlin over yer cursin my name an the day you tried to do me down im capn now the crew marched off through the woodlands laughing and jostling each other happy to be going back to the life they knew aboard the best craft of all gabools fleet the good ship darkqueen one searat remained however fishgill the steersrat strode across to graypatch and sat beside him let em go capn theyll either end up in gabools clutches or come back to you after gettin sick of that bigmouth bigfang hes a fool an a hothead hell either get himself or the crew killed graypatch breathed a sigh of relief fishgill matey i knew you wouldnt let me down stay with me now this eyell be better in a day or two then well see whos the real capn of darkqueen and the best steersrat too oo clary and the long patrol had become alerted when they found pakatuggs secret den empty using their considerable skills as trackers they had trailed the squirrel across the dunes the hares found the river crossing the beach at midmorning checking the aftermath of the battle with greenfangs crew they traced the river course inland at midday they sighted the darkqueen tied up alongside the treefringed creek whoohahahahooh hon rosie whooped with delight whos for a trip aboard the ski lark brigadier thyme jumped aboard deserted eh where dyou spose the scurvy blaggards are now clary havent the foggiest old fellah still an all ill tell you where they wont be goin to sea in this bally tub again well make sure of that come on chaps in a short time the rudder was detached and hidden in the woods the oars were weighted and sunk in the creek the steering wheel was dismantled and flung widespread into the bushes and the mooring ropes were hacked through so that darkqueen drifted in and heeled at a crazy angle in the shallows they jettisoned the worst of the provisions and made a leisurely meal off the choicest bits of the remainder clary found some of the bows and arrows in the weapon locker righto chaps settle down now you take first watch rosie shout out at the first sign of a scurvy whisker and well give em billyo oh i say super im rather good at the old archery game yknow i could score a bullseye on a rats eye with no bother whoohahahahoo clary nibbled a ships biscuit until a weevil poked its head out at him he spat out quickly and tossed the offending morsel overboard phwaw i think id turn to a life of crime if i had to eat tucker like that no wonder they look mean an ugly o the mist was heavy in the forest as mariel and her friends struck westward into the strange new territory durry quill kept repeating the lines of the poem aloud find the trail and lose your life when in the woods this promise keep with senses sharp and open eyes my nose shall not send me to sleep your nose doesnt have to your bally voice would send anybeast to sleep durry tarquin snorted didnt they teach you singin at redwall floppyears i werent singin i were recititatin so there cant you two stop arguing and keep quiet oops sorry old gel mlips are sealed from now on promise dandin had to hack away at hanging vegetation and thick fern to keep the path clear he did not like this forest at all it was dank and steamy with little sunlight showing through the matted treetops the ground was squelchy underpaw and the going slow the travelers were not inclined to stop in the gloomy atmosphere they snatched bites of food as they pressed onward each with their separate thoughts dandin thought of redwall and mother mellus the good badger who had reared him despite her scolding and reprimands he missed her he wondered how saxtus was faring now that he was the only one of the terrible duo left for mellus to watch over durry thought of his uncle gabriel his friends bagg and runn and the moles whom he felt a great kinship to he imagined summer afternoons in the orchard with cool cider and cakes beneath the shady trees mariel thought of her father wondering where he could be and how his health was she remembered the quiet strength of her father the bellmaker his ready smile and gentleness the care he had taken of her and the pride he took in his little daughter whose name he likened to a bell ringing over meadows on a summer evening she blinked away a silent tear and gritted her teeth as she thought of cruel gabool and the retribution she would mete out one day when she faced him tarquin thought of sitting alongside hon rosie at the annual haredance and banquet in salamandastron rosie always treated him mockingly but that was just her way secretly he imagined she longed for him the words of a new song came bubbling out of the irrepressible hare if i were a cake upon the table you would take a bite from me and i would shout if i were able rosie youre a sight to see dolly ting bang clang diddly ding mr woodsorrel ive told you once politely now clamp a lid on it what oh er right you are mlady its just that lovely smell reminds me of rosies perfume that she wore to the banquet durry quill sniffed my spikes so thats what perfume smells like a lad like me never smelt it afore whaaaawwwhhooommmm scuse i mariel was about to silence durry when she yawned aloud also dandin stopped swinging his sword into the tangled creepers he leaned against a willow and yawned aloud rubbing his eyes hoooommmmm funny sort of smell not like id imagined perfume to be bit sickly sweet if you ask me tarquin sat down on the trail his harolina slipped from his paws and he blinked owlishly hooooooah take m word for it laddie thats what perfume smells like whoooohaaaw corks cant keep the ol eyes oooooooh pen mariel lay down slowly clutching the gullwhacker to her like a baby mouse going to bed with her dolly through halfclosed eyes she watched shadowy figures rising from the earth around them the last thing she heard before sleep rode in on the cloying waves of heavy scent was durry quills voice my nose shall no whooooaw oo mariels head ached furiously and a dark mist swam before her eyes changing to brown then dull green she caught a whiff of the fetid scent as a face swathed in barkcloth came close to hers heehee disn waknin up athink desens near wakn too abit eers snidjer lookitout the realization that she was bound to a tree woke mariel completely she tugged and strained at her bonds as a creature hobbled toward her it was covered in trailing weeds and wore a barkcloth wrapper around its face as did many others she could see crouching in the background the creature carried with it the whiff of heavy scent it stood in front of the mousemaid and spoke in a high squeaky voice yerrherr snidjer gotcher anyerr frens tarquin had awakened they were all tied tightly to the same big tree oh great golly rrtpoor head its burstin who the devil are you sir the creature prodded tarquin with a long thorny branch you sh rupp snidj er s talkin nochoo ennyow werryerfrom dandin was awake he lay with his eyes closed as he interpreted i think his name is snidjer and he wants to know where were from snidjer giggled heehee smarteemouse disn a smarteemouse durry was last to wake he strained forward trying to reach his head with bound paws gwaw my poor skull this shouldnt happen to a good young lad like me i think it was that scent which knocked us out oh nunky help send those orrible beasts away snidjer and his tribe giggled as they danced around the tree in front of their victims dandin watched them closely trying to figure out what sort of creatures they were under the barkcloth facewraps and body hangings of thick weed tarquin who are they have you ever seen anything like them before i should jolly well hope not old boy what a dreadful load of idiots cant even talk properly rosied have a word or two to say to em about their sad lack of elocution believe me snidjer pranced up to tarquin waving a torch made of smoldering herbs under his nose the hare was not wellpleased pooh take it away you rascal its that beastly scent again snidjer giggled sleepasleep sleepasleep yerrherraherrherr mariel groaned aloud so that was what the poem meant about my nose sending me to sleep its those smoldering herbs they must be full of a sort of sleep drug buried ones will surely rise ha i remember that bit just before i was knocked out by that smell i dimly remember seeing those creatures coming out of the ground though how they did it i dont know whwheres my gullwhacker oh i wish my head would stop aching snidjer wriggled with delight the loose weeds quivering all over him wannasee how we do it clevermouse wannasee ey dflitchaye cleverer than you a bigbit yousee the weird creature stamped his paw several times upon the ground mariel watched her eyes wide with amazement all around the earth clumps of weed and grass lifted like rough lids as more of the peculiar creatures came out of hiding from their subterranean pits in a short time the area was thick with barkmasked weedclad beasts they shuffled about chanting in their highpitched voices we dflitchaye flitchaye flitchaye dandin struggled against his bonds as he roared aloud hey come away from that stuff its ours snidjer was waving martins sword about as his tribe emptied the contents of the travelers packs onto the ground fighting and grabbing for the food and drink one of them swung gullwhacker close to dandins head nahh shrup youns flitchaye prisners tarquin gulped against the rope that circled his neck sno use old lad stiff upper lip an ignore the blighters were outnumbered at least ten to one i say whats the next bit of the jolly old rhyme maybe thatll help us wot dandin promptly reeled off the required stanza beat the hollow oak and shout we are the creatures of redwall if a brave one is about hell save any fool at all thats it as best as i recall lets look about for this hollow oak to beat then we can start shouting durry blinked painfully as he tried to focus his eyes phwaw im lookin though outside o this clearin i cant see nothin but trees my ol nuncle gabed say it were like lookin fer timber in a woodland by now the supplies had either been eaten or squashed into the ground though one or two of the creatures were still squabbling over flasks of cider and cordial snidjer swung the sword at an overhanging bough he missed and landed himself flat upon his back the flitchaye chief lay sniggering as three smaller ones thrummed roughly away at tarquins beloved harolina the hare fought against his tight bonds crying out against the outrage i say put that instrument down youre an absolute bunch of yahoos dye hear me yahoos and hooligans concealing her voice beneath the surrounding hubbub mariel whispered to dandin im working my paws loose it shouldnt take long the moment im free well have to see if we can grab our weapons and hold this lot off until we find the hollow oak hollow oak old gel tarquin chuckled no need to look any further were tied to the bally thing durry groaned aloud an i couldve saved my poor eyes all that lookin an searchin taint fair dandin glanced upward hmm so we are he whispered back right when mariels loose well untie each other quietly if we can reach our weapons all well and good if we cant then the best plan would be to surround tarquin and keep him protected while he beats the oak those long legs of yours should come in very handy for that tarquin er durry what is it that we all have to shout out we are creatures of redwall good an loud snidjer and the flitchaye who was holding gullwhacker hurried across to the prisoners snidjer carried the sword and some smoldering herbs he glanced at them suspiciously worrayou talkabout ey tarquin sniffed actually old bean we were just remarking on what a vile smelly load of old forest weeds you bods are snidjers eyes glinted angrily and he waved the smoking herbs under tarquins nose you shrup yhear shrup or flitchaye send you sleepasleep smore the hare coughed violently his eyes watering as the flitchaye chief held the reeking herbs closer suddenly tarquin shot out both his long legs bound together as they were the powerful limbs caught snidjer a mighty kick that sent him head over heels mariel freed her paws and unknotted the rope that held them to the oak and unbound dandins paws with their backs to the dead oak the four companions faced the howling mob of flitchaye creatures mariel tugged durrys paws loose as dandin untied tarquin snidjer leaped up quivering with fury as he waved the sword menacingly hawhaw ydone it now cleverbeasts dflitchaye killyer now killyer good n dead gerrem flitchaye gerrem again the mousemaid remembered attacking gabool with the sword when her life was threatened this time it was not only her but also three good friends who were in danger of being slain mariel felt the old storm rise within her grabbing the ropes that had bound them she knotted the ends and passed them to dandin and durry these will have to do as gullwhackers get thumping tarquin the hare needed no second bidding he pounded his long hindlegs against the hollow trunk raising his voice to join the others we are creatures of redwall we are creatures of redwaaaaalll the first wave of the flitchaye mob struck them armed with sticks and small daggers mariel and her comrades thwacked away at them with their knotted ropes for all they were worth most of the flitchaye were repulsed some knocked senseless whilst others halfconscious clung onto the bodies of their attackers snidjer stayed well back swinging the sword as he urged a fresh wave of attackers to the fray gerremall flitchaye grabbem holdem i cutm up wid dis sworder durry quill went down felled by a heavy blow dandin and mariel stood shoulder to shoulder swinging their knotted ropes tarquin lay on his back pounding the oak with his hindpaws while he lashed out at the enemy with his front paws joining voice with his companions we are creatures of redwall we are creatures of redwaaaaalll they were struggling against the odds more so when snidjer gathered a fresh batch of flitchaye about him and headed the charge at his weakened opponents dcleverbeasts fallin now gerrem flitchaye mariel and dandin went down beneath the masses of weedclad bodies still shouting as they were submerged beneath the flitchaye mob we are creatures of redwaaaalll oo thick white fog enveloped both sea and shore as if the very clouds had dropped out of the sky sound was muted and nowhere was there vision or sight for more than a paws length rawnblade widestripe chuckled grimly to himself as he donned the long spiked helmet he always wore with his battle armor salamandastron was deserted he had sent out all his hares to patrol on one pretext or another some to the south others to the east the great badger lord pulled down the helmet visor focusing happily through the twin slits rawnblades eyes should have been tired but they were not he had lain awake most of the night listening to the muffled silence fog brought in its wake restless turning rawnblade had finally left his beloved mountain to stroll on the tideline along the shore by salamandastron that was when he had heard it the sickening crunch of ships timbers upon rock was unmistakable the searat captain orgeye was below sleeping when he was thrown forcibly from his bunk onto the cabin floor shouts from the waveblades two lookouts brought him scrambling up on deck belay weve run aground in this cursed fog hells teeth shes run bowon to a reef rawnblade had strained his ears to catch the shouts from the waveblade capn orgeye whatll we do bilgescum youve been sleepin on watch if she breaks her keel on these blasted rocks ill rip out yer livers get over the side onto the reef an see how she looks move yerselves capn shes noseup on the stones holed near the waterline an trapped tighter than meat between yer teeth what do we do what can we do slophead theres naught for it but to wait till this fog clears mayaps we can beach her for repairs then oo rawnblade expanded his massive chest letting out a great sigh of pure joy at the memory of his night stroll it was not often the big badger got a shipload of searats delivered to his doorstep that was why he had sent his hares away the lord of salamandastron wanted this one all to himself picking up his formidable broadsword he swung it easily across his shoulders and strode silently back to the tideline standing with waves lapping his studded leg greaves rawnblade widestripe resembled a great carved statue set at the edge of the sea fog swirled about his armored body as he listened to the sounds of the cursing searats who were waiting for the fog to lift so was rawnblade he remembered the dead bodies of his three hares swaying in the shallows of the tideline the work of searats a huge rumble of satisfaction welled up in his throat as he anticipated loosing his wrathful battlesword upon orgeye and the waveblades crew c o colonel clary notched an arrow to his bow and the other two members of the long patrol followed his example the fog had thinned to a milky river mist in the creek where the darkqueen lay crippled clarys ears stood straight up as he listened to the noise of the darkqueens crew they were crashing heedlessly through bush and shrub careless and noisy as they made their way back to the ship ringtail was first to spot the darkqueens masts amid the forest greenery he dashed forward with the light mist swirling about him ahoy mates there she lies the darkqueeny even as the rest of the crew dashed forward they saw ringtail fall with a gurgle an arrow through his neck down get down the ships been boarded roared bigfang the searats obeyed dropping down instantly behind trees and bushes ranzo lay alongside bigfang pale with fright ringtails been done for who killed him bigfang peered through the mistshrouded trees i dont know mate but ill soon find out ere bring up them oarslaves brigadier thyme raised himself from the heeling deck to obtain a better shot at the foebeast he groaned aloud and sat down again oh dash it look what theyre up to now clary and hon rosie stood up in dismay bigfang was approaching with the rest of the searats and they were using pakatugg and the wretched oarslaves as a shield in front of them they stood in a bunch at the woodland fringe on the creek bank hon rosie relaxed her bowstring golly gosh i say that sort of things not on you know hey there you bunch of moldy old cowards come out an fight beast to beast bigfang prodded pakatugg with his cutlass moldy ol cowards is better than foolish dead heroes rabbit now what dye say we parley a bit eh clary twitched his whiskers firmly we dont parley with the likes of you bottlenose bottlenose yerself rabbit bigfang snatched a spear from kybo and hurled it the spear landed with a quivering thud pinning clarys paw to the darkqueens side immediately rosie and thyme took a chance shooting slightly upward they sent their arrows over the tops of the oarslaves heads wounding frink and slaying a searat named reekhide the searats broke and ran for the cover of the bushes dragging the oarslaves with them hon rosie acted swiftly tugging the spear free she pulled clary into the scuppers knew they couldnt kill you you old piewalloper are you hurt clary gritted his teeth trying hard with one paw to stanch the flow of blood from the other ahem that fellers not very good at givin a manicure with a spear though i think he meant it to be a haircut rosie could see by the tightdrawn expression on clarys face that he was suffering greatly she searched her pack for bandages not to worry youll soon be right as rain again old lad thyme put aside his bow and arrows now the confrontation was over well chaps it looks like were stuck aboard this tub until clarys able to use the old paw again wot oo out of sight and earshot of the hares bigfang was having trouble with his new command kybo had elected himself spokesrat for the rest and he and bigfang argued fiercely we shouldve charged them when i flung that spear huh an get caught in the water by those two with the bows not me matey did you see the darkqueen theyve crippled er i could get her seaworthy an sailin again you all youve done so far bigfang is to get frink wounded an reekhide killed it was foolish chuckin that spear we shouldve got closer to em then we couldve done some real damage oh aye an what would you have done scumbags kybo flung himself on bigfang they rolled over and over grunting and kicking at each other bigfang was gaining the upper paw when he tripped and became tangled with the oarslaves kybo quickly sat on his adversarys chest pulling out a wicked skinning knife he pressed the blade across bigfangs throat the former leader lay still knowing that kybo had won kybo retained his position breathing heavily now you listen to me addlebrain im speakin fer all of us see the darkqueens scuppered oars rudder an steerin wheel gone didnt ysee an theyve heeled her over shell sit on the bottom of that creek like a stone in mud im takin this crew back to graypatch that abbey is the only place where well have it safe an easy he was right now you can come peaceable or die here whats it t be bigfang swallowed feeling the blade scrape his throat you win mother mellus crept up on bagg and runn the otter twins who were hanging perilously over the north ramparts she seized each one by an ear and pulled them down as they squeaked piteously now then you two young fiends what are you up to out here eh owow leggo we were keeping guard thats all eeeek me ear somebeasts got to watch out for searats mellus released them shooing the delinquent pair down the steps to the abbey lawn run along now searats would eat two dibbuns like you for tea ha bet they wouldnt wed make em into searat pudden an eat em no you wouldnt theyd have your tails on toast then what would i tell the abbot the two small otters shuffled off disgruntled flagg the big otter called along from the west wall to mellus the only tails on toast those scurvy ratsll have is their own tails marm you leave it t me an young saxtus the badger gave a worried frown i hope youre right flagg theyre certain to be back searats like that lot dont give in easily saxtus who was on the east wall and within hearing range called back at the same time as flagg and neither do we snidjer approached mariel brandishing the sword weighted down by flitchaye she was unable to move helplessly she watched him raise the glittering blade from nowhere a huge voice rang out i was born on a dark night in a storm im the roaring child of heavywing mcgurney shake in your fur flitchaye stoneheads arrived a barn owl of awesome proportions swooped down and hurled snidjer high in the air with a noise somewhere between a hoot and a roar he launched himself into the fray mariel had never seen anything like it the weedclad barkmasked flitchaye scattered everywhere like ninepins stonehead was aptly named he used his massive head like a battering ram thudding and butting with the speed of a striking snake as he shouted aloud at the terrified flitchaye tribe stand and fight you forest weeds why if i couldnt slay a dozen of you before breakfast id die of shame i can drink a river dry and eat an orchard bare im stonehead mcgurney bravest of the brave mariel and her companions got the feeling they would offend the big barn owl by joining in the fight so they stood to one side watching as he enjoyed him self to the full the flitchaye who were not laid out flat took to their holes and closed the lids as mariel retrieved her gullwhacker and dandin picked up the sword tarquin tuned his harolina and nudged durry i dont think id like to meet that chap when hes cross do you durry kicked snidjer on the bottom as he tried to rise dearie me he do ave a right ol temper an no mistake six flitchaye were backing off toward the woods stonehead spotted them and yelled get back here down your pits and shut the lids run away and ill follow you to the ends of the earth you know i never lie we mcgurneys arent the wisest owls anywhere but by thunder were the bravest he turned to the four travelers aggressively so youre redwall creatures eh should never let yourselves get caught by this lot flitchaye hah ill show you what they are come here you snidjer came but not quickly enough stonehead grabbed him in one powerful talon and ripped away the barkcloth mask and trailing weeds theres a flitchaye for you skinny little weasels dressed up thats all they are here do you want me to butt him right over the top of that hollow oak i can do it easily you know dandin interceded on snidjers behalf i think hes had enough sir thank you for rescuing us i am dandin of redwall these are my friends tarquin mariel and durry the owl shook their paws with his talons until they ached then he kicked open the lid of a flitchaye hole and beckoned to snidjer in there you and look sharp about it snidjer obeyed with alacrity stonehead took a huge dead treelimb in his claws and tossed it on top of the lid locking snidjer inside there thats the way to treat them dont take any nonsense you dont think i was too easy on them do you sure you dont want me to throw a few over the treetops no no old chap you did splendidly do you live alone in these woods stonehead blinked his eyes at tarquin and snorted alone ill say not we mcgurneys have always lived here got the wife thunderbeak and four little onestwo sons and two daughters theyre only chicks but you should see them fight come home with me for supper meet my family the savage golden eyes glared at them they did not refuse oo if at all possible stoneheads wife thunderbeak was even fiercer than her belligerent husband the four babies sat at the foot of a dead ash with them fighting uproariously at every opportunity much to the amusement of their parents the food was surprisingly good there was a white mushroom salad specially laid on for the travelers the owls did not eat dandin decided that it would not be polite to ask them what their diet was though the odd barkcloth and weeds in the bushes left him in little doubt after supper tarquin sang and played his harolina an impromptu song if youre ever caught by the flitchaye and the situation looks grave then call for a mcgurney the bravest of the brave hell fight all night and battle all day until you hear those flitchaye say have mercy have mercy have mercy on us all mariel smiled fondly at the owlets bless them theyve fallen asleep thunderbeak cuffed them roughly awake wheres your manners dozing off when the nice rabbits singing you a song wake up this instant mariel wrapped her gullwhacker into a pillow and lay down oh dont scold them please they need their sleep the same as me actually if that nice rabbit starts singing another song hell feel the knot of my gullwhacker between his big bunny ears oo tarquin sat up late remembering the next lines of the poem and discussing their future route with stonehead though the owl did not appear to be a great deal of help tarquin racked his memory whilst pretending to be attentive to stoneheads advice let me see now something or other about saving any fool at all i think the last bit was oh but that was you wasnt it stonehead blinked fiercely whats that you say im any fool at all i think you could do with a lesson in politeness rabbit its true we mcgurneys arent wise owls but were the bravest of the brave now defend yourself or get kicked right over that tree tarquin held up his paws placalingly sorry old chap i wasnt alluding to you not a bit of it the fools i was talking about is us me and my jolly old friends point of fact you may be able to help us with our route ive remembered the lines goes somethin like this beware the light that shows the way trust not the wartskinned toad in his realm no night or day fool stay to the road thats it ysee it mentions us again fool i dont suppose you happen to know what place the rhyme means wot stonehead got up and paced about a bit one of the babies gave his leg a drowsy bite as he passed and he cuffed the sleeping infant affectionately wouldnt like to be a flitchaye when she grows up wonderful little battler yes of course i know the place your poem mentions you and your friends want the swampdark never go there myself rotten place take you there in the morning get some sleep now rabbit youre quite a good singer never have time for such nonsense myself sooner have a good clean fight must warn you though if you start warbling and wake my wife up shell probably rip your leg clean off shes not named thunderbeak for nothing you know sleep well good night tarquin put his harolina carefully aside and lay down gazing around at the dark dripping forest and the six savage owls in slumber blow me id never take hon rosie picnickin to this place whats that rabbit did you say something er no old bean just good night good night now shut up and sleep or else oo gabool the wild was not affected by sleep anymore he was driven night and day by an insane nervous energy roaming the rooms of fort bladegirt the nonarrival of graypatch was preying upon his mind though he did not doubt that his traitorous captain would show up sooner or later the king of searats now began hoping that graypatch would be brought back alive he descended a winding stairway muttering and chuckling to himself no dont kill him thats too quick for me old shipmate graypatch gabools got somethin nice fer him a surprise aharrharrharr aye graypatchtl remember old skrabblag i was capn of the ratwake an he was mate when we brought skrabblag from the warm isles in the deep seas to the south haharr good old skrabblag lets see if youre still alive an foultempered still laughing to himself the mad king reached the bottom of the steps he entered a side room and took a spear from its wallhanger at the center of the room was a circular stone with a thick iron ring attached gabool thrust the spear through the ring and levered the stone upward sliding it to one side he took the spear and crouched over the hole in the floor skrabblag matey its me gabool sing out are ythere there was no reply gabool jabbed down into the inky darkness with the long spear there was a dry rustling sound accompanied by an odd clicking noise the searat grinned aharr you murderous villain i can hear yeh whats it like down there livin on rotten fishheads an scraps o dead seabird the rustling and clicking increased something caught the spear blade but gabool pulled it back quickly hoho not so fast bucko i know youd like to drag me down there but you bide your time and old gabool will give yer a little gift remember graypatch aye he was the one that helped catch you an take you from your nice warm island to this cold dark berth well you stop down there an think what youd like to do to graypatch pretty soon now ill let him drop in an pay you a call youd like that wouldnt yer the clicking and rustling increased gabool laughed heartily as he slid the stone back into place with the spear outside the wind moaned around the rocks of terramort and the stones of bladegirt the restless sea pounded coves and inlets as seabirds deserted the skies for nests and perches gabool sat once more in his banqueting hall chin in claws as he slouched across the table and spoke to his bell hah yer gettin dirty now since theres no slaves to spit an polish yer shiny hide an thats the way it should be big an dirty with a brassy voice one day the bell tower will be built then ill string you up there an make you sing every time i tug the rope ill make yer sing or be quiet just as i please whatve ygot to say to that eh the great bell remained silent gabool sat watching it until his weighted eyelids began drooping over weary bloodseared eyes a ship in flames passed his vision followed by another lying on its side in a creek overgrown by trees and yet a third ship washed up and holed upon a reef bluddrig garrtail saltar and orgeye floated lifeless in the waves sweeping across his fevered dream dead rats all through the shifting gray mists a huge armored badger strode raising his sword he struck gabool was awake once more glaring his hatred across the table at the bell whose very presence haunted his every moment haharr me old shipmates how was your voyage graypatch had his sight back now though his eye was still quite swelled he sat on a fallen log with fishgill watching his sheepish crew bigfang kept noticeably out of the way kybo still the unofficially elected spokesrat unfolded the unfortunate encounter with the hares and reported on the sorry state of the vessel darkqueen graypatch listened to the woeful narrative as he sat sketching on the ground with his swordpoint when kybo had finished the other searats gathered around to hear what graypatch had to say he kept them waiting awhile before he spoke a sad an misrable tale mateys but what ship can last forever darkqueen was a good craft but shed be a floatin death warrant for us against the might of gabool leave er to rot in the creek i say redwall abbeys worth a hundred darkqueens well be lords of this land country gentlerats if yplease instead of floatin bilgeslops at the

then do as i say an well be takin supper in redwall abbey tonight everyone cheered aloud with the exception of bigfang somehow he felt as if he had been tricked by graypatch though being in disgrace and having the whole crew against him left him in no position to complain cxo hot summer vegetable soup was being served with large flat oatcakes there was fourseason plumcake and elderberry cup to follow the sentries on the abbey walls took theirs as they watched the surrounding countryside for signs of movement the food was being served in the orchard sister sage and mother mellus dished it out to the little ones and each carried their portion to a corner of the orchard where the abbot assisted by simeon and foremole stood ready to give them a lecture seated in a group beneath a gnarled apple tree the dibbuns began eating abbot bernard cast a kindly eye over them shook back his habit sleeves and began righto my little friends carry on eating while i talk to you er grubb stop dipping your oatcake into baby turgles soup and listen to me please grubb did as he was told but immediately started complaining yurr zurr habbit ee squirrel turgles adrinken moi drink the infant squirrel grinned over the top of grubbs beaker and sucked noisily at his stolen elderberry cup the abbot turned his eyes skyward as if looking for patience foremole went among the dibbuns and took charge of the situation gurr you liddle terror give ee drink back ter grubb an yew maister grubb touch yon turgles soup agin an oill bite ee tail offen the abbot took a deep breath and continued now as you may know there are some very naughty creatures whove been hanging about outside our abbey but theres no need for you to worry or be frightened well take care of them meanwhile i want all you dibbuns to be very good little creatures do what you are told by those who look after you mother mellus sister sage sister serena simeon brother saxtus myself an bruvver hoobit too yes and brother hubert too an

grownup creatures do as they say if you are sent indoors go straight in do not try to leave the abbey we dont want you going outside stay out of the way eat all your food keep yourselves clean and go

hurr liddle goodbeasts youm eaten up all ee vittles naow an run along ter play foremole chuckled as he strolled off with simeon and the abbot oim athinken theym got the message zurrs x leaning against a battlement flagg twirled his sling idly scanning the northward path all quiet this side young saxtus saxtus licked plumcake from his paws before shouldering his spear this side too flagg but im wondering for how long hmm can you feel it too mate its as if theres a sort of calm before the storm i dont like it dandin and mariel were anxious to be away but half the morning was gone and still they had to wait about stoneheads wife thunderbeak had insisted on reprovisioning their empty packs and she was somewhere off in the woods stonehead and his four owlchicks put on several exhibitions of wrestling butting and kicking tarquin and durry had to keep avoiding being used as demonstration examples finally thunderbeak arrived back with the knapsacks not much im afraid but itll have to do plenty of apples some white mushrooms wild damsons not too ripe bit of celery some other bits and bobs oh theres some woodland scones though theyve been lying about a bit my own make very nourishing they thanked her allowed themselves to be pecked and kicked one last time by the owlchicks then struck westward led by stonehead oo the strange forest grew dimmer and more gloomy until finally they were in a world of black shadow and green light trees were immensely tall with long bare trunks crowded together like black columns the foliage growing at their tops completely blocking daylight turning it into sinister green shafts little or no shrubbery grew on the forest floor which was composed of squishy dark leaf mold with massive tree roots crisscrossing like dark giant veins mariel noticed that the silence was total whenever they talked their voices echoed spectrally around the gaunt trees to cheer things up a bit tarquin twanged his harolina and began a ditty old missus hedgehog heres what she likes a little fat husband with lots of spikes and a quarrel with a squirrel who wears flowers round his middle and a chestnut for her supper on a winters night he came to a faltering halt as stonehead turned his great golden eyes upon him do you have to make that silly noise rabbit one more song out of you and ill wrap that hareliner thing round your skull this is bad country we dont want to attract attention to ourselves do you hear me tarquin walked behind durry and dandin muttering under his breath sure sign of a savage no appreciation of good music huh bet the bally feller wouldnt complain if it was a piece of boiled flitchaye instead of a piece of beautiful music aye durry whispered back an whats a poor lad t do wanderin round like an ant lost in a dark well bottom what i wouldnt give fer a flagon of my ol nuncles giggly juice right now mariel watched the back of stoneheads enormous figure sometimes hopping before them other times winging low between the trees how he knew the way westward was a mystery to her she had lost all sense of time and distance tramping through this eerie world quite suddenly after what seemed an endless trek stonehead fluttered onto a fallen tree and turned to them this is it swampdark land never go any further than here myself not afraid of it just dont like the place right youre on your own now i wont say good luck because youll end up dead or devoured im sure of it always remember though if you ever get back to my part of the forest give me a call we mcgurneys arent the wisest owls anywhere but its an acorn to an appletree were the bravest with that he was gone winging away through the trees before they had a chance to thank him or say goodbye dandin sat on the fallen tree and undid his knapsack well goodbye stonehead mcgurney im starving lets sit here awhile and have lunch in peace for a change golly look at this they climbed up onto the fallen trunk staring in the direction they would be taking it was practically pitchblack lowhanging trees with heavy weed trailing from them held out knotted and gnarled branches like predatory claws waiting to seize the unwary traveler the ground was a greeny brown with odd clumps of blue and white flowers sticking up through it all ran several raised paths humps of solid rocky earth which meandered off in various directions the whole scene was one of complete depression it weighed on their spirits like a millstone oh corks you chaps the place is enough t give a bod the complete pip just lookin at it wot mariel busied herself collecting twigs and dry bark doesnt it just well ill tell you what im going to do light a fire and cook up something tasty who knows the next time well get a decent feed roaming through that lot the suggestion was wholeheartedly endorsed with flint and tinder they soon had a merry blaze going the gloom was dispelled temporarily as they delved through their packs lets toast some o these liddle mushrooms an wrap some apples in wet leaves to bake durry was toasting away even as he spoke dandin took a bite at one of thunderbeaks scones he winced and held the side of his jaw ouch i wonder how many seasons ago these were baked tarquin chuckled we could always sling em at any enemies we meet dandin rummaged farther down his knapsack suddenly he gave a cheer look its my flute id forgotten that id packed it mustve stuck in my pack lining thank goodness the flitchaye never found it well well can you beat that eh the flute of my ancestor gonff the thief lets see if it still sounds all right trilling an old abbey reel called otter in the orchard dandin set his companions paws to tapping as the music skirled and tootled around the lonely trees hot food a glowing fire and merry music lifted the spirits of the travelers even the blinking eyes that watched them from the dark swamp stopped winking and stayed wide open with fascination as they awaited the travelers next move into their miry world oo fleetleg shorebuck and longeyes returned from the south beaches patrol to salamandastron they were first back the hares found little welcome the mountain chambers were deserted longeyes saw something at the doorway of the badger lords forge room deepscored marks in the solid rock he groaned in despair lord rawnblade did this with his bare claws gouged the rockface like this i knew it would happen someday shorebuck ran his paws across the scars in the solid rock the bloodwrath has come upon rawnblade wide stripe fleetleg picked up his lance come on we must find him no badger lord has suffered the bloodwrath since boar the fighter but be careful rawnblade might kill anybeast foolish enough to stand in his way oo the fog had long dispersed beneath the high bright sun on the tideline the three hares found the results of their lords terrible madness fully a hundred searat corpses drifted and rolled in the shallows around the reef hewn hacked or cleaved through blood spattered the stones and swirled in the water broken swords and shattered spears decorated the rocks shorebuck slumped against the reef his eyes shut to blot out the awful carnage so this is why he got rid of us sent out all the patrols ive seen battlefields before but never anything like this fleetleg leaned upon his lance it is written that a badger lord can slay many when the bloodwrath is upon him but how did these searats come here where is their ship longeyes had been wading around the west side of the reef he called out here round here theres one still alive the searat was mortally wounded with his life ebbing fast he gasped out what he had witnessed ship waveblade ran onto the reef in fog stuck and holed capn orgeye waited until fog went we fixed ship up here on reef waitin for tide to lift us off ohhhh ohhhh monster badger came rushing out of sea eulaliaaaaa longeye cradled the searats head on his lap that was rawnblade rawn blade i dont know giant water rushin off his armor spikes studs silver metal like some wild beast out of the sea aaaaahhhh that sword like a great jib boom we didnt stand a chance dye hear me mates fivescore searat fighters an we didnt stand a chance roarin shoutin gorsepaw crocus sergeant learunner killin slayin i tell yer mates longeye looked at fleetleg sergeant learunner wasnt he your father fleetleg stared out to sea aye gorsepaw and crocus were brother and sister too my brother and sister i was only a newborn infant then our mother never lasted more than a season after they died rawnblade reared me and when i was old enough he told me that he had found them floating on the tideline delivered there by gabool and his searats the injured searat lifted his head and stared at fleetleg screamin shriekin an awailin an dyin dyin the searats head lolled to one side he died with eyes wide open horror frozen on his face as his spirit sailed for hellgates somewhere out on the blue deeps of the crested sea the ship waveblade ran before whichever course the wind chanced to take her summer breezes sent spray skimming over the decks washing them clean of blood and battlestain stretched out on the forecastle oblivious to all about him rawnblade widestripe slept deeply still fully armored his great sword hanging loosely from one paw unmindful of the stinging salt water which dewed his fresh scars the awful bloodwrath had left him he knew not when it would visit him again he slept on as peaceful as any infant at its mothers side evening shadows began closing in on a cloudless sky as the sun reddened and began its descent into the west the stones of redwall took from it their dusky red brown hue heat shimmer on the flatlands gave way to purplish twilight gabriel quill had relieved saxtus on the walltop the fat cellarmaster yawned looked north along the path blinked and rubbed his eyes before calling across to the west ramparts sister serena marm what dyou make of this ere serena hurried across shielding her eyes with a paw she peered shortsightedly in the direction gabe was pointing hmm dont know mr quill very pretty though it looks like a lot of party lanterns bobbing along the path little golden lights rufe brush came bounding up the steps he caught the last phrase little golden lights where oh by the fur of my fathers sister those little golden lights are fire torches being carried toward the abbey ill sound the alarm in a twinkling rufe was down from the ramparts across the lawn and up in the halffinished bell tower grabbing the wooden cudgels he began pounding on the hollow log thonkthonkathonkthonkathonkthonkathonkl oo as soon as the sound reached his ears graypatch sent the rope and grapnel brigade dashing into the woods on the east side of the path jumping across the ditch onto the flatlands with his own contingent he stood with a thin smile playing on his lips watching bigfang rush em an burn the gates eh shipmate well it was your idea in the first place so go to it matey go to it desperation and fear showed in bigfangs face as the flickering torchlights illuminated it he knew the element of surprise had gone with the sounding of the abbey alarm furthermore there were only seven proper searats with him graypatch had sent them more to keep the oarslaves in line and watch his performance than to fight alongside bigfang oarslaves and a frightened squirrel that was all he had with him graypatch was trying to get him killed that much was obvious bigfang laughed a halfhearty cackle that grated on his own ears he tried to sound belligerent in his reply ill burn em out matey never fear just make sure youre there to back us up and rush in when we do oo saxtus and three young otters stood with flagg over the threshold piles of stones were heaped by them ready for slinging friar alder with a mixed group of moles and mice ranged the east and west walls carrying spears in bundles they were little more than sharpened yew stakes but in the right place they could wreak considerable damage foremole headed a group that was in charge of large baskets of rock and rubble placed around the east and west walls so they could be conveniently tipped onto foebeast heads below sister sage rufe brush and gabe quill led a small contingent of archers the abbey was not a place of war as a result the weapons were sadly piecemeal ancient and few mellus paced the walls slowly her gruff homely voice reassuring the redwallers who were all firsttime warriors be calm now dont panic theyre outside and were safe within dont go firing or throwing anything let them make the first move besides they may just want to parley flagg could not help snorting a little just like a fox parleys with a baby mouse if youll pardon me turn of phrase marm mellus nodded confidently they look more like a bunch of searats than hungry foxes though im pretty sure theyll find were not baby mice by any means oo graypatch walked the far side of the ditch edge until he and his cohort were directly facing the threshold above redwalls main gate bigfang faltered just short of the gate and stood undecided amid the bearers of the blazing torches there was an audible silence finally broken by saxtus as he called down to graypatch what do you want this time rat graypatch smiled as he looked from side to side at his searats savage bloodthirsty and eager each one a picture of barbarism decked out in their tawdry finery they displayed an array of the most fearsomelooking weapons we want this abbey you might have known wed come back why dont you just give up now while youre all still alive save yourselves and us a great lot of trouble saxtus picked up a sharpened stake and held it ready to throw its no trouble rat why dont you turn your vermin round go back the way you came and save yourselves the trouble the searat captain decided the time for talking was over he raised his sword yelling at the top of his lungs attack kiiilll saxtus dropped to one side as an arrow sped by his head straightening up he hurled the spear hard at graypatch the searat saw it coming and ducked unfortunately there was another rat standing directly behind him who took the hurtling spear straight through his middle he fell with an earsplitting scream the battle was joined mellus watched as bigfang and his gang of torchbearers made a rush at the gates straightaway she countered the move foremole rubble over here quick aim it down onto them try not to kill the slaves foremole and his crew hurtled the baskets of mixed rock and rubble over the parapet wall bigfang was about to swing his torch at the gates when the first basket hit him extinguishing the flames as it stunned him he lay spread on the path the oarslaves backed off but frink and fishgill threw their torches one hit the gates and bounced back but the other fell just right at the bottom of the woodwork flagg was about to see to it when he tripped over saxtus the young mouse was crouching down head in paws sobbing uncontrollably the big otter grabbed hold of him saxtus matey are you all right have ye been wounded blinded by tears and hardly able to speak saxtus shook his head oh flagg ive just killed a living creature its horrible one moment he was alive and suddenly my spear hit him did you hear him scream hes dead flagg dead and i killed him flagg turned to mellus as she passed theyve fired the gates see what you can do marm ill be with you in a moment flagg raised saxtuss tearstained face with a rough paw none of us wants to kill anybeast matey but this is a war its kill or be killed now were not just protectin our own skins theres the whole of redwall an what it stands for what about that dormitory of dibbuns do you want t see them slain by searats make no mistake about it young un those ratsil kill us all if they conquer our abbey come on now saxtus me old cully lets see you up on your paws defendin your home saxtus wiped away his tears grabbing his sling he fitted a rock and sent it hurtling into the searats come on fight you dirty cowards you wont conquer us rocks and spears arrows and lances filled the air zinging backwards and forwards between searat and redwaller mother mellus and three moles buxton drubber and danty rolled a barrel of water from the abbey pond to damp down the back of the gates foremole and his crew hurled baskets of earth over the ramparts to smother the flames licking up the front of the gates grubb the baby mole together with the little twin otters bagg and runn had escaped from the dormitory wakened by the noise and clangor of battle they decided to take part and distinguish themselves as warriors wandering through the deserted kitchens inside the abbey they searched for suitable armament bagg gave a shout whohoa looka these friar alders large vegetable chopping knives lay sharp and gleaming upon the worn worktable they selected one each dancing about and waving the dangerous blades heehee lets make searat pies im goin to chop their chiefs head right off choppo burrhurr this hinfantll skin ee a few oitl make they squeal creeping out onto the abbey lawn they ducked behind some bushes as mellus and the moles hurried by trundling another big barrelful of water toward the main gate runn held a paw to his lips ssshh come on this way they mastered the steps to the top of the north wall near the east end helping each other to scramble up the big roughhewn stone stairs pushing the knives ahead of them as they went at the top an argument broke out over which knife belonged to whom hey thats my knife this ones yours no taint i had the pointy one with the brown handle yurr give yon knoifer t me moin were the big un as they were sorting out the weaponry a threehooked grapnel narrowly missed baggs head it caught a crack in the stones and the rope attached to it was pulled taut grubb patted baggs head boi okey that were near a gudd shot it nurly went roight daown youm ear the whirring and clanking of grapnels increased as all along the east wall metal hooks clamped into stonework cracks and ropes pulled twangingly tight runn climbed up on grubbs head and peered down into the forest darkness its searats lads climbin up the ropes to get in here bagg glanced over to the west wall where the battle was concentrated huh no good ashoutin fr that lot they got enough t do sides ma mellusd tan our hides an make us go back t bed an not give us no breakfast tomorrow an keep us in our room all day an grubb placed a grimy paw over baggs mouth oh tell oi no more orrible stories otter usns cut ee ropes wi our gurt knoifs hoa hoa ee ratsll fall bump on they bottems when ee ropes do be cutted oill start in ee middle you two come frum both ends hurr hurr kybo was nearly at the top of the wall holding his sword between his teeth he looked back at the others swarming up the ropes their eyes glinting triumphantly through the darkness as they hauled themselves upward claw over claw it was a great distance from the walltop to the woodland floor and kybo was not too fond of heights he partially closed his eyes and tried not to look down staring at the wallface in front as he pulled himself ever higher the searats claw was about to stretch up and grab the battlement at the walltop when there was an ominous chuckle a sawing noise and a discordant twang as the rope parted company with the metal grapnel it had been lashed to oh noooooooooo kybo sailed outward from the walltop and dropped like a stone several searats looked up in amazement their eyes following kybo as he plunged to the dark floor far below in a very short time ropes were popping and cracking as they were sliced through by the redwall friars keen vegetable knives the thud of bodies and the terrified screams of searats filled the night air one rat plunged earthward without a sound staring in puzzlement at the loose rope still firmly clenched in his claws bagg runn and grubb were truly having fun it took only three slices to cut through the toughest rope stretched taut as they were a wunn a two an a three an away ee do go vermint grubb chanted happily and away the vermint did go with a loud wail of despair oo meanwhile at the abbey front graypatch had drastically changed his opinion of the creatures he once called bumpkins the accuracy of their stoneslinging had driven him and his searats off the flatlands and down into the ditch shaking with frustration he ducked smartly as another salvo of rocks and homemade spears rattled overhead the fire at the gates had been smothered under heaps of rubble bigfang was still lying senseless on the path frink fishgill and some others had their claws fully occupied trying to catch the little oarslaves some of whom had crossed the ditch and were dodging about on the flatlands dripnose scrambled along the ditch bed to gray patch he was nursing a fractured limb keeping his head well down as missiles rained in from above aagh these creatures fight like mad things capn what did you expect them to do weevilbrain throw flowers at us maybe not but were out of spears an arrows the crew are havin to make do with throwin back the stuff thats been flung at us huh they dont seem t be short of arms atop o that wall graypatch spat contemptuously homemade rubbish theres not a proper sword or cutlass between the lot of em just wait till kybo an his buckos come over their precious wall well soon sort out the warriors from the wetnoses deadglim was nearby he shook his head doubtfully well where is kybo an the rest theyve been around there long enough to build a blasted wall never mind climb one a second later he regretted the outburst as graypatch turned to him avast there smartmouth get yourself round to the back of the east wall an see whats keepin em look lively now dripnose get lardgutt an see if you can drag that oaf bigfang back down the ditch here hes neither use nor ornament lyin spark out on that path oo mother mellus seized a full basket of rubble and heaved it toward the ditch with a mighty effort the screams and curses from below confirmed her accuracy she winked at a group of enthusiastic slingthrowers thats the stuff to give em keep it up weve got them pinned down tight how are you doing saxtus the young mouse dodged a flying rock and slung one smartly back fine marm just fine though its all a bit puzzling ive noticed that we only seem to be fighting about thirty or so searats and they had nearly a hundred by flaggs count wheres the rest of em the badger weighed a large chunk of rock in both paws as she pondered the question i dont know really i wasnt counting maybe wed better check around the walls to see theyre not laying some sort of trap you take the south wall and ill cover the eas oh thundering fur the east wall look theres dibbuns over there the three small comrades in arms were looking for more ropes to cut when mellus saxtus and flagg descended upon them you naughty little rascals what are you doing out of your beds eh burr usns oanly acutt give me those knives this instant you could have cut the paws off yourselves playing around with them oh you scallywags but we was ony savin the abbey not another word do you hear me wait until friar alder sees his best vegetable chopping knives i wouldnt like to be in your fur flagg picked up a threepronged grappling hook hold on there marm look at

we wont nex time if you start ashoutin an ascoldin so there saxtus was peering over the wall golly look at this upward of half a dozen searats had been killed by the fall impaled on broken branches or crushed by their falling comrades the rest lay about in a pitiful state moaning as they nursed broken and aching limbs flagg scratched his whiskers in disbelief well give me fins an call me a fish so thats what the rest of the pesky vermin were up to grubb shook his furry head not oop maister only arfways oop saxtus laughed loud at the joke but his merriment withered under melluss icy stare flagg however was shaking paws hugging and patting the three dibbuns well done fellers strike me you saved the abbey an no mistake bagg and runn sat against the wall rubbing their eyes and yawning the badger swept them up one in each big paw she tried to look stern but could not help smiling come on heroes bed for you three and stay there this time grubb rode down the wallsteps piggyback upon flaggs broad back oim not afeared of nobeast marthen ee wurrier that be oi oo graypatch stood out on the path his sword tight at pakatuggs neck as he called up to the ramparts truce or i kill the squirrel rufe brush slackened off his sling truce then speak your piece rat all along the west and north walls the defenders put aside their missiles to listen graypatch stood in a pool of moonlight and delivered his message stop throwing and let us withdraw rufe chuckled scornfully had enough mangy chops pakatugg squealed slightly as the sword pressed closer graypatch was in no mood to bandy insults aye weve had enough for one try you may have won the battle but ill win the war now let us walk away in peace or this one dies simeon appeared leaning on his friend the abbot go then you could have done that anytime without threatening the life of a helpless squirrel at a signal from graypatch the defeated searats began their retreat north along the path graypatch could not resist a parting shot wait and wonder when we will return mousethen you will really see what a battle is like simeon turned his head in the direction of graypatchs voice alas i will never see anything for i am blind but i can sense a lot i can feel you are both evil and desperate they say you have only one eye i am surprised at you even a fool with half an eye could see that you will never triumph against good if you are evil after their meal and a short rest the four travelers struck off westward once more into the gloomy dark swampland mariel took the lead peering into the deceptive halflight she chose a relatively straight path the other three followed her in single file along the raised trail avoiding smooth slippery rocks and testing each fraction of the way with hesitant paws to both sides of them the overhanging trees grew out of stagnantsmelling smoothness which occasionally threw up a liquid bubble betraying the treacherous nature of its surface durry sounded apprehensive oh nuncle it wouldnt do a poor lad much good to fall in there dandin brought up the rear of the file his paw on durrys shoulder aye be careful and take your time i just wish it were a bit lighter in here its like trying to plow your way through pea soup all muggy and dark green what is it we have to beware in here the wartskinned toad second in line tarquin turned his head slightly as he spoke not a sign of the old wartskinned blighter i hope were goin the right way trail leader old gel mariel kept her eyes straight ahead as far as i can see we are i chose the longest and straightest of the paths aha whats that up ahead stop a minute please they halted directly ahead of them a light was shining in the gloom a small flickering golden glow it stopped hovering farther up the path when mariel moved forward again it moved also dandin recalled the rhyme beware the light that shows the way right you are dandin old lad wot theres the very light weve jolly well got to watch out for mariel halted once more lie down and be still you three they dropped down and lay perfectly still mariel flattened herself against the path and began inching forward this time the light remained still glowing a short way above the trail durry lifted his head for a quick peep wheres she agoin to dandin stifled the hedgehogs mouth with his paw ssshhh keep quiet and be still durry mariels crawling figure had now disappeared into the murky gloom ahead of them the light still glowed steadily they waited with bated breath pressing themselves flat to the earth suddenly from along the path a dismayed croak sounded followed by a whoop from mariel and the familiar thwack of gullwhacker springing up the three travelers made their way along the path as speedily as circumstances would allow the mousemaid stood over a stunned toad it was an indescribably ugly specimen completely covered in large wartlike growths in one paw mariel twirled her gullwhacker while in the other she held a curious contrivance it was a lantern on a small carrying frame wonderfully made from thincut rock crystal inside the lantern half a dozen fat fireflies buzzed giving off a pale golden light mariel prodded the toad lightly two puzzles solved with one gullwhacker the wartskinned toad and the light that shows the way three in fact take a look ahead by the light of the lantern they saw that the path ended sharply a short distance from where they stood durry shivered if wed follered that orrible beast with his light we wouldve gone ploppo right into that swamp dandin prised a rock from the trail aye ploppo is the right word he threw the rock into the swamp it disappeared making a small hole which swiftly filled in leaving the surface undisturbed the wartskinned toad was beginning to recover groaning pitifully and rubbing his head with slimy webbed paws mariel thumped the gullwhacker down close to the repulsive creature want some more she inquired the toad recoiled in fear muurraakk no more rrrreb dandin unsheathed his sword and tickled the creatures nose listen i dont know what your game is but we want to get out of this place and youre going to lead us understood still rubbing its head it nodded unhappily dandin turned to mariel right lets get going keep this creature in the lead kwirraawwwk the wartskinned toad took off with a sideward leap at the swamp dandin reacted swiftly but not fast enough he barely grabbed the toads back leg as it sailed through the air the toad flopped into the swamp pulling dandin off balance with a squeak of dismay he toppled from the raised path slithering on its sloping side for an instant before plunging bodily into the treacherous ooze spreading its bulk flat and extending its webs the wartskinned toad slithered off across the swamp surface leaving behind dandin who was rapidly disappearing into the bottomless waste help do something im being sucked under holding tarquins paw mariel stretched out flicking her gullwhacker toward dandin here catch on to this dandin struggled to reach the rope without avail the swamp had pulled him in up to his neck now tarquin threw his harolina to dandin here old lad put both y paws on top of this it might help to keep you up dandin did as he was told but he could feel the tug of the swamp and panic filled him completely help oh help me someone an urgent voice was whispering to mariel the tree the tree she looked up at the tree hanging low overhead and immediately understood clambering up into the tree she edged out along a thick dipping bough below her she could see dandin ashenfaced as he hung on to the harolina the swamp oozing around his chin and lips hold on dandin hold on knotting gullwhacker tight to the end of the bough she called out tarquin durry get up here and lean on this branch belly down without questioning mariel they clambered up into the tree scrambling out along the branch until they were close to her both tarquin and durry followed mariels example straddling the bough stomachs down jerking to exert more pressure on the limb the swamp had closed over dandins mouth he took a final breath as it started to flood into his nostrils fighting back the welling panic as it oozed around his eyes mariel felt the branch bend lower grabbing dandins outstretched paws she noosed the gullwhacker tight around them calling to her companions back off now back along the branch quick following them with all speed she managed to cry out as they hung over the path jump the swamp had sucked dandin under his head disappeared from view mariel durry and tarquin jumped heavily from the tree to the path falling in an awkward heap atop each other the bough straightened with a tremendous rush dandin was hauled clear of the swamp with a huge squelching plop he hung there dangling above the swamp at the ropes end by both paws covered from ears to tail in thick foul mud pulling the sword from where it stood quivering on the trailside where dandin had dropped it tarquin leaned out supported by mariel and durry holding the sword by its blade he hooked the crosstree hilt into dandins belt and pulled him in mariel and durry grabbed dandins limp body tarquin swung the sword upward with a mighty slash severing the end of the bough that the gulhvhacker was tied to all four fell back in a heap on the pathside while tarquin undid the knots to free dandins paws mariel poured water from their flasks over his face washing away the ooze that caked it durry forced his mouth open whilst mariel poured water into it dandin struggled feebly and coughed mariel sighed her relief her voice choking with emotion for her friend she tried to sound busy and practical thank goodness for that i thought he was gone for a moment there tears were flowing down durry quills homely face as he joked our dandin a goner naw hell be aright i member father abbot sayin he use to eat mudpies when he were a dibbun hahahaboohoo laughing and crying at the same time durry hugged dandins paw a fire was lit though only a small one with the limited supply of fuel in the swamp tarquin took a turn at making some mushroom and turnip broth while mariel tended to dandin the young mouse had recovered sufficiently to sit up he looked away from the darklands swamp and shuddered uuuuuuhhhhh it filled my nose and eyes and sucked me under right under it was horrible ill never forget it as long as i live mariel patted his back gently there there its all right youre safe now good job you thought of the tree durry the hedgehog looked at her oddly i didnt mention no tree missy oh it must have been tarquin then thank you tarquin dont mention it old thing but ydont mind me sayin what tree you mean it wasnt you who said the tree the tree nope sorry mustve bin some other beastie dandin and mariel looked at each other dandin smiled aye the same one who told me to hold my paws up straight after i went under good old martin the warrior after a few hours they were able to resume their journey backtracking until they found another path which looked fairly straight and safe mariel walked in front holding the wartskinned toads lantern it made the visibility slightly better tarquin followed at the rear cleaning mud from his harolina supreme sacrifice wot chap keepin another chap afloat in a bally swamp with his harolina not manyd do that yknow bet hon rosied think it was a jolly noble effort on my part fact im sure she would he turned to the big frilled lizard that was following him i mean to say a chaps harolina is a very personal possession wot omigosh eulaliaaa tarquin suddenly brained the lizard with the harolina knocking it flying into the swamp other lizards sinuously scaled up from the sloping pathsides where they had been following the travelers there were at least twenty or thirty an assortment of newts and frilled lizards their reptilian tongues flickering in and out as they watched the four travelers through cold basilisk eyes durry threw up his paws in despair lackaday what now weve ad sticklegs pikes adders flitchaye mad owls a warty toad an now this dragons my nuncle gabe wouldnt believe a word iffen i told him more like hed say that i ad been adrinkin of his strong blackberry wine mariel tell a poor lad whos far from home what do we do now it was a strange scene they stood on the trail holding a hasty conference watched by the silent unblinking lizards we have two choices durry stand and fight or make a run for it dandin drew his sword im with you mariel just say the word now steady in the ranks there chaps tarquin interrupted ive already cracked a valuable harolina on one blinkin reptiles bonce hold fast a moment will you i could be mistaken but just a moment ago i swear i felt a bit of a light zephyr durry wrinkled his snout a what a light zephyr me old scout a vagrant breeze a fortunate breath a bally puff of wind in fact just give me a moment will you tarquin walked back down the trail to a tree brushing aside a newt beg pardon old lizard scuse me with an agility which belied his awkward figure the hare climbed the tree he stood on a high branch paw to forehead gazing out nodded with apparent satisfaction then descended the trunk swiftly pushing through the lizards dyou fellows mind not hoggin the trail bad form yknow idlin about an stickin your flippin tongues in an out like that returning through the dumbfounded lizards to his companions tarquin murmured under his breath to mariel tarquin l woodsorrel reportin back marm dont show too much excitement but i could see the sea from up in that tree about a couple of hours good hike from where we are does that alter the situation just thought you ought t know bein expedition leader an all that dandin gave a wriggle of suppressed joy the sea well that does change things but weve still got these lizards to contend with look theres more coming out of the swamp the lizards from the mud joined their fellows upon the trail waving long prehensile tails and strutting about slowly with sinuous reptilian grace mariel weighed the situation carefully hmrn they havent made any move to attack us yet maybe its just a display of strength in numbers though if we made a run for it they could easily stop us this is their territory they know it better than we do and were outnumbered at least ten to one right one things clear we cant stand here much longer or somethings bound to happen ive got an idea that might work hold my gullwhacker and give me that sword dandin dont ask questions just trust me wordlessly dandin gave her the sword turning from her companions the mousemaid faced the gathering of reptiles crowding the path which one of you is the leader there was no reply the lizards merely stood staring at her dont you have a chief some creature in command further silence mariel brandished the sword of martin she gave a great leap and yelled redwaaaalll i am mariel the warrior ill fight you all together or one at a time come on send your best killer out here and ill meet him in combat lizards dont bother me buckos ive ate lizard stew before today behind her she could hear durry and the others snorting to suppress a fit of laughing giggles sounds like mariel stonehead to me lizard stew oh i say thats goin it a bit dyou reckon they can understand her teeheehee mariel ignored them she approached a large crested lizard who stood half a head above the rest what about you sliptongue youre big and lazy enough to be a chief do you fancy your chance against mariel the warrior the lizard blinked turned slowly and walked majestically away with mariel shaking the sword at it so youre not only dumb but cowardly with it well let me tell you slimenose if any of your tribe try attacking my friends youre the first one im coming after ill chop off your tail and stuff it up your nose were leaving now i hope youll heed my warning swaggering outrageously the mousemaid joined her companions telling them from the side of her mouth right get moving ill stay at the back dont run keep it to a brisk walk off we go tarquin led the way almost helpless with laughter good egg dandin did ysee that swagger hohoho i thought she was going to wriggle clear out of her skin never seen anythin so funny in all me life young mouse haha and did you see the way that big lizard looked at her when she called him slimenose cawhaw his face was a picture chop off his tail n stuff it up his nose mariel stifled a chuckle picturing herself as the others saw her dont laugh too much pals theyre still following us and sure enough they were still silent tongues flickering eyes fixed staringly on the travelers backs the pack of lizards followed at an even pace not to worry chums tarquin called back i can feel that breeze quite clearly now hey dyou suppose the big chappied give me a ride on his back if i asked him nicely after all we are going the same way arent we two hours later the swamp thinned out overhanging trees became few and far between and the path petered off giving way to firm ground and fragrant gorsebushes but the greatest joy to the four travelers was the clear blue summer sky overhead after days of dark forest and swamp the fresh air tasted like springwater to them they halted and looked back to the darkland swamp the lizards were gathered on its fringes still silent flickeringtongued and beadyeyed though some of them were preening and stretching in the sudden warmth of the sun settling themselves down languorously to bask free now of the reptilian threat mariel and her friends could not resist shouting their humorous goodbyes cheerio you baggyskinned blighters dont get your noses too muddy in the jolly old swamp wot wot byebye tonguepullers give our regards to the old wartyskinned toad yes goodbye you great bunch of dumbos by the way ive never tasted lizard stew before itd probly make me sick bye now tata vermints dyou think you could make your way to our abbey someday just in case my nuncle gabe dont believe me when i tell m about ee across the gorsefields they trekked toward a range of high hills which fronted the westerly edge seabirds wheeled in the sky above while the irrepressible tarquin strummed away on his cracked harolina o i wouldnt go through the swamps no more not for an abbots feast not even for a kiss from rosie dear though shes a lovely beast give me the summer sunshine dont mind a cloud or two rather than that bally bog and a pot of lizard stew graypatch and his searats were back sooner than any creature at redwall abbey expected smarting from the ignominious defeat and with the crew beginning to mutter behind his back again the searat captain decided to turn the tide in his favor with a shock attack he camped his crew farther up the path for the remainder of the night waking them at dawn light to explain his scheme fireswingers thats the thing buckos the old fireswingers bigfang was feeling a bit cocky now graypatchs first attack had failed fireswingers me tail i already tried fire an it didnt work whats so good about your plan graypatch ridiculed bigfang ill tell you matey my planll work because ive got a brain an you havent rush the gate an set fire to it huh i could think of a better plan than that in a storm at sea with both claws tied behind me back so you either shut up an listen or ill cut you loose in this country to fend for yerself unnerstand bigfang subsided into sullen silence while graypatch continued cut up all those lengths of rope we used for grap nels tie rocks to the ends all wrapped in dead grass an soaked with lamp oil thatll make good fireswingers now we sneaks along that there ditch sos those redwallers dont see us acomin then we gets out on the flatland lights up our fireswingers an twirls em an hurls em think of it mates a good fireswinger has more range than any weapon so they wont be able to touch us with bows or lances or spears we can stand around all season flingin fire into their precious abbey an they cant do a thing about it sooner or later some part of the buildin will take flame haharr then theyll be ready to talk terms or be roasted alive well what dye say shipmates the scheme was not greeted too enthusiastically but graypatch worked upon them painting pictures of the good life to come when they would be masters of redwall his eloquence finally won and they set about making large numbers of fireswingers oo midmorning at the abbey found a repair crew clearing away the debris from the previous nights battle the front gates had been made good and piles of green branches and rubble stacked in front to prevent them being set alight again because the normal abbey routine had been disturbed a large late breakfast was being served upon the southern wallsteps friar alder and his young assistant cockleburr had made crusty country pasties and these were being served with melted yellow cheese and rough hazelnut bread there was new cider strawberry cordial and a number of latticed pear and redberry tarts to follow bagg runn and grubb were the heroes of the hour regaled with outsize portions of everything as they related their feats of derringdo embroidering and expanding as they pleased hohurr oi cloimed down ee roaps an foighted with theyns awhoil then oi clambers back oop an cuts a few more o they roaps thats true i let some of em climb right over the top cos im not afeared o searats then i jabbed em in their bottoms with my big sharp knife so they screamed an jumped back over the wall eek they went ill bet theres a few sore beinds

ive been up since an hour before dawn trying to sharpen new edges on them ignoring the caustic remarks bagg and runn propounded new ideas we could have a dibbuns army yknow good idea mate an we could fight lots of battles an all that aye thatd show some othese old fogies haha wed send them all t bed early burr wi no supper or brakkist on the morrow heehee id scrub em all beind their ears twice a day hoo urr oid spank a few o they just fer nuthin t all they froze at the sound of sister serenas voice behind them personally ive never spanked any creature for nothing at all but i hear there were three of our dibbuns missing from their beds in the dormitory last night sister sage said that they were out on the east walltop playing with friar alders sharp knives now if i found out who they were id give them a real good hidetanning for being naughty little creatures but i dont suppose you three would know who they were would you us er phwaw er oh no not us sister we were in bed fast asleep all night burr aye asnoren like hinfant ogs usns wuz marm oo saxtus was coming from the dormitory with a scroll he had been studying as he crossed the abbey lawn he witnessed a strange incident a whooshing noise in the air caused him to look up he saw what looked like a small comet of fire with a rope tail it soared upward mounting high into the blue then dropped toward earth plummeting like a stone the young mouse mentally charted its course and yelled aloud sister serena look out saxtus was rushing toward the south steps as he shouted serena not knowing what the alarm was immediately did the thing closest to her dutiful instinct she flung herself upon the three dibbuns sitting on the lower step shielding them with her body hurtling through the air the blazing rock bound around with oilsoaked grass shattered on the step where serena had been sitting friar alder gasped with shock as a sliver of rock cut his face and a heap of burning material landed on his spotless white apron creatures disturbed from their meal dived for cover beating at smoldering garments and ducking the flying shards of rock that ricocheted from the stone wallstairs saxtus beat at sister serenas habit luckily it was only scorched and the dibbuns she had protected were shocked but unharmed farther over to the center of the abbey grounds another fireswinger shot out of the sky and burst on the winding gravel path showering splintered rock and flame across the lawn saxtus flagg and the abbot dashed about roaring out warnings at the top of their lungs under cover everybeast quick inside the abbey hurry get those dibbuns inside saxtus and flagg ran upstairs rufe brush was already there notching an arrow to his bow he aimed in the general direction of the grinning jeering crew of searats standing on the flatlands around a fire rufe gritted his teeth drawing the bowstring back to its limit scum ill wipe the smiles off your dirty faces the arrow fell miserably short causing further merriment among graypatch and his crew saxtus flagg and rufe stood watching as deadglim dipped a fireswinger into the fire it flared up instantly the searat began swinging it in clockwise circles alongside his body faster and faster it swung until it was like a blur of light he let it go and off it sped like a rocket out and upward flagg could only stand and watch as it whooshed by overhead he followed its course luckily it shot straight into the abbey pond extinguishing with a splash and a hiss the big otter took the bow and arrows from rufe here matey ill put one across their bows flagg was a powerful fully grown male otter he drew back the shaft to its point and let fly at graypatch again the arrow fell woefully short flagg grabbed a spear and hurled it with all his considerable strength it did not even go as far as the arrow saxtus tried his slingshot it went farther than either the spear or the arrow but still not far enough on the flatlands the searat crew howled their derision dancing and jigging as they screamed out insults at the redwallers yah country bumpkins whats up cant ythrow here mousy fire an arrow at me haharr couldnt hit a crab in a pail hohoho the three defenders watched helplessly as another fireswinger came roaring over this one had been thrown by bigfang it hit the partially finished bell tower setting light to the woodenframe scaffolding saxtus hurried from the wall well have to organize firefighting crews aye flagg agreed miserably those things theyre chuckin have twice the range of any of our weaponry oo it was midafternoon the dibbuns would normally have been playing outside racing around the orchard paddling at the ponds edge or frolicking on the lawns now they had to stay inside the abbey building it was a hot dusty afternoon and they were becoming fractious wanna go ouside gonna play inna pond you come back here this instant young squirrel oi wants to sit in ee orchar tis wurm in yurr youd be a lot warmer if one of those flaming things hit you now lie down and take a nap thatll cool you off if you lie still im lyin down an im still roastin whens teatime not for a while yet now be good burr oi wantser be naughty oi loiks aven a liddle naughty now n agin tis noice a fireswinger hit the main abbey door with a loud crash and the dibbuns broke into startled squeaking mellus distributed candied chestnuts as she reassured them hush now its nothing saxtus and flagg will deal with it oo graypatch tore at the roasted meat from the fire grinning wolfishly at kybo he winked this is the life eh messmate a whole abbey at our mercy an nobeast to stop us ahoy ranzo any more of these skylarks skylarkin round ranzo fitted an arrow to his bow squinting upward leave it till evenin capn they start to come down then the searat sprawled on the grass in the warm summer noon aharr this is a land of plenty not like those cold northern isles he stuck an apple on a stick and began toasting it bigfang came to the fire to light another fireswinger graypatch leaned close and whispered in his ear brains bigfang thats what it takes brains you leave the thinkin to old graypatch matey ill guarantee theyll want to talk terms by this time tomorrow bigfang held his silence determined not to rise to graypatchs bait he would wait to settle their score oo evening brought no change in the situation the fireswingers poured in with perilous regularity each one coming from a different angle to land in an unexpected place according to the mood of the searat that hurled it tired and redeyed from fighting conflagrations which had sprung up all over the abbey grounds saxtus and flagg with their fire crews sat drinking cold mint tea awaiting the next fireswinger attack rufe brush and his sentries on the west wall shouted warnings at the approach of each missile hiyo the grounds fire coming in high and north they dashed over as the incendiary missile appeared at the north end sister sage calling out its hit the north wall wicker gate quick stumbling and tripping in the dark they reached the blaze and began beating the flames down with wet sacking and green boughs it took a while to defeat the blaze as they were boneweary and dogtired hiyo the grounds rufe brushs voice called out once more one coming in dead center right over me the firefighters hitched up their habits and began dashing off in the direction of the main gateway saxtus tripped and fell flat he rested a moment with his scorched face against the grass a rapping sound caused the young mouse to look up he gazed around in the darkness quizzically there it was again saxtus stood up and investigated the noise further it was coming from the wicker gate now there were voices ydont suppose theyve bally well gone to bed wot hardly old chap after all they are under invasion yknow imagine sleepin through a fireswinger attack whoohahahahooh please rosie dont laugh so close to me poor old ear its jolly well deafenin in fact dont gurgle at all if ycan help it old gel just think happy thoughts eh oh come off it clary you old bodger if i didnt have a good hoot now and again id probly swell up an burst hmm no such blinkin luck wot oh whoohahahahooh you are a card brig thyme saxtus unbolted the wicker door searats didnt laugh like that in the fading eventide light the four travelers breasted the big hills to find themselves confronted by a breathtaking sight a long rocky beach lay beneath them lapping up to the shore the rippling waves broke in a dark blue cascade glittering red as the setting sun caught the sea turning it to an iridescent green midway which faded to purply black on the horizon the huge crimson halfcircle sank slowly in the west throwing up gold and umber shadows on the undersides of long cloud layers with cream tops dandin and durry had never seen the great waters before they stared at the magnificent spectacle awestruck by the immensity of sky and sea durry sat down on the hilltop spreading his arms wide ive seen the abbey pond and that stream wi the pikes aswimmin in it but this tis too much fer one poor lads eyes to take all in dandin could add nothing to the truth in his friends simple words they descended to the shore and found that what looked like a rocky beach from above was a mass of tall stone outcrops which gave them the sensation of wandering through a mazelike canyon tarquin glanced up at the huge blockform monoliths well camp somewhere hereabouts for the night wot yell be washed away by the night tides if ye do a fat old dormouse had appeared from nowhere he stood smiling at them over the top of his quaint square eyeglasses my names bobbo tarquin bowed with the oldfashioned elegance common to hares pleasant evenin bobbo allow me to introduce us as tarquin went through the formalities mariel quietly assessed their new acquaintance the dormouse was quite old and plump he carried a knobbly stick which he leaned heavily upon his garb consisted of a faded velveteen longcoat tied about the middle with tough dried seaweed all in all a curious character his homely eyes twinkled behind the glasses as he wagged his stick up at a towering rock close by weary travelers all come ye up to my abode follow bobbo if ye please he was such a friendly harmlesslooking old character that they followed reeling instinctively that somehow they could trust him the dormouses house was a sizable cave set high in the rock and they made their way to it up natural ledges which formed a stairway in the stone oo a cheerful seacoal fire illuminated bobbos home the walls were hung with homemade fishnets and oddshaped pieces of driftwood sculpted by sand and tide rush mats scattered about served as seats and delicious odors wafted from a black stockpot set on a tripod over the fire bobbo took a ladle and stirred the contents of the pot its only shrimpandseacabbage stew with a few turnips thrown in but ye be welcome to share it he issued them with deep scallop shells and bade them help themselves durry nearly sat on a small yellowthroated newt which scampered fearfully away to a ledge at the back of the cave it sat watching them eyes blinking throat pulsating bobbo strained some of the cooked shrimp from the pot and placed it on the ledge beside the newt take ye no heed to him wayfarers he fell from yon hilltops at high tide and was washed here by the sea waters i named him fid though he never speaks to me hes a grand listener arent ye firl the small newt blinked and began eating bobbo drew them each a drink of cloudy liquid from a gourd he kept hanging near the entrance where night breezes kept it cool tis dandelion flower and wildbarley water the plants grow plentiful on the hillside do ye like it durry took a long draught from his shell bowl by ecky most afreshin my old nuncle gabe would dearly like t know how you brew this mr bobbo would ytell me how to make it the dormouse added more seacoal to his fire all in good time master durry tis a long night and ive sat alone here many a season longing for the sound of another voice but first let me tell you how i came to this place then you can tell me all about yourselves and your long journeys from the good homes you left outside the tide washed in through the rock canyons swishing and hissing as it threw spray against the walls of seascoured stone the wind made a hollow moaning dirge of its night passage through the flooded maze high in the safety of the dormouses den the four travelers sat in comfort listening to him the hightoned singsong voice causing them to blink and nod around the fire as bobbos uncomplicated tale unfolded ah me twas more seasons ago now than i do remember a winters night and there was i chained to a galley bench in a searat ship they had taken me captive when i was very young do you see i had no memory of parents home or even my name the galley bench was all i knew well now didnt an awful storm spring up a fearful thing waves washed over the side and flooded the galleys where we poor wretches were chained to the oars pulling until our backs were nigh broken whipped starved and illtreated myself was chained next to a poor weak creature a vole who just gave up life and died right next to me there on the galley bench listen now for i tell you true the master of this ship was a searat the blackesthearted scoundrel who ever stepped aboard ship gabool the wild was his name mariels eyes came wide open but she did not interrupt bobbo who by now was in full flow ah well there was i chained to an oar and a dead creature trying to pull my weight with the others as we battled against wave storm and the slavedrivers lash gabool came down into the galleys why isnt that oar workin says he because one of ems dead says the slavedriver then gabool says the way that oar isnt pullin it looks like theyre both dead throw em overboard an get two more in their place now before i could call out the slavemaster bashes me over the head and im in the sea chained to the poor dead vole what took place next i cannot be telling you for i must have passed out but the chains and the body of my dead oar partner saved my life as i awoke next morning high up on these rocks where the tide had thrown the two of us the body of the vole was caught in a crevice without him i would have been washed back into the sea again for i was hanging in my chains by both paws high up on top of this very rock with the shore far below me when i could muster the strength i climbed up to my dead partner his paws were so thin and wasted that i found little difficulty slipping the manacles and chains from them do you know i often wish that he had lived for then i would have had some creature to talk with be that as it may twas in climbing down these rocks that i found this cave so here am i bobbo the vole lies buried on the green hillside i think he would have liked that when i had freed myself of the chains i threw them far into the sea from the high rocks here i have lived a solitary peaceful life though not without its perils i did try to make my way inland but was lost in the swamps for many days lucky i was to find my way back here tis best that here i stay maybe one day i will teach little firl to speak then we can talk together bobbo left off staring into the fire so then there you have it all look now i can see you are for sleeping lie down and rest you can tell me about yourselves in the morning it is warm and safe here you will sleep well tarquin dandin and durry needed no second bidding but mariel was not tired the mousemaid sat up far into the night questioning bobbo about gabool though the dormouse had little information to impart he was however eager to hear about the travelers so in return for his kindness mariel did not keep him in suspense until the morrow she related all their adventures as bobbo sat keenly drinking in every word with firl making tiny snoring sounds on the ledge behind them the squeal of sea gulls wakened dandin as rosy dawn banished the coverlet of night he lay still only his eyes moving about taking in their new surroundings the other three were still fast asleep dandin rose and stretched as bobbo stumped in followed by firl his faithful newt the dormouse bore twigs and a full sack dandin it is a good morning i am bidding you look dried applewood and sweet herbs to burn it makes my abode smell fresh in the mornings now you will find a small rockpool outside to wash in and i will prepare wild oatcakes small fish and gorseflower honey to break your fast the young mouse grinned that sounds excellent to me bobbo thank you he was back in a short while splashing water over his sleeping friends rise and shine wakey wakey oatcakes honey and fish last one washed doesnt get any tarquin sprang up shaking himself i say you sly young cad why didnt ywake me earlier by the pattern on me auntys pinny bobbo that smells good oo morning sunlight was beginning to flood the cavern as they sat eating mariel had a surprise to reveal youll never guess what i learned last night while i was talking to bobbo durry licked honey from his paws and juggled with a hot oatcake no marm youre right well never guess so hurry up an tell us the mousemaid recited the appropriate lines of the poem where the sea meets with the shore there the final clue is hid rock stands sentinel evermore find it as i did the swallow who cannot fly south the bird that only flies one way lies deep beneath the monsters mouth keep him with you night and day do you remember that part of the rhyme well last night while you were all snoring i sat up telling bobbo of our quest and guess what tarquin dipped his oatcake in the amber honey impatiently whatwhatwhat mariel smiled intriguingly from one to the other bobbo knows where the swallow is i say good egg what a spiffin old bobbo you are wot even more cleverer than my nuncle gabe an thats a fact do you really know bobbo oh tell us please the dormouse stood up brushing crumbs from his longcoat do you come with me and i will show it to you bobbo hobbled in front with firl at his heels he led them on a southerly tack through the twisting winding canyons keeping up a surprisingly lively pace now disappearing into shadowed recesses and materializing into bright sunlight sometimes they crunched upon small pebbles other times pattered across damp sand occasionally splashing through sunwarmed shallow pools finally they arrived at their destination bobbo leaned against a monumental edifice well now friends here is the very place this rock was much larger than any they had previously encountered it was almost a small mountain set in the sands giving the impression of some vast primeval monster squatting upon the shore with its back to the sea the dormouse led them to the east side of the rock where a huge overhang projected over a pool that was both wide and deep dandin looked about expecting to see a swallow perched somewhere close bobbo pointed to the pool see right at the bottom lodged between two rocks gathering around the rim they peered into the underwater grotto through the clear limpid water aided by lancing rays of sunlight it could be dimly seen no bigger than the size of a mouses paw a swallow fashioned from metal its outspread wings partially obscured by the rocks which held it captive amid the brightly hued sea anemones and corals on the bed of the pool dandin shook his head in amazement how did you ever find it bobbo fishing young master i was fishing for shrimp one day sitting here staring down into the pool when i saw it glint in the early sunlight and didnt you try to get it out ah well i did try for nearly half a day with my hook and line but it was too smooth and firmly lodged in the rocks so i had to leave the little bird do you see then after i found firl i brought him along to this place to dive for it newts are excellent swimmers of course they are why didnt firl get it the small newt scampered down from the rock and cringed against bobbo eyes wide and throat palpitating madly ah well do you see it is not only the little bird who lives down at the bottom the dormouse explained there is also a great shell creature one with claws like vises great eyes on stalks and long whiskers poor firl lost his tail to the beast it has only lately grown back i would not let him go down there again no not ever bobbo produced a piece of oatcake from his longcoat powdering it he mixed it to a paste with some water and molded it around a small pebble watch now and see he dropped the coated pebble into the pool close by the edge they gathered around and marked its progress as it sank rapidly to the bottom of the water near the part where the swallow lay the pebble came to rest it had no sooner landed than a gigantic blueblack lobster rushed out of a crevice pounced on the stone and retreated swiftly with the object held tightly in its enormous pincered claws it all happened so fast that the onlookers were stunned into momentary silence bobbo shrugged so you see now wayfarers is it not a dreadful monster durry blanched its even too orrible to look at mr bobbo mariels jaw was set firm and resolute but ive got to go down there and rescue the swallow if you go down then i do too there was determination in dandins eyes er er oh dash it count me in as well you chaps mariel shook her head no tarquin you and durry stay up here with bobbo well need you two to lower us down and pull us out quick now let me think awhile ill have to figure out the best way to do this durry mopped his brow and blew out a sigh of relief thank my stars my old nuncled ave a fit if half a poor nephew walked back in on im one o these days best we stay up ere mr woodsorrel just think what your hon rosied say if you turned up with no nose and ony one ear bet shed be rightly peeved peeved peeved aint the word young durry rosied take a screamin blue tizzy if she saw a magnificent specimen of harehood minus a hooter an a lug good grief id have to run off an become a bally searat or somethin equally foul oo it was noontide before mariel and dandin came up with a workable solution they went back to bobbos cave where they gathered together what rope they could find plus all the cooked shrimp and small fish they could lay paws upon back at the pool mariel explained her strategy to the others the idea is to throw as much food to the lobster as possible lets start right now durry tarquin chuck the shrimp and fish in i want you to keep your eyes on the lobster once it stops coming out to get the food let me know dandin you and i will search about for two rocks we need something to weight us down and make us sink to the bottom of the pool while were down there you keep watch with the sword ready ill get the swallow then durry and tarquin can haul us up out of it soon the final preparations had been made mariel and dandin sat on the rock lip of the pool with ropes tied about their waists the mousemaid put aside her gullwhacker it would be useless underwater dandin took off his scabbard and held on to the sword durry and tarquin were still dropping odd bits of food into the water i think the old lobster villains had enough hes not botherin to come out for any more tucker the waters teemin with jolly nice fish an shrimp but he seems to have had a tummyful great glutton both mice picked up their rocks bobbo gave final instructions now then do you go straight down and get the bird tug on the ropes and we will haul you up fast if we see the creature come out we will pull you up whether you have the swallow or not i wish you both luck and good fortune now take a slow deep breath side by side mariel and dandin slid into the water the coldness forcing them to take deep breaths then the weight of the stones took over with eyes wide open the pool closed above their heads and they began their descent into the silent aquamarine depths of the watery world book three the sound of a bell the hare shook paws with mother mellus inside great hall as the fireswingers roared outside on the lawns and in the orchard long patrol from salamandastron at yservice marm colonel clary brigadier thyme and hon rosie mellus inspected clarys paw youve been hurt ill get a proper dressing for that wound sister sage

alder reluctantly parted with his three best vegetable knives again take care of them please mr thyme its brigadier sah brigadier but you can call me brig not to worry about the old frogstickers well have em back good as new saxtus and flagg sat with their backs to the abbey building taking a breather and a drink of cool dandelion and burdock cordial while gabriel quill and friar hubert took over the firefighting relief column flagg rubbed the cold stone beaker against his brow whew i opes those hares cn help us nice folk though a little snooty in their manner o talkin like saxtus took a long draught of his drink theyre salamandastron hares brother hubert said battletrained and ready for anything leave it to them theyll know what to do flagg oo out in the woodlands beyond the east wallgate clary trimmed shoots from a thick yewpole with friar alders knife there that should be just the ticket wot six long staves good solid yew hows the oak comin along rosie old gel capital clary we found a big old one quite dead an ready to topple but loads of sound branches on it just the right length too hahahahooh thyme looked up from his labors i noted lots of fishin line in the kitchens we can plait it together should be ideal clary smiled grimly well done thyme come on lets go an hour before daybreak deadglim shook graypatch awake he went to the fire and warmed himself hows it goin mateys swinging his arm around ever faster frink suddenly let a fireswinger go it roared off into the lightening sky like a shooting star great capn though were usin green vines instead o rope now theres loads of it growin over yonder plenty o dead grass too we could keep this up all season its bags o fun graypatch helped himself to roasted bird tearing at it hungrily haharr so it is shipmate get summat to eat now ill take over fer a while hoho they must be run ragged inside those walls by now pretty soon theyll be too tired an slow then a firell start that they wont be able to cope with thats when well pay em a visit come on me lucky bucks keep aslingin those flames in bigfang stood up rubbing sleep from his eyes he stared toward the abbey walls in the gathering daylight he ran across to graypatch capn look its those three big rabbits who were aboard the darkqueen see em large as life on the walltop graypatch spat out some burnt feathers and picked at his fangs noddletop those aint rabbits dont yknow a hare when ysee one anyow what difference does it make to us who they are theyll burn same as the rest of em wake yerself up addlebrain an start throwin c d they met on the walltop in front of the threshold facing the plain from where graypatch and his entire contingent could be seen around the large fire which provided ignition for the missiles colonel clary brig thyme hon rosie mother mellus and flagg saxtus stood to one side he watched as clary took command all traces of jocularity and fun gone from the hares normally quirky voice there were six bows and a large stock of arrows on the threshold clary picked up a bow and a single shaft im aware that you all know how to fire a bow but ill go over this once to refresh your memories this bow like the others we have made is a longbow solid yew and more than twice the size of the ones you are used to it is strung with a cord plaited from fishing lines to give it extra power the arrows as you can see are far longer than normal arrows thicker too they are oak firehardened tips and leaf flights now i have chosen you because you are the biggest strongest creatures in the abbey the very ones to fire these longbows let me demonstrate as saxtus watched clary notched an arrow onto the bowstring stand sideon to the bow keep it upright draw back the string so that the shaft is fully occupied and the string taut bring the arrow up to the jawline sight with one eye along the shaft allowing for the arrow to take a curving course mounting upwards and coming down right on the object aimed at right now for a target thyme pointed the rat dipping a swinger into the fire get him clary adjusted his eyeline drew the arrow back to its limit and let fly the taut longbow string twanged as the heavy oak shaft hissed off into the dawn light saxtus held his breath ranzo was about to start whirling his fireswinger when the arrow struck him it knocked him backward dead before he could blink the fireswinger dropping from his nerveless claws saxtus was still a novice in the art of war and the sudden death shocked him yyou kkilled him hes dead he stammered to the grimfaced hare clary issued longbows to the others aye young mouse it was a clean shot keep your head down and issue us with arrows as we call for them in case youre feeling sorry for that wretch let me tell you something fire is the most dangerous thing to any living woodlander once it takes a hold it means death and destruction to everyone and everything only a searat would use fire sometimes i think it is because they do not realize the danger being creatures who live on the great waters but most of the time i think it is because they are evil vermin we at salamandastron have battled against searats all our lives i would not dare tell you some of the sights i have seen searats are complete enemies they live only to kill and conquer they are completely merciless thyme notched an arrow to his bowstring rightyho chaps give em vinegar wot five more messengers of death hissed through the early morning it was then that saxtus decided the hares manner was merely a front presented to others because they would forget the real purpose behind the guardians of the shores the young mouse doled out arrows knowing that he would never get used to warfare and be a jolly fellow one moment and a ruthless fighter the next oo pandemonium reigned in the searat camp graypatch ran hither and thither trying to stop his searats retreating out of the range of the deadly longbows exhorting them to carry on with his plan which had worked quite well until the appearance of the hares come on shipmates dont let a few arrows scare yer off lardgutt kybo get back here we were beatin em we still can bigfang sat well out of range a smug expression on his face i told yer about those rabbits graypatch but you wouldnt listen would yer oh no you knew best the searat captains temper broke completely you lilylivered wormhearted bilgescrapins mutineers deserters the whole pack of yer we had the battle nearly won an now youve turned tail an slunk off like a load of sea slugs look at me am i afraid am i scared haharr ha ha ha i laugh at em graypatch grabbed a fireswinger putting light to it he began swinging it furiously ill show yer abbeyscum ill bring yer redwall down in flames he dodged ducking a flying arrow the fireswinger lost momentum right at its peak and the burning section fell onto his footclaws yaaheeeoooooh graypatch hopped about beating at his burning limb fur smoldering as he threw himself upon his back screeching and thudding his scorched footclaws against the ground oo hon rosie fell back whooping hysterically whoohahahahooh oh i say chaps that was a real old hotfoot oo down in the orchard gabriel quill and burgo mole sat looking at each other yurr they vermints baint chucken no more foir at usns nor they arent neither burgo hoho your eyes are all red n smoky hurrhurr talk about eeself

cockleburr had been given charge of dibbuns breakfast time he mopped his brow as he chased grubb about with a bowl of corn pudding oh wanderin woodpigeons will you come an eat this breakfast you

wanna play inna orchard fidgetin frogs mother mellus told me nobeast goes out without eatin breakfast first specially dibbuns ho well do ee sling it unner yurr an usns will force et daown mariel and dandin dropped silently to the bottom of the pool dandin with sword in one paw and weightstone in the other immediately turned to face the lobsters den he could see the big crustacean it watched them as it lay unmoving one great claw hanging in front the other by its side the lobster looked peaceful enough for the moment still dandin did not relax his vigilance for a single instant mariel let go of her weightstone and tried to dislodge the tiny metal swallow but it was lodged firmly between two slabs of rock she chose the smaller of the two slabs and began wresting it out of the way by this time both she and dandin were longing for a breath of air struggling with the cumbersome rock mariel could feel the blood pounding round inside her head she set her footpaws on the large rock and gave the smaller rock a mighty shove without warning it shifted giving off an odd crumbling noise underwater clouds of silt and sand boiled up as it toppled to one side disturbed by the noise and movement in its pool the huge blueblack lobster came scurrying out dandin barely saw the monster come he backed water thrusting the swordpoint at its eyes mariel snatched at the swallow but it slipped from her grasp and slid into the sand in the confusion of disturbed cloudy water she realized that she had lost the precious object now the lobster had dandin trapped up against the rock thinking quickly he pushed forward landing in between its claws it was a clever move he was stuck up against the hideous face of the creature too close for it to use its cumbersome oversized nippers they clacked across his back like giant shears unable to bite him but it was like being caught in a vise dandin was held fast in the embrace of the heavyshelled joints the sword was squeezed from his grip and fell to the bottom of the pool he shouted aloud in desperation but the sound was only a boggle of noise lost amid the air bubbles that escaped from his mouth however mariel had heard it forgetting the swallow she turned to the aid of her friend lungs bursting she scrabbled about on the pool bed until her paw came in contact with the sword the lobster doubled up to rid itself of dandin and the hefty fanlike tail caught mariel a swipe as she tried to get close the air was now forcing itself out of the mousemaids mouth in huge bubbles she wondered why her friends on the surface were not attempting to haul them up her limbs felt like lead and her head was ringing blindly she struck out with the sword and pierced the lobsters back down near its tail infuriated the lobster turned lashing out with one claw instantly freed dandin felt himself being hauled quickly to the surface the lobster locked on to the sword blade with its viselike pincer mariel felt herself being hauled up on the rope she was now upsidedown in the water clinging grimly on to the sword the lobster below her hanging on to the sword blade with one claw whilst trying to get at her with the other a large rock came splashing down onto the lobster followed by another and another it let go of the sword as it was battered to the pool bottom by yet more rocks mariel was pulled clear of the pool with a whoosh of spray and a rush of air and she fell upon the sand spitting out water and gasping for breath tarquin sat her up pushing her back and forward mariels head was rising and falling as it nearly touched her footpaws and the water gushed out as she coughed come on old gel just like the village pump wot tarquin chuckled cheerfully dandin was in slightly better shape having been pulled out marginally sooner than mariel he sat with his back against the rocks in the sunlight as durry fussed about him any more water t come up matey no thank you durry just let me rest ill be all right they sat mariel beside him she wiggled a paw in her ear well what about that little adventure eh and all for nothing bobbo squatted in front of her smiling behind his glasses well now why do you say all for nothing young mouse mariel scuffed the sand irritably because we never got the swallow bobbo pressed something into her paw then tell me what this is mariel stared at the tiny metal bird she was holding but how bobbo chuckled and patted her paw it was firl i told you that the newts are very good at the swimming he went in and got it while you and your friend dandin battled with the creature we could not risk pulling you up you see the water was too cloudy and disturbed and we could not see what was happening then firl dived in and i myself decided you needed air or you would both drown so i said pull up whatever is happening pull durry swelled his chest out proudly the rocks were my idea missy me n tarquin hurtled em at the beastie as we pulled you out mariel got slowly up and hugged them one by one what good friends you are all of you later in the cave they took a closer look at the little swallow it was made of some shining blue metal which gave off strange glints in the sunlight shaped like a fantailed swallow wings spread wide as if it were flying dandin noticed a small hole bored through one of the wingtips see this hole what dyou suppose its for i dont know maybe for something to fit into it hmm itd have to be pretty thin to fit through that tiny hole bobbo pulled a thread from the lining of his velveteen longcoat something as thin as this are you thinking wayfarers dandin nodded yes thats thin enough lets try it the swallow hung by the piece of thread it dangled there turning slowly then stopped facing the right wall of the cave they watched it the little bird remained still tarquin took hold of the thread here lets see the bally old bird he spun it on the thread round and round it went finally coming to rest facing the same way again the right wall of the cave no matter how many times it was spun it still ended facing the same direction the wall on the right side of bobbos cave durry shook his head in amazement just like the poem says the swallow who cannot fly south mariel smiled aye it flies the opposite way north dandin recited the last lines of the poem his flight is straight norwest is true your fools desire hell show to you bobbo held up the swallow on its thread watching as each time it stopped turning it pointed due north this is a thing of great magic you could be going anywhere in dark or fog yet it would guide you see northwest is at the point of the birds neck between its head and left wing so you see travelers let the little swallow think he is flying north but you take the northwest course truly a marvelous bird my friends at supper they sat around the fire discussing their next move mariel knew well what it was we need a boat dandin left off polishing the sword how long would it take to build a boat where would we get the timber we know nothing of boatbuilding a gloomy silence prevailed the fire flickered warmly about the rock walls as they sat mentally wrestling with the problem bobbo looked from one to the other before speaking ah well now it is sad and dreary your faces are you are my friends i would like you to stay here forever but i know that your fate and search are elsewhere and you will leave sooner or later so listen to what i must tell you you want a boat i do not have a boat but i know where a ship lies mariel sprang up where please tell us where the ship is bobbo the old dormouse sat back stroking firls head gently i saw her a few days ago she was drifting north round the headland a curious ship with not a living creature aboard her so then i followed her along the shore she had neither masts nor rigging the tide sent her up into the cove on the other side of the headland and i boarded her in the shallows twas a terrible sight to see a searat ship greenfang she was named burnt out in some battle though not anyone aboard of her there was no supplies or things i could be using myself ah well then i anchored her fast to some rocks and left her there now i warn you she has neither sail nor masts the cabins are all gutted by fire but the hull is sound and she has steering and a rudder she will take you where you want to go i will show you her on the morrow and you can decide for yourselves though i see by your faces that your minds are already set on it go you to sleep now tis probably the last good rest you will be taking in many a perilous day ahead as for myself i will bide here with my friend firl i am too old for such wild adventures peace is all i seek now oo by midmorning of the next day they were riding the charred hulk of greenfang out upon the tide with scant supplies no proper accommodation and an outward wind mariel held the long tiller the metal swallow constantly pointing north under cover of a makeshift awning tarquin wiped a paw bravely across his eyes dandin sniffed copiously durry wept unashamedly but mariel smiled fondly at the two small figures growing dim in the distance as they waved from the shoreline she would never forget bobbo the quaint little dormouse or his silent friend firl the newt and their peaceful existence in the cave amid the tall rocks now the mousemaid turned to the open sea and the unknown dangers that lay before them abbot bernard realized the value of battletrained hares accordingly he allowed the trio full rein in defending the abbey trusting to their military judgment clary organized most things within redwall whilst the threat of attack was still a possibility he was very good at it sentries were posted upon the walls in a regular roster with the exception of simeon no creature was excluded at least one longbow archer was posted at all times night and day fully armed and ready to shoot apart from that the daytoday routine was not interfered with creatures got on with the business of living at the abbey carrying out their chores and taking their ease and pleasure when permitted tonight was such a night the abbot had ordered a special supper in honor of the hares flagg offering to take thymes watch with the longbow cavern hole was the venue tables were laid around the walls with a splendid running buffet spread upon them one thing the hares did not lack was appetite the splendid fare offered by the famous redwallers made the salamandastron food seem spartan in comparison colonel clary found himself ushered around plate in paw by sister serena colonel perhaps you would like to try some of this deeper n ever pie deeper n wot marm looks delicious i must say jolly strange name yes its a great favorite of the moles you knowfull of turnip n tater n beetroot to use the mole language i say i

them colonel clary the hare turned to mellus his eyebrows raised marm go after them actually its not the searats im thinking of its the oarslaves its pitiful really what sort of a life must those poor creatures lead as slaves of the filthy searats couldnt we i mean you arrange to sort of release them and bring them back here now now mellus abbot bernard interrupted the badger colonel clary and his

theyve gone off to face goodness knows what perils questing for a bell searching for a strange island determined to slay gabool the searat where will it all end i hope those youngsters are safe wherever they are sometimes i wish that little mousemaid would have stayed as storm gullwhacker instead of finding out her real name was mariel clary halted his assault on a nearby vegetable flan stap

little slaves who are in a shameful position simeon what would you have me do sit safe here in redwall abbey and not bother about it at all the blind herbalist spread his paws apologies apologies i did not realize you felt so strongly about the slaves being blind i cannot see them but i suppose if i had my sight id shout for their rescue as loudly as you in the small hours between midnight and dawn the three hares stole silently through mossflower toward the searat encampment armed only with their lances clary stopped the other two a short distance from the glow of the enemy campfires rightyho got it all clear now me n rosie do the decoyin thyme youre the jolly old rescuer when youve got a couple of slaves make straight back to redwall the south wallgate is only bolted with a

walltop be ready with a longbow in case were followed an its nip an tuck good luck old scout come on rosie bob n tack duck n weave you know the drill wot oo foul tempers predominated around the searat campfires graypatch sat apart disgusted with the rest after their rout by five longbows on the flatlands just as his fireswinger plan was beginning to look as if it might work the searat captain lashed out at any rat that came near him giving vent to his contempt slimesloppin mudsuckin cowards haharr tis a pity that those longbows never took care of more o you mutinous deckscum then id only have meself to think of instead o a pack of seascabbed poltroons the crew lay about sulkily not answering because they knew graypatch was looking to pick a fight and slay somebeast to slake his spleen from over to graypatchs left a voice called from the shadows hoho matey you did a fine jig with your foot afire shove it in yonder flames an do us another ornpipe go on graypatch whirled his sword dashing toward the rats who were lounging in the area whence the insult had issued yer lilylivered maggot stan up an say that to me face next instant a voice called from the other side of the camp maggot yerself stinkbreath were takin no more orders from you graypatch veered rushing in the direction of the second voice belay ill rip the tongue out o yer mouth show yerself another voice called from yet a third direction flopnose you couldnt rip yer mothers apron graypatch hurled himself on deadglim and began throttling the unfortunate searat as he pleaded his innocence gwaaark it wasnt me capn i swear it gyuuurgh i never said a wuuurgh frink was deadglims mate he ran across to prevent graypatch choking his friend to death but bigfang tripped him with a spear leave them be rat deadglim might show a bit of fight back fishgill leaned across who asked you to interfere fatmouth he slapped bigfang across the head with the flat of his cutlass as he did someone else kicked fishgill from behind you leave bigfang alone fleahead fishgill turned and punched lardgutt in the eye kick me would you weeviltail take that lardgutt drew his dagger screaming furiously i never kicked yer but youll pay for that punch snotface within a short time the entire camp was in uproar as fights broke out all over the place clary and rosie flitted about like two fleeting moonshadows belting heads and roaring out in imitation searat voices bigfang fer capn graypatch is ony a deckwal loper avast get stuck in buckos poor deadglims bein strangled rosie whacked a passing rat on the back of his head with her lancebutt take that from kybo you scum i never did like you with a screech of rage the rat grabbed a corsairs hook and went after kybo yelling an all these seasons i thought you was my matey the fight was going splendidly until hon rosie could no longer hold back her laughter haharr you durty decksweepin take that whoohahahahooh oh i say this is super fun come on chaps scrag each other harder instantly the fighting ground to a halt corks rosie youve torn it now old gel yneed to gag that giggle clary could be heard muttering in the firelight shadows graypatch left off throttling deadglim weve been tricked mates its those hares get em but saying was far easier than doing the hares were up and gone through the nightshaded woodlands before the searats could assemble themselves to give chase thyme had gone also and with him two young shrews from the oarslave ranks but this would not be discovered until daylight arrived captain flogga of the ship rathelm was a hard and seasoned searat he had served gabool long and well but the old gabool was vastly different from the one he faced now flogga had taken no chances keeping his crew fully armed and tight about him when he landed at terramort they had marched straight up to fort bladegirt and trooped into the banqueting hall flogga knew there was safety in numbers now sitting in front of the searat king he was shocked at the change that had come over the warlord of the waves gabool was gibbering mad he was a truly terrifying sight his fine silk gear all stained and torn rings and bracelets tarnished and bent the golden emeraldstudded teeth still gleamed though the eyes above them were bloodred caked and running from many sleepless nights the searat captain was frightened mad and disheveled as he was gabool looked doubly dangerous and there was always the risk was he really insane or merely playing at it for some reason best known to himself gabools mood could switch from good humor to evil temper from friendly camaraderie to murderous enmity at the blink of an eye not for nothing was he feared by all searats captains and crews alike still flogga was completely taken aback at the way gabool addressed him haharr graypatch i knew youd come back someday well well me old shipmate graypatch back at bladegirt with a full crew about him the searat captain shook his head gabool dont ye know me its flogga master of the rathelml smiling craftily gabool waggled a claw at him haharr so you say matey so you say but you cant fool me graypatch i know who you are wheres my ship darkqueen eh darkqueen dont mention that craft t me youve ad us chasin our tails across the waves high n low lookin fer darkqueen im beginnin to think its all some kind o game like that treasure shes supposed to have stowed in er hold gabool cocked his head to one side both eyes roving up and down oddly treasure ysay have you been talkin to saltar matey saltar hes dead dead saltar who killed him you did right ere in your own banquetin hall haharr so i did graypatch so i did listen matey ferget darkqueen itll be me n you agin just like in the old days eh but i keep tellin ye im flogga not graypatch gabool winked slyly nah you cant fool me listen about that treasure it was never in the darkqueen i only said that to ave you brought back ere flogga blew out a long sigh he decided to humor the mad king all right gabool so im back ere now what gabool leaned close whispering confidentially hearken t me graypatch the treasure is here right here in bladegirt only me knows where tis dye want me to show it t yer flogga suddenly became interested aye id like that shipmate haharr well tell this lot to stay here an come with me oh no gabool what dyer want to separate me from me crew for eh graypatch i thought you was a brainy one mate we dont want t share all that booty with this useless load of flotsam now do we flogga stared at gabool uncertain of what he should do suspecting the searat king might be leading him into a trap yet eager to get his claws upon the treasure in the end greed won all right gabool itll be just like the old days fiftyfifty lead me t the booty mate but earken play me false an my daggerll find yer throat afore youre much older play ye false gabool sounded indignant youre the one who played me false graypatch but im givin ye another chance shipmate now get rid of these numbskulls an follow me flogga turned to his crew and gave them a wait here sign he nodded and winked at them outwardly confident but inwardly apprehensive as he strode off after the searat king oo gabool fitted the spear through the iron ring and heaved as the stone lifted he slid it to one side flogga stood in the doorway of the chamber still wary of a trap the searat king pointed to the black hole in the center of the floor down there tis me old matey more booty than you could wink an eye at come an get your half graypatch or are you afeared flogga remained in the doorway i dont know gabool strode over and grasped his paw tightly then well go down there together eh tell you what matey well take a run an jump in at the same time both o us haharr just think gabool an graypatch down there midst all that booty flogga gnawed at his lip together at the same time both of us aye matey thats the way come on one t be ready two t be steady three t be off clutching floggas claw gabool rushed him at the hole flogga finding gabool running eagerly alongside him felt confident they leaped together flogga down into the hole gabool right across it onto the other side where he landed chuckling hoho skrabblag i told yer id bring graypatch ere for a visit flogga screamed with horror something was rustling and clicking in the darkness as gabool held a flaring walltorch over the pit flogga moaned in despair a fully grown black scorpion was stalking him in the close confines of the pit claws clicking armored hide rustling against the floor it advanced upon him the venomous needlepointed sting in its tail held high ready to strike gabool laughed insanely you remember skrabblag dont yer matey hahahaharr thick fog had dropped upon the sea and the waters ran smooth almost waveless from her point at the tiller mariel could not make out the other end of the ship one thing became apparent they were becalmed lying on the unrippled waters in the midst of the heavy dripping mist tarquin brought food to her side absolutely dreadful this bally fog wot shouldnt bother us though old gel as soon as we move again at least itll be in the right direction the jolly little swallow fellerll see to that right tarquin wheres dandin and durry i havent seen them for a while forard i think thats the right nautical jargon theyve found some line an fancy their paws as fisherbeasts mariel leaned on the tiller gnawing at a cold oatcake as she stared about her into the blank whiteness funny isnt it the fog seems to be ten times thicker at sea than on land if you stare into it long enough you begin to see all sorts of odd shapes looming up on you hmm quite eerie i never liked it when i was at salamandastron yknow beastly stuff its like bein surrounded by steam from a kettle cept that its all chilly an clammy brrrr hsst tarquin did you hear something no unless its those other two up at the front of the boat beg pardon i mean the forard end yaaaaah look out crrrraaassshhh the burnedout hulk quivered as the high prow of the searat galley seatalon rammed her amidships heeling her high out of the water the burnt timbers shattered under the impact as the hulk overturned and smashed completely in two pieces mariel grabbed the metal swallow before being hurled off into the fog she hit the waters with a dull splash all around she could hear shouting and confusion capn catseyes weve struck a vessel then board er you bilgeswillins see if theres any pickins t be had where away is she now weve rammed er in the fog capn shes broke in two cant see a thing in this cursed fog is seatalon damaged fishtail no capn were all right the other one broke right easy though mustve been some sort o wreck eh aye itll be sunk by now capn catseyes theres two beasts in the sea well hook em out dont stand there dreamin look its a mouse an a hedgepig haul em aboard pump the water outta them an bring em t my cabin oo mariel trod water holding the swallow between her teeth the gullwhacker about her neck weighing heavily in the sea cries from the searat ship died away into the fog and now she was alone on the deep shrouded by the allenveloping mists and without her companions suddenly something grabbed her footpaws and pulled her under kicking madly she wriggled and fought underwater the mousemaid lashed out connecting hard with something whatever it was had let go of her mariel fought her way to the surface and emerged next to tarquin who was spitting water and gurgling gwaawhg i mustve gone right t the bottom then i say was that your paws i grabbed hold of mariel was overjoyed to see her friend tarquin its you ill say it is who did you expect a fish with fur an ears it was a searat ship that rammed us theyve got dandin and durry aboard i heard them call it the seatalon oh corks dandin n durry captured by searats whattl we do what can we do which way did this seatalon go over that way i think though its hard to tell in this fog then theres only one thing for it well have to swim after it and see if we can get our friends back come on they struck out into the fogged sea swimming as hard and as fast as they could after a while tarquin halted treading water as he floated sno use mariel whew im out of breath me too we could be going in circles in this fog then i vote we just float here until it clears dyou want my harolina it makes rather a good float well both use it then together they rested their paws on the instrument it buoyed them slightly and they kicked their legs slowly to keep afloat well this is a pretty mess were in and no mistake how far do you suppose we are from shore tarquin no idea old scout its sink or swim from here on in i say im famished you dont happen to have any tucker on you sorry all i had was that cold oatcake and i lost that in the wreck ah well at least we wont make a nice fat meal for any fishes that are feelin peckish i suppose there are fishes around here could be might be one or two big ones with huge mouths and sharp teeth steady on miss you could scare a chap out of a seasons growth talkin like that oo mariel and tarquin lost all reckoning of distance or position as they floated for what seemed like endless hours gradually the fog began to thin giving way to slightly choppy water and mists which were soon dispelled by a stiff breeze there was not much to see no sight of the searat galley nor of land they were completely surrounded by rising waves helping each other as best as they could the two friends conserved their energy by floating only swimming when the seas became too rough mariel looked up at the sky evening was not far off it gets cold on the sea at night hmm ydont say its blinkin cold enough now my paws have gone all dead an shrivelled with the salt water mine too tarquin im sorry i got you into this i should have traveled alone now dandin and durry are the prisoners of searats and were not going to last long out here oh nonsense old miss mousy i wouldnt have had it any other bally way none of it was your fault wed have come along whether you liked it or not now stop that kind o talk an save your breath youre a good friend tarquin l woodsorrel i wont forget you should jolly well hope not rosie too hope she thinks of old tarkers feedin the fish now an then oh rosie youll never find another as devilmaycare an handsome as me poor old thing mariel draped her gullwhacker across the harolina her limbs were beginning to tire seawater lapped into her mouth and she spluttered i say why dont you take the swallow out of your mouth an tie it round your neck good idea tarquin thank you oh dear theres the jolly old sun beginnin to set im so tired i could lie back in the water and go to sleep steady on there dont start talkin like that here ill hold you up for a bit no tarquin you need all your energy to stay afloat yourself fiddlededee ive got energy i havent even used yet there hows that mariel gullwhacker thats fine tarquin but you wont be able to keep us both up for long spose not but when that time comes well sink together wot clinging to each other they bobbed on the open sea oblivious of the glory of the setting sun and the manyhued sky which reflected in the waters all round night closed in on the hare and the mousemaid two massive paws shot down into the water and grabbed them both hauling them effortlessly out of the night sea and onto a heaving deck woodsorrel i might have known it would be you semiconscious and shivering uncontrollably tarquin peered up into the huge striped face of rawnblade i sssay mlord dddidnt know youd taken t bbboatin wot you young rogue i suppose youve brought this poor mousemaid along with you just to get her drowned quite the cccontrary sssir hmm well discuss that later after youre both fixed up when mariel regained consciousness she was in the cabin of the waveblade a charcoal fire burned in the small stove and she was clad in castoff searat garments lord rawnblade made her drink some heavy dark wine and eat a little dried fruit tarquin was fully recovered mariel could not suppress a smile at the comical figure he cut dressed in searat silks with a cloak of yellow chenille draped about him tarquin admired the daggers and swords he had stuffed into the widesashed belt of orange satin and earrings and bangles jangled as he twirled about dramatically haharr me booties tis only i tarquin the terrible rawnblade sniffed away a smile threatening to steal across his face id say awful was more appropriate than terrible the badger lord turned to mariel so tell me mousemaid what were you doing bobbing about on the high seas in company with this addlebrained creature mariel sipped more of the wine feeling its dark warmth comfort her well its a long story sir but ill start at the beginning outside wind keened the darkness scouring the face of the sea as rain began to spatter the decks waveblade cut her course northward her tiller lashed in position by the sodden gullwhacker as the ship plowed on through the night guided by a small metal swallow abbot bernard watched the two young shrews as they attacked the abbey breakfast board like hungry wolves swigging pear cordial stuffing plum and greengage tart and grabbing hot elderberry muffins dripping with honey my word mother mellus those two young ones can put it away aye bless them youd think we were facing a tenseason famine simeon checked the paw of one from reaching for acorn and rhubarb crumble how many more of you do the searats have seventeen i spose or eighteen aye eighteen countin the squirrel friar alder turned his eyes upward nudging young cockleburr dearie me imagine another eighteen like that at breakfast boilin breadloaves friar theyd eat us out o kitchen an abbey oo clary sat in gabe quills cellar sampling the latest rosehip squash with foremole as they nibbled cheese and beechmast bake to counteract the sweetness of the drink ahurr youm say ee wants four of usns this comin noight zurr yes indeed four stout mole chaps all good diggers mind you hurrhurr baint no crittur better at diggen than usn molers oid say dan buxton groaby an moiself aye wens the ones rightyho

trifle sweet wot no sweetern roseips orter be zurr fill er up iffen ee please gabe quill filled a jug from a polished cask he set it on the table sniffing righteously over the remarks being made about the sweetness of his rosehip squash try some o this elderflower an larkspur cordial iffen you likes a less sweeter drink but while youre adoin that tell me mr clary why did you only free two slaves las night clary sipped the new drink raising his eyebrows appreciatively well mr quill its quite simple really more than two at a time would be rather awkward to cope with seein as how theyve got to be helped every step of the way after all they are in chains yknow bein oarslaves theyre still chained in twos each creature to his galley bench partner if we can manage moren two all well an good well see how many of the poor blighters we can bag tonight now listen carefully foremole me old digger heres the plan oo graypatch had been all day making the searats woodland camp secure against intruders he sat on a log checking out the new setup with fishgill tripwires hidden in the undergrowth all around the edges o the camp rope traps in the trees aye capn me n frink an kybo rigged the rope traps anybeast sneakin around out there at nightll find themselves suddenly hangin upsidedown from a tree the tripwires are all stretched tight an wellhidden too good now these oarslaves well hold em in the center of the camp just to one side of the main fire that way theyll be surrounded by the crew the evening fires had been lit all around them searats squatted cooking whatever they had found during the day bigfang roasted dandelion roots and some small hard apples he and lardgutt had come across grumbling as he watched kybo huh what use is roots an sour apples to me n lardgutt were searats this woodland garbage wouldnt feed a sick maggot kybo matey hows about sharin that great fat woodpigeon yer roastin with a couple of old messmates kybo kept his eyes on the roasting meat his claw straying to a long rusty dagger he kept nearby get yer own rations bigfang me n fishgill an graypatch snared this one while we was layin out tripwires an you was lyin round snorin like a hog you want meat get out an hunt it lardgutts eyes strayed to the roasting woodpigeon as he absently reached into the embers for a toasted apple with the result that he scorched his claws badtemperedly he flung the apple from him yowch thats it ill starve afore i eat that muck bigfang looked around at other searats who had not been fortunate enough to obtain meat they were toasting roasting and charring almost any kind of vegetation they could scavenge bigfang spat into the flames hah livin off the fat o the land eh buckos does this look like the berth we was promised landlords of mossflower look at us grubbin fer roots an berries scrapin about an fightin with yer own shipmates fer anythin growin outta the soil why dont we attack redwall agin thats what i want ter know sittin round protectin some oarslaves like they was precious booty wheres that agoin to get us eh murmurs of agreement arose around the camp graypatch strode over carrying a heavy limb of dead oak he threw it onto the fire causing a shower of sparks bigfang and lardgutt were forced to jump back beating off the fiery splinters which landed on them their apples and roots completely squashed and ruined beneath the wood graypatch had thrown on the fire the searat captain prodded bigfang viciously in the ribs with his curved sword always the thickhead an the rabblerouser eh bigfang i dont know why i keep yer alive its not for your brains i can tell ye anybeast with half a grain o sense would tell yer what im about last night taught me a lesson if those redwallers want to free the slaves theyve got to come an try see look at it this ways theyre goin to no end o trouble to rescue slaves who they dont even know ive seen their type afore now imagine how theyd feel if we captured some of their own haharr thatd be somethin now wouldnt it us havin redwallers as hostages itd be like ownin a ticket fer free entrance to their abbey bigfang rubbed his ribs where the sword had scraped his hide how do we know theyre goin to come back graypatch shook his head as if despairing short on brains an long on mouth thats you matey of course theyll come back theyre noble creatures they couldnt leave poor slaves in the claws of us cruel searats but this time weve laid the traps this time well catch them an ill parade em in chains outside their abbey you mark my words those redwallers wont be so high n mighty then theyll be ready to listen to old graypatchs terms mates aye short on brains bigfang just like i said you stick with me matey let me do the thinkin and one day we could be rulers of a whole slave army of redwallers hahah imagine that they could be mercenaries spearfodder with an army that size we could build ourselves another fleet an conquer terramort for ourselves kill gabool an seize his island then wed be rulers of redwall an terramort mates oo hon rosie lay on her back a short distance from the camp she twanged upon a tripwire as she listened to graypatch lecturing his crew clary and thyme sat with the moles holding a whispered conference super plan yknow tripwires springropes an hostages id give the scurvy blaggard an a for alertness wot foremole extended his powerful digging claws oi knows wot oid loik t give im pesky searatter clary was busy undoing a tripwire good effort all the same come on hares lets undo this little lot an set it up in a new location thyme can you manage those rope traps certainly clary old chap i say these searats are rather good at tying knots and whatnot must be with all that messin about in boats i spect so howre you mole chaps feelin fancy a spot of diggin hohurr zurr wem frisky as frogs an fittern fleas whurr do ee want us astart gaffer foremole trundled about muttering calculations glancing from certain spots on the ground toward the rat camp gurrm let oi see naow root crossens thurr thurr an yon stoans alayen yurr an thurr reckernin fer a swift n easy deep tunnl oi sez usns be hadvised to start diggen roight yurr he scratched a large x on the woodland floor with his digging claws dan groaby and buxton went to it with a will sentries were posted all around the fringes of the camp graypatch settled down close to the fire his one good eye searching the woodland edge for signs of movement bigfang and lardgutt fought briefly over possession of a ragged blanket before ripping it in half then each lay down trying to cover himself with the skimpy remnant gradually the searats encampment quietened down for the night the silence broken only by an odd crackle of burning branches on the fires sentries blinked their eyes to stay awake heads drooping as they leaned heavily on pike and spear brigadier thyme watched the scene from the low boughs of a sycamore some distance away finally satisfied that everything was ready he climbed down and reported back to clary operation oarslave now feasible to commence sah good scout thyme right troops forward the buffs oh and rosie try to remember will you one whoop an were in the soup oh i say clary jolly poetic one whoop an were in the soup not to worry ive given up whoopin for the moment oo a searat named fleawirt lay asleep facing the main fire it was difficult trying to sleep in open woodlands after a life of sprawling to rest in the swaying rocking crews accommodation of a ship fleawirt awoke his face was scorched and burning with the fire though his back was stiff and chilled to the bone by the night breezes he turned grumpily over placing his back toward the fire as he did a sharp twig stuck in his cheek fleawirt sat up cursing silently as he rubbed his injured face then a very strange thing happened sitting up facing away from the fire fleawirt found himself looking at the oarslaves they lay sleeping chained in pairs some whimpering in their dreams others clutching each other tightly in slumber then there was a slight clink of chains and four oarslaves vanished into the ground fleawirt rubbed his eyes and yawned half turning to he down once more then the oddness of what he had seen hit him he stood bolt upright as another two slaves disappeared into the earth capn graypatch look the slaves fleawirts cries aroused the entire camp graypatch sprang up and began shaking fleawirt whats goin on tell me the slaves the ground four of em then another two the floor i saw it stop babblin like a fool now tell me what happened properly well i was sittin up awake an all of a sudden i saw four of the oarslaves just vanish into the floor i looked again an another two went right in front o me eyes capn i swear it the oarslaves were wakening yawning and rubbing at their eyes as the noise around them grew into a hubbub graypatch ran among them scattering the thin bodies left and right a flaring torch held high quickly he counted them twelve including the squirrel fleawirt was right six oarslaves had vanished somehow he stumbled as he stepped into a small pothole which on closer inspection proved to be a tunnel which had been backfilled after the slaves escaped graypatch sank his sword uselessly into the loose earth stabbing at it wildly it was a tunnel they got six slaves out through a stinkin tunnel bigfang strode about nodding his head knowingly so a tunnel eh mates thats how they did it probly got some of those squirrels to do their diggin for them i thought so graypatch grabbed bigfang by the nose digging his claws in tightly he twisted with cruel ferocity moles muckhead not squirrels moles dye hear mer bigfang pranced about tears squirting from his eyes graypatch aimed a hard kick which caught him in the rear and sent him sprawling now up on yer claws the lot o yer spread out an get searchin they cant have gone far i want em back dead or alive clary thyme and rosie appeared just outside the clearing i say slobberchops you shouldntve twisted the poor chaps hooter like that he was right we did use squirrels get theeeeeemmm graypatchs voice was somewhere between a roar and a screech the searats charged forward in a mob at the three hares then they hit the tripwires that had been carefully set anew the hares melted into the woodland being careful to travel in the opposite direction from foremole and his crew who were guiding the six slaves back to red wall graypatch and several others who had been at the back of the charge followed the hares leaping over the sprawling heaps of rats who had fallen or tripped or been pushed onto the tripwires by the momentum of their dashing comrades graypatch looked back at them over his shoulder blunderin idiots there was an immense tug on his legs instantly he was swinging back and forth as he dangled upsidedown from a spring rope tied to a tree limb his head cracked painfully against that of frink who was also suspended upside down by a rope back at the camp bigfang had scrambled upright and was shouting though his nose looked like a ripe plum ready to burst see i told you it was squirrels i was right the rabbit said so chains clinked as hammers thudded sending keentipped chisels biting through the chains and fetters of the oarslaves foremole patted each one fondly upon the head as they were freed hurr guddbeasts youm go naow an jump in ee barth thurr be clean cloathen an vittles aplenty when youm warshed mother mellus wiped her eyes on a spotted kerchief you can almost see their bones sticking out poor little things flagg struck the last of the chains free dont fret marm theyve got mouths to eat with theyll soon be fat as hogs gabriel quill sniffed speak for yourself streamdog oo before they went to the dormitories clary and his friends sat with foremole and the crew around the fireplace in cavern hole drinking a nightcap of mulled october ale excellent nights work chaps eight down twelve to go wot thyme stared into the flames right you are old sport but its goin to get much harder each time now that they know what were really after much jolly well harder hon rosie emptied her tankard at a single gulp clary may i oh i spose so permission t carry on rosie i say clary thanks whoohahahahahooh dan and groaby banged their tankards down upon the hearth wincing visibly at the earsplitting sound gwaw thats et oim arf t bed hurr an oi too afore oim deafened fer loif captain catseyes of the seatalon patted the new sword at his side proudly never had a searat set eyes upon such a sword as this he watched the two new oarslaves bending their backs as they pulled in stroke with the others up an one an down an two bend yer backs an curse yer birth up an one an down an two pull those oars fer all your worth the grating voice of the slavedriver echoed across the benches as he strode up and down flicking his cruel whip reciting the crude rowing poem as he laid out about him up an one an down an two some have backs without no hide up an one an down an two those who couldnt row have died up an one an down an two heres a gift from me to you he lashed out with the whip an oarslave arched his back and screamed catseyes nodded toward dandin and durry the two new uns how are they shapin up blodge blodge the slavedriver flicked his whip toward the pair no better or worse than the rest o them capn though theyre still fresh an strong a season or so eatin slave slops an the weight of that oar theyre chained to should knock some o the starch out of em catseyes strode down the alleyway between the oars until he was facing dandin the searat captain drew the sword watching the lantern lights playing up and down the length of its wondrous blade you dont look much like a warrior mouse whered a liddle fish like you come by a blade such as this beauty dandins eyes blazed fire at the captain of the seatalon i am dandin of redwall that is the sword of martin the warrior you are not fit to wear it rat catseyes nodded to blodge the slavedriver flailed his whip hard against dandins back the young mouse did not even flinch he continued to glare his hatred at the searat captain catseyes laughed feisty hddle brute aint you well well see about that fishtail the mate leaned across the rail listening to his captains instructions as terramort isle appeared like a tiny pinpoint on the horizon capn flogga should be there with the rathelm it could be dangerous fer me fishtail im no friend of gabool or flogga when we drop anchor in terramort cove i want you to go up to fort bladegirt an spy out the lay o the land take most of the crew with yer matey ill be all right aboard here with blodge an five others stay well armed an careful keep an eye peeled on that gabool and learn if anybeast brought graypatch back an claimed the booty from the darkqueens hold oh an you might have a chat with flogga see if he favors gabool an listen out fer any talk of the other capns formin an alliance against gabool but mind what i say matey be careful of gabool hes wild an crazy with it ill wait aboard this ship for yer return got that aye aye capn leave it t me oo the gruff voice of blodge rang through the galley ship oars me lucky buckos well ride in to terramort on the swell all around dandin and durry the oarslaves leaned heavily on their oars bringing the shafts down and locking them by wedging the ends beneath the benches thus leaving the oarblades sloping high out of the sea to port and starboard giving seatalon the appearance of a bird with outspread wings as she drifted toward terramort on billowing sails durry licked his paws gently i feel powerful sorry for the pore child who owns these paws what my o nuncled say if he saw his favrite nephew achained up in some scurvy searats galley i fears to think dandin wiped beading sweat from his brow i wonder where we are the little oarslave directly in front of him a fieldmouse named copsey provided the answer

against the oar and rested dandin patted her scarred back not if i can help it copsey wooden bowls were passed among the slaves they leaned toward the alleyway each holding the big bowl in their right paw the smaller in the left blodge passed with his assistant a small evilfaced rodent named clatt they had with them two wooden buckets one full of boiled barley meal the other of water blodge filled the large bowls with water clatt the smaller ones with barley meal both rats thought it great fun to slop the water or meal carelessly at a bowl so that it missed and splashed upon the deck come on scum lively now an hold those bowls out straight aye were too kind to you idlers treat you like a pair o nursemaids we do hee hee hee using their paws to eat the lukewarm mess dandin and durry

seatalon rode at anchor in terramort cove as evening gave way to night the wind had dropped leaving the air still and warm captain catseyes leaned over the rail staring up to the lighted windows of bladegirt blodge popped his head out of the forecastle cabin skilly an duff capn me an clatt made enough fer all claws aboard catseyes left the rail adjusting the sword of martin so it rode more comfortably at his side thankee blodge i think i will the weary oarslaves were slumbering chained to their oars as the hooded mouse stole carefully into the galleydeck he glanced around shaking his head at the pitiful figures the mouse was not young anymore but he was well set up and strongly built from his belt he drew several sharp threecornered rasp files dandin had been watching him through halfclosed eyes now the young mouse sat upright as the other crept past him dandin caught hold of the strangers dark cloak who are you what are you doing here the hooded mouse held up a warning paw ssshhh i bring freedom dandin nodded recognizing immediate friendliness in the strangers voice what do you want me to do say the word and ill help wake the others as quietly as you can here take one of these and use it on those chains dandin accepted the file he shook durry and copsey gently hush now be quiet wake up the others but do it softly all around dandin oarslaves were being wakened as he worked away with the file it was a good file he freed himself then began on durrys chains the hedgehog smiled at him in the darkness wait i tells my o nuncle bout this the strange mouse gave a low whistle and twenty other mice entered the galleydeck they set about helping to release the slaves a small thin harvestmouse stood up unable to contain himself he laughed aloud and threw his broken chains noisily to the deck one of the helpers muffled the harvest mouse in his cloak but it was too late pawsteps sounded above then captain catseyes highpitched voice called out whos that whos down there the stranger took off his cloak beneath it he was a broad fitlooking fellow clad in a searat jerkin though dandin noticed that he was completely silvery gray the mouse bundled the cloak up and passed it to dandin whos that calling out on deck captain catseyes the master of this ship why everybeast back at their oars hide the broken chains and leave this to me be quick now the oarslaves seated themselves whilst the other cloaked mice hid beneath the galley benches capn capn catseyes the strange mouse called up to the deck gabool sent me down his majesty has news for you catseyes came bounding down the companionway anxiously he strode up to the strange mouse what news from king gabool the strange mouse stepped close in drawing a dagger from the back of his belt gabool doesnt know but i brought you this he slew catseyes with one fierce thrust dandin leaped forward unbuckling the dead searats belt he retrieved the swrord and scabbard more pawsteps sounded above on deck capn can we get some wine from yer cabin aye skilly n duffs better with a drop o wine capn thats blodge and clatt dandin whispered to the stranger leave them to us when they come down right how many more aboard four besides them well take care of them get that body out of sight and sit back down as you were the rest of you hide blodge and clatt came stumbling down into the halflight of the galleydeck blodge peered around badtemperedly capn where are yer aint we goin t get no wine tonight not tonight or any other night slavedriver clatt gave a squeak of dismay blocking the stairway was the stranger backed by twenty hooded mice he whirled about to find himself facing dandin blodge unwound the whip from about his shoulders and raised it threateningly get back or ill have the hide off yer dandin chopped the nailing lash in two pieces with a sweep of his sword youll never use that whip on another creature rat he hurled himself upon the slavedriver who fell back yelling hoarsely as he grappled at his belt for his own sword copsey and durry gave clatt a mighty shove in the back and he shot from the alleyway straight into the arms of a bunch of oarslaves who were waiting swinging lengths of broken chain clatt had time for just one short despairing scream just one no more from above decks the sound of four bodies splashing in the sea told the oarslaves that the stranger and his companions had dealt finally with the remaining crew members dandin stood straight distastefully wiping his sword upon the fallen body of blodge he died as he lived a cringing coward who could only strike out at helpless creatures in chains the freed slaves made their way up to the deck the stranger and his band were loading up with any weapons that they could find he nodded at dandin all finished down there the young mouse sheathed his sword as finished as itll ever be what next we take everything we can from this shipweapons food and clothingthen we get off and sink her from there we go to the caves at the other side of the island when the time is right we will attack fort bladegirt and put an end to gabool the wild are you with us j the freed slaves looked at dandin he grasped the strangers outstretched paw were with you every step of the way and glad to be along my name is dandin of red wall whats yours the stranger swirled his dark cloak about him a broad honest grin creeping across his strong features they call me joseph the bellmaker the morning was a fine one blue smoke from the searat campfires drifted through the high woodland trees mingling with sloping shafts of sunbeam across leafy boughs of oak ash rowan sycamore elm and beech soft mosses short grass and variegated flowers carpeted the ground broken here and there by beds of fern and flowering nettles the beauty of it all was lost upon the searats food was the more practical problem of the moment graypatch had argued ranted and cajoled but the faction led by bigfang and lardgutt won the day appealing to greed rather than conquest hunger made bigfang unexpectedly eloquent on the subject of food graypatch listened knowing he had no real answer to bigfangs argument shipmates we aint woodland rats were searats we always had plenty o fish an seabirds too besides what stores we could plunder but here we aint got nothin an theres too many of us to be sharin nothin oh leaves berries roots n fruits are fine if yknow which are the right ones an which ones wont make a body sick or even kill yer but we dont so were goin to starve if we cant get proper vittles to eat there was massive agreement with this statement graypatch shrugged well fair enough bigfang tell us the answer youre so smart bigfang had his answer ready this time i say we use our weapons to get food not to fight some abbey or guard a lot of useless oarslaves split up go in gangs fish the streams an ponds kill the birds with slingshots arrows anythin but lets get some decent grub inside of us amid the roars of approval graypatch waved his sword for silence all right all right that sounds sensible t me i never had no objections to a searat crew feedin theirselves mateys but theres still these oarslaves theyre ours and we cant let em be nabbed away by those redwallers so i suggest we build a cage for em then we can go huntin avast what do ye say bigfang pointed his sword at graypatch you do what you want rat were goin to get food the entire crew stopped what they were doing and watched bigfang had finally laid down his challenge graypatch gripped his sword tight and confronted his enemy so its come t this eh matey bigfang circled crouching low sword at the ready im no matey o yours rat haharr i reckon you fancy yourself as capn round here couldnt make no worse a job of it than you smartmouth with a roar they clashed blade striking upon blade the searats formed a circle for them to fight in bigfang was strong he used his sword like a club hacking and bludgeoning at his opponent graypatch was vastly more experienced he ducked and parried dodging away from the main attacks using the campfire as a barrier they fought in silence none of the crew shouting encouragement to one or the other lest the shouter back the losing beast dust and ashes from the fire rose in billows as the pair battled savagely bigfang gaining the upper claw slightly with his size strength and ferocity graypatch countered most of the moves sometimes making bigfang look awkward and ungainly but as sword locked sword they gritted and sweated their faces almost touching graypatch began to realize that he was not as young and powerful as bigfang fighting desperately to keep the foe from his blind side he felt himself starting to tire and weaken but experience was on his side he kept his single eye on the main chance striving wildly he turned bigfang so that his back was to the fire and redoubled his attack bigfang was forced backward until one foot went into the fire he yelped in pain graypatch dodged away as if giving his adversary a chance to recover bigfang looked down at his scorched footclaws for a vital second it cost him his life graypatch snatched the spear that frink was holding and hurled it he was too close to miss from the branches of a tall beech close by a fat squirrel sat watching he shook his head as he saw bigfang fall hmm couldve told him thatd happen that old rats no fool oo graypatch stood with his narrow chest heaving he glared around the circle to reassert his authority as captain come on riffraff anyone else wanna be capn speak up a deathly hush had settled over the crew the only sound was the crackling of the campfire as they stood staring at the carcass of bigfang who only moments ago had been alive and arguing graypatch laid the flat of his sword against lardgutts throat come on bagbelly do you fancy tryin fer capn lardgutt could not even gulp the sword was so tight on his neck not me youre the capn capn graypatch nodded approvingly immediately changing his mood right matey im the capn an i gives the orders so lets see plenty o stout wood bein cut to make a cage fer our oarslaves after that well head out into these woodlands an plunder all the vittles a searat can lay claws on now whatve ye got t say to that though the tone was subdued they all replied ayeaye capn rufe brush gave a shout of delight as the fat squirrel came bounding in across the north wall with acrobatic skill oak tom you old bushrumbler well curl my tail they hugged and wrestled as squirrels do then the normally taciturn rufe held his friend out at pawslength let me look at you treejumper by the fur youre twice as fat as a badger at a feast whatve you been doin to yourself oak tom patted his vast stomach and chortled yukyukyuk rovin and eatin though mostly eatin doesnt slow me down at all im faster than i ever was young rufe again they fell to wrestling and hugging several dibbuns had gathered to view the performance they called encouragement thinking it was some sort of fight bite his tail off rufe kick im in ee gurt fat tummy squirrl mother mellus and abbot bernard came hurrying over oak tom released rufe and performed several acrobatic pawsprings abbot bernard how are ye father oh look out its old stripy top bet ycant catch me for a bath now ma mellus the badger put on a mockserious expression wagging her paw at him just let me catch you oak tom you were the worst dibbun redwall ever had to put up with ill wager youve not had a bath since you left here last summer the fat nimble oak tom bounded up on melluss broad back and whispered in her ear course i have here this is for you pulling a small package from his traveling bag he dropped it in melluss paw the badger sniffed it appreciatively oh jasmine and lavender soap where did you get it no dont tell me id hate to think of one of my dibbuns stealing oak tom pulled a long face the abbot patted his head fondly shes only joking tom come and talk to me tell me all the news of your travels youre just in time for lunch were eating out in the orchard summer salad leek and celery soup hot rootbread and strawberry trifle to follow you mustve known i was comin back my favorite of all strawberry trifle yahoooooo oak tom went hurtling away toward the orchard in a series of blurring somersaults runn and grubb watched him go he mustve been a terrible dibbun worsern us buhurr aye oi weageree wurr a gurt fat hinfant oo the news oak tom brought was extremely serious particularly to clary and his long patrol they listened intently mellus glanced anxiously at clary when oak tom finished telling what he had witnessed at the searat camp clary paced about in the shade of a gnarled pear tree a big cage ysay just how big tom big n strong enough t hold all twelve o them well made too with thick branches an lashings very heavy id say clary struck the tree with his paw darn i knew itd come t this somehow what does it mean colonel clary coughed and brushed his whiskers with the back of a paw oh nothin marm at least naught fer you to worry your head about leave it t me ill have a word with my jolly old pals well sort it out ticketyboo thats the word wot simeon groped about with his paw until he touched melluss cheek there was a lot of false bravado in what clary said i think hes worried saxtus watched the lanky figure of the hare retreating toward the abbey yes the more anxious hares get the lighter they seem to make of things have you noticed mellus stared at the young mouse intently thats a shrewd observation for one so young saxtus oo in the dormitory allotted to them the three hares sat upon the rushmatted floor clary had laid out a plan of the searat encampment with various bedroom articles he placed a lantern squarely in the middle thats where the bally cage is chaps they studied it thyme stroking his waxed moustache whiskers hmmm difficult extremely awkward wot but ysay theyve all gone out killin birds an the like praps theres a chance we could pay the confounded camp a visit now and make a surprise sortie clary shook his head no chance old lad oak tom went an scared off all the game in the blinkin neighborhood there wont be a bird or a fish for miles theyll probly be back by now roastin roots an burnin apples an whatnot its a rotten ol standoff hon rosie shrugged no way out were stumped clary sighed there is one way the only sure way i knew itd come down t this eventually as soon as i saw those searats in mossflower country i felt it in m bones they sat looking at each other awhile then clary sniffed airily still an all lord rawnblade wouldnt have us do anythin else thyme chuckled rather old rawneyd have a blue fit if we didnt hon rosie picked up her lance and began polishing it i say then lets do it just for a lark whoohahah ahooh oo gabool the wild did not bother covering up the pit anymore he cackled madly as he gazed in at the loathsome sight of the huge black scorpion perching on the carcass of fishtail former ships mate of the seatalon haharrharrharr thatll teach catseyes t send scurvy traitors spyin on me what dye say skrabblag the glistening arachnid clicked and rustled balefully gabool strode out gesturing into the air as he conversed with himself no need for capns when theres a king ill show em badgers n bells ships n searats capns n kings haharr round an round they run achasin each other through my head but gabool will win in the end he swept into the banqueting hall where the assembled searats watched in astonishment as he stood claws on hips talking to the great tarnished bell which dominated the center of the floor go on ring yer way out o that one hearty oh youll sing fer me one day ring ring gabool the king he whirled upon the two crews an whatre you all gawpin at pray nothin t do nothin to

tarquin kept forard lookout mariel took the stern rawnblade stood at the tiller steering a course offline with the little swallows flight as it dangled on its thread beneath the awning mariel left off scanning the horizon to stare at the impressive figure of lord rawnblade widestripe he resembled some giant stepped out of legend clad partially now in helmet and breastplate the sword verminfate resting beneath one paw as he steered with the other spray glistened dewing the shaggy fur as his keen dark eyes gazed out across the seas brows lowered as if he were pondering some mystery known only to badger lords this then was the creature for whom her father had cast and made the great bell she could think of no nobler or worthier owner for her fathers masterpiece her father joseph the name meant everything to mariel security love guidance and a comradeship between parent and child that was more like having a best friend than a father at times his humorous twinkling eyes and ready wit i say old gel have ygone asleep back there ships ahoy and astern the sound of tarquins voice brought mariel back to reality three sets of sails had appeared on the horizon in their wake and lord rawnblade gave swift instructions without questioning his authority mariel and tarquin took up their positions whilst the badger lord concealed himself in the cabin below the three vessels nightwake crabdaw and blacksail were traveling back to terramort in loose convoy though now they sensed terramort was reasonably near they broke formation and began racing to see who could anchor first in the cove captain hookfin of the blacksail held the tiller steady as they ran before the southwest wind tacking occasionally to keep his craft on course he cursed as the nightwake drew level with her master riptung at the helm a cask of dark wine i beat ye back riptung riptung swung the tiller over recklessly causing him to veer haharr not in that ol tub ywont matey with superb skill and daring the corsair grimtooth plied his craft between them both hoho ill show ye how a real searat sails mates an ill drink that wine to teach ye both a lesson in searatship the nightwake was now closest to mariel and the waveblade as the three ships bore onward all oars pulling and sails at full stretch riptung wiped spray from his eyes and looked across from the distance all he could see was a very small steersrat and an extralanky lookout both decked out in the tattered finery of searats ahoy waveblade where have ye come from riptung called out the small steersrat indicated back across her left shoulder but did not shout a reply riptung understood south eh we wer down that way mustve missed yer are you on for a race back to terramort cask o wine fer the prize the small rat shook its head jiggling the tiller and shrugging riptung nodded rudder trouble matey wheres capn orgeye the lanky one on lookout pantomimed sleep resting his head on the foredeck rail and pointing below riptung laughed aloud haharr lazy ol orgeye snorin like a hog too much wine eh the lanky one did a stagger and held his stomach and forehead at the same time riptung smote the tiller laughing uproariously scupper me the drunken ol blubberfish ahoy there tell im when he wakes that he missed a chance o winnin a big cask o wine the two searats waved back as the ships drew away racing pellmell for terramort riptung shouting tidings of orgeye to the other two captains who shook their heads with merriment rawnblades huge head poked out of the cabin doorway have they gone tarquin blew out a long sigh of relief aye mlord but it was a close thing any nearer to us and the game wouldve been up they would have seen we werent bally searats mariel leaned back against the tiller wiping her brow whew see that it isnt seaspray its sweat how they could ever have taken me and tarquin for a couple of scurvy searats ill never know rawnblade strode up on deck well furl in the sails and let them get in to terramort well ahead of us up you go woodsorrel im too heavy to be climbing masts and mariels needed on deck tarquin took a look at the swaying mainmast billowing with sail he threw a paw across his eyes and staggered giddily oh corks do i have to climb up that great swayin thing an fold all those windy old bedsheets do i really sir rawnblade pointed a stern paw to the topmast up woodsorrel up tarquin spat on his paws but made a lastditch plea to a passing gull i say birdie old bean just furl a jolly old sail or two as youre passin theres a good chap the sea gull flew heedlessly on rawnblade stood with his hefty paw still pointed into the rigging up tarquin nervously scaled the mast calling out to the sea gull who had decided to hover overhead and view the performance yah rotten ol featherbag bet your mum was a cuckoo oh golly if hon rosie could see me now shed split her fur laughin at that precise moment hon rosie had never been more serious in her life she stood in a small wooded area just out of sight of the searat camp with her were clary thyme rufe brush oak tom and the pretty squirrel treerose the hares were armed to the teeth lances bows arrows and a dagger apiece clary was talking to the squirrels now you know the drill chaps as soon as i shout out t you then you come runnin get the slaves away pretty darn quick an head north take a loop south an straight back

the abbey rosie nodded course you will pretty one on your way now when the squirrels had gone colonel clary inspected his patrol very smart top marks good turnout wot thyme brushed his moustache one last time no excuse for sloppiness my old pa always said they nocked shafts onto their bowstrings and strode off toward the searat camp talking softly to each other make me proud of you now troops goes without sayin clary well give rawnblade somethin to talk about while were at it wot i say clary is it all right if i laugh n hoot a bit once the show gets under way permission granted rosie old gel you chuckle as much as ylike oo the searats were milling about the fires shoving and pushing as they tried to get cooking space there had been no fish or meat taken as a result of oak toms activities in the area however they had found a good supply of wild pears and apples and plentiful dandelion roots now they cooked the fruits telling each other that there would be good hunting tomorrow when the birds and fish returned the oarslaves sat miserably in their long wooden cage it was exceptionally strong being made from thick green branches lashed together with rope the young creatures gazed longingly out at their captors knowing the only food they would receive was the waste and scraps after the rats had glutted themselves pakatugg pushed his face against the wooden bars he had grown thin and gaunt in captivity suffering the kicks and curses of searats he bitterly regretted tracking the darkqueen in quest of plunder now he sat staring through his prison at the woodlands beyond thinking of his secret den far away the cool green light from the shading trees the mossy rocks and trickling stream quite suddenly pakatugg saw the three hares of the long patrol they were striding grimfaced through the searat camp making for the captives in the cage fully armed with lance and dagger each with a shaft drawn tautly on a longbow the squirrel watched them silently his eyes wide with disbelief the hares ignored the noisy crew of searats as they marched purposefully forward the rat called fleawirt was first to see them as he turned from the fire hey where dyer think yer go wordlessly thyme turned and slew him the heavy oak arrow knocking the startled searat back fully three paces pandemonium broke out before the rats could grasp what was going on another two fell pierced by shafts from clary and rosie as swiftly as they loosed the arrows the long patrol had fresh ones stretched upon their bowstrings get them greypatch bellowed drawing his sword dont just stand there kill em shaking the numbness of surprise from him one called shoreclaw plucked his spear from the ground and raised it he was so close that clarys arrow passed through him and wounded another standing behind rosie dodged a spear as the trio quickened their pace she sent her arrow zinging into the snarling face of kybo cutting off the scream that issued from his mouth now the hares sent out the bloodchilling war cry of salamandastron it rang out above the clamor eulaliaaaaaaa they arrived at the cage still sending arrows from the formidable longbows thudding into the horde of advancing foe rats pakatugg shoved his paw through the bars give me a dagger and ill cut the ropes clary tossed him a freshly sharpened knife from redwalls kitchen what ho you old villain chop away at the back of the cage would you a spear took thyme in the right footpaw gritting his teeth he wrenched it out and hurled it back wounding its thrower ah well no more runnin for me today wot rosie stopped a charging rat with her lancepoint hate to remind you old thing but we didnt come here to run clary whacked out fiercely breaking a leg with the heavy yew bow famous last stand wot go out in a blaze of glory an all that right chaps another quick volley an give em a shout t let em know weve arrived fire three arrows flew from the longbows into the seething rat pack eulaliaaaa pakatugg slashed frenziedly at the remaining rope lashings in the back of the cage the bindings parted and a section of the woodwork fell away the oarslaves huddled dumbly in a group he pushed through them tugging at the back of clarys belt through the front bars ive done it part of the backs fallen down colonel clary winced as an arrow took him in the shoulder wait the squirrels arrive old thing then follow em take all the slaves an stick close to them no matter what clary threw back his head and yelled rufe tom treerose now now now thyme was kneeling wounded in both footpaws he bravely held his bow horizontally firing as rapidly as his dwindling quiver of arrows permitted glancing back he saw the three redwall squirrels herding the timid oarslaves out through the broken cage into the woodlands rosie was throttling a struggling rat on her bowstring as clary held off the mob with a lance held in each paw mission accomplished eh rosie old scout rather whoohahahahahooh standing at the back of the crew graypatch ran around belaboring with the flat of his sword as he roared hoarsely get into em come on yer sluggards rush em frink took aim and skillfully threw a long dagger got im ive wounded the big un in the ribs the grin of triumph froze on his face as an oak arrow found him thyme tugged at clarys leg out of arrows old sport get me up on me pins an give me a lance pakatugg assisted in getting thyme upright clary glared at him where did you come from mister you were supposed to escape with the rest i wont stand for insubordination yknow armed with a searat cutlass and spear the squirrel growled dangerously im stoppin here see dont like searats dirty vermin beat me an made sport o me nobeast does that to pakatugg ill teach em rosie flinched as a sword caught her high on the cheek good for you paka ynasty old rogue give em vinegar flinging their empty quivers and longbows into the faces of the rats the long patrol brandished daggers and lances charging forward they carried the battle straight into the ranks of the enemy with clary calling out aloud nice day for it wot thyme staggered forward summers my favrite season old lad hon rosie clapped pakatugg on the back lets give em one last shout for salamandastron an the jolly old abbey eulaliaaaa redwaaaaaaall accompanied by an old squirrel the long patrol threw themselves into the howling mob of searats oo not just flagg but every creature in redwall abbey stood out upon the north ramparts scanning the path in the pale moonlight for signs of movement mellus and flagg were armed with longbows lanterns flickered all along the walltop in the hushed silence simeon the blind herbalist stood with the abbot and the dibbuns their bedtime forgotten in the tense waiting atmosphere simeons voice was barely above a whisper but it could be heard by many as he addressed the abbot whats happening out there bernard nothing old friend its very quiet and still down there hurr be they acummen yet maister simmen simeon patted grubbs velvety head only if youre very good and stay quiet little mole oi be vurry soilint naow hussshhher whatever possessed them to go on such an insane venture mellus murmured to flagg six of ours against all that rotten horde and to think it was i who urged colonel clary to rescue the slaves in the first place flagg shook his head no marm it werent you clary had it in his mind to do the deed anyway he left me a scroll tellin all i burned it in the kitchen stove as he wished me to so dont blame yerself marm they were sworn to fight searats from birth it was their destiny oo minutes stretched into hours as the redwallers waited straining their eyes along the north path sometimes expectant at a sign of movement only to have their hopes dashed by the realization that it was merely a shadow as clouds scudded across the moon or the rustle of breezestirred foliage the dibbuns had finally fallen asleep sister sage covered them with blankets from the gatehouse as they lay huddled together in the northwest corner of the walltop saxtus and sister serena carried a caldron of leek and celery broth from the kitchens followed by friar alder and cockleburr laden with wheat farls gabriel quill stared toward the eastern horizon over the treetops of mossflower be dawn in two hour i reckons foremole was slurping soup rather noisily from a wooden bowl when simeon placed a restraining paw on him hush i think i can sense something the abbot held up his paws for silence all around what is it simeon the blind mouse leaned out across the battlements his whiskers quivering slightly metal i thought i could hear metal yes there it is any signs on the path none whatsoever sssh there it is again over there on the woodland edge metal wait its chains i can hear chains saxtus sprang up between the battlements with a whoop hurrah its them i can see rufe brush leading the slaves out of mossflower onto the path hi rufe flagg acted speedily marm put an arrow to your bow and stand beside me here well keep them covered saxtus foremole gabe youll find spears down by the main gate take twenty with you and escort them back in keep your wits about you an your eyes open hurry now they may be followed by searats oo without further event the last eleven slaves made it into the safety of redwall abbey as the chains were being cut from their wasted limbs the abbot questioned the three squirrels who had taken part in the rescue treerose and oak tom were crying even the normally tough rufe brush broke down and wept bitterly as they related what they had seen at the magnificent last stand of the long patrol they didnt stand a chance yet they came through the center of that searat camp laughing and joking they were completely surrounded oak tom was pale his voice low and trembling i never thought that was what they meant to do but it was the only thing they could have done to free the slaves what makes it all so strange is that they knew what would happen how it must end treerose accepted a spotted handkerchief from foremole oh they were so brave rosie smiled at me and said shed see me back here oh father abbot why did they do it abbot bernard shook his head gently who knows child who knows certainly none of us at redwall we are infants in the ways of war colonel clary and his hares were complete warriors their seasons were numbered from birth they knew this was the day their fates were sealed saxtus hung his head yet they knew they were helping redwall and bringing liberty to the slaves so they went to meet their destinies smiling and joking i was wrong about the hares and ill always remember that when i make judgments about other creatures oo simeon and the abbot went back to lock the main gates before turning in dawnlight was beginning to flush the skies triumph and tragedy in the one night old friend the abbot kicked away a stone which was hindering the closing gate right simeon hey you two come in here right now bagg and

three searat ships as wavebladc sailed into terramort cove rawnblade swung the tiller navigating between them strange theyve just arrived yet theyre going out again tarquin shaded his eyes and peered across aye an those arent searats who are sailin them what dyou thinks goin on ahoy there mariel the mousemaid gasped there standing on the shore of the cove waving at her was dandin she jumped up and down waving back dandin dandin stay there were coming ashore they plunged over into the shallows and waded onto the beach dandin hugged and patted tarquin and mariel who in their turn squeezed him tightly ruffling his whiskers and patting his paws as if they could not believe it was really him smiling happily dandin managed to extricate himself from the welcoming huddle i thought you were dead i was certain youd been drowned though there wasnt much time to think about that with the fix me and durry found ourselves in i tell you dont ever become an oarslave its worse than being captured by the flitchaye when the reunion was finished and lord rawnblade had been introduced mariel looked about wheres durry no sooner had she spoken than in company with two hooded shrews durry came pounding down the path to the cove the young hedgehog looked very dashing wearing a broad leather belt with several daggers bristling from it and a hood on his head oh durry you do look a proper swashbuckler and no mistake mariel laughed however durry quill was in no mood for banter puffing and blowing he waved back over his shoulder phew quick urry up theres about five undred searats ot on me trail theyre comin after you i think mikla flann get that ship out to sea ill take these friends to the caves hurry the two shrews mikla and flann waded out to the waveblade to take her out of the searats reach with the other three ships mariel tarquin and rawnblade followed durry and dandin as they raced off in the opposite direction to bladegirt toward the sheer rocky coast which veered up on the west side of the cove the searat frontrunners with riptung and hookfin in the lead came rushing down the path to the shore of the cove riptung threw his sword down in frustration hells tail theyre too far out well never get to em now hookfin raced about on the shoreline searching for a dinghy to pursue his ship in thunder n blood aint there nothin we can give chase in an enterprising rat called felltooth stripped off his more cumbersome weapons thrust a dagger in his headband and entered the water waveblades not too far out capn riptung mayaps we can swim to er an use er to bring back the other three ships riptung retrieved his sword thats the way matey some of yer go with im any good swimmers seven searats gripping daggers in their teeth waded into the sea hookfin pointed in the direction of the crude trail which led up into the high rocks look its the badger dandin glanced down to the yelling hordes racing across the shore to the rocks weve been spotted here they come lord rawnblade set his back against a rock raising the sword verminfate in both paws get running ill stop them dandin stood in front of the upraised sword rawnblade was beginning to breathe heavily his eyes glazing over as he watched the searats below the young mouse took the badgers paw theres no need for you to stay come with us theyll never find us youll see the badger lord took considerable moving all four tugging and pushing him farther up the trail and behind an overhanging outcrop of rocks where they were out of sight of the rats durry went across to a big craggy boulder he pushed it moving it easily to one side tarquin gasped in astonishment at the tunnel that yawned before them golly thats jolly clever durry a secret tunnel how did ymanage to move that whackin great boulder with one single shove durry swelled his chest out i ate a good breakfst dandin laughed take no notice of that little fibber come inside and ill show you how easy it is they filed into the tunnel rawnblade stooping to get his great size through the opening dandin was last in quickly he set flint and tinder to a dry brush torch and passed it to mariel hold this and watch leaning out of the cave entrance dandin gave the boulder a light push and sprang back the massive rock tottered slightly and rolled back into its former position blocking the tunnel entrance he took a wedge of ships timber and slammed it tight against the bottom of the boulder there thatll stop anybeast moving it the whole thing works on a fine balance you see now stay quiet and listen oo hookfin and a bunch of searats rounded the rocky outcrop before them the winding trail ran upward into the high hills completely devoid of signs of life the searat captain looked hither and thither without suc cess this is the way they came id stake me oath on it whereve the scurvy blaggards got to theyve vanished capn stow yer gab biscuitbrain nobeast just vanishes theyre round ere somewheres i know it well my old dad used ter say that badgers were magic beasts maybe they ave vanished capn hookfin aimed a kick at the speaker huh your ole dad mustve lived up a tree with a branch growin through both ears dont talk such bilgerot no theyre round ere i can feel it mayaps theyre beind that big boulder capn this remark did not improve hookfins temper aye an mayhaps ill beat your brains out agin that great boulder if yer make another stupid suggestion spread out an look around as they searched one searat close to the boulder nudged his mate can you smell burnin matey no but itll probably be capn ookfins old brainbox tryin ter figger out where the badger went heeheeheehee you two over there stop sniggerin an start searching or ill lay me sword blade across yer backs rocking back and forth with silent mirth the creatures in the cave listened to the searats outside even rawnblade had to stifle a few chuckles finally dandin took the torch and went off down the winding rocky tunnel come on we cant stop here all day listening to those buffoons the tunnel sloped gently downward mariel stared at the rough rock walls in the flickering torchlight as she followed durry quill where are we going durry down to the main cave missy thats where us trag warriors meet trag whats that supposed to mean durry quill flourished a fearsome dagger muttering darkly terramort resistance against gabool trag see first letter o each word youll like our chief though he knows you very well mariel was mystified knows me how durry smiled in the shadows as he answered cos hes your daddy joseph the bellmaker dandin felt the torch snatched from his grasp as mariel dashed past she disappeared down the winding tunnel leaving them groping in the darkness as the mousemaids voice echoed about them at a screaming pitch father fatheeeeerrr cxo it was an immense cavern high above the tidemark on the sheer rock coast facing the open sea and well lit by the summer sun free creatures former oarslaves and fort bladegirt drudges sat about on rocky ledges cleaning and preparing weapons cooking over fires and readying meals all activity ground to an immediate halt as the mousemaid came hurtling down the tunnel into the cavern heedlessly dropping the flaring torch she threw herself into the paws of joseph hugging him fiercely as her tears flooded into the silvergray fur of his broad shoulder father oh father i always knew id find you again someday joseph the bellmaker held his only child the pain and anguish of many long days and nights turning to unbounded joy as a happy smile lit his strong face banishing the glistening dew which threatened to spill from his proud eyes mariel mariel my little maid how youve grown i never knew all this time whether you were alive but in my heart i refused to believe that you were dead and i always knew youd return somehow my little mariel the others stumbled out of the tunnel durry quill dabbing tenderly at his swelling snout which he had banged against the rock walls in the darkness well waitll i tell my ol nuncle dashin off an leavin a young og in the dark like that aint you got no feelins missy oo that night the fires blazed merrily in the cavern of the trag warriors huge platters of shrimp and shellfish were served with wild oat and barley bread hot from the rocks it had been baked on casks of preserved fruits taken from searat ships were opened and a fine barrel of daisy and dandelion beer tapped the friends sat around as joseph related his story gabool pushed me from a high window of his banqueting room luckily for me i did not strike the rockface on the way down i hit the water hard and was knocked senseless i was weak and ill from being starved and imprisoned otherwise i might have stayed conscious the sea must have washed me around the headland and i came to jammed against a reef on a small inlet somewhere up the coast of terramort thats where i was found by that fellow joseph pointed to a vole who was seated on a rock ledge sharpening a sword the vole stood up and bowed to them introducing himself by name tan loc he sat down and resumed sharpening the sword tan loc is a fellow of few words joseph continued he broods a lot his whole family were slain by searats when he was taken captive he lives for only one thing to meet the murderer hookfin master of the blacksail but back to my story tan loc and i helped each other stay alive we could not afford to be seen it would have meant certain death so we stayed on this side of the island surviving as best we could one day we discovered this place and its tunnels i will show them to you in due course the tunnels were a new lease of life to us they led to places all over the island so we could travel anywhere and remain unseen some nights we would steal supplies from the ships weapons too and other items which would be of use to us we soon came across others house slaves from fort bladegirt who had managed to escape sometimes oarslaves thrown on the beach because they were too sick and weak to pull an oar anymore in time our numbers began to swell that was when we decided to form trag terramort resistance against gabool soon now we will be strong enough to attack bladegirt in force though our numbers would never equal the searat horde up there at the moment still we will fight them and try to rid the earth of gabool the wild we may not have the numbers but we have the courage and determination lord rawnblade stood up both paws resting on the crosshilt of his destroyer verminfate i am sworn to kill gabool he is mine joseph touched the long knife at the back of his belt then you will have to be quick lord widestripe i made an oath to slay gabool when the house slaves told me he had drowned my mariel with a rock and a rope tied about her neck that oath still holds mariel leaped up the gullwhacker swinging wide first there first served gabools life is mine to take i am mariel gullwhacker i claim the right tarquin leaned over to dandin what about you old feller dandin drew the sword slowly this is the blade of martin the warrior no creature that is evil can stand against it least of all gabool tarquin and durry held a hasty whispered conference then they both jumped up issuing their separate challenges this ere is my scraggin dagger an im goin to scrag that scurvy gabool good n proper im ony a young lad but i swear it by my ol nuncle gabes best october ale well youll have t scrag away pretty fast old chap cos if joseph has got the blighter with his long knife milord rawnblade has paid the rotter a visit with that great log cleaver and our mariel has been to see the scoundrel with her gullwhacker then along comes the bold durry quill with his scraggin dagger well tell me this what chance is an honest chap like meself goin to get to brain the beggar with my jolly old harolina wot listen you lot stop bein so confounded greedy and let me be first to knock out a tune on the villains noodle the sight of tarquin striking a noble pose harolina at the ready caused the entire group to dissolve into helpless laughter oo gabool was in no mood for laughter the maddened searat king dashed furiously around his barred and bolted room slashing at phantom badgers as they stole out of the shadows to confront his bloodshot eyes shrieking and thrusting wildly at the specters created by his tormented brain haharr ill finish ye all im gabool the king of all seas bongl bongl bongl bong bongl he rent curtains and wallhangings sparks showered from his sword as it clashed on the stone walls cursed noise ill send yer to hellgates an beyond oo down below in the banqueting hall riptung hookfin and grimtooth laughed drunkenly as they flung hard apples across the tables at the great tarnished bell in the center of the floor haharr listen yer majesty its yer old matey the bell aspeakin to yer it wants t know where youve hid the booty haharrharrharr the crews joined in the laughter as they pelted the bell with apples boom bongl booml bongl booml bongggggl a pale dawn sun high above mossflower woods watched impassively as the otter and badger searched for the searat camp longbows at the ready flagg strained his ears for sounds of movement its no good marm we shouldve asked the squirrels which way t go mother mellus sat down upon a fallen limb and rubbed her eyes perhaps youre right flagg my old senses arent what they used to be if we dont find it soon well have to change direction the otter joined her on the limb tell you what marm well take a liddle rest and then try a different path anyway by the fur im tired missin a full nights sleep never did me much good even when i was a cub aaaahhhh sit down on the grass ere an put yer back against this limb awhile there now aint that a little better mellus relaxed settling her head back against the mosscovered limb a big bumblebee droned lazily past on its quest for nectar in the distance a songthrush warbled blithely its hymn to the coming summer day somewhere close by a grasshopper that had strayed from the flatlands chirruped idly the warmth of the rising sun beat steadily down upon the two weary friends as sleep stole up and took their tired senses unawares the longbows slipped from their paws and their eyes drooped shut oo a small spider was starting to weave her web from the tip of a longbow to flaggs nose he twitched his snout flicking at it drowsily with his paw as the voices intruded upon his dream somewheres around this way she was i swear i saw er matey well stow yer gab an keep that spear ready y cant take no chances with this scurvy rabbit i could swear weve killed er three times aready tread easy now is that er where layin among those fern things goggle eyes look cant ysee flagg came awake collecting his senses as he listened to the searats take no chances this time mate sneak up an both of us in fast with the spears hard as ycan ten times apiece see she doesnt jump away agin aye did ye ever see anythin like that leap she made out of the camp right over graypatchs ead an er all cut t pieces too the urgency of the situation hit flagg like a thunderbolt sitting up silently he placed a paw across melluss mouth and shook her awake the badger saw something in flaggs eyes that made her go completely still he gestured forward with his paw whispering one word searats stealthily the two friends stood up fitting arrows to their longbows the two searats were standing some distance away their backs to the hunters as they sneaked in upon a bed of fern spears raised ready for the kill flagg and mellus drew back the shafts upon their bowstrings to full stretch the otter nodded to mellus and she called out in a loud gruff voice ahoy there the two searats turned in the direction of her voice as the arrows left the longbows with a vicious twin hiss both rats fell instantaneously the sharp oak shafts standing out of their necks a halflength regardless of nettle and bush the otter and the badger crashed through the woodland into the bed of ferns they stood aghast at the wounded scarred bloodstained form of hon rosie lying on the ground she pulled herself up onto one paw smiling crookedly through her ripped and battered face hhello you chchaps fraid theyve kkilled me wot collapsing back the brave hare lay stretched among the ferns mellus was down beside her ripping up her garments bandaging wiping blood from rosies face and massaging her paws as she instructed flagg have you got a knife yes marm one of friar alders best is she dead no not quite theres a chance cut some polesno wait use the longbows chop some vines anything well use our belts got to make a stretcher here she ripped off her belt and threw it to flagg the helpful otter took off his own gotcha marm leave it t me he set about his task swiftly glancing urgently back to where mellus was busy with rosie among the ferns you cant die dyou hear me rosie wake up if you die ill kill you oh im sorry dear live live for clary and thyme live oo rufe brush and oak tom headed the party that had set out from redwall at dawn they were all heavily armed and determined to help mellus and flagg against the searats cutting off the path they entered the woodlands tom and treerose swung off into the foli age to scout ahead gabe quill brandished a big bung mallet angrily ill searat em the filthy vermints rufe turned to him keep

abbey as quickly as you can tell sister serena simeon the abbot and sister sage to have all their medicines ready and a room in sickbay cleared out right off you go the three squirrels went off through the top terraces of the woodlands like greased lightning ready pawys gripped the stretcher steadying rosie as the group broke into a fast trot oo graypatch limped badly from an arrow that had pierced his leg he gazed around at the smashed cage the smoldering embers of last nights fires and the carcasses of dead searats that littered the ground like fallen leaves they were piled in a heap in the middle of the camp he prodded the lifeless forms with his sword somewhere beneath that heap lay two hares and a squirrel the searat captain shook his head and slumped down upon a rock three hares and a squirrel did all this he murmured disbelievingly deadglim shambled over he leaned on a broken spear nursing the place where his left ear had been eighteen left alive capn well it would be a score but two went after the hare that got away graypatch massaged his leg wincing eighteen is that all aye capn whats yer orders graypatch stared into the surrounding forest he had come to hate mossflower country the whole thing had been a catalogue of disaster since they arrived he had stolen the darkqueen and set sail from terramort with a crew of a hundred ablebodied searats and now he was sitting in this landlocked hell of greenery with only eighteen left tell the crew to pack up lock stock n barrel were pullin out o this stinkin place im goin to find the darkqueen get er seaworthy an sail out to the open sea where we can breathe again a slow smile formed upon deadglims coarse face ayeaye capn graypatch ill do that with pleasure sir treerose paced the corridor outside the sickbay abbot bernard came out with a basin and a stained towel ah treerose see if you can get some clean warm water and a fresh towel for me pretty one treeroses voice betrayed great anxiety how is rosie father the abbot wiped his paws on his wide sleeves a smile creasing his kindly face dyou know i didnt believe it at first but shes going to be all right thanks to your warning the creatures who got her here so fast and the marvelous skills of simeon and sister sage yes treerose shes going to be around for quite a number of seasons yet to come so you stop that crying now and get me fresh water and a clean towel mother mellus came out to stand in the corridor with the abbot what was all that about father oh nothing really it just surprises me how overnight that young squirrel has changed from a spoilt brat into a really nice helpful creature mellus patted the abbots frail back hmm then we must be doing something right the way we bring our young ones up at redwall eh the abbot bowed gallantly the way you bring them up mellus saxtus lay on his back in the strawberry patch with the dibbuns bagg and runn chattered incessantly as they decimated the latest crop of ripe fruit have all the searats gone now saxus suppose so we havent seen them for a while an theyre not comin back to ttack the abbey again i hope not why dyou ask oh nuts i wanted em t come back so i could fight em no you dont little one weve had enough fighting and killing isnt it much nicer lying here filling your tummy with strawberries in the sun mm spose so but i cant get at the biggest n juiciest

stuffing strawberries three at a time oi sees ee winds blowed all ee strawbly trees away agin sister sage was creeping from the sickbay with simeon on tippaw they had done all they could with the hares dreadful injuries now they decided it was best that she sleep and recuperate the hinge squeaked as sister sage opened the door rosie opened one eye and peeked through the bandaged slit never died after all wot good show simeon leaned on sister sages arm incredible totally unbelievable ive heard of cats having nine lives but that rosie shes the limit sister sage shut the door as quietly as possible or the absolute bally limit as colonel clary would have said do you know where we are now mariel and rawnblade shook their heads they were completely lost on their guided tour of the tunnels of terramort joseph pointed ahead go up there careful now because its the end of this particular tunnel and youll see a couple of gorsebushes just part them and tell me what you see as they carried out his instructions mariel drew in a sharp breath its fort bladegirt right across on the next hill joseph nodded i can take you to another branch of this same tunnel that brings you out on the other side of the fort or yet another which will bring you out at the back of bladegirt well does it give you any ideas a threepronged invasion you took the words out of my mouth lord rawnblade anything else youd like to see yes father id like to see these other two exits im beginning to get a few ideas myself hmm i thought you would come on then follow me down below in the main cave dandin durry and tar quin were making friends with the freed slaves of the trag society a young shrew and some of his companions sat questioning them where do you come from redwall abbey in mossflower country the youngster gazed at them with shining eyes redwall abbey mossflower country does it look as nice as it sounds tarquin strummed his harolina you can bet your fluffy bedsocks it does young thingummy here dandin give me a trill on your whistle while i tune me jolly instrument up an ill tell em all about it dandin tootled away on his ancestors flute until between them he and the hare had a rollicking air going the trag members tapped their paws on the rocks to the infectious music as tarquin sang on the old brown path from north to south is a place youd love to stay in come one come all to old redwall and hear what i am sayin theres an orchard there thats fat and fair with apple berry plum and pear theres a pond with fish and all youd wish to grace a supper table dish theyve a nice soft bed to rest your head or sleep beneath the trees instead if you meet the abbot then be sure to shake him by the paw on the old brown path from north to south its peaceable an free where our abbey stands amid woodlands im sure youd love to be there there was loud cheering and tarquin was requested to sing the ditty twice more durry leaped up and danced with a vole and a dormouse afterward they sat about talking redwall was the chief topic of discussion among the freed slaves most of whom had never known or could not remember a place they called home do you have lots of nice things to eat at redwall my spikes ydo summercream woodland puddens deeper n ever pies strawbrry flans blueberry scones raspbrry muffins cheeses you couldnt count an cordials teas wines an october ale that me n my ol nuncle gabe makes in our cellars and every creature is free there mr woodsorrel free as the air young feller peaceful as the flowers that grow an happy t wake up among friends each dawn wot will you take us there dandin oh please say you will dandin held up his paws of course you have my promise on it though mother mellusll probably grab you all and bathe the lot of you on sight a small hedgehog sat enraptured with every word he had heard mother you mean they have a mother there i cant remember having a mother dyou think shell be my mother too whats your name young un barty thats my sister dorcas shes younger than me i think durry patted their soft unformed spikes you can live with me an nuncle gabe ill teach ee t be cellar ogs when joseph returned with mariel and rawnblade a full meeting was called freed slaves crowded into the big cavern rawnblade expressed surprise at the numbers quite a sizable army joseph i didnt think there was so many the bellmaker indicated a crowd packing the ledges at the rear our trag warriors who stole three of the searat ships have brought us many oarslaves who wish to join us all of these have been landed from the three ships we captured there must be close on a hundred new arrivals though we are still far below in numbers compared to the searats mariel stood alongside her father not to worry weve got their ships its the rats who are trapped on this island and not us besides well have the advantage of cover and surprise lord rawnblade would you like to outline our plan the badger took a charred stick from the fire and drew upon the rockface this is fort bladegirt we will attack tonight when they are sleeping these three tunnels come out into the hills both sides and behind the fort mariel you and your friends will lead onethird of our force to attack from the left joseph my friend you will lead the other third from the right that way they will be under pressure from both sides my mariel will tell you what to do mariel took over flattered that such a warrior as the lord of salamandastron was consulting her judgment recognizing in the mousemaid a fellow warrior spirit use bows and slings dont attempt to climb the walls into the courtyard stay well hidden and use the ground above the tunnel entrances that way we can send arrows and stones down at them but remain silent dont give the searats any noisy or standing targets to fire back at and keep slinging rocks and firing arrows as hard as you can tarquin once the rats are occupied in fighting us on both sides you will attack the front gates of the courtyard take the rest of the force with you and make as much noise as possible you will have a battering ram to smash away at the gates with we will besiege them from three sides tarquin your squad will be armed with spears bows and long pikes got that understood old scout what happens then i come from the back lord rawnblade explained i will pick my moment it will be when most of the searats are defending the front gate from your battering ram outside the tunnel at the rear of the fort is a big boulder on the hillside i will send it down the hill to smash through the rear courtyard wall joseph the moment you see the boulder start to roll bring your force down from the right to back me up mariel you bring your creatures down from the left to join woodsorrel im banking on the rats doing an aboutturn and coming to face me if the ram hasnt battered the gates down you must prop it against them and use it as a ladder well that is the plan first theyll be attacked from the left and right then from the front and back once we are inside the courtyard we can force our way into the fort itself then its good luck to whoever finds gabool by unanimous decision the plan was voted a good one joseph stood to have a final word with the occupants of the cavern grayfurred as he was the bellmaker stood tall in their eyes the suffering and indignities he had put up with etching his strong face righteous vengeance ringing out from his voice like the sound of his own great bell hear me this is the time i have waited for we will rid the earth of searats for all seasons to come no more are you slaves you are the fighters of trag if victory is ours tomorrow we have ships to sail away from this accursed island let us leave this place deserted as a monument to the death and misery it has caused to creatures everywhere when the wild cheering had died down the two small hedgehogs barty and dorcas called out were going to redwall abbey to live rawnblade picked them both up one in each huge paw if i know the good creatures of that place youre all going there the cavern echoed and reechoed to the wild applause of trag warriors none of them knowing what the morrow would bring but each one fervently wishing his or her desire to go and live in the fabled redwall graypatch and his band were lost they stumbled about in the vastnesses of mossflower woods not knowing which direction to take next each place they arrived at looked the same as the spot they had started from oak tom sat high in a chestnut tree watching them he tested the point of his lance and shook his head wouldnt leave em in charge of a dibbuns spring outin any of em deadglim slumped wearily on the ground belay capn you sure you know the right course fer darkqueen graypatch turned on him and vented his temper i did when we started out but you wetnosed idiots awanderin here an yon scroungin fer vittles have set me off course im as lost as the rest o yer an its your fault not mine dripnose threw himself down beside lardgutt yah whats the use im stayin ere until somebeast finds the right way graypatch sat down with him his voice dripping sarcasm oh you are are yer so be it i am too matey this way nobeastll find the darkqueen an well all sit right ere an rot fishgill came up with a suggestion capn why dont we split into three groups we could each set course a different way mark the trees as we go an all make our way back ere when somerat finds darkqueen graypatch thought about this for a moment then stood up fishgill matey thats the first decent idea to come out o this load of lunkheads right you take five an go thataways dripnose up on yer claws take five an head the other way over there ill take the other five an go straight ahead dont ferget an use your blades to mark the trees otherwise youll be lost forever in this hellridden forest right lets get goin oak tom watched them go before leaping down to scar false routes widespread on the treebark with his lancepoint the squirrel carefully noted the direction taken by graypatch and his party then set out after the five led by deadglim pushing through the brambles and tripping over tree roots deadglim and his rats unwittingly made their course south back the way they had come completely lost and in their confusion taking a bumbling path toward redwall abbey turn round and follow fishgill lardgutt pointed into the leafy canopy its a voice from up there deadglim clawed nervously at his sword what dyer want from us im from the abbey the mystery voice called back to him we dont want you attacking us again youre headed for redwall if you keep on in this direction turn round and follow fishgill hes traveling in the direction of your ship darkqueenl lardgutt carried on south calling up in a sneering voice aaahh you could be trickin us i think this ways the right way the javelin hissed down from the branches slaying him on the spot this time the voice was loud and menacing take my word for it fools die there are many of us up here turn round and follow fishgill if you value my advice deadglim did a swift aboutturn were going look were going leave us alone and we wont be back a mocking laugh rang out through the trees go then quickly oak tom plucked the javelin from lardgutts carcass as the pounding paws of deadglims party receded into the distance before nightfall they would join fishgills party in the flitchaye territory oak tom took one look back to the south where his friends rufe brush and treerose would be giving clary and thyme a decent burial at the deserted searat camp setting his jaw grimly he took off through the woodlands on the trail of graypatch and the remaining five oo the searat captain did not know whether to be delighted or disappointed he stepped out of the foliage and onto the path leading north with his companions having traveled in a huge semicircle well at least were clear of all that tangle fer a while mateys maybe now we can get some proper bearins a rat named stumpclaw strained his eyes northward up the path ahoy capn theres a ford up ahead i can see the sunlight on its waters relief flooded through graypatchs body he sat down by the side of the path a tear forming in his single eye if its water itll run to the sea mateys an itll take us to darkqueen if its the right stream stumpclaw take these buckos an scout the lay o the water will yer matey ole graypatch is weary ill be restin me bones ere awhile till you get back on a spruce bough not too far distant oak tom sat watching graypatch let the summer sun play on his face as he lay back and relaxed the stream must lead up to darkqueen and then down to the sea maybe a few more dawns would see him in command of his own ship once more running south before the breeze away from mossflower and the seas where gabools vessels hunted sleep was just about to embrace graypatch when loud screams rent the still air silently oak tom trailed him as he made his way cautiously to the ford using the trees to the side of the path as cover graypatch sneaked up to within a short distance of the water iraktaan stood over the carcass of stumpclaw his vicious beak dripping red iraktaan kill kraaaaak behind him in the swiftrunning weedstreaked waters of the ford the bodies of the three who had made it to the water bounced and bobbed in a grotesque parody of life though it was only the ripping jaws of the pike shoal which moved them graypatch cut east into the woodlands avoiding the killer heron and following the course of the stream voicing his thoughts aloud as he went ill find the darkqueen sure as eggs is eggs foller the stream thats all ye do matey foller the stream haharr ill sit aboard me ol ship an wait fer the others no chance graypatch is goin t get lost amid all that forest agin no sir as the sun grew hotter graypatch knelt to drink from the stream he sucked long and noisily feeling the cool flow of fresh water crossing his chin suddenly lifting his face clear of the stream the searat captain felt his neck hairs rising without turning he knew there was somebeast behind him a vague blur showed on the surface of the swiftrunning water masking the strangers identity instinctively the searats claw reached for his sword who are yer the strangers voice was as cold as north wind on wet stones my name would mean nothing to you rat graypatch played for time slowly inching the sword from his belt what dye want with me then i mean yer no harm a blow from a lance butt sent him sprawling into the stream he stood up in the shallows spluttering his face was a mask of vengeance oak tom stood on the bank lance held loose but ready the time for your reckoning is due searat now you must pay for the lives of two hares tell me how does it feel standing there without your crew to protect you graypatch swallowed hard his own voice sounding squeaky in his ears leave me alone i only want ter get out o here let me go and i wont bother ye anymore i just want t get to the sea oak tom raised the lance then you shall go to the sea graypatch had his sword free now but the squirrels face was so full of vengeance and rage that the searats natural boldness and cunning deserted him completely the sword fell from his nerveless claws into the water as he turned and ran with the flowing stream oo it was fully three days later that graypatch made it to the sea floating faceup with oak toms lance standing out from his corpse like a mast with no sail the two gallant hares of the long patrol had been avenged and redwall abbey was freed of further trouble all with one swiftly thrown lance oo two hours after dawn next day set up by a full redwall breakfast the creatures of the abbey began to set their home right again fire damage was repaired crops and orchard tended back to their former fruitfulness the pond was weeded and cleared of charred fireswingers and the main gate had a team attending to it armed with carpenters tools and headed by saxtus brother

all right now simeon good your senses are improving my friend i too can sense something oh something ive missed its not that mole burgo and his wild garlic again is it haha no i sense that we should

runn look at them covered from nose to tail with green gatehouse paint ill scrub the hides off the pair o them she took off at a trot chasing the two green perils of red wall sometimes i think shes only happy when shes got dirty dibbuns to hurl into bathtubs simeon whispered in the abbots ear late the previous night six searats had been posted on guard duty by captain riptung felltooth and the rats who had swum out in vain pursuit of the waveblade felltooth was not the most popular searat at bladegirt a fact that his mates kept reminding him of please sir capn sir can i swim out an bring

capns thats why theyre capns see the crack of the rock was audible in the darkness as it struck the speaker he dropped without a sound felltooth leaned over him ere are you all right matey yaaaagh an arrow had gone right through felltooths ear he straightened up and ran for the fort screaming aloud attack attaaaaaack still halfasleep the searat horde were rousted out by hookfin riptung and grimtooth they hurried into the courtyard surrounding bladegirt snatching weapons as they went stir yer stumps ydozy layabouts were under attack come on out there every ratjack of ye move pick up those weapons never mind yer fancy clothes yer goin to a fight not a dance high in the rocks dandin and mariel drew back their bows glancing along the line of trag warriors as they drew bowstrings tight in unison durry quill nodded now the arrows zipped off like a flight of angry wasps straight down into the teeming courtyard where even despite the night they could not miss among the large numbers of milling rats as the archers dropped down to fit more shafts to their bows a line of warriors behind them stood up whirling slings again durry nodded now the rocks hurtled down chunking into the searats below oo from a lower floor window gabool the wild grabbed hold of a passing searat hauling him in bodily over the sill what in the name of hellfangs is agoin on out there majesty were bein attacked i can see that idiot who is it doin the attackin sire i dont know but were bein cut down by arrows an rocks from both sides left an right gabool hauled the unfortunate off with him toward the banqueting hall its the badger i know it is you stay outside the door an sing out t me as soon as ysee the badger hear the terrified searat nodded dumbly though no sooner had gabool gone into the banqueting hall and w slammed the door than the young searat sneaked off back to the courtyard where a hardslung rock put an end to all his fears oo on the far hill joseph was marshaling his troops to snipe from two different directions of the hillside causing great confusion among the searats they would turn to fire their bows in one direction only to be hit from behind as they did riptung ran up and down the courtyard in the dark laying about with the flat of his sword as he yelled out up there in the hills to yer left dolts cant yer tell by the way those arrows w stones are comin in ere gimme that bow you he snatched the bow and arrow from a bewildered rat pulling the shaft taut on the bow he held it as a row of archers ducked down riptung let the arrow fly as the slingbeasts stood up and was rewarded with a faint cry from high on the hillside see thats the way to get em now get down behind the wall and use yer tiny brains up an down quick like sames theyre doin to us there aint that many of em judgin by their volleys gradually the three captains got the searats into some semblance of fighting crews using all their cunning in reply to the surprise invasion dandin caught a stray searat who had moved out of the wall cover he glanced anxiously at mariel wheres tarquin got to as if in reply a cry rang out from below eulaliaaaaa whump bump thud the battering ram had begun its work on the front gates tarquin had his forces screaming and yelling as they charged with the ram trag trag trag eulaliaaaa trag trag trag the massive treetrunk still matted with earth and grass pounded its blunt head against the quivering timbers of the gates grimtooth dashed around to riptung theyre smashin the gates in matey take your force from this side an stand em off ill get hookfin to do the same soon the searats were massed halfway between the fort building and the gates they fired arrows upward in a curving arc the shafts fell on the ram crew slaying several with their first volley tarquin ordered his archers to return fire give em blood an vinegar chaps fire gabool could see only the sea and the rocks below from the big banqueting hall window but he darted around the slit windows on the other walls the noise of battle ringing in his ears as he peered out at the dark shapes scurrying below dashing to the slit window on the far side he stared out at the back hillside in horror the badger had emerged from somewhere high upon the hill and stood there like some giant out of the worst nightmare framed against the night sky battlesword stuck in the ground beside him clad in warhelm and breastplate gabool stood framed in the big window screaming threats and challenging the enemy who had haunted his waking dreams so long but rawnblade was only concerned with the task of the moment setting his paws against the vast boulder he sucked air into his lungs feeling his mighty chest swell against the metal breastplate he pitted his weight and strength against the monolithic ball of rock it budged slightly then settled back this time the badger threw his back against it digging his blunt claws and wide footpads hard into the earth he crouched and grunted with exertion as sweat trickled across his striped head forcing his bulk into the boulder this time it moved out of its depression in the stony soil feeling the mass move rawnblade attacked it with primeval ferocity roaring and bellowing he hurled all his weight into the side of the formidable stone sinew and muscle bunched as flesh hit rock the boulder began to trundle away like some dread juggernaut slowly at first then gathering speed on the sloping hillside lord rawnblade seized his battlesword throwing back his head he howled the war cry of salamandastron to the night sky eulaliaaaaaa the boulder crashed through the hill gorse spinning and bouncing a mighty stone ball of destruction with the badger lord charging in its wake with a thunderous rumble it smashed through the wall sending an explosion of sharded masonry high in the air either side of it sections of wall fell like wheat before a scythe several rats guarding the back wall stood paralyzed with fright as rawnblade came bounding through the dustcloud in the shattered breach followed by joseph the bellmaker and a chanting mass of trag warriors trag trag trag redwaaaaalll the rats at the main gates stopped shooting arrows they turned to see what was happening at the back wall riptung dashed through them come on theyve burst through the walls back there reluctantly the searat archers turned to face the latest peril hookfin and grimtooth shoving and pushing them toward the foe push em back or were done for mates there aint that many of em weve got em outnumbered buckos charge spurred on by desperation the rats clashed with their attackers steel clashed against steel as both sides met like two waves crashing together the bigger more powerful searats in their barbaric finery did not intimidate the young trag fighters who threw themselves upon their hated oppressors with insane ferocity hacking and cleaving as the melee swayed back and forth but the rats were experienced skirmishers each searat and his mate taking one trag warrior between them slashing and stabbing from back to front soon it became evident that josephs force would be routed without reinforcements rawnblade was fighting his own fight the bloodwrath had come upon him his one aim was to get inside bladegirt to find gabool oblivious of trag difficulties he fought his way toward the fort seeing nothing through the fiery red mist that engulfed his eyes but the building which contained his sworn enemy searats flew before the blade of verminfate like butterflies caught in a gale oo outside the main gates they heard the noise as the back wall was broken by the boulder within moments the searat arrows stopped raining over upon them mariel tarquin dandin and durry lifted their heads and listened the pounding of receding paws and the shouts that followed told them the battle was being joined inside durry did a little dance of impatience use the ram as a ladder quick quick mariel weighed up and cracked and splintered gates no theres twice as many of us now lets see what we can do against these gates right tarquin all paws now every tragjack of you grab the ram one two hup the hare roared out in his best parade ground voice rank upon rank of willing paws gripped the battering ram lifting it high above their heads with a rush of strength and energy tarquin shouted out commands from the front righto chaps back up back back back a bit more come on you lot on the end stop bunchin together and back up we need a good long run to gain momentum wot thats it laddie buck back back ah thats more like it halt mariel stood with dandin and durry at the front of the ram gazing down the long run toward the gates tarquin joined them throwing his shoulder under the log and lifting it high listen up now chaps when i give the word altogether fast as ycan ready chaaaaaarge dust pounded and flew from under the thundering paws eyes wide and mouths agape screaming and yelling bloodcurdling cries the army of rammers with the log swaying madly above their heads tore onward to the gates in one single mad rush whakkarraboom there was no sound of splintering timber just a tremendous whump door timbers locks bars and bolts even the two impressive stone gateposts were knocked flat as if hit by a thunderbolt carried on in the momentum of the heroic charge the rammers clattered across the fallen gates and over the courtyard the battering ram still held high swept on in the rush with the blood singing through his eardrums like a highpitched siren durry quill yelled aloud eeyahoooo the battering ram hit the rear of the searat hordes scattering them like ninepins over the clamor of battle joseph laughed in relief the reinforcements had arrived in a spectacular manner oo riptung knew the tide had turned he strove madly to group a fighting force about him but the searats ignored his cries each fighting with the strength of despair the searat captain whirled his curved sword with longborn expertise taking out a vole and a fieldmouse only to find himself confronted by dandin the blade of martin the warrior flashed in the young mouses paws as he closed in to attack riptung parried frantically backing to get creatures between himself and the coldeyed swordsmouse the searat tried every move and trick he knew but his assailant kept coming on battering the curved corsair sword aside ferociously until he had riptung backed up to the wall above the clash of battle riptung swung his sword high for a downward slash screeching in dandins face youll never take me alive dandin slew him with a strong upward swing i dont want you alive rat hookfin saw that the battle was lost he sneaked away before the total rout of all the searats skirting the edges of the fray until he found the section of the back wall that the boulder had smashed through without a backward glance he slipped out onto the hillside with a sigh of relief that died upon his lips sitting in front of him on a rock was the impassive vole tan loc hookfin froze drawing his long sword tan loc whetted it against the rock speaking in a flat voice without even looking at hookfin ive been waiting for you oo back at the battle joseph found himself fighting for his life a searat was choking him from behind as grimtooth swung his cutlass in front the bellmaker parried each thrust as he fought to shake off the rat who clung behind him like a leech grimtooth slashed furiously knowing the death of a leader might turn the tide of battle back in favor of the searats he smiled grimly as the grayhaired mouse began to weaken and closed in for the kill redwaaalll mariel leaped off the back of a falling rat swinging her gullwhacker grimtooth turned catching the full force of the blow between his eyes he dropped like a log durry quill took the strangler from behind with a rock from the wall debris tarquin fought his way through to them a broken lance clutched in his paws one more good sally an theyre finished chaps i say wot he turned this way and that bobbing up and down wheres me old boss got to anybeast seen lord rawnblade mariel struck off into the melee no come on lets find him they were joined by dandin as they dodged around skirmishing groups the steps up to fort bladegirt were littered with dead searats durry picked his way between them pointing with his dagger at the big oak door which had been hacked almost to splinters and hung crazily on one hinge ha betcher rawnblade did this wi that great treechopper o his mariel strode past durry into the building well see who gets gabool saxtus gazed out from the ramparts of red wall the sun cast cloud shadows onto the path and across the greenery of the woodlands fleecy clouds scudded across the sky on a warm breeze the days of summer season were numbered now simeon joined him his paws feeling along the battlements until he came in contact with saxtus the autumn will arrive soon saxtus how did you know what i was thinking brother simeon chuckled and patted saxtuss paw i didnt it was just an educated guess creatures often think i have wondrous powers but its just experience and observation though i do sense that you have more reason than the change of seasons for standing up here it comes to me that you are watching the road would i be wrong in supposing that you are awaiting the return of certain friends saxtus searched the blind herbalists wise old face you are right of course but it doesnt take a genius to know that dandin and durry were my best friends mariel too for the short time she was with us i had a dream you see the night before last it was of a great battle i saw them fighting with searats like the crew who attacked our abbey but there were many many more than that was it through martin the warrior that this dream came ah now you do surprise me what makes you say that simeon oh we are old friends the spirit of the abbey and i martin has visited me more than once in the land of sleep you must always heed his warnings what did you see of this battle it was not very clear i saw an old gray mouse quite a big fellow he was being attacked by two searats i cried out in my dream for martin to help him mariel and durry quill rescued him there was lots of fighting a great battle things werent very clear though and it all faded after a while martin too i say yoohoo you two up there whats the matter dont you want to try my seedcake it was hon rosie waving from her wheelchair friar alder and cockleburr were pushing it both their faces pictures of strained patience well talk about this another time simeon whispered to saxtus turning in the direction of the wheelchair he waved seedcake did you say i used to be a fair cook at making that myself hold on well come down and try some give me your paw saxtus lunch was being served in great hall as they entered mellus nudged foremole murmuring in a low voice heres another two victims being brought in to sample the dreaded seedcake what rosie made it with i dont know burr youm can say that agin oi near broken moi diggen claws just picken up a sloice marm rosie leaned from her chair scanning the table i say wheres me jolly old seedcake gone you havent scoffed it all have you well thats the bally limit i suppose ill have to bake another er no seeds left marm friar alder interrupted swiftly cockleburr tugged the friars sleeve perishin puddens friar theres a great box of seeds at the back of the floursacks i found it meself this m oof alder elbowed his assistant sharply in the stomach and carried on smoothly oh those seeds you mean theyve got damp and were beginning to sprout i was meaning to leave them out for the birds oh dear not a single seed in the kitchens or the storerooms what a shame underneath the table grubb and bagg were using the remains of the seedcake as building blocks well have to get miz rosie more seeds if we wanna make a model of the abbey bagg grumbled as he looked about for more hurrhurr froir alder scrangle ee iffen youm mention et i spose so i heard im say to the habbit that he hopes miz rosietl get better afore she kills us all wi seedcakes oo saxtus wandered through to watch some creatures working on the great abbey tapestry brother hubert was supervising the design from sketches he had found in the gatehouse he tossed a hank of light brown thread to sister serena this color should suit if youre starting the face of the warrior saxtus sorted a thread out of a slightly darker tone excuse me brother but i think this shade is the correct one hubert held it up to the light inspecting it carefully hmm you could be right saxtus but how do you know that this is the color of martins face i sort of sensed it oo lord rawnblade widestripe strode through the entrance hall of fort bladegirt the sword verminfate sending out showers of sparks as he clashed it against the stone columns leading to the main stairway gabool it is i rawnblade the badger show yourself the rumble of the badger lords challenge echoed back at him from empty chambers and deserted corridors as he mounted the stairs his keen dark eyes searching everywhere rawnblade sniffed but the odor of searat permeated the air throughout and he could not distinguish the scent of his enemy kicking aside the debris of castoff clothing useless weaponry and stale food the rats had left behind he ascended the wide stone stairs oo heedless of whether the rats had won or lost the battle gabool listened to the sounds of the badger ringing through his fort as he nerved himself up for the confrontation he knew would inevitably come gripping both sword and dagger the searat king ranged about his upper chamber holding a muttered conference with himself hahaar ill sleep tonight once im rid of the badger ill destroy that useless bell aye thats it kill the badger an roll the bell off the high cliffs inter the sea whatll be left to worry me then ive seen em all off graypatch saltar bludrigg look out badger youre next an the bell to follow yer then theyll see whos the ruler of terramort me gabool king of searats ill build a new fleet each craft bigger an faster than darkqueen theyll scour the coasts for slaves fine silks wine an the best of prime vittles haharr gabool wont need no bell to announce hisself theyll know who i am wherever they see my ships hove in an hear me name gabool you spawn of hell where are you the deep thunder of rawnblades voice vibrated upward from the banqueting hall gabool pressed an ear to his room door keep searchin badger ill lead you a merry dance before im done with yer gabool aint feared of a stripedog no more oh no matey oo rawnblade stood before the great bell it was exactly as he had imagined it only a bellmaker with the skills of joseph could create such a wonder his hefty paw stroked the stained and discolored surface of the brazen object as he walked around it reading the mysterious badger hieroglyphics near the belltop smiling with satisfaction at the message only a badger lord could interpret that is yet to come but meanwhile rawnblade smashed a wooden stool with one blow of his sword picking up a severed stool leg he began belaboring the bell bongboo m bo ngaboombo ngbong as he struck the bell rawnblade breathed upon a section of the metal and rubbed it clean he continued to smite the great bell harder and louder boombongboomboombongbooooongggg peering at the polished section the badger watched gabool enter the banqueting hall and begin creeping up on him sword raised to strike rawnblade stopped beating the bell and turned slowly so you like my music eh rat gabool leaped forward his sword flashing down like lightning rawnblade swung his battlesword sideways the power of the sweep knocking gabools blade flying it clattered into a corner the searat stood helpless his paws deadened by the numbing force of the blow rawnblade nodded to the curved sword lying on the floor pick it up and have a proper try mariel came dashing into the banqueting hall with jospeh tarquin dandin and durry the mousemaid swung her gullwhacker shouting stand and fight rat gabool cackled harshly the bellmakers brat eh go away mouse ive killed you once youre naught but a ghost mariels jaw tightened as the gullwhacker whirled above her head youre wrong seascum im no ghost i beat you once and im going to do it again this time for good from the corner of her eye mariel saw the badger lord move to attack gabools mine rawnblade the badger turned his head in her direction as he did gabool plunged the dagger into his chest and sped through a door on the other side of the room as the door slammed they ran to the badger lord he was standing straight with the dagger protruding before anybeast could speak rawnblade pulled the dagger out and tossed it aside nearly grazed my fur when it pierced the breastplate not bad steel for a searat dagger tarquin was tugging and shoving at the door blighters locked it out of the way woodsorrel hurry tarquin barely had time to leap aside as a stroke from verminfate split the door in two halves lord rawnblade kicked them flat dont interrupt me next time mousemaid the stairs in front of them spiraled downward keeping one paw against the side wall they hurried around the dizzying curves oo gabool slammed the door closed and barred it chuckling to himself he moved an old carpet from a corner of the room and spread it over the hole in the floor standing on the far side of it he went into a crouch claws stretching forward soon he heard his pursuers arriving there was a rending crash and the door swung lopsidedly on a single hinge rawnblade thrust it aside as he stepped into the room brandishing his sword he glanced about at the bare walls the runnings over rat theres nowhere for you to g aye so tis gabool sneered youre well backed up by your friends and fully armed too i thought badgers were true warriors why dont yer throw down that great doorcleaver an meet me in paw t claw combat searat fashion or are yer just a great cowardly stripedog the red mists of bloodwrath clouded lord rawnblades eyes as he flung his sword aside and came at gabool with a mighty roar eulaliaaaa for an instant gabools blood froze within him at the sight of the huge badger charging forward then rawnblade stood on the carpet he plunged down into the hole with a sharp bark of alarm falling flat on his back at the bottom of the pit there was a scuttling noise and rawnblade shouted aloud stay away mariel and her companions hesitated in the doorway the massive black scorpion rattled out at breathtaking speed it was on rawnblade before he could move his eyes went wide with horror at the sight of the loathesome beast perched on his breastplate clicking claws held menacingly wide it began to bring the venomous barbed sting on its tail up over its back to strike at the badgers unprotected face suddenly some unseen force galvanized rawnblade into instant action his paw shot up grabbing the scorpion by the curve of its tail and with a mighty bellow he jumped upright whirling the evil creature around he flung it swiftly from the pit the black scorpion shot up at an angle striking the ceiling and dropping down straight into the face of gabool the wild from the doorway they watched in horrified fascination as the searat leaped frenziedly about the room feebly struggling with the angry creature locked onto his throat with both claws it covered his face muffling the gurgled screams as the lethal tail sent its hooked sting slamming over the top of his head into the base of the skull whipping back and forth as it stabbed in a maddened frenzy rawnblade heaved himself out of the pit in time to see gabool fall to the floor his limbs twitching spasmodically as poison flooded through his crazed brain the king of the searats shuddered one last time and died his body arched back like a straining bow dandin rushed into the room as the scorpion turned its attention to lord rawnblade the young mouse swung the sword of martin the warrior once twice thrice the two halves of the terrible creature toppled awkwardly back into its pit still clicking and striking with its poisonous tailsting rawnblade shuddered he rubbed his paws together vigorously as if trying to cleanse himself of the scorpions touch tarquin addressed his harolina consolingly well me old twanger you never got to brain gabool after all matter o fact none of us did what a shameful waste of such jolly good weapons joseph put a paw around his daughters shoulders evil destroyed evil and good triumphed come on mariel let us leave terramort the nightmare is over mariel hugged her father fondly lets go to redwall oo four ships lay ready to sail from the cove at terramort captain durry quill stood at the helm of waveblade renamed gabriel after his favorite nuncle captain tarquin l woodsorrel now commanded the hon rosie formerly the blacksail captain dandin rested his paw on the tiller of nightwake renamed the abbot bernard the crabdaw had been restored to her former name periwinkle at the wish of her new captain joseph the bellmaker he stood proudly with mariel and rawnblade on her swaying deck watching the crew of former oarslaves tying down the final lashings of the great bell above them a huge hole gaped in the seaward side of fort bladegirt where the bell had been lowered to the periwinkles deck dark smoke curled from the breach in the fort as rawnblade nodded his head in satisfaction ive never used fire on anything in my life but i was glad to put the torch to that evil building it will never burn away its memory but maybe someday in the seasons to come the wind and rains from the seas will scour its blackened stones clean joseph patted the deckrail good old periwinkle remember when we first set sail in her mariel now we can complete that voyage and deliver lord rawnblades bell to salamandastron where it belongs but the badger lord had other ideas no friend joseph this bell must go to redwall abbey and i will tell you the reason why when i was down that pit with the scorpion on me i was in the grip of bloodwrath and did not know what was going on the creature would have killed me however i was saved by martin the warrior it was his spirit that entered me and enabled me to act so quickly he saved my life so i must repay him dandin touched the hilt of the sword good old martin so it was he wrho really slew gabool or was it him through you sir or was it just a badtempered scorpion well never know what do you say mariel i say here take this little swallow and hang it where my father can see it give me your sword you wont need it for a moment armed with the sword of martin the warrior the mousemaid stood high on the bowsprit and shouted her orders to the little fleet hoist anchors and set all sails theres a running tide and fair wind to take us to the shores of mossflower country and redwall the great bell gave out a mighty boom as rawnblade struck it the sound echoed around the headlands mingled with the joyful cheers from hundreds of free creatures as the breeze filled the sails and carried the four vessels out onto the seas in golden summer sunlight the seasons turned and autumn arrived in due course though saxtus and his friend simeon kept up their vigil on the ramparts of redwall there was still no sign of the returning travelers the abbey orchard was now in burgeoning fruitfulness and each day the crop gatherers were busy with ladders long poles and industrious energy as they picked and basketed the plums apples damsons pears and berries of many different varieties the kitchens were working at full capacity cooking preserving and storing the fruits gabriel quills cellar was also a hive of activity cordials wines squashes and october ale were being squeezed brewed and fermented the days of autumn continued fine and warm though darkness started to draw in earlier peace and plenty had returned to the abbey every creature was happy well nearly every creature the three little dibbuns bagg runn and grubb were totally dissatisfied with their lot and feeling highly mutinous two three sometimes even four scrubbings a day were commonplace for them during harvesttime they had been caught in different color changes by mother mellus and the good sisters who cared for them purple from blackberries crimson from redcur rants yellow from greengages green from gooseberries and generally filthy from climbing trees falling into bushes being covered in dust from the cellars or appearing coated in oven grime and ashes from the kitchen ovens besides being sent to bed early for cheeking some venerable abbey dwellers the three miscreants were now being instructed in sewing by brother hubert so that they could repair their own ripped clothing hubert had also hinted darkly that they would soon be attending gatehouse school and abbey history study this news was the final clincher being met with awful scowls and rebellious mutterings and culminating in the terrible trio swearing a deathly oath underneath a dormitory bed where they were hiding from their latest misdeeds they were leaving the abbey the very next morning to seek their fortunes far afield or as grubb succinctly put it sumplace where gurt beasties doant keep scrubben an barthen usns dawn came soft and misty with warm sunlight turning the lowlying shrouds of mist from white to pale yellow the three dibbuns let themselves out by the north wallgate and trundled up that path rustling the carpet of brown leaves brought down by autumnal night winds each of them had a kerchief bulging with food swinging from a stick across his shoulder and their mood was decidedly carefree as they strode out with a will wait ol ma mells finds usns are gone i bet she shakes er head an says oh dearie me a lot then eh heeheehee she wont ave

aye an well spank em all an baffem an scoff every thin hurrhurr thatll teach em a lessing oo late breakfast turned into early lunch as they sat at the side of the path telling each other what tyrants they would be when they returned to the abbey fully grown suddenly runn squeaked with fright the three dibbuns sat petrified at the sight of a giant armored badger who had strolled up out of the mists with a strange light in his dark eyes he swung his massive sword high and placed it into the carrier straps on his back the badger knelt down bringing his widestriped head close to their terrifed faces his voice was growling deep but gentle as he could make it well well what have we here three marauders lying in wait for poor honest travelers uuusns be oanly dibbuns zurr dibbuns eh a likely story you look more like bloodthirsty rogues to me all right then supposing you are dibbuns where are you from bagg found his tongue please sir redwall habbey sir rawnblade lifted them carefully in his hefty battlescarred paws redwall habbey i think i may know that place youd better come with me ill soon find out if youre telling me the truth oo the badger made his way through the hordes of trag warriors eating breakfast at the side of the path he halted by a wide flat wooden cart with a great bell upon it the three dibbuns sat gazing at their reflections in the burnished metal surface of the bell as they perched upon rawnblades paws their legs swinging over the big blunt claws lord rawnblade lowered them toward dandin and durry winking at the two friends as he did ive just captured these three searat captains they were waiting down the way apiece probably to ambush us and steal our bell dandin and durry played along with the badger its as well you did they look like born killers to me aye these searats are all the same yknow grubb tried reasoning with his captors oh gurraway oim a moler an they be two hotterfolk youm be danin an maister quill oi knows ee rawnblade burst out laughing hohoho well said well take you back to redwall with us bagg held a paw to his snout confidentially whispering to rawnblade i wouldnt if i was you ma mells will chuck you all inna tub an scrub you sumfink awful the orchard workers had halted for a midmorning break and jugs of cider and slices of plumcake were passed around mother mellus searched around the berry bushes worriedly anybeast here seen three dibbuns bagg runn and grubb saxtus stood up helpfully do you want me to go and look for them the badger plumped down wearily next to simeon and accepted a beaker of new cider id be most grateful if you did saxtus ive run my aching old bones ragged searching for those three rips as the young mouse trotted off on a tour of the abbey grounds mellus refilled simeons beaker what a fine young creature our saxtus is i remember he wasnt any great trouble as a dibbun always a fairly serious and obedient little thing not like some i could name the blind herbalist smiled youre a proper old fraud mellus you wouldnt know what to do with yourself if all our dibbuns were quiet serious and obedient it makes the seasons happier having a few little pickles around having searched in the most likely hiding places saxtus mounted the wallsteps and scoured the ramparts starting at the south wall he worked his way along to the east battlements covering every recess and niche each moment expecting to come upon the three little ones hiding in some favorite corner he had hidden up here many a time with dandin and durry when they were small all the best secret hideouts were known to him saxtus could feel anxiety beginning to gnaw at him he had searched every possible place and still there was no sign of the missing trio he leaned his back against the northwest walltop corner looking down into the abbey grounds mentally ticking off each place he had covered the three little ones were definitely missing but there was no need to upset mother mellus yet they might still be somewhere in the vicinity saxtus turned to look up the path for a moment he could scarcely believe his eyes he felt his whole body begin to shake and tremble with excitement paws twitching and teeth chattering he blinked and rubbed his eyes to reassure himself he was not witnessing a mirage he was not he stood for some time exerting all his willpower to gain control of himself oo refreshment time was over in the orchard picking up their baskets the harvesters were about to go back to work saxtuss voice rang out level and loud from the ramparts father abbot mother mellus bring everybody with you come up here and look at this mellus and the abbot with simeon between them rounded the corner of the abbey building a crowd of redwallers following them saxtus hi saxtus what is it have you found the dibbuns saxtus the young mouse turned and called back to the swelling band of redwallers come up here this is very important i think you should all see this now every creature in the abbey was striding across the lawns from the orchards kitchens great hall cavern hole dormitories and gatehouse overcome with curiosity i hope it aint more searats marm in the name of all fur what is it hoi saxtus whats all this about but saxtus had turned his back on them and was staring out at the path from the north ignoring their shouts mellus quickend her pace ooh he was always very aggravating as a dibbun was that one oo every creature in the abbey was now ranged along the wall staring dumbfounded at the sight before them it was gabriel quill who broke the silence scrambling up onto a battlement he waved his paws wildly as he shouted theyve come back oh durry me heart its me yer ol nuncle gabriel the hedgehogs call seemed to trigger everything a mighty roaring cheer rose from the walltops caps and aprons were flung in the air as the redwallers danced up and down waving and cheering at the top of their lungs stamping their paws and howling pure joy to the skies theyre back oh look theyre back hooraaaaaay on the path the horde of trag warriors with the great bell in their midst ground to a halt at rawnblades signal mariel stood atop the bell she loosed her gullwhacker and began swinging it in circles above her head tarquin winked at her go on old gel let em know you jolly well did it the mousemaid swung the heavily knotted rope down with both paws boooooommrnmmml the deep melodious sound echoed out across the brown and russet woodlands in the fine autumn morn eulaliaaaaa trag trag trag redwaaaaalll the answer to red walls cheers rent the air as the warriors roared out their battle cry sitting on top of lord rawnblades war helmet grubb joined paws with bagg and runn who were perched on the badgers shoulders between them they yelled as loudly as any battlehardened soldier abbot bernard stood in front of the open gateway paws tucked into wide habit sleeves his voice quivered noticeably as he addressed the four travelers who stood with lord rawnblade at the head of the army you have come a very long way to be at redwall abbey welcome home extract from the writings of abbot saxtus the seasons turn slowly with the earth redwall stones grow aged and mellow and i thank fortune that we live peacefully within our abbey the old ones are still with us i am happy to say joseph simeon hubert and old abbot bernard i sat with them this afternoon on the rickety remains of the wooden bellcart in the orchard we talked of bygone times as we lounged about in the warmth of this long summer bagg runn and grubb brought us dandelion and burdock cordial to drink you would not believe what big wellmannered otters the twins are and grubb always ready with a joke and a smile he never changes i know because he put otter hotroot in my beaker bernard and his friends were recalling the feast of the bell raising what a day mariels father was so proud wrhen we named the bell after him the oseph bell though he would not sit at the head of the table no joseph insisted on sitting with tarquin and his wife rosie ah that was a feast my stomach still remembers cellarmaster durry quill and his assistant old gabriel produced the finest october ale i ever drank friar cockleburr made a bellshaped fruitcake as big as the joseph bell itself friar alder and his trag trainees did us proud too there were more trifles tarts puddings salads cheeses and breads than you could shake a twig at oak tom and his wife treerose say that the feast might have lasted a whole season had it not been for flagg the otter rosie and tarquin and mellus and rawnblade my word you should have seen those creatures eat you would have thought they were facing a sevenseason famine well the bell was finally raised though a lot more things happened during the three days of that feast i can tell you lord rawnblade explained the badger symbols around the top of the bell to us all would you believe it they told of the coming of the bell to redwall even predicting its name joseph the badger rulers of salamandastron are truly mysterious beasts someday i may take a trip there to study the mountain and its caves rawnblade gave permission for rosie and tarquin to range the lands freely and they have formed an organization called the fur and foot fighting patrol last i heard they had twelve members all their own young ones rufe brush did a strange thing on the third morning of the feast he took the sword of martin the warrior strapped it to his back and climbed to the roof of the abbey yes right up to the very top of redwall what a climb rufe placed the sword on the arm of the weathervane and tied it there what a curious thing to do brother simeon told me that rufe had been spending a lot of time staring at our grand tapestry of martin so it occurs to me that our warrior may have visited rufe in his dreams rufe brush is now our bellringer still as strong and silent as ever i am very close to rufe he is a true friend to me always ready to step in and settle disputes though they are few and far between at redwall i think bagg will become the new foremole the old fellow spends his days drink ing eating and playing with the dibbuns he is a great favorite among the little ones i miss dandin and mariel very much and sometimes i dream of them they went off you know the peaceful abbey life was not for them they said one morning we awoke to find they had gone south in search of adventures joseph merely smiled and said that they would return someday but mother mellus moped about for half a season she loved that pair very much sometimes i wish that i had not been born with a sense of duty and my serious nature i would have liked to travel with them but it was not to be when bernard stepped down everybeast immediately called for me to take on the robe of father abbot what could i do wherever my friends mariel and dandin are my heart is with them may the way be fair before them and good fortune attend them both i am sitting on the bell tower steps as i write it is cool and shady in here quiet too the roof and all of the woodwork stairs and doors and beams are made from the timbers of four ships that were dismantled by the side of the ford which crosses the path to the north some of the wood was used to build a bridge over the ford to protect travelers from the pike that swim in the waters there i have only to look up and i can see the great joseph bell overhead it is truly the pride of our abbey a thing of great beauty ah well rawnblade rules salamandastron and i must rule here i love my redwall abbey it is a place of peace and plenty soon my friend rufe will come to ring the bell for suppertime there will be lots of good things to eat and drink in cavern hole and i will sit in my great chair surrounded by all of my dear companions dibbuns playing beneath the table mellus sage and serena old as they are still shooing the little ones to bath and bed and me discussing with the ancient simeon what i can sense about the earth the seasons and the feelings of other creatures he says i am becoming quite good at it old abbot bernard will just chuckle into his elderberry wine and recall that simeon used to say that about him so i hope you will forgive me my friends i must go now and attend to my duties as father abbot there ive done it again bumped my head on that great knotty thing hanging at the end of the bellrope im always doing that i must learn to duck my head though i think i do it purposely because that piece of rope reminds me of a little mousemaid named storm who turned up at our abbey one summer have you guessed what the rope is then you must have been taking lessons from simeon it is the weapon called gullwhacker before mariel and dandin went they tied it to the end of the bellrope as a reminder to other creatures for all the seasons to come that this was how they brought the great joseph bell home to redwall
