preface the red book contains a large number of verses a few are included in the narrative of the downfall of the lord of the rings or in the attached stories and chronicles many more are found on loose leaves while some are written carelessly in mar gins and blank spaces of the last sort most are nonsense now often unintelligible even when legible or halfremembered fragments from these marginalia are drawn nos ii though a better example of their general character would be the scribble on the page recording bilbos when winter first begins to bite the wind so whirled a weathercock he could not hold his tail up the frost so nipped a throstlecock he could not snap a snail up my case is hard the throstle cried and all is vane the cock replied and so they set their wail up the present selection is taken from the older pieces mainly concerned with legends and jests of the shire at the end of the third age that appear to have been made by hobbits especially by bilbo and his friends or their immediate descendants their authorship is however seldom indi cated those outside the narratives are in various hands and were probably written down from oral tradition in the red book it is said that no was made by bilbo and no by sam gamgee no is marked sg and the ascription may be accepted no is also marked sg though at most sam can only have touched up an older piece of the comic bestiary lore of which hobbits appear to have been fond in the lord of the rings sam stated that no was traditional in the shire no is an example of another kind which seems to have amused hobbits a rhyme or story which returns to its own beginning and so may be recited until the hearers revolt several specimens are found in the red book but the others are simple and crude no is much the longest and most elaborate it was evidently made by bilbo this is indicated by its obvious relationship to the long poem recited by bilbo as his own composition in the house of elrond in origin a nonsense rhyme it is in the rivendell version found transformed and applied somewhat incongruously to the highelvish and numenorean legends of earendil probably because bilbo in vented its metrical devices and was proud of them they do not appear in other pieces in the red book the older form here given must belong to the early days after bilbos return from his journey though the influence of elvish traditions is seen they are not seriously treated and the names used derrilyn thellamie belmarie aerie are mere inventions in the elvish style and are not in fact elvish at all the influence of the events at the end of the third age and the widening of the horizons of the shire by contact with rivendell and gondor is to be seen in other pieces no though here placed next to bilbos maninthemoon rhyme and the last item no must be derived ultimately from gondor they are evidently based on the traditions of men living in shore lands and familiar with rivers running into the sea no actually mentions belfalas the windy bay of bel and the seaward tower tirith aear or dol amroth no mentions the seven rivers that flowed into the sea in the south kingdom and uses the gondorian name of highelvish form firiel mortal woman in the langstrand and dol amroth there were many traditions of the ancient elvish dwellings and of the haven at the mouth of the morthond from which westward ships had sailed as far back as lefnui morthondkirilringlo gilrainsernui and anduin the name was borne by a princess of gondor through whom aragorn claimed descent from the southern line it was also the name of a daughter of elanor daughter of sam but her name if connected with the rhyme must be derived from it it could not have arisen in westmarch the fall of eregion in the second age these two pieces therefore are only rehandlings of southern matter though this may have reached bilbo by way of rivendell no also depends on the lore of rivendell elvish and numenorean concerning the heroic days at the end of the first age it seems to contain echoes of the numenorean tale of turin and mim the dwarf nos i and evidently come from the buck land they show more knowledge of that country and of the dingle the wooded valley of the withywindle than any hobbits west of the marish were likely to possess they also show that the bucklanders knew bombadil though no doubt they had as little understanding of his powers as the shirefolk had of gandalfs both were regarded as benevolent persons mysterious maybe and unpredictable but nonetheless comic no i is the earlier piece and is made up of various hobbitversions of legends concerning bombadil no uses similar traditions though grindwall was a small hythe on the north bank of the withywindle it was outside the hay and was so well watched and protected by a grind or fence extended into the water breredon was a little village on rising ground behind the hythe in the narrow tongue between the end of the high hay and the brandywine at the mithe the outflow of the shirebourn was a landingstage from which a lane ran to deephallow and so on to the causeway road that went through rushey and stock indeed they probably gave him this name it is bucklandish in form to add to his many older ones toms raillery is here turned in jest upon his friends who treat it with amusement tinged with fear but it was probably composed much later and after the visit of frodo and his companions to the house of bombadil the verses of hobbit origin here presented have generally two features in common they are fond of strange words and of rhyming and metrical tricks in their simplicity hobbits evidently regarded such things as virtues or graces though they were no doubt mere imitations of elvish practices they are also at least on the surface lighthearted or frivolous though sometimes one may uneasily suspect that more is meant than meets the ear no certainly of hobbit origin is an exception it is the latest piece and belongs to the fourth age but it is included here because a hand has scrawled at its head frodos dreme that is remarkable and though the piece is most unlikely to have been written by frodo himself the title shows that it was associated with the dark and despairing dreams which visited him in march and october during his last three years but there were certainly other traditions concerning hobbits that were taken by the wanderingmadness and if they ever returned were afterwards queer and uncommunicable the thought of the sea was everpresent in the back ground of hobbit imagination but fear of it and distrust of all elvish lore was the prevailing mood in the shire at the end of the third age and that mood was certainly not entirely dispelled by the events and changes with which that age ended
