key of light nora roberts chapter one the storm ripped over the mountains gushing torrents of rain that struck the ground with the sharp ring of metal on stone lightning strikes spat down angry artillery fire that slammed against the cannon roar of thunder there was a gleeful kind of mean in the air a sizzle of temper and spite that boiled with power it suited malory prices mood perfectly hadnt she asked herself what else could go wrong now in answer to that weary and completely rhetorical question natureвђin all her maternal wrathвђwas showing her just how bad things could get there was an ominous rattling somewhere in the dash of her sweet little mazda and she still had nineteen payments to go on it in order to make those payments she had to keep her job she hated her job that wasnt part of the malory price life plan which she had begun to outline at the age of eight twenty years later that outline had become a detailed and organized checklist complete with headings subheadings and crossreferences she revised it meticulously on the first day of each year she was supposed to love her job it said so quite clearly under the heading of career shed worked at the gallery for seven years the last three of those as manager which was right on schedule and she had loved itвђbeing surrounded by art having an almost free hand in the displaying the acquiring the promotion and the setup for showings and events the fact was shed begun to think of the gallery as hers and knew full well that the rest of the staff the clients the artists and craftsmen felt very much the same james p horace might have owned the smart little gallery but he never questioned malorys decisions and on his increasingly rare visits he complimented her always on the acquisitions the ambience the sales it had been perfect which was exactly what malory intended her life to be after all if it wasnt perfect what was the point everything had changed when james ditched fiftythree years of comfortable bachelorhood and acquired himself a young sexy wife a wife malory thought with her bluesteel eyes narrowing in resentment whod decided to make the gallery her personal pet it didnt matter that the new mrs horace knew next to nothing about art about business about public relations or about managing employees james doted on his pamela and malorys dream job had become a daily nightmare but shed been dealing with it malory thought as she scowled through her dark drenched windshield she had determined her strategy she would simply wait pamela out she would remain calm and selfpossessed until this nasty little bump was past and the road smoothed out again now that excellent strategy was out the window shed lost her temper when pamela countermanded her orders on a display of art glass and turned the perfectly and beautifully organized gallery upside down with clutter and ugly fabrics there were some things she could tolerate malory told herself but being slapped in the face with hideous taste in her own space wasnt one of them then again blowing up at the owners wife was not the path to job security particularly when the words myopic plebeian bimbo were employed lightning split the sky over the rise ahead and malory winced as much in memory of her temper as from the flash a very bad move on her part which only showed what happened when you gave in to temper and impulse to top it off shed spilled latte on pamelas escada suit but that had been an accident almost however fond james was of her malory knew her livelihood was hanging by a very slim thread and when the thread broke she would be sunk art galleries werent a dime a dozen in a pretty picturesque town like pleasant valley she would either have to find another area of work as a stopgap or relocate neither option put a smile on her face she loved pleasant valley loved being surrounded by the mountains of western pennsylvania she loved the smalltown feel the mix of quaint and sophisticated that drew the tourists and the getaway crowds that spilled out of neighboring pittsburgh for impulsive weekends even when she was a child growing up in the suburbs of pittsburgh pleasant valley was exactly the sort of place shed imagined living in she craved the hills with their shadows and textures and the tidy streets of a valley town the simplicity of the pace the friendliness of neighbors the decision to someday fold herself into the fabric of pleasant valley had been made when she was fourteen and spent a long holiday weekend there with her parents just as shed decided when she wandered through the gallery that longago autumn that she would one day be part of that space of course at the time she had thought her paintings would hang there but that was one item on her checklist that shed been forced to delete rather than tick off when it was accomplished she would never be an artist but she had to be needed to be involved with and surrounded by art still she didnt want to move back to the city she wanted to keep her gorgeous roomy apartment two blocks from the gallery with its views of the appalachians its creaky old floors and its walls that shed covered with carefully selected artwork but the hope of that was looking as dim as the stormy sky so she hadnt been smart with her money malory admitted with a windy sigh she didnt see the point of letting it lie in some bank when it could be turned into something lovely to look at or to wear until it was used money was just paper malory tended to use a great deal of paper she was overdrawn at the bank again shed maxed out her credit cards ditto but she reminded herself she had a great wardrobe and the start of a very impressive art collection which she would have to sell piece by piece and most likely at a loss to keep a roof over her head if pamela brought the axe down but maybe tonight would buy her some time and goodwill she hadnt wanted to attend the cocktail reception at warriors peak a fanciful name for a spooky old place she thought another time she wouldve been thrilled at the opportunity to see the inside of the great old house so high on the ridge and to rub elbows with people who might be patrons of the arts but the invitation had been oddвђwritten in an elegant hand on heavy stonecolored paper with a logo of an ornate gold key in lieu of letterhead though it was tucked in her evening bag now along with her compact her lipstick her cell phone her glasses a fresh pen business cards and ten dollars malory remembered the wording the pleasure of your company is desired for cocktails and conversation eight pm september warriors peak you are the key the lock awaits now how weird was that malory asked herself and gritted her teeth as the car shimmied in a sudden gust of wind the way her luck was going it was probably a scam for a pyramid scheme the house had been empty for years she knew it had been purchased recently but the details were sparse an outfit called triad she recalled she assumed it was some sort of corporation looking to turn the place into a hotel or a mini resort which didnt explain why theyd invited the manager of the gallery but not the owner and his interfering wife pamela had been pretty peeved about the slightвђso that was something still malory would have passed on the evening she didnt have a dateвђjust another aspect of her life that currently suckedвђand driving alone into the mountains to a house straight out of hollywood horror on the strength of an invitation that made her uneasy wasnt on her list of fun things to do in the middle of the workweek there hadnt even been a number or a contact for an rsvp and that she felt was arrogant and rude her intended response of ignoring the invitation would have been equally arrogant and rude but james had spotted the envelope on her desk hed been so excited so pleased by the idea of her going had pressed her to relay all the details of the houses interior to him and hed reminded her that if she could discreetly drop the name of the gallery into conversation from time to time it would be good for business if she could score a few clients it might offset the escada mishap and the bimbo comment her car chugged up the narrowing road that cut through the dense dark forest shed always thought of those hills and woods as a kind of sleepy hollow effect that ringed her pretty valley but just now with the wind and rain and dark the less serene aspects of that old tale were a little too much in evidence for her peace of mind if whatever was rattling in her dash was serious she could end up broken down on the side of the road huddled in the car listening to the moans and lashes of the storm and imagining headless horsemen while she waited for a tow truck she couldnt afford obviously the answer was not to break down she thought she caught glimpses of lights beaming through the rain and trees but her windshield wipers were whipping at the highest speed and were still barely able to shove aside the flood of rain as lightning snapped again she gripped the wheel tighter she liked a good hellcat storm as much as anyone but she wanted to enjoy this one from someplace inside anyplace while drinking a nice glass of wine she had to be close how far could any single road climb before it just had to start falling down the other side of the mountain she knew warriors peak stood atop the ridge guarding the valley below or lording itself over the valley depending on your viewpoint she hadnt passed another car for miles which only proved that anyone with half a brain wasnt out driving in this mess she thought the road forked and the bend on the right streamed between enormous stone pillars malory slowed gawked at the lifesize warriors standing on each pillar perhaps it was the storm the night or her own jittery mood but they looked more human than stone with hair flying around their fierce faces their hands gripping the hilts of their swords in the shimmer of lightning she could almost see muscles rippling in their arms over their broad bare chests she had to fight the temptation to get out of the car for a closer look but the chill that tripped down her spine as she turned through the open iron gates had her glancing back up at the warriors with as much wariness as appreciation for the skill of the sculptor then she hit the brakes and fishtailed on the crushed stone of the roadbed her heart jammed into her throat as she stared at the stunning buck standing arrogantly a foot in front of the bumper with the sprawling eccentric lines of the house behind him for a moment she took the deer for a sculpture as well though why any sane person would set a sculpture in the center of a driveway was beyond her then again sane didnt seem to be the operative word for anyone who would choose to live in the house on the ridge but the deers eyes gleamed a sharp sapphire blue in the beam of her headlights and his head with the great crowning rack turned slightly regally malory mused mesmerized rain streamed off his coat and in the next flash of light that coat seemed as white as the moon he stared at her but there was nothing of fear nothing of surprise in those glinting eyes there was if such things were possible a kind of amused disdain then he simply walked away through the curtain of rain the rivers of fog and was gone wow she let out a long breath shivered in the warmth of her car and one more wow she murmured as she stared at the house shed seen pictures of it and paintings shed seen its silhouette hulking on the ridge above the valley but it was an entirely different matter to see it up close with a storm raging something between a castle a fortress and a house of horrors she decided its stone was obsidian black with juts and towers peaks and battlements stacked and spread as if some very clever very wicked child had placed them at his whim against that rainslicked black long narrow windows perhaps hundreds of them all glowed with gilded light someone wasnt worried about his electric bill fog drifted around its base like a moat of mist in the next shock of lightning she caught a glimpse of a white banner with the gold key madly waving from one of the topmost spires she inched the car closer gargoyles hunched along the walls crawled over the eaves rainwater spewed out of their grinning mouths spilled from clawed hands as they grinned down at her she stopped the car in front of the stone skirt of a wide portico and considered very seriously turning back into the storm and driving away she called herself a coward a childish idiot she asked herself where shed lost her sense of adventure and fun the insults worked well enough that she soon was tapping her fingers on the cars door handle at the quick rap on her window a scream shot out of her throat the bony white face surrounded by a black hood that peered in at her turned the scream into a kind of breathless keening gargoyles do not come to life she assured herself repeating the words over and over in her head as she rolled the window down a cautious half inch welcome to warriors peak his voice boomed over the rain and his welcoming smile showed a great many teeth if youll just leave your keys in the car miss ill see to it for you before she could think to slap down the locks hed pulled her door open he blocked the sweep of wind and rain with his body and the biggest umbrella shed ever seen ill see you safe and dry to the door what was that accent english irish scots thank you she started to climb out felt herself pinned back panic dribbled into embarrassment as she realized she had yet to unhook her seat belt freed she huddled under the umbrella struggling to regulate her breathing as he walked her to the double entrance doors they were wide enough to accommodate a semi and boasted dull silver knockers big as turkey platters fashioned into dragons heads some welcome malory thought an instant before one of the doors opened and light and warmth poured out the woman had a straight and gorgeous stream of flamecolored hairвђit spilled around a pale face of perfect angles and curves her green eyes danced as if at some private joke she was tall and slim garbed in a long gown of fluid black a silver amulet holding a fat clear stone hung between her breasts her lips as red as her hair curved as she held out a hand sparkling with rings she looked malory thought like someone out of a very sexy faerie tale miss price welcome such a thrilling storm but distressing im sure to be out in it come in the hand was warm and strong and stayed clasped over malorys as the woman drew her into the entrance hall the light showered down from a chandelier of crystal so fine that it resembled spun sugar sparkling over the twists and curves of silver the floor was mosaic depicting the warriors from the gate and what seemed to be a number of mythological figures she couldnt kneel down and study it as she might have liked and was already struggling to hold back an orgasmic moan at the paintings that crowded walls the color of melted butter im so glad you could join us tonight the woman continued im rowena please let me take you into the parlor theres a lovely fire early in the year for one but the storm seemed to call for it was the drive difficult challenging missвђ rowena just rowena rowena i wonder if i could take a moment to freshen up before joining the other guests of course powder room she gestured to a door tucked under the long sweep of the front stairs the parlor is the first door on your right take your time thank you malory slipped inside and immediately decided that powder room was a very poor label for the plush spacious area the half dozen candles on the marble counter streamed out light and scent burgundy hand towels edged in ecru lace were arranged beside the generous pool of the sink the faucet gleamed gold in the fanciful shape of a swan here the floor mosaic showed a mermaid sitting on a rock smiling out at a blue sea as she combed her flamecolored hair this time after doublechecking to make certain that shed locked the door malory did kneel down to study the craftsmanship gorgeous she thought running her fingertips over the tiles old certainly and brilliantly executed was there anything more powerful than the ability to create beauty she straightened washed her hands with soap that smelled faintly of rosemary she took a moment to admire the collection of waterhouses nymphs and sirens framed on the walls before digging out her compact there was little she could do for her hair though shed drawn it back and anchored it at her nape with a rhinestone clip the weather had played havoc with the dark blond curls it was a look she thought as she dusted her nose sort of arty and carefree not elegant like the redhead but it suited her well enough she reapplied her lipstick satisfied that the pale rose had been a good investment subtle worked best with her milkmaid coloring shed paid too much for the cocktail suit of course but a woman was entitled to a few weaknesses she reminded herself as she straightened the slim satin lapels besides the slate blue was right for her eyes and the tailored lines pulled it all together into a style both professional and elegant she closed her bag lifted her chin okay mal lets go drum up some business she stepped out forced herself not to tiptoe back down the hall to drool over the paintings her heels clicked briskly on the tile she always enjoyed the sound of it powerful female and when she stepped through the first arch to the right the thrilled gasp escaped before she could block it shed never seen its like in or out of a museum antiques so lovingly tended that their surfaces gleamed like mirrors the rich deep colors that demonstrated an artists flair rugs pillows and draperies that were as much art forms as the paintings and statuary were on the far wall was a fireplace she could have stood in with her arms stretched out at her sides framed in malachite it held enormous logs that snapped with tongues of red and gold fire this was the perfect setting for a woman who looked like shed stepped out of a faerie tale she wanted to spend hours there to wallow in all that marvelous color and light the uneasy woman who had huddled in her car in the rain was long forgotten it took five minutes for my eyes to stop bugging out of my head after i walked in malory jolted then turned and stared at the woman who stood framed in the side window this one was a brunette with dense brown hair skimming between her jawline and shoulders in a stylish swing she was perhaps six full inches taller than malorys compact fivefour and had the lush curves to match the height both were set off with trim black pants and a kneelength jacket worn over a snug white top she held a champagne flute in one hand and extended the other as she walked across the room malory saw that her eyes were deep dark brown and direct her nose was narrow and straight her mouth wide and unpainted the faintest hint of dimples fluttered in her cheek when she smiled im dana dana steele malory price nice to meet you great jacket thanks i was pretty relieved when i saw you drive up its a hell of a place but i was getting a little spooked rattling around by myself its nearly quarter after she tapped the face of her watch youd think some of the other guests would be here by now wheres the woman who met me at the door rowena dana pursed her lips as she glanced back toward the archway she glides in and out looking gorgeous and mysterious im told our host will be joining us shortly who is our host your guess is as good as mine havent i seen you dana added in the valley possibly i manage the gallery for the time being she thought thats it ive come to a couple of showings there and sometimes i just wander in and look around avariciously im at the library a reference librarian they both turned as rowena walked in though glided in malory thought was a better description i see youve introduced yourselves lovely what can i get you to drink miss price ill have what shes having perfect even as she spoke a uniformed maid came in bearing two flutes on a silver tray please help yourselves to the canapгs and make yourselves at home i hope the weather isnt keeping your other guests away dana put in rowena merely smiled im sure everyone whos expected will be here shortly if youll excuse me just another moment okay this is just weird dana picked a canapг at random discovered it was a lobster puff delicious but weird fascinating malory sipped her champagne and trailed her fingers over a bronze sculpture of a reclining faerie im still trying to figure out why i got an invitation since they were there and so was she dana sampled another canapг no one else at the library got one no one else i know got one for that matter im starting to wish id talked my brother into coming with me after all hes got a good bullshit barometer malory found herself grinning you dont sound like any librarian ive ever known you dont look like one either i burned all my laura ashley ten years ago dana gave a little shrug restless moving toward irritated she tapped her fingers on the crystal flute im going to give this about ten more minutes then im booking if you go i go id feel better heading back into that storm if i drove to the valley behind someone else same goes dana frowned toward the window watched the rain beat on the other side of the glass crappy night and it was an extremely crappy day driving all the way here and back in this mess for a couple of glasses of wine and some canapгs just about caps it you too malory wandered toward a wonderful painting of a masked ball it made her think of paris though shed never been there except in her dreams i only came tonight in hopes of making some contacts for the gallery job insurance she added lifting her glass in a mock toast as my job is currently in a very precarious state mine too between budget cuts and nepotism my position was adjusted my hours trimmed back to twentyfive a week how the hell am i supposed to live on that and my landlord just announced that my rents going up first of next month theres a rattle in my carвђand i spent my automaintenance budget on these shoes dana looked down pursed her lips terrific shoes my computer crashed this morning enjoying herself malory turned away from the painting and raised a brow at dana i called my bosss new wife a bimbo and then spilled latte on her designer suit okay you win in the spirit of good fellowship dana stepped over and clinked her glass against malorys what do you say we hunt up the welsh goddess and find out whats going on around here is that what the accent is welsh gorgeous isnt it but be that as it may i thinkвђ she trailed off as they heard that distinctive click of high heels on tile the first thing malory noticed was the hair it was black and short with thick bangs cut so blunt they might have required a ruler beneath them the tawny eyes were large and long making her think of waterhouse again and his faeries she had a triangular face glowing with what might have been excitement nerves or excellent cosmetics the way her fingers kneaded at her little black bag malory went with the nerves she wore red stoplight red in an abbreviated dress that clung to her curvy body and showed off terrific legs the heels that had clicked along the tile were a good four inches high and sharp as stilettos hi her voice was breathy and her gaze was already flicking around the room um she said i should come right in join the party such as it is dana steele and my equally baffled companion this evening malory price im zoe mccourt she took another cautious step into the room as if she was waiting for someone to tell her thered been a mistake and boot her out again holy cow this place its like a movie its um beautiful and all but i keep expecting that scary guy in the smoking jacket to come in vincent price no relation malory said with a grin i take it you dont know any more about whats going on than we do no i think i got invited by mistake butвђ she broke off ogling a bit when a servant entered with another flute on a tray ahвђ thanks she took the crystal gingerly then just smiled down at the bubbling wine champagne it has to be a mistake but i couldnt pass up the chance to come where is everybody else good question dana angled her head charmed and amused as zoe took a small testing sip of champagne are you from the valley yes well for the last couple years three for three malory murmured do you know anyone else who got an invitation for tonight no in fact i asked around which is probably why i got fired today is that food just to take you got fired malory exchanged a look with dana three for three carlyвђshe owns the salon where i work worked zoe corrected herself and walked toward a tray of canapгs she heard me talking about it with one of my customers and got bent out of shape boy these are terrific her voice had lost its breathiness now and as she appeared to relax malory detected the faintest hint of twang anyway carlys been gunning for me for months i guess the invite seeing as she didnt get one put her nose out of joint next thing i know shes saying theres twenty missing from the till i never stole anything in my life bitch she took another more enthusiastic gulp of champagne and then bam im out on my ear doesnt matter its not going to matter ill get another job i hated working there anyway god it mattered malory thought the sparkle in zoes eyes that had as much fear to it as anger said it mattered a great deal youre a hairdresser yeah hair and skin consultant if you want to get snooty im not the type who gets invited to fancy parties at fancy places so i guess its a mistake considering malory shook her head i dont think someone like rowena makes mistakes ever well i dont know i wasnt going to come then i thought it would cheer me up then my car wouldnt start again i had to borrow the babysitters you have a baby dana asked hes not a baby anymore simons nine hes great i wouldnt worry about the job but ive got a kid to support and i didnt steal any goddamn twenty dollarsвђ or twenty cents for that matter im not a thief she caught herself flushed scarlet sorry im sorry bubbles loosening my tongue i guess dont worry about it dana rubbed a hand up and down zoes arm you want to hear something strange my job and my paycheck just got cut to the bone i dont know what the hell im going to do and malory thinks shes about to get the axe at her job really zoe looked from one face to the other thats just weird and nobody we know was invited here tonight with a wary glance toward the doorway malory lowered her voice from the looks of things were it im a librarian youre a hairdresser she runs an art gallery what do we have in common were all out of work malory frowned or the next thing to it that alone is strange when you consider the valleys got a population of about five thousand what are the odds of three women hitting a professional wall the same day in the same little town next were all from the valley were all female about the same age twentyeight twentyseven dana said вђњtwentysixвђtwentyseven in december zoe shivered this is just too strange her eyes widened as she looked at her halfempty glass and she set it hastily aside you dont think theres anything in there that shouldnt be do you i dont think were going to be drugged and sold into white slavery danas tone was dry but she set her glass down as well people know were here right my brother knows where i am and people at work my boss his wife your exboss malory said to zoe your babysitter anyway this is pennsylvania for gods sake not i dont know zimbabwe i say we go find the mysterious rowena and get some answers we stick together right dana nodded at malory then zoe zoe swallowed honey im your new best friend to seal it she took danas hand then malorys how lovely to see you their hands were still joined as they turned and looked at the man who stood in the archway he smiled stepped inside the room welcome to warriors peak for a moment malory thought one of the warriors from the gate had come to life he had the same fierce male beauty in his face the same powerful build his hair black as the storm waved back in wings from that strong sculpted face his eyes were midnight blue she felt the power of them a flash of heat along her skin when they met hers she wasnt a fanciful woman anything but she told herself but the storm the house the sheer ferocity of that gaze made her feel as though he could see everything in her mind everything that had ever been in her mind then his gaze left hers and the moment passed i am pitte thank you for gracing what is for now our home he took malorys free hand lifted it to his lips his touch was cool the gesture both courtly and dignified miss price she felt zoes fingers go lax on hers then pitte was moving to her lifting her fingers in turn miss mccourt and danas miss steele chapter two a boom of thunder had malory jolting and her hand groped for zoes again he was just a man she assured herself it was just a house and someone had to get everything back on an even keel you have an interesting home mr pitte she managed yes wont you sit ah rowena youve met my companion he took rowenas arm when she came to his side they fit malory decided like two halves of a coin by the fire i think rowena said gesturing toward the fireplace such a fierce night lets be comfortable i think wed be more comfortable if we understood whats going on dana planted her highheeled boots and stood her ground why we were asked here certainly but the fires so lovely theres nothing quite like good champagne good fellowship and a nice fire on a stormy night tell me miss price what do you think of what youve seen of our art collection impressive eclectic with a glance back at dana malory let rowena lead her toward a chair near the fire you must have spent considerable time on it rowenas laugh rippled like fog over water oh considerable pitte and i appreciate beauty in all its forms in fact you could say we revere it as you must given your choice of profession art is its own reason yes its the light in every shadow and pitte we must make certain miss steele sees the library before the evenings over i hope youll approve she gestured absently at the servant who entered with a crystal champagne bucket what would the world be without books books are the world curious cautious dana sat i think theres been a mistake zoe hung back looking from face to face i dont know anything about art not real art and booksвђi mean i read butвђ please sit pitte nudged her gently into a chair be at home i trust your son is well she stiffened and those tawny eyes went tigerbright simons fine motherhoods a kind of art dont you think miss mccourt a work in progress of the most essential most vital kind one that requires valor and heart do you have children no i havent been given that gift his hand brushed rowenas as he spoke then he lifted his glass вђњto life and all its mysteries his eyes gleamed over the rim of the glass вђњtheres no need to fear no one here wishes you anything but health happiness and success why dana demanded you dont know us though you seem to know a great deal more about us than we do about you youre a seeker miss steele an intelligent straightforward woman who looks for answers im not getting any he smiled its my fondest hope that youll find all the answers to begin id like to tell you a story it seems a night for stories he settled back like rowenas his voice was musical and strong faintly exotic the sort malory thought designed for telling tales on stormy nights because of it she relaxed a little what else did she have to do after all besides sit in a fantastic house by a roaring fire and listen to a strange handsome man weave a tale while she sipped champagne it beat eating takeout while reconciling her checkbook hands down and if she could wheedle a tour of the place and nudge pitte toward the gallery as a vehicle to expand his art collection she might just save her job so she settled back as well and prepared to enjoy herself long ago in a land of great mountains and rich forests lived a young god he was his parents only child and well beloved he was gifted with a handsome face and strength of heart and muscle he was destined to rule one day as his father before him and so he was reared to be the godking cool in judgment swift in action there was peace in this world since gods had walked there beauty music and art stories and dance were everywhere for as long as memoryвђand a gods memory is infiniteвђthere had been harmony and balance in this place he paused to sip his wine his gaze tracking slowly from face to face from behind the curtain of power through the veil of the curtain of dreams they would look on the world of mortals lesser gods were permitted to mix and mate with those of the mortal realm at their whim and so became the faeries and sprites the sylphs and other creatures of magic some found the mortal world more to their tastes and peopled it some of course were corrupted by the powers by the world of mortals and turned to darker ways such is the way of nature even of gods pitte eased forward to top a thin cracker with caviar youve heard stories of magic and sorcery the faerie tales and fantasies as one of the guardians of stories and books miss steele do you consider how such tales become part of the culture what root of truth they spring fromвђќ вђњto give someone or something a power greater than our own to feed our need for heroes and villains and romance dana shrugged though she was already fascinated if for instance arthur of the celts existed as a warrior king as many scholars and scientists believe how much more enthralling more potent is his image if we see him in camelot with merlin if he was conceived with the aid of sorcery and crowned high king as a young boy who pulled a magic sword out of a stone i love that story zoe put in well except for the end it seemed so unfair but i thinkвђ please pitte said go on well i sort of think that maybe magic did exist once before we educated ourselves out of it i dont mean educations bad she said quickly squirming as everyones attention focused on her i just mean maybe we um locked it away because we started needing logical and scientific answers for everything well said rowena nodded a child often tucks his toys in the back of the closet forgetting the wonder of them as he grows to manhood do you believe in wonder miss mccourt i have a nineyearold son zoe replied all i have to do is look at him to believe in wonder i wish youd call me zoe rowenas face lit with warmth thank you pitte ah yes to continue the tale as was the tradition upon reaching his majority the young god was sent beyond the curtain for one week to walk among the mortals to learn their ways to study their weaknesses and strengths their virtues and flaws it happened that he saw a young woman a maid of great beauty and virtue and seeing loved and loving wanted and though she was denied to him by the rules of his world he pined for her he grew listless restless unhappy he would not eat or drink nor did he find any appeal in all the young goddesses offered to him his parents disturbed at seeing their son so distressed weakened they would not give their son to the mortal world but they brought the maid to theirs they kidnapped her malory interrupted they could have done rowena filled the flutes again but love cannot be stolen its a choice and the young god wished for love did he get it zoe wondered вђњthe mortal maid chose and loved and gave up her world for his pitte rested his hands on his knees there was anger in the worlds of gods of mortals and in that mystical halfworld of the faeries no mortal was to pass through the curtain yet that most essential rule was now broken a mortal woman had been taken from her world and into theirs married to and bedded by their future king for no reason more important than love whats more important than love malory asked and earned a slow quiet look from pitte some would say nothing others would say honor truth loyalty others did and for the first time in the memory of the gods there was dissension rebellion the balance was shaken the young godking crowned now was strong and withstood this and the mortal maid was beautiful and true some were swayed to accept her and others plotted in secret there was a whip of outrage in his voice and a sudden cold fierceness that made malory think of the stone warriors again battles fought in the open could be quelled but others were devised in secret chambers and these ate at the foundation of the world it came to pass that the godkings wife bore three children three daughters demigoddesses with mortal souls on their birth their father gifted each with a jeweled amulet for protection they learned the ways of their fathers world and of their mothers their beauty their innocence softened many hearts turned many minds for some years there was peace again and the daughters grew to young women devoted to each other each with a talent that enhanced and completed those of her sisters he paused again as if gathering himself they harmed no one brought only light and beauty to both sides of the curtain but there remained shadows one coveted what they had that no god could claim through sorcery through envy despite all precautions they were taken into the halfworld the spell cast plunged them into eternal sleep a living death and sleeping they were sent back through the curtain their mortal souls locked in a box that has three keys not even their fathers power can break the locks until the keys turn one by two by three the daughters are trapped in an enchanted sleep and thensouls weep in a prison of glass where are the keys malory asked and why cant the box be opened by enchantment since it was locked by it where they are is a puzzle many magicks and spells have been cast to unlock the box all have failedвђbut there are clues the souls are mortal and only mortal hands can turn the keys my invitation said i was the key malory glanced at dana and zoe got nods of confirmation what do we have to do with some mythological legend i have something to show you pitte rose gestured toward the archway i hope it interests you the storms getting worse zoe sent a wary look toward the windows i need to start home please indulge me well all leave together malory gave zoes arm a reassuring squeeze lets just see what it is he wants to show us first i hope youll invite me back at some point she continued as she walked to the doorway to join pitte and rowena id very much like to see more of your art collection and perhaps repay the favor by giving you a private tour of the gallery youll certainly be welcome back pitte took her arm lightly and led her down the wide hall it would be a pleasure for rowena and me to discuss our collection with someone who understands and appreciates it he turned toward another archway i hope youll understand and appreciate this particular piece of it over another fireplace that roared with flame was a painting that towered to the ceiling the colors were so vivid so rich the style so bold and strong that malorys art lovers heart took one fast leap the portrait was of three women young beautiful in flowing gowns of sapphire of ruby of emerald the one in blue with golden curls rioting to her waist sat on a bench that circled a pool she held a small gold harp seated on the silver tiles at her feet the girl in red had a scroll and quill in her lap and her hand on her sistersвђ for surely they were sistersвђknee beside them the girl in green stood a chubby black puppy in the crook of her arm and a short silver sword at her hip a heartbreak of flowers spilled around them there were trees with jeweled fruit dripping from the branches and in the cerulean sky both birds and faeries were on the wing enthralled malory was halfway across the room for a closer look when her heart gave another harder knock the girl in blue had her face younger she thought as she came to an abrupt halt certainly more beautiful the skin was luminous the eyes deeper bluer the hair more luxurious and romantic but there was no mistaking the power of the resemblance nor she saw as she steadied herself the resemblance between the others in the portrait and the other two guests at warriors peak magnificent work a masters work malory said and was amazed at how calm her voice sounded through the buzzing in her ears they look like us there was wonder in the words as zoe moved beside malory how can they good question and suspicion in danas how did the three of us come to be used as models for what is obviously a portrait of the three sisters in the story you just told us it was painted before you were born before your parents your grandparents and those who sired them were born rowena walked toward the portrait stood below it with her hands folded at her waist its age can be verified through tests isnt that so malory yes its approximate age can be authenticated but whatever its age you havent answered zoes question the smile that spread on rowenas face seemed to hold both approval and amusement no i havent what else do you see in the painting malory reached in her purse took out a pair of blackframed rectangular glasses she slipped them on and made a more thorough study a key in the right corner of the sky it seems to be a bird until you look closely a second one there on the branch of a tree almost hidden by the leaves and fruit and the third just visible under the surface of the pool theres a shadow there in the trees in the form of a man maybe a woman just the hint of something dark watching them another shadow just sliding onto the silver tile at the edge a snake ah and here in the far background she lost herself in the painting forgot herself and stepped up onto the hearth theres a coupleвђa man and a womanвђembracing the woman is robed richly with the purple symbolizing a woman of rank and the man is garbed like a soldier a warrior theres a raven in the tree just above them a symbol of impending doom just as the sky here is darker with storm lights a threat the sisters are unaware of the threat they look forward grouped together the crown of their ranks glinting in the sunlight that washes this area of the foreground theres a sense of companionship and affection between them and the white dove here on the edge of the pool is their purity each wears an amulet the same shape and size with the jewel reflecting the color of their gown they are a unit yet individuals its magnificent work you can almost see them breathe you have a discerning eye pitte touched rowenas arm as he nodded at malory its the prize of the collection and still dana pointed out you havent answered the question magick couldnt break the spell that locked the souls of the kings daughters in a box of glass sorcerers were called and wizards and witches from all the worlds but no magicks could unbind the curse so another was cast in this world in every generation three women are born who will come together in one place at one time they are not sisters they are not gods but mortal women and they are the only ones who can release the innocents and you want us to believe that were those women danas brows arched there was a tickle in her throat but it didnt feel like laughter that we just happen to look like the women in this painting nothing just happens and whether you believe or not changes little pitte held out his hands toward them you are the chosen and i am charged to tell you well youve told us so nowвђ and to make you this offer he continued before dana could finish you will each have in turn one phase of the moon to find one of the three keys if within the twentyeight days the first fails the matter is done if the first succeeds the seconds time begins but if the second fails within her time the matter is done if all three keys are brought to this place before the end of the third moon you will be given a boon what sort of boon zoe asked one million dollars each get out of town dana snorted then stared at her two companions oh come on ladies this is just screwy easy for him to toss money around like confetti when wed be off on some wildgoose chase for a trio of keys that dont exist in the first place and if they didвђ her eyes brilliant zoe turned toward dana if they did wouldnt you want a chance to find them the chance for that kind of money what chance its a great big world out there how do you expect to find a little gold key you will be given each in turn a guide rowena gestured to a small chest this we can do if all agree you may work together in fact we hope that you will you must all agree if one refuses the challenge its done if all accept the challenge and the terms youll each be given twentyfive thousand dollars it remains yours whether you fail or succeed wait a minute wait a minute malory held up a hand then pulled off her glasses wait a minute she repeated youre saying if we agree to look for these keys just to look for them we get twentyfive k free and clear the amount will be deposited in an account of your choosing immediately pitte stated oh my god zoe clasped her hands oh my god she repeated and sat down heavily this has got to be a dream a scam you mean whats the catch dana questioned whats the fine print if you fail any one of you the penalty for all will be a year of your lives what like in jail malory demanded no rowena motioned to a servant to enter with a coffee cart a year of your life will not exist poof dana snapped her fingers like magic the keys exist not in this house rowena murmured but in this world this place this we are able to do more we are not allowed to say although we may offer a little guidance the quest isnt simple so you will be rewarded for the attempt should you succeed the reward is greater should you fail there is penalty please take this time to discuss it pitte and i will give you some privacy they walked out of the room and rowena turned back to slide the wide pocket doors shut this dana said as she plucked a tiny cream puff from the dessert tray is a nuthouse and if either of you is actually considering playing along with these fruitcakes you belong in this nuthouse let me just say one thing malory poured a cup of coffee stirred in two lumps of sugar twentyfive thousand dollars each you dont really believe theyre going to plunk down seventyfive large because we say oh sure well look for the keys the ones that unlock the box holding the souls of a trio of demigoddesses malory debated over a mini гclair only one way to find out they look like us ignoring the coffee and pastries zoe stood beneath the painting staring up so much like us yes they do and thats just creepy dana nodded when malory held up the coffeepot why paint the three of us together that way weve never met before tonight and the idea of somebody watching us taking pictures or sketches or whatever so they could put this portrait together spooks me it wasnt something painted on a whim or quickly malory handed dana the coffee cup its a masterpieceвђ the skill the scope the detail someone poured himself or herself into that piece someone with incredible talent and it took an incredible amount of work if this is a scam its an elaborate one plus whats the point im broke you dana puffed out her cheeks close enough ive got some savings zoe put in but im going to go through them pretty quick if i dont get another job and fast i dont know a lot about it but it doesnt look like these people would be after the little bit of money weve got agreed you want some coffee thanks she turned back to them and spread her hands look you all dont know me and youve got no reason to care but i could really use this money zoe came forward вђњtwentyfive thousand would be like a miracle security for my son a chance maybe to do what ive always wanted have my own little salon all we have to do is say yes so we look for some keys its not illegal there are no keys dana insisted what if there are zoe put her cup down without drinking i have to say the idea of twentyfive thousand dollars really helps open my mind to possibilities and a million she gave a quick baffled laugh i cant even think about it it makes my stomach hurt itd be like a treasure hunt malory murmured it could be fun god knows it could be profitable twentyfive thousand would really close the gap for me and thats a very practical priority just now i might be able to have my own place too not like the gallery but just a little place that spotlights artists and craftspeople it was a full ten years before that was due in the order of her life plan but she could be flexible nothings that simple nobody hands you money because you say youll do something dana shook her head theres got to be more under all this maybe they believe it the story malory added if you believed it twentyfive thousand would be chump change were talking souls here unable to help herself she looked back at the portrait a souls worth more than twentyfive thousand dollars excitement bounced inside her like a bright red ball shed never had an adventure certainly not a paying adventure theyve got money theyre eccentric and they believe it the fact is going along with it sort of feels like were the ones pulling the scam but im going to get over that youll do it zoe grabbed her arm youre going to do it its not every day you get paid to work for the gods come on dana loosen up danas brows drew together her forehead forming a stubborn vertical line between them its asking for trouble i dont know where or how but it just feels like trouble what would you do with twentyfive thousand malory purred it then offered another cream puff invest what i could so i could have my own little bookstore her sigh was wistful and a sign that she was weakening id serve tea in the afternoons wine in the evenings have readings oh boy its strange how were all having a job crisis and that the thing we all want is to have our own place zoe sent a wary look at the portrait again dont you think its strange no more strange than being here in this fortress and talking about going on a treasure hunt well im in a fix dana muttered i say no it kills it for both of you saying yes makes me feel like an idiot i guess im an idiot yes with a hoot of laughter zoe threw her arms around dana this is great this is amazing take it easy chuckling dana patted zoe on the back i guess this is the time to pull out the right quote one for all and all for one i got a better one malory picked up her cup again lifted it in a toast show me the money as if on cue the doors opened rowena entered first shall we sit weve decided to accept theвђ zoe trailed off looked at dana the challenge yes rowena crossed her legs youll want to look over the contracts contracts malory echoed naturally a name has power the writing of ones name the promise of it is necessary for all once youre satisfied well select for the first key pitte took papers out of a desk handed one set to each woman theyre simple i believe and cover the terms already discussed if youll write in where you wish the money to be sent it will be done doesnt it matter to you that we dont believe in them malory lifted a hand toward the portrait youll give your word that youll accept the terms thats enough for now rowena told her pretty straightforward for such an odd business dana commented and promised herself she would take the contract to a lawyer the next day to see if it was binding pitte handed her a pen as you are straightforward if and when your turn comes i know youll do all you can lightning sizzled along the window glass as the contracts were signed then countersigned you are the chosen rowena said as she rose again now its in your hands pitte he walked back to the desk picked up a carved box inside are three disks one has a figure of a key the one who chooses that disk begins the quest i hope its not me with a shaky laugh zoe wiped her damp palms on her skirt im sorry im just really nervous she closed her eyes reached into the box keeping the disk clutched in her fist she looked at malory and dana lets all look at the same time okay fine here goes dana reached in kept the disk palmed against her side as malory reached for the final one okay they stood in a circle facing each other then held out the disks wow malory cleared her throat lucky me she whispered as she saw the gold key etched into the white disk she had selected you are the first rowena said walking to her your time starts at sunrise tomorrow and ends at midnight on the twentyeighth day thereafter but i get a guide right a map or something rowena opened the small chest and withdrew a paper which she offered to malory she then spoke the words written on it you must seek beauty and truth and courage one alone will never stand two without the third is incomplete search within and know what you have yet to know find what the dark covets most search without where the light conquers shadows as love conquers sorrow silver tears fall for the song she makes there for it springs from souls look beyond and between see where beauty blooms and the goddess sings there may be fear there may be grief but the true heart vanquishes both when you find what you seek love will break the spell and the heart will forge the key and bring it to light malory waited a beat thats it thats supposed to be a clue im so glad i didnt have to go first zoe said waitвђcant you tell me anything else you and pitte already know where the keys are right this is all we are allowed to give you but you have all you need to have rowena laid her hands on malorys shoulders then kissed her cheeks blessings on you later rowena stood letting the fire warm her hands as she stared up at the painting she felt pitte come in to stand behind her turned her face into his hand when he touched her cheek i had higher hopes before they came he told her theyre bright resourceful none are chosen who arent capable yet we remain in this place year by century by millennium dont she turned slid her arms around his waist pressed herself to him dont despair my dearest love before it really begins so many beginnings but never an end he bent his head touched his lips to her brow how this place crowds me weve done all that can be done she laid her cheek on his chest comforted by the steady sound of his heartbeat have a little faith i liked them she added and took his hand as they started toward the doors вђњtheyre interesting enough for mortals he replied as they passed through the archway the roaring fire vanished and the lights snapped off leaving behind a trail of gold in the dark chapter three she couldnt say she hadnt seen it coming and james was certainly gentle even paternal but the boot was the boot however it was administered being prepared even having the miraculous cushion of the twentyfive thousand dollars now tucked away in her accountвђa fact that she had confirmed that morningвђ didnt make being fired any less horrible and humiliating things change james p horace natty as always in his bow tie and rimless glasses spoke in modulated tones in all the years malory had known him shed never heard him raise his voice he could be absentminded occasionally negligent about practicalities when it came to business but he was unfailingly kind even now his face held a patient and serene expression a little like an aged cherub malory thought though the office door was closed the rest of the gallerys staff would know very shortly the outcome of the meeting i like to think of myself as a kind of surrogate father and as such i want only the best for you yes james butвђ if we dont move in some direction we stand still i feel that though this may be difficult for you initially malory youll soon see its the best thing that could happen how many clichгs malory wondered could one man use when lowering the boom james i know pamela and i havent seen eye to eye ill see your clichг and raise you as the new kid on the block shes bound to be a bit defensive while i tend to be territorial im so terribly sorry i lost my temper spilling the coffee was an accident you know id neverвђ now now he waved his hands in the air im sure it was i dont want you to give that another thought water under the bridge but the point is malory pamela wants to take a more active role in the business to shake things up a bit desperation slithered into her belly james she moved everything in the main room jumbled pieces in from the salon she brought fabric inвђgold lame jamesвђand draped it over the deco nude like a sarong not only was the flow interrupted by the placements but the result was well just tacky she doesnt understand art and space sheвђ yes yes his voice never changed pitch his face never altered its placid expression but shell learn and i believe that teaching her will be enjoyable i appreciate her interest in my business and her enthusiasmвђjust as ive always appreciated yours malory but the fact is i really think youve outgrown us here its time for you to stretch yourself broaden your horizons take some risks her throat closed and her voice sounded thick when she managed to speak i love the gallery james i know you do and youre always welcome here i feel its time for me to give you a nudge out of the nest naturally i want you to be comfortable while youre deciding what youd like to do next he took a check out of his breast pocket a months severance should help keep the wolf from the door what will i do where will i go frantic questions flew around her brain like terrified birds вђњthis is the only place ive ever worked which makes my point he set the check on the desk i hope you know how fond i am of you and that you can come to me anytime anytime at all for advice though it would probably be best if we kept that between ourselves pamela is a little annoyed with you just now he gave her an avuncular peck on the cheek a pat on the head then strolled out patient and placid he might be but he was also weak weak and though she hated to admit itвђhated to realize it after all these yearsвђselfish it took a selfish weakness to fire an efficient creative loyal employee on the whim of his wife she knew it was useless to cry but she cried a little anyway as she stood in the small office that shed decorated herself and boxed up her personal things her lifetime careerwise fit into a single storage box that was efficient again practical and malory decided pathetic everything was going to be different now and she wasnt ready she had no plan no outline no list for what came next she wouldnt be getting up tomorrow eating a light sensible breakfast dressing for work in the outfit carefully selected tonight day after day without purpose without plan stretched out in front of her like some bottomless canyon and the precious order of her life was strewn somewhere down there in the void it terrified her but marching along with the fear was pride so she repaired her makeup and kept her chin up her shoulders back as she carried the box out of the office and down the stairs she did her best to muster up a smile when tod grist rushed to the base of the stairs he was short and trim clad in his signature black shirt and pants two tiny gold hoops glinted in his left earlobe his hair was a shoulderlength streakyblond which malory had always envied the angelic face that it framed drew middleaged and elderly ladies like the sirens song drew sailors hed started at the gallery the year after malory arrived and had been her friend confidant and bitching partner ever since dont go well kill the bimbo a little arsenic in her morning latte and shes history he grabbed at the storage box mai love of my life you cant leave me here i got the boot a months severance a pat on the head and a pack of homilies she fought to keep the tears from blurring her vision as she looked around the lovely wide foyer the streams of filtered light spilling over the glossy oak floor god what am i going to do tomorrow when i cant come here aw baby here give me that he took the box gave her a little nudge with it outside so we can blubber im not going to blubber anymore but she had to bite her lip when it quivered i am he promised and kept nudging until she was out the door he set the box down on one of the iron tables on the pretty covered porch then flung his arms around her i cant stand it nothings going to be the same without you here who will i gossip with wholl soothe my broken heart when some bastard breaks it you notice this is all about me he made her laugh youll still be my best bud right sure i will youre not going to do something crazy like move to the city he eased back to study her face or fall in with bad companions and work in a strip mall gift shop a lead weight landedвђkaboomвђin her stomach those were the only two reasonable choices she had if she was going to make a living but because he looked as if he might cry she waved them away to bolster him perish the thought i dont know what im going to do exactly but ive got this thingвђ she thought of her odd evening and the key ill tell you about it later ive got something to keep me occupied for a while thenвђ i dont know tod everythings out of kilter maybe she was going to blubber a little after all nothings the way its supposed to be so i cant see how it will be getting fired was not in the malory price life plan its just a blip he assured her james is in some sort of sexual haze he could still come to his senses you could sleep with him he added inspired i could sleep with him i have one thing to say to both of those suggestions ick profound and true how about if i come by tonight bring you chinese and a cheap bottle of wine youre a pal well plot putrid pamelas demise and plan your future want me to walk you home sweetie pie thanks but ill be fine give me time to clear my head say goodbye toвђ everybody i just cant face it now dont you worry she tried not to worry as she walked home she tried to ignore the panic that dogged her with every step she took away from routine and closer to that wide wide canyon she was young educated hardworking she had money in the bank her whole life was ahead of her like blank canvas all she had to do was choose her paints and get on with it but right now she needed to think of something else anything else she had a month to decide and an intriguing task to perform in the meantime it wasnt every day you were asked to find a mysterious key and play a part in saving souls she would play along with that until she figured out the rest of her life shed given her word after all so shed best get started on keeping it somehow right after she went home and buried her sorrows in a pint of ben and jerrys as she came to the corner she looked back mistily miserably toward the gallery who was she kidding that had been home on a long sigh she took a step and landed hard on her butt whatever had collided with her sent her box of possessions flying then fell on top of her she heard a grunt and what sounded like a yip with the breath knocked out of her and what felt like a minor mountain pressing on her chest she stared up into a hairy black face even as she fought for the breath to scream an enormous tongue rolled out and slurped her face moe stop heel get the hell off jeez jesus im sorry malory heard the voice the light panic in it as she gagged and turned her head to try to avoid the tongue abruptly the huge black mass pinning her down grew arms then a second head this one was human a great deal more attractive than the first despite the sunglasses that slid down a sharp straight nose and the grim set to the mouth are you all right are you hurt he shoved the massive weight away then squeezed his body between them like a defensive wall can you sit up the question was moot as he was already pulling her from her ungainly sprawl to a sitting position the dog tried to nose in but was elbowed back you lie down you big sloppy idiot not you he added with a quick charming grin as he brushed malorys hair back from her face im sorry hes harmless just clumsy and stupid whatвђ what is it moes a dog or thats the rumor we think hes a cross between a cocker spaniel and a woolly mammoth im really sorry my fault i wasnt paying enough attention and he got away from me she slid her gaze to the right where the dog if it was a dog was hunkered down thumping a tail as thick as her arm and looking as innocent as anything that homely could manage you didnt hit your head did you i dont think so she found moes owner staring at her with a quiet intensity that made heat rush over her skin what she was as pretty as a bakeryshop pastry all that tumbled blond hair the topcream skin the rosy bottomheavy mouth that was in a sexy little sulk her eyes were big blue and beautiful despite the temper flames shooting out of them he nearly licked his lips when she scowled at him and lifted her hand to shove it through that terrific tangle of hair what are you staring at just making sure you dont have little xs in your eyes you went down pretty hard great eyes by the way im flynn and im tired of sitting on the sidewalk do you mind oh yeah he stood took both her hands in both of his and pulled her to her feet he was taller than shed realized and she automatically stepped back so she didnt have to tip her face up to keep an eye on him the sun was streaming over his hairвђa lot of thick wavy brown hair with hints of chestnut his hands were still clasping hers firmly enough that she felt the ridge of callus on them you sure youre all right steady you went down pretty hard im aware of that painfully aware in the portion of her anatomy that had hit the sidewalk first she crouched and began gathering what had spilled out of the box ill get this stuff he crouched beside her then stabbed a finger at the dog who was trying to inch his way toward them with the same stealth as an elephant tiptoeing across the african plain stay or theres no treat for you just get your dog i dont need any help here she snatched up her emergency cosmetic bag tossed it in the box and when she saw that shed chipped a nail she wanted to curl into a ball of selfpity and wail instead she selected the temper button you have no business being out on a public street with a dog of that size if you cant control him hes just a dog he doesnt know any better but youre supposed to youre right youre absolutely right umвђ this must be yours he held out a strapless black bra mortified malory grabbed it out of his hand stuffed it in the box go away now go very very far away listen why dont you let me carry thatвђ carry your silly dog she snapped and hefting the box strode away with as much dignity as she could muster flynn watched her go as moe lumbered over to press his considerable weight against his masters side absently flynn patted the massive head and enjoyed the indignant sway of feminine hips in a short skirt he doubted that run in her stocking had been there before her encounter with moe but from his perspective it did nothing to detract from a pair of great legs pretty he said aloud as she slammed into a building halfway down the block and pretty steamed he glanced down at the hopefully grinning moe nice job jerkface after a hot shower a change of clothes and a medicinal bowl of cookie dough ice cream malory headed for the library she hadnt made any firm arrangements with herвђshe supposed they were her partnersвђthe night before as she was the first she would have to be in charge they needed to have some sort of meeting to go over the clue to plot out a plan of action she didnt hold out any real hope of winning a million dollars but she wasnt going to shrug it off or go back on her word she couldnt remember the last time shed actually been in the library for some reason going in made her feel like a student again full of naivetг hope and an eagerness to learn the main area wasnt large and the tables were mostly unoccupied she saw an older man reading the newspaper a few people wandering the stacks a woman with a toddler in tow at the checkout counter the place was so hushed the ringing of a phone was like a shout she glanced toward the sound and the central island of counter dana sat there a phone at her ear while her fingers clicked on a keyboard pleased that she wouldnt have to search the building to find her malory walked over she wagged her fingers as dana nodded at her and finished the call i was hoping youd come by didnt expect you this soon im now a woman of leisure oh sympathy softened danas face you got canned canned booted axed then knocked on my ass by an idiot and his dog on the way home all in all its been a lousy day even with the expansion of my bank account i have to say i didnt believe it those two up on the peak are certifiable lucky for us but still we have to earn it im first up so i figure i need to get started somewhere im ahead of you jan will you take the desk as she rose dana gathered a stack of books from under the counter come with me she told malory theres a nice table by the window where you can work work at what research ive got several books on celtic mythology gods and goddesses lore and legend im going with the celts since rowenas from wales and pittes irish how do you know hes irish i dont he sounded irish at this point i know little or nothing about celtic myths and i figure its the same for you and zoe i dont have a clue dana set the books down with a muffled thud so we need to get one im off in a few hours then i can give you a hand and i can call zoe in if you like malory stared at the stack of books maybe thats a good idea i dont know where to start pick one ill get you a notebook after an hour malory needed an aspirin as well when zoe rushed up to sit at the table beside her she took off her glasses and rubbed her tired eyes good reinforcements she shoved a book across the table im sorry it took me so long i was running errands i bought simon this video game hes been wanting i know i probably shouldnt have spent the money but i wanted to get him something just for fun ive never had so much money in my life she whispered i know i have to be careful with it but if you cant do a little something fun whats the point you dont have to sell me and after youve been at this for a while youll know you earned it welcome to the wacky world of the celts danas probably got another notebook i brought my own out of an enormous bag zoe pulled a fresh notebook thick as a brick and a pack of pencils already sharpened to saber points its sort of like going back to school zoes eager optimism cut through malorys foul mood want to pass notes and talk about boys zoe just grinned and opened a book were going to find that key i just know it by the time dana joined them malory had written reams of notes in the modified shorthand shed developed in college had drained her pen and borrowed two of zoes pencils why dont we move this to my brothers place dana suggested its right around the corner hes at work so he wont be in the way we can spread out a little and you can give me the highlights fine with me stiff from sitting malory got to her feet i can only stay for about an hour i like to be there when simon gets home from school when i can then lets get started these books are on me dana said as she began gathering some up anybody takes one home for personal research i need it back in a timely fashion and in the same condition it was in when you took it she really is a librarian malory tucked books under her arm bet your ass dana led the way out im going to see what i can get off the net and through interlibrary loan i dont know how much were going to get out of books dana slipped on her sunglasses then tipped them down and peered at malory over the tops anything worth anything can be found in books okay now youre heading toward scary library lady what we need to do is figure out the clue without information on the story the characters in it weve got no base weve got four whole weeks zoe put in and dragged sunglasses out of her shoulder bag thats enough time to find out a lot of stuff look in a lot of places pitte said the keys were around here so its not like we have the whole world to worry about around here could mean the valley or the highlands it could mean the entire state of pennsylvania malory shook her head at the sheer scope and disorder pitte and pal left it pretty wide open even if its close by it could be in someones dusty drawer on the bottom of the river in a bank vault or buried under a rock if it was easy somebody else would have found it by now zoe pointed out and the grand prize wouldnt be three million dollars dont be sensible while im crabbing sorry but theres one other thing i was wondering i couldnt sleep last night going over and over the whole evening in my head its all so unreal but even if you set all that aside for a minute even if were optimistic and say you find the key how do we know its your key and not one of the other two interesting malory shifted her load of books as they turned the corner how come the weird twins didnt think of that i figure they did see first you have to say its all real dana shrugged weve all got money in the bank and were walking along with a load of books on celtic myths thats real enough for me if its all real then malory can only find the first key even if the other two were right in front of her she wouldnt find them and we wouldnt either not before its our turn to look dana stopped angling her head as she studied zoe do you really believe all this zoe flushed but gave a careless shrug id like to its so fantastic and important ive never done anything fantastic or important she looked up at the narrow threestory victorian painted a soft slate blue with creamy gingerbread trim is this your brothers house ive always thought it was so pretty hes been fixing it up bit by bit kind of a hobby they started up the brick walk the grass was green and trim on either side but it needed flowers malory thought color and shape and texture and an old bench on the porch next to a big copper pot full of interesting sticks and grasses the house looked lonely without them like a perfectly attractive woman she thought whod been stood up for a date dana took out a key unlocked the door the best i can say about the inside is itll be quiet she stepped in and her voice echoed and private the foyer was empty but for a few boxes shoved into a corner the stairway leading up was a lovely fanciful curve with a griffin head as its newel post the foyer spilled into a parlor where the walls were painted a rich shadyriver green that went well with the warm honeytoned pine of the floor but the walls like the yard were naked there was a huge sofa in the middle of the floor the sort that shouted to malory a man bought me despite the fact that some of the green in it matched the walls it was a hideous plaid clunky of style and too large for the charm potential of the room some sort of crate stood in as a table there were more boxes one of which sat on the hearth of a delightful little fireplace with an ornately carved mantel that she could envision dressing up with a fabulous painting soвђ zoe turned in a circle i guess hes just moving in oh yeah for the last year and a half dana laid her books on the crate hes lived here for over a year it hurt simply hurt malorys heart and his single piece of furniture is this really ugly couch hey you shouldve seen his room at home at least this is neat anyway hes got some halfway decent stuff upstairs thats where he lives theres probably not any food but therell be coffee beer coke anybody diet coke malory asked dana sneered hes a guy right ill live dangerously and have the real thing cokes fine zoe agreed coming up go ahead and sit the couch is an eyesore but its comfortable all this wonderful space wasted malory decided on a man who would actually pay money for something like this she dropped down on the couch okay its comfortable but its still ugly can you imagine living in a place like this zoe turned a quick circle its like a dolls house well a really big dolls house but just as sweet id spend all my free time playing with it hunting for treasures to put in it fussing with paint and fabric so would i malory tilted her head at her very best she thought she would never look as hip and exotic as zoe managed to do in simple jeans and a cotton shirt and shed done the math calculating how old zoe had been when shed had her baby at that same age malory had been shopping for the perfect prom dress and preparing for college and yet here they were together in a largely empty room of a strangers house and having nearly identical thoughts its strange how much we have in common strange too that we live in a relatively small town and never met before last night zoe sat on the opposite end of the couch where do you get your hair done carmines out at the mall вђњthats a good salon hair today here in town where i worked its mostly women who want the same do week after week after week she rolled her big tawny eyes cant blame you for heading out of town youve got great hair did your stylist ever suggest that you take a couple inches off cut instinctively malorys hand went to her hair cut just a couple inches take some of the weight off its a terrific color its mine well i get it punched up a bit she laughed and dropped her hand i get the feeling youre looking at my hair the way im looking at this room wondering just what i could do with it if i had a free hand cokes and cookies dana brought in a trio of cans and a bag of storebought chocolate chip cookies so what have we got so far i didnt find anything that mentions three daughters of a young god and a mortal woman malory popped the top and sipped though she would have preferred a glass and some ice jesus this stuff is so sweet when youre not used to it i also didnt find anything about trapped souls or keys a lot of strangelooking names like lug and rhianna ami danu tales of battlesвђvictories and death she took out her notebook flipped it open to the first neatly arranged page one look at it had danas dimples popping out i bet you were an a student all the way through school honor roll deans list fucking the curve for the rest of the class why youre too organized not to be you made an outline and everything she snatched the notebook turned pages and time lines charts shut up laughing at herself malory grabbed the notebook back as i was saying before being snickered at for my organized research style celtic gods dieвђthey appear to pop back but they can actually be killed and unlike what i know about the gods in greek and roman mythology these dont live on some magic mountaintop they inhabit the earth live among people lots of politics and protocol dana sat on the floor anything that could be a metaphor for the keys if there was it was over my head artists were gods and warriors zoe added or the other way around i mean artвђmusic storytelling all thatвђwas important and there were mothergoddesses motherhood was important and the number three so its like malorys the artistвђ it was a quick and painful twist in malorys heart no i sell art you know art zoe said like dana knows books i know about being a mother thats good dana beamed at her that gives each of us our role in this pitte said beauty truth courage in the painting maloryвђlets simplify by calling them by our names for nowвђmalory was playing an instrument musicartbeauty i was holding a scroll and quillвђbookknowledgetruth and zoe had the sword and the puppy innocenceprotectioncourage which means malory demanded we could say the first key your key is somewhere that has to do with art and or beauty that goes along with the clue great ill pick it up on my way home malory nudged a book with her toe what if they just made it up the whole story i refuse to believe they made the whole thing up just to have us scrambling around looking for keys thoughtfully dana bit into a cookie no matter what we believe they believe its true so theres got to be some root some basis for this legend or myth or story they told us last night if theres a root its in a book somewhere actuallyвђ zoe hesitated then went on the book i was reading talked about how a lot of the celtic mythology and legends didnt get written down they were passed orally those damn bards dana muttered look pitte and rowena heard it somewhere and whoever told them heard it from someone else the information is out there and information is my god maybe what we have to do is get information on pitte and rowena who the hell are they malory spread her hands where do they come from where do they get the kind of money that allows them to pass it out like cupcakes youre right annoyed with herself dana blew out a breath youre absolutely right and i shouldve thought of that before it happens i know somebody who can help us with that while were looking into the myth she glanced toward the doorway as she heard the front door open and here he comes now they heard a thud a slam a scramble and a curse it was just familiar enough to have malory pressing her fingers to her temples holy mother of god even as she spoke the huge black dog raced in his tail swung like a demolition ball his tongue lolled and his eyes went bright as stars as he spotted malory he let out a series of earshattering barks then leaped into her lap chapter four flynn saw three things when he charged into the room after his dog his sister sitting on the floor laughing like a lunatic a sharplooking brunette standing at the end of the couch heroically trying to dislodge moe and to his surprise and delight the woman hed been thinking about for the better part of the day mostly buried under moes bulk and insane affections okay moe down i mean it thats enough he didnt expect the dog to listen he always tried moe never listened but it seemed the right thing to do as he gripped the dog around the barrel of his belly he had to lean downвђwell maybe not quite as far as he did but she had the prettiest blue eyes even when they were shooting daggers at him hi nice to see you again muscles jumped in her jaw when she clenched it get him off working on it hey moe dana shouted cookie that did the trick moe leaped over the crate nipped the cookie out of the hand dana held in the air then landed it might have been a graceful landing if he hadnt skidded several feet over the uncarpeted floor works like a charm dana lifted her arm moe loped back the cookie already history and insinuated his bulk under it wow hes really a big dog zoe eased over held out a hand then grinned when moe licked it lavishly friendly pathologically friendly malory brushed at the dog hair that had transferred itself to her once pristine linen shirt thats the second time today hes landed on me he likes girls flynn took off his sunglasses tossed them on the crate you never told me your name oh so youre the idiot and his dog shouldve known this is malory price dana said and zoe mccourt my brother flynn are you michael flynn hennessy zoe crouched to stroke moes ear looked up at flynn under her bangs m f hennessy with the valley dispatch guilty ive read a lot of your articles and i never miss your column i liked the one last week on the proposed ski lift up on lone ridge and the environmental impact thanks he reached down for a cookie is this a book club meeting and will there be cake no but if youve got a minute maybe you could sit down dana patted the floor well tell you what it is sure but he sat on the couch malory price the gallery right not anymore she grimaced ive been in a couple times mustve missed you i dont cover arts and entertainment i see the error of my ways his eyes she noted were the same color as the walls that lazyriver green i doubt we have anything to offer that could complement your decor you hate the couch right hate is much too mild a word its very comfortable he glanced over at zoes comment and smiled its a napping couch you nap your eyes are closed so you dont care what it looks like celtic mythology he read angling his head to read the titles on the books scattered over the crate myths and legends of the celts he picked one up turned it in his hands as he studied his sister what gives i told you i was going to that cocktail party at warriors peak his face went hard the instant the affable smile faded i thought you werent going because i said there had to be something off about that since nobody i talked to got an invitation dana picked up her coke can gave him a mildly interested look do you actually think i listen to you no okay then heres what happened shed barely begun when he turned away from her and those green eyes sharpened on malorys face you got an invitation yes and you he nodded at zoe what do you do zoe right now im an unemployed hairdresser butвђ married no neither are you he said as he looked at malory again no ring no im married vibe how long have the three of you known each other flynn stop doing a damn interview just let me tell you what happened dana started again and this time he boosted a hip off the couch took a notebook out of his back pocket doing her best to appear as if she wasnt the least bit interested in what he was doing malory slid her gaze to the left and down he used shorthand she realized and real shorthand not any sort of bastardized version as she did she tried to decipher it as dana spoke but it made her a little dizzy вђњthe daughters of glass flynn muttered and kept scribbling what without thinking malory reached over and clamped her fingers on his wrist you know this story a version of it anyway since he had her attention he shifted toward her his knee bumped hers my irish granny told me lots of stories why didnt you recognize it malory asked dana she didnt have my irish granny actually were steps dana explained my father married his mother when i was eight or my mother married her father when i was eleven its all point of view he reached up to toy with the ends of malorys hair grinned easily when she batted his fingers aside sorry theres just so much of it its irresistible anyway my granny liked to tell stories so i heard plenty of them this one sounds like вђњthe daughters of glass which doesnt explain why the three of you were invited up to the peak to listen to a faerie tale were supposed to find the keys zoe put in and snuck a peek at her watch youre supposed to find the keys to unlock their souls cool he stretched out to prop his feet on the crate crossed his ankles now its my duty to ask how when and why if youd shut up for five minutes id tell you dana reached for her coke and drained it malory goes first she has twentyeight days starting today to find the first key when she does either zoe or i goes next same drill then the last of us gets her shot wheres the box the box of souls dana frowned as moe deserted her to sniff malorys toes i dont know they must have it pitte and rowena if they dont the keys wont do them any good youre telling me youre buying this miss steepedinreality and youre going to spend the next few weeks looking for keys that open a magic glass box that holds the souls of three goddesses demigoddesses malory nudged moe with her foot to discourage him and it isnt a matter of what we believe its a business deal they paid us twentyfive thousand each dana offered in advance twentyfive thousand dollars get out the moneys been deposited in our bank accounts its been verified forgetting herself malory reached for a cookie moe immediately dropped his heavy head on her knee could you call off your dog not as long as youve got cookies these two people whom you dont know gave each of you twentyfive grand to look for magic keys did they have any beans for sale a golden goose maybe the moneys real malory said stiffly and what if you dont deliver whats the penalty we lose a year youre what indentured to them for a year a year gets taken away from us zoe looked at her watch again she really had to go what year she gave him a blank look well iвђ the last year i guess when were old or this year he said and pushed to his feet or next or ten years back if were being weird which we sure as hell are no that cant be pale now zoe shook her head it cant be from before that would change everything what if its the year i had simon or the year i got pregnant that cant be no it cant because none of this can be he shook his head and looked down at his sister wheres your head dana didnt it occur to you that when you dont come up with the goods these people might hurt you nobody dumps that kind of money on strangers which means youre not strangers to them for whatever reason they know you theyve looked into you you werent there dana said eccentric is definitely apt in their case psychotic isnt besides theres no motive for them to hurt us he spun back to malory no he wasnt affable now she realized but annoyed and working his way rapidly to irate and there is one for them to dump big gobs of money on you ive got to go zoes voice shook as she grabbed her bag i have to get to simon my son she streaked out and dana leaped to her feet nice job flynn very nice job scaring the single mother witless she bolted after zoe hoping to calm her he jammed his hands in his pockets stared hard at malory you scared no but i dont have a nineyearold boy to worry about and i dont believe pitte or rowena wants to hurt us besides i can take care of myself why do women always say that after theyve gotten themselves in a really big jam because men usually come along and make things worse im going to look for the key as i agreed to do we all are so would you she had him there he jingled the change in his pocket considered cooled off what did they tell you would happen if you found the keys the souls would be unlocked and wed each get a million dollars and yes i know how ridiculous that sounds you had to be there when you add that these three goddesses are currently sleeping in crystal beds in a castle behind the curtain of dreams i guess you did have to be there they have a painting of the daughters of glass they look like us its a brilliant painting i know art hennessy and this is no paintbynumbers deal its a goddamn masterpiece it has to mean something his face sharpened with interest who painted it it wasnt signed not that i could see then how do you know its a masterpiece because i know its what i do whoever painted it has an amazing talent and a great love and respect for the subject matter that sort of thing shows and if theyd wanted to hurt us why didnt they do something last night when we were all there dana was there alone with them before i arrived why not bash her over the head and chain her in the dungeon then do the same with me with zoe or drug the wine ive already thought about all that already asked myself all the questions and ill tell you why because they believe everything they told us and this eases your mind okay who are they where do they come from how did they get here why did they come here this isnt exactly mystic central why dont you find out instead of scaring people dana demanded as she returned is zoe okay malory asked her sure shes just great now that she has visions of somebody using her kid as a human sacrifice she punched flynn in the shoulder hey if you didnt want somebody to point out the flaws in the plan you shouldnt have had your party at my place so tell me everything you know about this rowena and pitte he took more notes managing to hold back any scathing comments on the lack of information anybody still got the invitation he took the one malory pulled out of her bag ill see what i can find out did your grandmothers story say anything about where the keys were hidden no just that they couldnt be turned by the hand of the gods which leaves a pretty open field flynn waited until malory left then crooked a finger so dana would follow him into the kitchen as rooms went it was a sad statement with its ancient coppertone appliances whitewithgoldspeckled countertops and fakebrick linoleum floor when are you going to do something about this room its awful all in good time my pretty all in good time he got a beer out of the fridge wagged it at her yeah why not he got out a second popped the tops on the wall opener that was in the shape of a bikiniclad blonde with a toothy grin now tell me what you know about the very sexy malory price of the big blue eyes i just met her last night uhuh he held back the beer women know stuff about women like telepathically the more a woman likes or dislikes another woman the more she knows there have been several scientific studies to verify this phenomenon give or no beer for you she hadnt particularly wanted the beer until hed used it as a hammer why do you want to know about her specifically why not zoe my interest in zoe is more academic i can hardly start the wild and passionate affair i have in mind with malory until i know all her secrets and desires youre going to make me sick flynn he merely tipped up his beer took a long slow sip while holding hers out of reach im not your silly dog wholl beg for cookies im only going to tell you so i can sit back and laugh derisively when she blows you off i do like her she added and held out a hand for the beer she strikes me as smart ambitious openminded without being naive she worked at the gallery just got canned over a dispute with the owners new trophy wife since malory called the new wife a bimbo to her face id say she doesnt always rate high on the tact and diplomacy scale but calls em like she sees em she likes good clothes and knows how to wear themвђspends too much on them which is why she was broke before this mornings windfall shes not currently in a relationship and would like to own her own business you really buried the lead he took a long slow sip so shes not dating anyone and shes gutsy not only does she tell off the bosss wife but she drives alone at night to the spookiest house in western pennsylvania so did i i cant have a mad passionate affair with you sweetie it would just be wrong now there you have made me sick but she smiled when he leaned over and kissed her cheek why dont you move in here for a couple weeks her dark chocolate eyes went baleful stop looking out for me flynn cant do it if i wouldnt move in when i was broke why would i now that im flush you know i like my own space and you do too such as it is and the goblins of warriors peak are not going to come down and spirit me away in the night if they were goblins they wouldnt worry me but because he knew her he eased off how about telling your new pal malory what an amazing man i am all brainy and sensitive and buff you want me to lie to her youre mean dana he gulped down more beer youre just mean when he was alone flynn settled down in his upstairs study he preferred the term study to office as an office meant work no way around it in a study you could well study or nap or read or stare into space thinking long thoughts you could certainly work but it wasnt a requirement hed outfitted the room with a big brawny desk and a couple of wide leather chairs that he thought felt as if you might sink into them until you disappeared he had files as well but he disguised them with manlylooking chests one wall was covered with framed prints of pinup girls from the forties and fifties if all else failed he could kick back study them and pass an enjoyable hour in solitude he booted up his computer stepped over moe who had already flopped in the middle of the floor and pulled a second beer out of the mini fridge hed installed under a work counter hed considered that idea pretty damn clever then he sat rolled his head as a boxer might before a round and got down to some serious surfing if there was anything in the cyberworld about the new residents of warriors peak he would find it as always he got sucked into the sirens song of information his beer went warm one hour passed into two two headed toward three before moe solved the matter by giving the desk chair a push that shot it and flynn halfway across the room damn it you know i hate that i just need a few more minutes but moe had heard that one before and he protested by plopping massive paws and a great deal of body weight onto flynns thighs so maybe well take a walk and if we happen to wander by a certain blondes door we could just stop in and share currently gathered information and if that doesnt work well pick up some pizza so it wont be a complete loss the word pizza had moe tearing to the doorway by the time flynn made it downstairs the dog was by the front door his leash clamped between his teeth it was a nice evening for a walk quiet balmy with his little postcard town basking under the latesummer sun at such moments when the air was soft the breeze fragrant he was glad hed made the decision to take over the dispatch from his mother rather than heading out to make his mark at some bigcity paper a lot of his friends had gone to the city and the woman hed thought he loved had chosen new york over him or hed chosen the valley over her it depended he supposed on your point of view maybe the news here didnt have the scope or the edge of the news in philly or new york but there was still plenty of it and what happened in the valley in the hills and mountains that surrounded it mattered and just now he scented a story that would be bigger and juicier than anything the dispatch had reported in the sixtyeight years since its presses began to run if he could help three women one of whom was a sister he loved very much flirt with an incredibly attractive blonde and expose a major conвђ well that would be a hell of a hat trick you have to be charming he told moe as they approached the trim brick building that hed watched malory enter that morning you act like a dog well never get through the door as a precaution flynn wrapped the leash twice around his fist before going into the twelveunit building he considered it good luck that m price was on the ground floor not only would he not have to drag moe up steps or pull him into an elevator but the buildings ground level had little patios that gave him the option of bribing moe with the cookie hed stuffed in his pocket and staking him outside charming he said again sotto voce giving moe a narrow stare before he knocked on malorys door her greeting when she answered wasnt what he could call flattering she took one look at him and moe oh my god youve got to be kidding i can put him outside flynn said quickly but we really need to talk hell dig up my flowers he doesnt dig please god dont dig ive got aвђi cant say the c word or hell get excited but ive got one in my pocket ill just put him out there out of the way i dontвђ moes nose arrowed straight into her crotch christ in defense she skipped back which was all the invitation moe required he was through the door dragging flynn merrily over an antique turkish carpet barely missing slapping his lethal tail into a deco vase filled with latesummer lilies terrified malory made a dash for her patio door yanked it open out out straight out it was a word moe knew and he objected to going out when hed just come in to so many fascinating scents he simply dropped his wide butt on the floor and dug in with dignity no longer an option flynn hooked both hands in moes collar and dragged him bodily across the room and out the door oh yeah that was charming out of breath flynn looped the leash around the trunk of a tree and as moe began to howl he dropped to his knees stop it have you no pride have you no sense of masculine solidarity how am i going to get my hands on that woman if she hates us he pushed his face into moes lie down and be quiet do this for me and the world is yours starting with this he pulled out the cookie the howling stopped instantly and the tail began to thump screw this up and next time i leave you home he stood up and sent what he hoped was an easy smile toward malory who stood warily on the other side of the door he figured it was a major victory when she opened it and let him in have you tried obedience school she demanded ah well yeah but there was an incident we dont like to talk about it this is a great place stylish arty and female he decided not delicatelittletrinket female but bolduniquefascinating female the walls were a deep rich rose a strong background for the paintings she favored antiques or reproductions that looked enough like the real thing to pass soft fabrics and sleek sculpture and everything tidy as a shiny new pin it smelled female classily so from the lilies and the dried flower petals that women were forever putting in bowls and he supposed from the woman herself she had music on low what was thatвђ annie lennox crooning slyly about sweet dreams it seemed to flynn that the entire place spoke of very specific very hightoned taste he wandered over to a painting of a woman rising up out of a dark blue pool there was a sense of speed about it of sexuality and of power shes beautiful does she live in the sea or on the land malory arched her brow at least hed asked an intelligent question i think she has yet to choose she pondered him as he wandered around he seemed moreвђ well male she supposed here in her place than he had on the sidewalk or stalking around the largely unfurnished room in his own house what are you doing here first i came because i wanted to see you again why youre really pretty because he found it both relaxing and entertaining to look at her he hooked his thumbs in his front pockets and did just that you might think thats a shallow reason but i like to think its simply basic if people didnt like looking at attractive things we wouldnt have any art how long did it take you to think of that one his grin was fast and appreciative not long at all im pretty quick have you had dinner no but i have plans why else are you here lets do this part first you havent had dinner tomorrow night yet would you like to have dinner with me i dont think thats a good idea because youre annoyed with me or because youre not interested youre pretty annoying those lazyriver eyes flirted not once you get to know me ask anybody no she had a feeling he wouldnt stay annoying hed be entertaining and interesting and trouble plus however attractive he was he was anything but her type ive got enough on my plate without dating a man who has terrible taste in furniture and questionable taste in pets she glanced toward the patio as she said it then couldnt stop the laugh as she saw moes ugly face pressed hopefully against the glass you dont really hate dogs of course i dont hate dogs i like dogs she angled her head to study the furry face i dont think that is a dog they swore he was when i got him from the pound her eyes went soft you got him from the pound aha a chink in the defensive wall he stepped over so they could study moe together he was a lot smaller then i went in to do a story on the shelter and he sort of came well gamboling up to me looked at me like he was saying okay ive been waiting for you to show lets go home i was a goner whats does moe stand for mountain he looks like moe you know moe howard when her face stayed blank flynn sighed women they dont know what theyre missing when it comes to the courageous comedy and wit of the three stooges yes yes we do know what were missing we miss it on purpose realizing they were standing close she took a deliberate step back was there something else i started running down these people you guys are tangled up with liam pitte rowena omeara at least those are the names theyre using why shouldnt those be their names because when i used my incredible skills and talents i found no record of anyone under those names that jibes with the new owners of warriors peak no social security numbers no passport numbers no drivers licenses business licenses no corporate paper trail for this triad at least none that connects to them theyre not american she began then blew out a breath okay no passport numbers maybe you didnt find it yet or maybe theyve used different names to buy the house maybe itll be interesting to find out because right now its looking like they popped out of thin air id like to know more about the daughters of glass the more i know about them the better chance i have of finding the key ill call my grandmother get more details of the legend i can fill you in over dinner tomorrow she considered him then looked back toward the dog he was willing to help and she only had four weeks on a personal front she would keep it simple friendly but simple at least until shed decided what to do about him would that be a table for two or for three вђњtwo all right you can pick me up at seven great and you can go out that way she pointed toward the patio door no problem he walked to the door glanced back you really are pretty he said then eased the door open just enough to squeeze out she watched him unhook the dog watched him stagger under the weight when moe leaped up to lavishly kiss his face she waited until theyd trotted off before she chuckled chapter five malory found zoes little house easily enough it was a tiny box on a narrow stamp of lawn but it had been painted a cheerful yellow with bright white trim a colorful patch of flowers bloomed vigorously along either side of the door even if malory hadnt been sure of the address hadnt recognized zoes car parked at the curb shed have known the house by the boy in the yard tossing a ball high in the air then racing to catch it he looked almost eerily like his mother the dark hair the longlidded eyes in a pixie face he had a slight build clad in ripped jeans and a pittsburgh pirates tshirt when he spotted malory he stood legs apart flipping the ball lightly into the pocket of his glove he had the cautious and somewhat arrogant stance of a boy whod had dont talk to strangers drummed into his head and thought he was old enough smart enough to handle himself with one anyway you must be simon im malory price a friend of your mothers she kept a smile on her face as the boy sized her upвђand she wished she knew more about baseball than that it involved a number of men throwing hitting and trying to catch a ball and running around a field shes in the house i can get her his way of doing so was to trot toward the door and shout mom theres a lady out here to see you moments later zoe opened the screen door stood there wiping her hands on a dish towel somehow despite the baggy shorts old shirt and bare feet she still managed to look exotic oh malory she lifted a hand to fiddle with one of the buttons of her shirt i wasnt expectingвђ if this is a bad timeвђ no no of course not simon this is miss price one of the ladies im going to be working with for a while okay hi can i go over to scotts now i finished mowing the lawn looks great do you want a snack first nuhuh at her arch look he grinned showing a missing tooth and sudden dazzling charm i mean no thanks go ahead then have a good time yes he started to race off then skidded to a halt when she spoke his name in a tone that malory assumed mothers developed through hormonal changes during gestation he rolled his eyes but made sure his back was to zoe as he did then he gave malory a quick and easy smile nice to meet you and all nice to meet you and all too simon he dashed off like an inmate escaping the prison walls hes gorgeous at malorys statement zoes face lit up with pride and pleasure he really is isnt he sometimes ill sneak to the window while hes out in the yard and just look at him hes my whole world i could see that and now youre worried that what weve done could hurt him somehow worrying about simon is part of my job description listen im sorry come in i used to spend saturdays at the salon so i thought id take advantage of having this one off and dig in around here youve got a pretty house she stepped inside the door looked around a very pretty house thanks zoe looked around as well grateful that shed finished buffing up the living room the pillows were plumped on the bright and cheery blue slipcovers of the sofa and the old coffee table shed antiqued was free of dust and held a trio of bottles filled with latesummer daisies snipped from her own little flower bed the rug her grandmother had hooked when zoe herself was a child was freshly vacuumed these are great malory wandered over to look at the framed prints of foreign locales grouped on a wall theyre just postcards i matted and framed i always ask customers to pick me up a postcard when they go on a trip theyre really clever and fun i like to you know put things together find stuff at yard sales or flea markets and haul it home fix it up it makes it yours that way plus it doesnt cost a lot of money ah would you like something to drink i would if im not holding you up no i dont think ive had a saturday off inвђ she skimmed her fingers through her hair ever she decided its nice to be home and to have company malory had a feeling that she was about to be invited to sit down while zoe went back to the kitchen to avoid that she walked over and angled herself toward the doorway did you plant the flowers yourself simon and i did with no choice zoe led the way into the kitchen i dont have any soft drinks sorry but i cant keep them around with simon ive got some lemonade thats great shed obviously caught zoe in the midst of a major kitchen cleaning but still the room exuded the same casual charm as the living area i love this she trailed a finger over the mintgreen paint of a cupboard it really shows what someone can do with imagination taste and time wow zoe took a squat glass pitcher out of the refrigerator thats quite a compliment coming from somebody like you i mean somebody who knows art i wanted to have pretty things but still make a place where simon could run around like a boy and its just the right size for us i dont care about the million dollars she set her company glasses on the counter shook her head boy does that sound stupid of course i care about the million dollars what i mean is i dont need a million i just want enough so were secure i only got into this because it seemed so interesting and because the twentyfive thousand was like a miracle and because that night up at warriors peak was so compelling so dramatic like we were all the stars of our own movie yes zoe let out a laugh as she poured i got caught up in the idea of it all but i never considered not for a minute that wed be taking any kind of risk i dont know that we are im not going to worry about that until we know more but i dont have a child to consider i wanted to come by and say that if you want to back out i understand ive been thinking about it one of the advantages of serious cleaning is its good thinking time do you want to take these out in the back ive got some chairs out there its kind of a nice spot they walked out and it was a nice spotвђthat tidy little yard the two adirondack chairs painted the same sunny yellow as the house and a big shady maple tree once they were seated zoe took a deep breath if pitte and rowena are some kind of lunatics whove targeted us for some reason theres no backing out it wont matter and if they are doing whatever we can to find the keys makes the most sense if theyre not then we should keep our word it sounds like were on the same track im toying with going back up there to talk to them again get another impression in a day or two malory nodded after weвђ i hopeвђfind out a little more i know dana will be zeroing in on the books and flynns already heating up the internet if he finds anything hell tell me at dinner tonight dinner youre going out with flynn apparently malory frowned into her lemonade five minutes after he left my apartment i was wondering how he talked me into it hes awfully cute any guy would look cute beside that big ugly dog and he was flirting with you zoe gestured with her glass so that the ice clinked big time that i got flirting isnt on the agenda for the next few weeks if im going to focus on finding the first key flirting with a cute guys a nice side benefit zoe sighed sat back and wiggled toes that shed painted poppy pink or at least i seem to recall it was from the dim dark past are you kidding surprised malory looked back at zoes sexy faerie face men must hit on you all the time the initial sortie usually stops dead when they find out ive got a kid she shrugged and im not interested in the letsgetnakedandkeepitcasual deal ive been there right now im not interested in the letsgetnakedandmakeitserious deal i have to figure out what im going to do with the rest of my life my current windfall isnt going to last forever but it does give me time to decide if i really want my own business and how to go about it if i do thats something else i was thinking about today im going to have to get back to work but the thought of starting a new job with new people out at the mallвђ zoe puffed out her cheeks and blew a hard breath and the last thing i want is to try to run a salon out of the house nobody takes you seriously when you do that they start thinking hairs your hobby instead of your job plus where you live isnt home anymore and im not taking that away from simon the way it was taken away from me your mother did hair out of your house вђњtrailer zoe shrugged she did the best she could considering we lived a couple miles outside nowhere west virginia my daddy took off when i was twelve and i was the oldest of four thats rough im sorry rough on all of us but like i said she did the best she could im just hoping to do better id say making a pretty house and home for you and your son means youre doing absolutely fine color washed into her face thanks anyway i thought id start scouting around see if i could find a place for rent that i could outfit for a salon if you find one see if you can find a nice storefront for me and my artworks shop with a laugh malory set her glass aside or maybe we should just combine the two and go into business together art and beauty onestop shopping ive got to go she rose im going to swing by and see dana then go home and see if i get a brainstorm over that stupid clue you want to plan for the three of as to get together one day early next week a powwow fine with me as long as we can work around simons schedule we can do that ill call you she didnt know if it qualified as a brainstorm but it was at least a direction malory studied the clue line by line searching for metaphors and hidden meanings double entendres loose connections then she stepped back again to look at it as a whole there were mentions of the goddess and the keys themselves were reputed to unlock imprisoned souls put all that together she decided and you had a sort of religious reference with that in mind she spent the rest of the day going through every church and temple in the valley she came home emptyhanded but she felt shed done something positive with her day she dressed for dinner keeping it simple with a sleeveless black top and black cropped pants topped with a tailored jacket the color of strawberries at exactly seven she was sliding into heeled sandals and preparing to wait in her experience she was the only one who habitually made it a point to be on time so it was a surprise a pleasant one to hear the knock on her door even as she was checking the contents of her purse youre prompt she said to flynn when she opened the door actually i was here ten minutes ago but i didnt want to seem anxious he handed her a small bouquet of baby roses nearly the same color as her jacket you look amazing thanks she eyed him as she sniffed the rosebuds he was cute she thought dog or no dog ill put these in water very nice touch by the way i thought so moe wanted to go for candy but i held out for flowers she stopped hes not out there is he no no hes home making do with kibble and the bugs bunny marathon on the cartoon network moes nuts about bugs i bet she arranged the flowers in a clear glass vase do you want a drink before we go depends can you walk three blocks in those shoes or would you rather drive it i can walk three miles in heels im a professional female cant argue with that and because i cant id like to do what ive been thinking about doing since i landed on top of you he moved in thats what malory would think later when her brain started to function normally again he simply moved into her ran his hands up the sides of her body over her shoulders along her throat then cupped her face in them it was all very slow all very smooth then his mouth was on hers taking its own sweet time somehow she was backed against the counter pressed snugly between it and his body somehow her hands were gripping his hips her fingers digging in and somehow she was sliding into the kiss without a single murmur of protest his fingers threaded back into her hair and he nipped not so playfully at her bottom lip when her breath caught the tone of the kiss changed from flirty warmth to flashing heat whoa wait she managed to catch the fading echo of warning bells ringing in her head but her body stayed plastered against his okay in a minute he needed another minute of her of the taste of her and the feel of her there was more here than hed expected and hed expected quite a punch there was something erotically sharp about the flavor of her as if her mouth was a rare delicacy that hed only just been allowed to sample and something so soft about her texture all those clouds of gilded hair all those lovely curves and dips he gave her lips one last rub with his then eased back she stared at him those blue eyes hed decided were irresistible now wide and wary maybeвђ she hoped the long slow breath would level her voice again maybe we should just start walking now sure he offered a hand and found himself flattered when she not only evaded it but skirted around him to get her purse i figured if i kissed you now i wouldnt be thinking about it all during dinner and lose track of the conversation he went to the door opened it for her the trouble is now that i have kissed you im probably going to be thinking about kissing you again all during dinner and lose track of the conversation so if you notice that my mind wanders youll know where and why you think i dont know why you just said that she walked out into the shimmering evening light with him by saying that youll plant the seed in my head so ill be thinking about you kissing me all through dinner or thats the plan damn youre good if youre quick enough to unravel the dastardly plots of men regarding sex the puzzle of the key ought to be childs play to you youd think so wouldnt you but the simple fact is ive had more experience with the dastardly plots of men regarding sex than i have with puzzles regarding goddesses and mythological spells i dont know whyвђhe caught her hand in his grinned at the sidelong look she sent himвђbut i find that very exciting if i ply you with wine at dinner will you tell me about those experiences there may be some plots ive missed along the way youre going to buy me a martini then well see hed chosen one of the towns prettiest restaurants and had arranged for a table on the back terrace with a view of the mountains by the time she was sipping her martini she was relaxed again id like to discuss the key if i find your attention wandering ill kick you under the table so noted id just like to say one thing first go ahead he leaned toward her breathed deep you smell terrific she leaned toward him i know now would you like to know what i did today she waited a beat then kicked him lightly on the ankle what yes sorry she lifted her glass for another sip to hide her amusement first i went to see zoe she relayed the gist of their conversation pausing when the first course was served the little yellow house flynn nodded as he brought the look of it into his mind used to be dogshit brown shes really fixed it up ive seen the kid in the yard now that i think about it simon he looks just like her its almost spooky now that you mention it i wouldve put that together when i met her if id been able to take my eyes off you for two minutes her lips twitched and damn it she was flattered youve very good at thatвђboth timing and delivery yeah its a gift then i went to see dana at her apartment she was buried in books and brooding вђњtwo of her best things she hasnt been able to track down a version of the daughters of glass story yet but shes working on it then i got this idea goddesses equal worship all the reading ive been doing indicates that a lot of churches were built on pagan worship sites most christian holy days coincide with the early pagan holy days which were based on seasons agriculture that sort of thing so i went to church in fact i went to every church and temple in a twentymile radius thats an interesting connection good clear thinking thats one of my major skills i kept going over and over the clue look within look without singing goddess and so on so i went looking didnt expect to walk in and see the key waiting for me on a pew but i thought maybe id see the symbol of it you know something worked into a stainedglass window or a molding but i didnt it was still a good idea a better one might be to go back to that house and talk to rowena and pitte again maybe want to know what i found out i do he waited while their entrees were served then studied her fish and his steak how do you feel about surf and turf amenable they cut off portions passed them you know this could develop into a serious deal you and me a lot of people are fussy about sharing food i never get that he sampled the steak i mean its food youre supposed to eat it whats the difference if it was on somebody elses plate first thats an interesting element to factor into a potential relationship now what did you find out i talked to my grandmother about the story there were some details i didnt remember clearly first there was dissension in the ranks over the godking making a mortal his queen it was okay to fool around with mortals but he brought her behind the curtain of powerвђor the curtain of dreams its called both and he took her as his wife because of this some of the gods set themselves apart from the young king and his mortal wife established their own rule politics cant get away from it naturally this didnt sit too well with the king there are other stories full of war and intrigue and heroics and that brings us to the daughters beloved by their parents and by those loyal to the king and his wife each had beauty as youd expect and each had powerвђa talent one was an artist one a bard and one a warrior devoted to each other they grew up in the kingdom taught by a young goddess of magic guarded by the kings most trusted warrior god either the teacher or the guard was to be with them at all times to keep them safe from the plots surrounding them in the painting there were two figures a man and a woman in the background they seemed to be in an embrace flynn gestured with his fork then speared more steak that fits with whats coming the kings advisers were campaigning to have the daughters marry three gods of rank from the opposing faction to unite the kingdom again but the selfproclaimed king of the opposing faction didnt like the idea of giving up his throne power had corrupted him and his thirst for more for complete dominance of this lets say netherworld and the mortal one consumed him he wanted to kill the daughters but he knew that if he did all but his most devoted followers would turn against him so he devised a plot and the two who were closest to the daughters aided him by falling in love they betrayed the daughters not purposely he tipped more wine into their glasses by distraction by looking at each other rather than looking after their charges and as the daughters were young women fond of their keepers they made it easy for the lovers to slip away from time to time and one day when they were unprotected the spell was cast their souls were stolen its more than that are you going to eat the rest of that steak hmm she glanced down at her plate no do you want it for moe i go back emptyhanded hell sulk he asked the waiter to box up the leftovers then smiled at malory dessert no just coffee tell me the rest вђњtwo coffees a crгёme brulee and two spoons youll never hold out against the crгёme brulee he said to malory then leaned forward to finish the tale the bad kings a clever guy and a sorcerer he doesnt take heat for slaying innocents and he turns the good kings choices and policy against him if a mortal is fit to be queen if three halfmortals are worthy of rank then let the mortals prove it only mortals can break the spell until thats done the daughters will sleepвђunharmed if mortal women one to represent each daughter can find each of the three keys then the box of souls will be unlocked the daughters souls restored and the kingdoms united and if they fail the most popular version according to my granny has the bad king setting a time limit three thousand yearsвђone millennium for each daughter if the keys arent found and the box unlocked within that time he alone rules both the godworld and the mortal i never understand why anyone wants to rule the world seems like one big headache to me she pursed her lips when the dish of crгёme brulee was set between them flynn was right she decided she wasnt going to be able to hold out against it what happened to the lovers a couple of versions of that too he dipped his spoon in at one end of the dish while malory dipped into the other my grandmothers pick is the one that has the grieving king sentencing the lovers to death but his wife intervened asking for mercy instead of execution banishment they were cast out through the curtain of dreams forbidden to return until they found the three mortal women who would unlock the box of souls and so they wander the earth gods living as mortals in search of the triad who will release not only the souls of the daughters but their own as well rowena and pitte think theyre the teacher and the warrior it pleased him that their conclusions meshed that would be my take youve got a couple of weirdos on your hands malory its a nice faerie tale romantic colorful but when people start casting themselves and others in the roles youre edging into psychoville youre forgetting the money no im not the money worries me seventyfive thousand means its not a game to them not a little roleplaying entertainment theyre serious either they actually believe the myth or theyre seeding the ground for a con she toyed with another spoonful of the crгёme brulee with the twentyfive thousand i now have approximately twentyfive thousand two hundred and five dollars which includes the twenty i found in a jacket pocket this morning my parents are fairly average middleclass people theyre not rich or influential i dont have any rich or influential friends or lovers ive got nothing worth conning maybe theyre looking for something else something you havent thought of but back to those lovers for a minute do you have any poor ones she sipped her coffee measuring him over the rim the sun had set while theyd had dinner now it was candlelight that flickered between them not at the moment heres a coincidence neither do i im in the market for a key flynn not a lover youre assuming the key exists yes i am if i didnt assume that i wouldnt bother to look for it and i gave my word i would ill help you find it she set her cup down again why a lot of reasons one im just a naturally curious guy and however this thing works out its an interesting story he skimmed a fingertip over the back of her hand and the little thrill danced straight up her arm two my sisters involved three ill get to be around you the way i figure it you wont be able to hold out against me any more than you could hold out against the crгёme brulee is that confidence or conceit just fate sweetie look why dont we go back to my place andвђ well hell i wasnt thinking about kissing you again until you gave me that snotty look now ive lost my train of thought im not having any trouble following that train okay that wasnt my track but im willing to jump on board what i was going to say was we could go back and do some research i can show you what ive got so far which is basically nothing i cant dig up any data on your benefactors at least not under the names they used to buy the peak or any variations of those names ill leave the research to you and dana for now she shrugged ive got some other trails to follow such as logic goddesses there are a couple of new age shops in the area im going to check them out then theres the painting im going to find out who painted that portrait see what else he or she has done and where those paintings might be who owns them how they acquired them i need to take another trip up to warriors peak have another talk with pitte and rowena and get another look at that painting a better look ill go with you theres a story here malory this could be a huge scam which would make it big news and my duty to report it she stiffened up you dont have any proof that rowena and pitte arent legitimateвђpossibly loony yes but not crooks easy he held up a hand for peace im not writing anything until i have all the facts i cant get all the facts until i meet all the players i need an entree to that house youre it in exchange you get the benefit of my keen investigative skills and dogged reporters determination i go with you or i talk dana into taking me up there she tapped a finger on the table while she considered her options they might not talk to you in fact they may not like it that weve brought you into this even on a peripheral level leave that part to me getting into places where im not wanted is part of my job description is that how you got into my apartment last night ouch why dont we run up there tomorrow morning i can pick you up at ten all right what harm could it do to have him along thereвђs no need to walk me all the way to the door malory said as they approached her apartment building sure there is im just an oldfashioned guy no youre not she muttered it as she opened her purse for her key im not asking you in okay she slanted him a look as they stepped up to the door you say that like youre an affable easygoing man youre not that either its a ploy he grinned it is yes youre stubborn and pushy and more than a little arrogant you get away with it because you put on that big charming smile and that iwouldnthurtafly demeanor but theyre just tools to help you get what you want god you see right through me watching her he twirled a lock of her hair around his finger now i either have to kill you or marry you and being appealing on some screwy level doesnt make you less annoying therein lies the flaw at those words he caught her face in his hands and crushed his lips enthusiastically to hers the heat shot straight up from her belly and seemed to burst out the top of her head neither does that she managed she shoved her key in the lock pushed the door open then shut it in his face half a beat later she yanked it open thanks for dinner he rocked gently on his heels when the door shut in his face a second time when he strolled away he was whistling and thinking malory price was the kind of woman who made a mans life really interesting chapter six dana gulped down her first cup of coffee while standing naked in her tiny kitchen eyes closed brain dead she drained it hot black and strong before letting out a soft whimper of relief she downed half the second cup on the way to the shower she didnt mind mornings mainly because she was never awake enough to object to them her routine rarely varied her alarm buzzed she slapped it off then rolled out of bed and stumbled into the kitchen where the automatic coffeemaker already had the first pot ready one and a half cups later her vision was clear enough for a shower by the time she was done her circuits were up and running and she was too awake to sulk about being awake she drank the second half of the second cup and listened to the morning news report while she dressed for the day with a toasted bagel and her third cup of coffee she settled down with her current breakfast book shed turned only the second page when the knock on her door interrupted her most sacred of rituals damn it she marked her place her annoyance faded a little when she opened the door to malory arent you the brightandearly girl sorry you said you were working this morning so i thought youd be up and around by now up anyway she leaned on the jamb a moment and studied the minute green checks of the soft cotton shirt that precisely matched the color of malorys pleated trousers just as the dovegray slides she wore exactly matched the tone and texture of her shoulder bag do you always dress like that dana wondered like what perfect with a little laugh malory looked down at herself im afraid so its a compulsion looks good on you too ill probably end up hating you for it come on in anyway the room was a compact informal library books stood or were stacked on the shelves that ran along two walls from floor to ceiling sat on the tables like knickknacks trooped around the room like soldiers they struck malory as more than knowledge or entertainment even more than stories and information they were color and texture in a haphazard yet somehow intricate decorating scheme the short leg of the lshaped room boasted still more books as well as a small table that held the remains of danas breakfast with her hands on her hips dana watched malorys perusal of her space shed seen the reaction before no i havent read them all but i will and no i dont know how many i have want coffee let me just ask this do you ever actually use the services of the library sure but i need to own them if i dont have twenty or thirty books right here waiting to be read i start jonesing thats my compulsion okay ill pass on the coffee thanks i already had a cup two and im wired вђњtwo and i can just manage to form complete sentences bagel no but go ahead i wanted to catch you before you left for work fill you in fill away dana gestured to the second chair at the table then sat to finish her breakfast im going back up to warriors peak this morning with flynn danas lip curled i figured hed horn in and hit on you are either of those things a problem for you no hes smarter than he comes across thats one of the ways he gets people to spill their guts to him if he hadnt horned in id have baited him until he helped out as for hitting on you i had to figure hed go for either you or zoe flynn really likes women and they really like him malory thought of the way hed moved in on her in her kitchen the way shed gone pliant as putty when he had theres a definite chemical reaction there but i havent decided if i like him or not dana crunched on her bagel might as well give in to it hell just wear you down which is another thing hes really good at hes like a damn border collie excuse me you know how they herd sheep she used her free hand zagging it right and left to demonstrate how they keep heading them off working them around until the sheep end up going where the collie wants them to go thats flynn youll think nope i want to go over here and hes thinking well youll be better off over there so you end up over there before you realize youve been herded she licked cream cheese off her finger and the hell of it is when you find yourself there you almost always realize you are better off he stays alive by never saying i told you so shed gone to dinner with him hadnt she malory considered kissed himвђtwice three times if she was going to be technical and he was not only coming with her to warriors peak he was driving her huh i dont like being maneuvered danas expression was a combination of pity and amusement well well see how it goes she rose gathering her dishes what are you hoping for with rowena and pitte i dont expect to get much from them its the painting malory followed dana into the little kitchen it didnt surprise her to find books here as well stacked in an openfronted pantry where the average cook would have stored food staples the paintings important somehow she continued while dana rinsed off the dishes what it says and who said it she took a moment to explain the rest of the tale as flynn had relayed it to her over dinner so theyre taking on the roles of the teacher and the guard thats the theory malory confirmed im interested in how theyll react when i broach it and i can use flynn to distract them long enough to give me time to get another look at the painting and take a couple of pictures of it that could lead to other paintings with similar themes it might be helpful ill do a search on mythological art this morning dana checked her watch ive got to go the three of us should get together on this as soon as we can lets see what we come up with today they walked out together and malory stopped on the sidewalk dana is it just crazy to do all this damn right call me when you get back from the peak it was a more pleasant if less atmospheric drive on a sunny morning as a passenger malory could indulge herself with the scenery and wonder what it was like to live high on a ridge where the sky seemed only a hand span away and the world was spread out like a painting below a fitting view for gods she supposed lofty and dramatic she had no doubt rowena and pitte had chosen it for its power as much as for the privacy in another few weeks when those elegantly rolling hills felt the chill of fall the colors would stun the eye and catch the breath mists would hover in the morning sliding into those folds and dips between the hills spreading like sparkling pools until the sun dissolved them and still the house would stand black as midnight with its fanciful lines etched against the sky guarding the valley or watching it what did it see she wondered year after year across the decades what did it know the question brought on a shudder a sudden sharp sense of dread cold she shook her head and rolled down her window all at once the car seemed hot and stuffy no im spooking myself thats all if you dont want to do this nowвђ i want to do it im not afraid of a couple of rich eccentrics in fact i liked them and i want to see the painting again i cant stop thinking about it whatever direction my mind goes off in i keep coming back to the painting she glanced out her window into the deep leafy woods would you want to live up here nope intrigued she looked back at him that was fast im a social animal i like having people around moe might like it he gazed into the rearview mirror to see moe nose jammed into the narrow window opening floppy ears flying i cant believe you brought the dog he likes to ride in the car she angled around studied moes blissful expression obviously have you ever considered getting him clipped so his hair isnt in his eyes dont say clipped flynn winced as he muttered the word were still not over the whole neutering deal he slowed as they drove along the wall that edged the estate then stopped to study the twin warriors who flanked the iron gate they dont look friendly i camped up here a couple of times with some friends when i was in high school the house was empty then so we climbed over the wall did you go into the house there wasnt enough courage in a sixpack of beer for that but we had a hell of a time freaking ourselves out jordan claimed he saw a woman walking on the parapet or whatever you call it swore he did he wrote a book about her later so i guess he saw something jordan hawke flynn added you mightve heard of him jordan hawke wrote about warriors peak he called itвђ phantom watch i read that book as a ripple of fascination raced up her spine she stared through the bars of the gates of course he described it all perfectly but then hes a wonderful writer she looked back at flynn suspiciously youre friends with jordan hawke since we were kids he grew up in the valley i guess we were sixteenвђme jordan and bradвђsucking down beers in the woods slapping mosquitoes the size of sparrows and telling very inventive lies about our sexual prowess its illegal to drink at sixteen malory said primly he shifted and even through the shaded lenses of his sunglasses she could see his eyes laughing really what were we thinking anyway ten years later jordans got his first bestseller and brads off running the family empireвђthat would be lumber and the homemakers chain for bradley charles vane iv and im planning on heading to new york to be a hotshot reporter for the times her eyebrows winged up you worked for the new york times no i never went one thing and another he said with a shrug lets see what i can do about getting us through this gate even as he started to step out of the car the gate opened with a kind of otherworldly silence that sent a chill dancing along the nape of his neck must really keep it lubed he murmured and i guess somebody knows were out here he slid back behind the wheel and drove through the house looked just as strange and stark and stunning in daylight as it had in a night storm there was no magnificent stag to greet her but the flag with its key emblem flew high and white and rivers of flowers ran below gargoyles clung to the stone and looked to malorys mind as if they were considering leaping not so playfully on any visitor i never got this close in the daylight slowly flynn stepped out of the car its spooky yeah but in a good way its terrific like something you expect to see on a cliff above a raging sea too bad theres no moat that would really top it off wait until you see the inside malory moved up beside him and didnt object in the least when flynn took her hand the tickle at the back of her throat made her feel foolish and female i dont know why im so nervous she caught herself whispering it then her hand jerked in flynns when the big entrance door opened rowena stood framed in the towering doorway she wore simple gray pants with a roomy shirt the color of the forest her hair spilled over her shoulders her lips were unpainted her feet bare but however casual the outfit she managed to look exotic like some foreign queen on a quiet holiday malory caught the glint of diamonds at her ears how lovely rowena held out a hand on which rings sparkled elegantly how nice to see you again malory and youve brought me such a handsome surprise flynn hennessy hes danas brother welcome pitte will be right along hes just finishing up a call she gestured them inside flynn had to resist gawking at the foyer it doesnt seem like the kind of place youd find telephones rowenas chuckle was low almost a purr we enjoy the advantages of technology come well have tea we dont want to put you to any trouble malory began but rowena waved her off guests are never any trouble how did you find out about warriors peak missвђ rowena she slid an arm silkily through flynns as she walked them to the parlor you must call me rowena pitte always has an ear to the ground for an interesting spot you travel a lot we do yes for work or pleasure without pleasure theres little point in work she trailed a fingertip playfully down his arm wont you sit ah heres the tea malory recognized the servant from her first visit she brought the tea cart in silently and left the same way what business are you in flynn asked oh we do a bit of this and that and some of the other milk she asked malory as she poured honey lemon a little lemon thank you i have a lot of questions im sure you do as does your very attractive companion how do you like your tea flynn blacks fine so american and what is your business flynn he took the delicate cup she offered his gaze was direct and suddenly very cool im sure you already know you didnt pick my sisters name out of a hat you know everything you need to know about her and that would include me yes rowena added both milk and honey to her own tea rather than looking insulted or chagrined she looked pleased вђњthe newspaper business must be very interesting so much information to be gathered and dispersed i imagine it takes a clever mind to know how to do both well and here is pitte he entered a room flynn thought like a general measuring the field gauging his ground outlining his approach however genial his smile flynn was certain there was a steely soldier behind it miss price what a pleasure to see you again he took her hand brought it to within an inch of his lips in a gesture that seemed too fluid not to be natural thanks for seeing us this is flynnвђ yes mr hennessy he inclined his head how do you do well enough our friends have questions and concerns rowena told him as she passed the cup of tea shed already prepared naturally pitte took a seat youre wondering i imagine if wereвђ he turned that mildly curious look to rowena lunatics she supplied then lifted a plate scones ah yes lunatics pitte helped himself to a scone and a generous dollop of clotted cream i can assure you were not but then again so would i if we were so thats very little help to you tell me miss price are you having second thoughts about our arrangement i took your money and gave you my word his expression softened very slightly yes to some that would make little difference it makes all the difference to me that could change flynn put in depending on where the money comes from are you implying we could be criminals now temper showed in the flush that swept rowenas iceedged cheekbones it shows considerable lack of courtesy to come into our home and accuse us of being thieves reporters arent known for their courtesy and neither are brothers when theyre looking out for their sisters pitte murmured something quiet and foreign skimmed his long fingers over the back of rowenas hand the way a man might soothe a cat who was about to spit and claw understood it happens ive some skill in monetary matters the money comes to us through perfectly legal means were neither lunatics nor criminals who are you malory demanded before flynn could speak again where do you come from what do you think pitte challenged softly i dont know but i think you believe you represent the teacher and the warrior who failed to protect the daughters of glass an eyebrow arched slightly youve learned more since you were here last will you learn more yet i intend to you could help me were not free to help in that way but i will tell you this not only teacher and warrior but companions and friends to those precious ones and so only more responsible its only a legend the intensity in his eyes dimmed and he leaned back again it must be as such things are beyond the limits of your mind and the boundaries of your world still i can promise you the keys exist where is the box of souls flynn asked him safe could i see the painting again now malory turned to rowena id like flynn to see it of course she rose and led the way into the room dominated by the portrait of the daughters of glass malory heard flynn catch his breath then they were moving together closer to the painting its even more magnificent than i remembered can you tell me who painted this someone rowena said quietly who knew love and grief someone who knows malory and my sister and zoe mccourt rowena let out a sigh youre a cynic flynn and a suspicious one but as youve put yourself in the role of protector ill forgive you for it we dont wish malory dana or zoe any harm quite the opposite something in her tone made him want to believe her its pretty disconcerting to see my sisters face up there youd do whatever needed to be done to keep her safe and well i understand that kind of loyalty and love i admire and respect it shes in no danger from me or pitte i can swear that to you he turned now zeroing in on what hadnt been said but from someone else lifes a gamble was all rowena said your teas getting cold she turned toward the door just as pitte stepped to it there seems to be a very large very unhappy dog of some sort outside the temper and sharp words hadnt ruffled flynn a bit but that single statement made him wince hes mine you have a dog the change in rowenas tone was almost girlish everything about her seemed to go light and bright then bubble out as she gripped flynns hand he calls it a dog malory said under her breath flynn merely gave her a sorrowful look before speaking to rowena you like dogs yes very much could i meet him sure ah while youre introducing rowena and pitte to moe at their peril could i take a minute to freshen up casually malory gestured toward the powder room i remember where it is of course for the first time since malory had met her rowena seemed distracted she already had a hand on flynns arm as they started down the hall what kind of a dog is he thats debatable malory slipped into the powder room and counted to five slowly heart pounding she opened the door a crack and did her best to peer up and down the corridor moving quickly now she dashed back to the portrait dragging out the little digital camera in her purse as she ran she took half a dozen fulllength shots then some of smaller details with a guilty look over her shoulder she shoved the camera back into the purse and pulled out her glasses a plastic bag and a small palette knife with her ears buzzing she stepped up on the hearth and carefully gently scraped flakes of paint into the bag the entire process took less than three minutes but her palms were slick with sweat her legs loose and wobbly by the time shed finished she took another moment to compose herself then strolledвђwith what she hoped was casual easeвђout of the room and out of the house the instant she stepped outside she stopped dead there was the regal and magnificent rowena sitting on the ground with a mountain of dog sprawled over her lap and she was giggling oh hes wonderful such a big sweetheart what a good boy you are she bent her head and nuzzled moes fur his tail beat like a jackhammer what a kind pretty boy she looked up at flynn and beamed did he find you or did you find him it was sort of mutual one dog lover recognized another tucking his thumbs in his pockets flynn scanned the expansive lawns the slices of woods big place like this lots of room to run you could have a pack of dogs yes well rowena lowered her head again and rubbed moes belly we travel considerably pitte laid a hand on rowenas hair stroked it how long do you plan to stay here when the three months is up well move on to that will depend a ghra yes yes rowena cuddled moe another moment then with a wistful sigh got to her feet youre very lucky to have such goodness in your life i hope you treasure him i do i see you do yes you may be cynical and suspicious but a dog like this knows a good heart yeah flynn agreed i believe that i hope youll bring him if you come back he can run goodbye moe moe sat up and lifted one massive paw with unaccustomed dignity wow thats a new one flynn blinked as moe politely allowed rowena to shake his paw hey mal did you seeвђ as he said her name moes head swiveled and he was off at a sprint in malorys direction bringing a distressed yip to her throat as she braced for the onslaught rowena called out a single indecipherable word in a calm brisk tone moe skidded to a halt inches from malorys feet plopped onto his butt and once more lifted his paw well malory expelled a relieved breath thats more like it she reached down obligingly shook the offered paw good for you moe how the helld you do that flynn wanted to know i have a way with animals ill say what was that gaelic mmmm funny that moe would understand a command in gaelic when he mostly ignores them in plain english dogs understand more than words she held out a hand for flynns i hope youll all come back we enjoy company thanks for your time malory walked to the car with moe trotting happily beside her the minute she sat she tucked her purse on the floor like a guilty secret rowena laughed but the sound was a bit watery as moe stuck his head out of the backseat window she lifted a hand in a wave then leaned against pitte as flynn drove away i have real hope she murmured i cant remember the last time i felt real hope iвђit frightens me it actually frightens me to feel it pitte wrapped an arm around her drew her tighter to his side dont weep my heart foolish she dashed a tear away вђњto cry over a strangers dog when we get homeвђ he shifted her cupped her face in his hands his tone was gentle yet somehow urgent when we get home youll have a hundred dogs a thousand one will do she rose on her toes to brush her lips across his in the car malory let out a long long breath i take that sound of relief to mean you got the pictures i did i felt like an international art thief i guess i have to give moe points for being the main distraction so tell me what you thought of them theyre slick smart and full of secrets but they dont seem crazy theyre used to moneyвђreal money used to drinking tea out of antique cups brought in by a servant theyre educated cultured and a little snobby with it the place is full of stuffвђfancy stuff theyve only been here a few weeks so they didnt furnish those rooms locally they had it shipped in i should be able to track that frowning he tapped his fingers on the steering wheel she went goony on moe what she turned into a puddle the minute she saw him i mean hes got a lot of charm but she melted i have this impression of her from inside cool confident aloof the kind of woman whos sexy because she knows shes in charge strolling up madison avenue with a prada bag on her arm or running a board meeting in la power money brains and looks all wrapped up in sex i get it you thought she was sexy last checkup i had a pulse so yeah but you shouldve seen her face when moe jumped out of the car all that polish that sheen just vanished she lit up like christmas morning so she likes dogs no it was more it wasnt the coocheecoo that some fancy women do with dogs it was fall down on the ground roll in the grass and gutlaugh so why doesnt she have one maybe pitte wont have one around flynn shook his head youre more observant than that the guy would slice open a vein for her if she asked him to something strange about the way she got moe to shake hands something strange about the whole deal no argument im going to concentrate on the painting at least until one of us comes up with a different angle ill leave you to try to pin down rowena and pitte ive got to cover a town hall meeting tonight how about we get together tomorrow he maneuvers he herds she remembered danas words and shot him a quick suspicious look define get together ill adjust the definition any way you want ive got four weeksвђless nowвђto find this key im currently unemployed and have to figure out what im going to do at least professionally for the rest of my life i recently ended a relationship that was going nowhere add up all the above and its very clear i dont have time for dating and exploring a new personal relationship hold on a minute he pulled off to the side of the windy road unhooked his seat belt he leaned over took her shoulders and eased her over as far as her own belt would allow while his mouth ravished hers a rocket of heat shot up her spine and left its edgy afterburn in her belly youve ah really got a knack for that she managed when she could breathe again i practice as often as possible to prove it he kissed her again slower this time deeper until he felt her quiver i just wanted you to add that to your equation i was an art major math isnt my strong suit come back here a minute she grabbed his shirt yanked him to her and let herself go everything inside her sparked blood and bone and brain if this was what it meant to be herded she thought dimly she could be flexible about her direction when his hands clenched in her hair she felt a stir of power and anxiety that was as potent as a drug we really cant do this but she was tugging his shirt out of his waistband desperate to get her hands on flesh i know cant he fumbled with the buckle of her seat belt well stop in a minute okay but firstвђ she brought his hand to her breast then moaned as her heart seemed to tip into his palm he shifted her cursed when he rapped his elbow on the steering wheel and moe delighted with the prospect of a wrestling match squeezed his head between the seats and slathered both of them with sloppy kisses oh god torn between laughter and shock malory scrubbed at her mouth i really really hope that was your tongue ditto struggling to get his breath back flynn stared down at her her hair was sexily tousled her face flushed her mouth just a little swollen from the assault of his with the flat of his hand he shoved moes face away and snapped out a curt order to sit the dog flopped back on his seat and whined as if hed been beaten with a club i wasnt planning on moving this fast malory shook her head i wasnt planning on moving at all and ive always got a plan been a while since i tried this in a car parked on the side of the road me too she slid her gaze toward the pathetic sounds coming from the backseat under the circumstancesвђ yeah better not i want to make love with you he drew her up to touch you to feel you move under my hands i want that malory i need to think everything about this is complicated so i have to think about it she certainly had to think about the fact that shed nearly torn the mans clothes off in the front seat of a car on the side of a public road in broad daylight my lifes a mess flynn the thought depressed her enough to have her pulse calming again whatever the equation ive screwed things up and i have to get back on track i dont do well with messy situations so lets slow this down a little he hooked a finger in the v of her blouse how much is a little i dont know yet oh i cant stand it she scooted around leaned over the seat dont cry you big baby she ruffled the fur between moes ears nobodys mad at you speak for yourself flynn grumbled chapter seven i feel the sun warm and somehow fluid like a quiet waterfall gliding from a golden river it pours over me in a kind of baptism i smell roses and lilies and some spicier flower that cuts the sweetness i hear water a playful trickle and plop as it rises up then falls back into itself all these things slide over me or i slide into them but i see nothing but a dense white like a curtain i cant part why am i not afraid laughter floats toward me bright and easy and female theres a youthful cheer in it that makes me smile that brings a tickle of laughter to my own throat i want to find the source of that laughter and join in voices now that quick birdchatter that is again youth and female the sounds come and go ebb and flow am i drifting toward it or away slowly slowly the curtain thins only a mist now soft as silken rain with sunlight sparkling through it and through it i see color such bold rich color it sears through that thinning mist and stuns my eyes tiles are gleaming silver and explode with sunlight in blinding flashes where the thick green leaves and hotpink blossoms of trees dont shade or shelter flowers swim in pools or dance in swirling beds there are three women girls really gathered around the fountain that plays its happy tune its their laughter i hear one has a small harp in her lap and the other a quill but theyre laughing at the wriggling puppy the third holds in her arms theyre so lovely there is about them a touching innocence thats so perfectly suited to the garden where they spend this bright afternoon then i see the sword sheathed at ones hip innocent perhaps but strong there is power here i can feel the tingle of it now sparking on the air and still im not afraid they call the puppy diarmait and set it down so it can romp around the fountain its excited yaps ring like bells i see one girl slide her arm around the waist of another and the third rest her head on the seconds shoulder there they become a unit a kind of triad a whole of three parts that chatter about their new puppy and laugh as he rolls gleefully in the flowers i hear them say names i know somehow know and look as they look in the distance in the shade of a tree that drips down with graceful branches heavy with jeweled fruit are a couple caught in a passionate embrace hes tall and dark and theres a strength to him i can sense might be terrible if roused shes beautiful and very slender but there is about her too a sense of more theyre desperately in love i can feel that need that heat inside me throbbing like a wound is love so painful the girls sigh over it and they wish someday they hope someday they will love like thatвђdesire and romance fear and joy all tied into one consuming entity they will know the taste of a lovers lips the thrill of a lovers touch someday we are all of us caught in that urgent embrace absorbed with our envy and our dreams the sky darkens the colors dim i feel the wind now cold cold as it spins around and around the sudden roar of it screams in my ears blossoms tear from branches petals fly like bright bullets now im afraid now im terrified even before i see the sly black shape of the snake slither over those silver tiles before i see the shadow slink out of the trees and lift high the glass box it holds in its black arms words boom out though i press my hands to my ears to block them i hear them inside my head mark this time and mark this hour when i wield my awful power mortal souls of daughters three forever will belong to me their bodies lie in eternal sleep their souls imprisoned in this glass the spell will hold sure and deep unless these things come to pass three keys to find to fit only by mortal hands to turn three thousand years in which to learn an instant more and souls will burn this test this quest to prove a mortals worthiness with these words i wind them and with my art i bind them these locks i seal and forge these keys and here hurl them to the hand of destiny the wind dies and the air goes still there on those sunwashed tiles the three girls lie their eyes closed as if in sleep their hands clasped three parts of one whole beside them is a glass box its clear panels leaded at the seams its trio of locks glinting gold warm blue lights dance frantically inside it seem to beat against the glass walls like trapped wings three keys lie scattered around it and seeing them i weep malory was still shaky when she opened the door to zoe i got here as soon as i could i had to get simon off to school you sounded so upset on the phone whatвђ danas not here yet id rather just go through this once i made coffee great zoe put a hand on malorys shoulder and simply lowered her into a chair ill get it you look like you still need to catch your breath kitchen that way yeah grateful malory leaned back rubbed her hands over her face why dont you tell me how your date with flynn went the other night what oh good fine she dropped her hands then stared at them as if they belonged to someone else he seems almost normal without his dog that must be dana ill get it just sit zoe hurried out from the kitchen heading malory off before she could rise okay wheres the fire dana demanded then stopped sniffed coffee dont make me beg for it im getting it go sit with malory zoe added under her breath dana plopped down in a chair pursed her lips and gave malory a long hard stare you look terrible thanks so much hey dont expect hugs and kisses when you get me out of bed and over here within twenty minutes and on one cup of coffee besides its reassuring to know you dont roll out of bed looking perfect whats up malory glanced over as zoe came back with three thick white mugs of coffee on a tray i had a dream i was having a damn good one myself i think it involved spike from buffy the vampire slayer and a really big vat of dark chocolate and then you called and interrupted it dana zoe shook her head then sat on the arm of malorys chair a nightmare no at leastвђ no as soon as i woke up i typed it out she rose now and picked up papers from the table ive never had a dream with so much detail before at least ive never remembered details so clearly after i woke up i wrote it down because i wanted to make sure i didnt forget anything but im not going to anyway itll be easier if you both just read it she handed them the typed pages then took her own coffee and paced to the patio doors it was going to be another beautiful day she mused another beautiful latesummer day with clear skies and warm breezes people would walk around town enjoying the weather going about their business their normal everyday chores in the normal everyday world and she would never forget the sound of that dreamwind the feel of that sudden bitter cold wow i can see why this shook you up dana set the pages aside but its pretty clear where it came from flynn told me you guys went up to see the painting again yesterday all of this is on your mind and your subconscious just flipped you into it its scary zoe rushed to finish the last few sentences before she got up walking over she rubbed her hands on malorys shoulders no wonder you were so upset im glad you called us it wasnt just a dream i was there she warmed her chilled hands on the coffee mug as she turned i walked into that painting okay honey take it down a notch or two dana held up a hand youre overidentifying thats all a strong vivid dream can really suck you in i dont expect you to believe me but im going to say out loud whats been in my head since i woke up woke up she remembered shaking with cold with the sound of that terrible wind still ringing in her ears i was there i could smell the flowers and feel the heat then the cold and the wind i heard them screaming she closed her eyes and fought a fresh surge of panic she could still hear them screaming and i felt this this charge in the air this pressure when i woke my ears were still ringing from it they were speaking gaelic but i understood them how could i you just thoughtвђ no she shook her head fiercely at zoe i knew when the storm came when everything went crazy i heard them calling out for their father chi athair sinn father help us i looked it up this morning but i knew how could i know she took a steadying breath their names were venora niniane and kyna how would i know she walked back to sit the relief of saying it all calmed her her pulse leveled as did her voice they were so afraid one minute they were just young girls playing with their puppy in a world that seemed so perfect and peaceful and the next what made them human was being torn out of them it hurt them and there was nothing i could do i dont know what to think about this dana said after a moment im trying to be logical here the paintings drawn you from the first and we know the legend is celtic in origin we look like the girls in the painting so we identify with them how did i know the gaelic how do i know their names dana frowned into her coffee i cant explain that ill tell you something else i know whatever locked those souls away is dark and its powerful and its greedy it wont want us to win the box and the keys zoe interrupted you saw them you know what they look like the box is very simple very beautiful leaded glass a high domed lid three locks across the front the keys are like the logo in the invitations like the emblem on the flag flying on the house theyre small only about three inches long id say it still doesnt make sense dana insisted if they had the keys why hide them why not just hand them to the right people and game over i dont know malory rubbed her temples there must be a reason you said you knew the names they called the couple making out under the tree dana reminded her rowena and pitte malory dropped her hands rowena and pitte she repeated they couldnt stop it either it happened so quickly so violently she took a long long breath heres the kicker i believe it all i dont care how crazy it sounds i believe it all it happened i was taken into that painting through the curtain of dreams and i watched it happen i have to find that key whatever it takes i have to find it after a morning staff meeting that included jelly doughnuts and a pissedoff reporter whod had her article on fall fashion cut by two inches flynn escaped to his office as his staff consisted of fewer than thirty people including the eager sixteenyearold he paid to write a weekly column from the teenage perspective having one reporter in a snit was a major staff glitch he flipped through his messages punched up a feature on valley nightlife approved a couple of photos for the next days edition and checked the accounting on ads he could hear the occasional ring of a phone and even with his door shut the muffled clatter of fingers on keyboards the police radio on top of his file cabinet beeped and hummed the television squeezed between books on a shelf was set on mute he had the window open and could hear the light whoosh of morning traffic the sporadic thump of bass from a car stereo playing too loud now and then he heard a door or drawer slam from the room beyond rhoda the society fashion gossip reporter was still making her annoyance known without looking through the glass he could see her in his mind spitting darts at him she along with more than half the staff had worked for the paper since hed been a boy and plenty of them he knew continued to see the dispatch as his mothers paper if not his grandfathers there were times when he resented it times when he despaired of it and times when it simply amused him he couldnt decide which reaction he was having at the moment all he could think was that rhoda scared the hell out of him the best he could do was not think about it or her and settle in to polish his article on the meeting hed attended the night before a proposed stoplight at market and spruce a debate over the budget and the need to repair the sidewalks on main and a rather spirited argument regarding the highly controversial notion of installing parking meters on main to help pay for those repairs flynn did what he could to inject a little energy into the subject matter and still stay true to the reporters code of objectivity the dispatch wasnt exactly the daily planet he reflected but then again he wasnt exactly perry white nobody around here would ever call him chief even without rhodas periodic snits he wasnt certain that anyone including himself really believed he was in charge his mother cast a very long shadow elizabeth flynn hennessy steele even her name cast a very long shadow he loved her of course he did most of the time he even liked her theyd butted heads plenty when he was growing up but hed always respected her you had to respect a woman who ran her life and her business with equal fervor and expected everyone else to do the same just as you had to give her credit for stepping out of that business when necessity demanded it even if she had dumped it in her reluctant sons lap shed dumped it all including he thought with a wary glance toward rhodas desk surly reporters she was filing her nails instead of working he noted baiting him file away he thought todays not the day we square off you cranky old bat but that day soon will come he was deep into adjusting the layout on page of section b when dana walked in not even a cursory knock no flirtatious little head peek in the door just stomp right in i didnt stomp ive got to talk to you flynn she threw herself into a chair then glanced around wheres moe its backyard day for the moe oh right and maybe you could go by hang out with him for a while this afternoon then maybe you could throw together some dinner so id come home to a hot meal sure thatll happen listen ive had a rough morning ive got a goddamn headache and ive got to finish this layout dana pursed her lips as she studied him rhoda sniping at you again dont look flynn snapped before dana could turn around youll just encourage her flynn why dont you just fire her ass you take entirely too much crap off her shes been with the dispatch since she was eighteen thats a long time now while i appreciate you dropping in to tell me how to handle my employee problems i need to finish this dana just stretched out her endless legs she really stirred you up this time huh fuck it he blew out a breath then yanked open his desk drawer to hunt up a bottle of aspirin you do a good job here flynn yeah yeah he muttered as he dug a bottle of water out of another drawer shut up im serious youre good at what you do as good as liz was maybe better at some areas of it because youre more approachable plus youre a better writer than anybody youve got on staff he eyed her while he washed the aspirin down what brought this on you look really bummed she couldnt stand to see him seriously unhappy irritated confused pissed off or surly was fine but it hurt her heart to see misery etched on his face pleasant valley needs the dispatch and the dispatch needs you it doesnt need rhoda and i bet knowing that just sticks in her craw you think the idea of that smoothed out the raw edges the stickinginthecraw part i mean you bet feel better yeah he capped the water bottle dropped it back in the drawer thanks my second good deed for the day ive just spent an hour at malorys and another twenty minutes wandering around trying to decide if i should dump on you or just keep it between us girls if it has to do with hairstyles monthly cycles or the upcoming red tag sale at the mall keep it between you girls thats so incredibly sexist im not even going toвђ what red tag sale watch for the ad in tomorrows dispatch is something wrong with malory good question she had a dream only she doesnt believe it was a dream dana related the discussion before digging in her bag for the typed account malory had given her im worried about her flynn and im starting to worry about me because shes got me half convinced that shes right quiet a minute he read it through twice then sat back in his chair staring at the ceiling what if she is right exasperation spiked into her voice do i have to start playing scully to your mulder were talking about gods and sorcery and the capture of souls were talking about magic about possibilities and possibilities should always be explored where is she now she said she was going to the gallery to do some research on the painting good then shes sticking with the plan you didnt see her no but i will what about you dig anything up im tugging a few lines okay lets all meet at my place tonight let zoe know ill tell mal when dana frowned at him he only smiled you came to me honey im in it now i really owe you for thisвђ oh sweetheart any day i can do something behind the bimbonazis back is a day of celebration still tod cast a cautious look right and left before he opened the door to what had once been malorys office and was now pamelas domain oh god what has she done to my space hideous isnt it tod actually shuddered its like the walls vomited louis xiv my only satisfaction is that she actually has to look at this when she comes in the room was jammed full the curvy desk the tables the chairs and two tasseled ottomans all vied for space on a rug that screamed with red and gold the walls were covered with paintings overpowered by thick ornate gold frames and statuary ornamental bowls and boxes glassware and whatnots crowded every flat surface each piece malory noted was a small treasure in itself but packing it all together in this limited space made it look like someones very expensive garage sale how does she manage to get anything done she has her slaves and minionsвђmeaning me ernestine julia and franco simone legree sits up here on her throne and gives orders you had a lucky escape mai maybe i did but still it had been a wrench to come through the front door again knowing she no longer belonged not knowing where she belonged where is she now lunch at the club tod checked his watch youve got two hours i wont need that much i need the client list she said as she headed for the computer on the desk oooh are you going to steal clients from under her rhinoplasty no hmm happy thought but no im trying to pin down the artist on a particular painting i need to see who we have that buys in that style then i need our files on paintings with mythological themes damn it shes changed the password its mine she uses your password noвђmine he shook his head she wrote it down so she wouldnt forget itвђafter she forgot two other passwords i happened to ah come across the note i love you tod malory exclaimed as she keyed it in enough to tell me what this is all about more than enough but im in kind of a bind about that a couple of people id have to talk to first she worked fast locating the detailed client list copying it to the disk shed brought with her i swear im not using this for anything illegal or unethical вђњthats a damn shame she chuckled at that then opened her bag to offer him a look at the printout shed made from the digital photo do you recognize this painting hmm no but something about the style exactly something about the style i cant quite place it but its nagging at me ive seen this artists work before somewhere when the file was copied she switched to another put in a fresh disk if you remember give me a call day or night sounds urgent if im not having a psychotic episode it may very well be does this have anything to do with m f hennessy are you working on a story for the paper she goggled where did that come from you were seen having dinner with him the other night i hear everything tod added it doesnt have anything to do with him not directly and no im not writing a story do you know flynn only in my dreams hes very hot wellвђ i think i might be dating him i wasnt going to but i seem to be lip lock several of them rating вђњtop of the scale sex almost but cooler heads prevailed damn plus hes funny and interesting and sweet pretty bossy in a really clever way so you barely notice until youve been bossed smart and i think tenacious sounds perfect can i have him sorry pal but i may have to keep him she snatched out the disk then carefully closed documents and shut down mission accomplished with no loss of life thanks tod she threw her arms around him gave him a big noisy kiss ive got to get to work on this she hunkered down in her apartment systematically going through the data crossreferencing eliminating until she had a workable list by the time she left for flynns shed winnowed the gallerys client list by seventy percent dana was already there when she arrived had dinner no malory looked cautiously for moe i forgot good weve got pizza coming flynns out back with moe for their daily romp youre okay that i told him about your dream yeah we seem to have brought him into this okay go in and flop well have some wine shed barely done so when zoe arrived with simon in tow i hope its all right i couldnt get a sitter i dont need a sitter simon declared i need a sitter zoe hooked an arm around his neck hes got homework so if theres a corner he can use i brought the shackles dana winked at him well use the dungeon can we torture him then feed him pizza weve already hadвђ i could eat pizza simon interrupted then he let out a whoop as moe charged in from the back of the house wow thats some dog simon dontвђ but boy and dog were already rushing together caught in the throes of mutual love at first sight hey flynn look what zoe brought us we get to make him do homework ive always wanted to do that with somebody you must be simon uhhuh this is a great dog mister the dogs moe im flynn zoe can simon take moe back out so they can run around like maniacs for a while sure twenty minutes simon then you hit the books sweet straight out the back flynn told him theres a ball out there with toothmarks and drool all over it he likes you to chase it and fetch it back to him youre funny simon decided lets go moe pizza dana announced when the bell rang want to call him back no hes fine he just finished eating three helpings of spaghetti flynn be a man pay for the pizza why do i always have to be the man then he zeroed in on malory and grinned oh yeah thats why dana sat on the floor with a fresh notebook in her lap lets be organized about this the librarian in me demands it zoe pour yourself some wine we can each report what weve found or thought or speculated on since the last time we got together i havent found much zoe took a folder out of her canvas bag i typed up all my notes though arent you a good girl delighted dana took the folder then pounced on the first box of pizza when flynn dropped two of them on the coffee table im starving вђњtheres news he sat on the sofa beside malory turned her face toward him with his hand then kissed her long and firm hi gee dont i get one of those at zoes question he shifted and leaned toward her but she laughed and gave him a light shove id better settle for the wine if flynns finished kissing girls dana began which wont be until ive drawn my last gasping breath settle down dana ordered we know about mais experience i have the typed report of it here which ill add to the collection of notes and other data ive got more since it was there malory took a slice of pizza from the box and dropped it onto a paper plate i have a list of peopleвђclients through the galleryвђ whove purchased or shown interest in classical and or mythological subject matter in art ive also started a search of like styles but thats going to take some time i intend to start making phone inquiries tomorrow i could help zoe offered i was thinking that maybe we should do a search for paintings that include the element of a key like a theme thats good malory acknowledged and tore a sheet off the roll of paper towels that stood in for napkins ive got some appointments tomorrow but ill work around them ive been working on the clue itself dana picked up her wineglass im wondering if we should take some of the key phrases and do a search on place names like restaurants or shops take the singing goddess for example i didnt find anything on that but its the sort of thing that could be the name of a shop or a restaurant or a site not bad flynn said and helped himself to another slice of pizza ive got some more still she said nothing as she reached into the box herself topped off her wine i put in some internet time running the three names malory heard in herвђ in her dream niniane comes up a few times some legends have her as the sorceress who enchanted arthurs merlin and trapped him in the cave of crystal theres another that has her as merlins mother but when i put her together with the other two i found one hit from this esoteric little site on goddess worship it gives a variation on the daughters of glassвђand calls them by those names those are their names you cant think its a coincidence that i dreamed those names and you found them today no dana said carefully but isnt it possible you came across the same site and the names stuck in your head no i wouldve written it down i wouldve remembered i never heard them before the dream okay flynn patted her knee first ill tell you i havent found any record of a shipping or moving company that serviced warriors peak and no record of any company shipping furniture here for clients under triad they had to get all that stuff in there somehow dana protested they didnt just click the heels of their ruby slippers together just giving you the facts the realestate company didnt make the arrangements for them either at this point i havent found any trail leading rowena or pitte to the peak not saying there isnt one he continued before dana could protest just saying i havent found one through the logical sources i guess we have to look at the illogical ones he shifted to beam at zoe there you go but ive got one more logical step to take who do i know who collects art seriously someone i could use as a source the vanes so i gave my old pal brad a call it so happens hes heading back here in a couple of days brads coming back to the valley dana asked hes taking over the local headquarters for homemakers brads got the vanes passion for art i described the painting to him or started to i wasnt close to being finished when he gave me the title the daughters of glass no that cant be id have heard of it malory pushed herself to her feet and began to pace whos the artist nobody seems to be sure just not possible malory continued a major talent like that id have heard id have seen more of the artists work maybe not according to brad nobody seems to know much about the artist the daughters of glass was last seen in a private home in london where it was by all accounts destroyed during the blitz in chapter eight malory closed herself in her apartment for two days she submerged herself in books telephone calls email it was foolish shed decided to run around chasing a dozen different angles and suppositions betterвђ far betterвђto conduct the search with technology and systematic logic she couldnt function simply couldnt think in disorder which was why she admitted as she carefully labeled yet another file shed failed as an artist art the creation of true art required some mysterious innate ability to thrive in chaos or that was her opinion to be able to see and understand and feel dozens of shapes and textures of emotions at one time then of course there was the little matter of possessing the talent to transfer those emotions onto a canvas she lacked the gift on all levels while the artist of the daughters of glass had it in spades the painting at warriors peak or one done by the same artist was the path she was sure of that now why else did she keep coming back to it why had she somehow in her dreams walked into it why had she been chosen to find the first key she thought if not for her knowledge of and contacts in the art world shed been told to look within and without within the painting or another by the same artist did without mean to look at what surrounded the painting opening a file folder she studied the printout of the painting again what surrounded the daughters peace and beauty love and passionвђand the threat to destroy it as well as she mused the method to restore it a key in the air in the trees in the water she was damn sure she wasnt about to pluck a magic key out of the air or from a tree branch so what did it meant and which of those three was hers too literal perhaps maybe within meant she was to look inside herself to her feelings about the painting both the emotional and the intellectual response where the goddess sings she reflected as she rose from her piles of research to pace no one had been singing in the dream but the fountain had reminded her of music maybe it had something to do with the fountain maybe water was her key and she thought in frustration she might not have left her apartment but she was still running in circles there were only three weeks left her heart jumped at the quick ratatat on her glass patio doors there stood the man and his dog on the other side instinctively she ran a hand over the hair shed yanked back into a ponytail sometime that morning she hadnt bothered with makeup or with changing out of the baggy cotton pants and tank shed slept in not only was she not looking her best but she was pretty sure shed dipped below her personal worst when she opened the door she decided flynn verified that when he took a good hard look at her and said honey you need to get out she felt actually felt her face arrange itself in a sulk im busy im working yeah he glanced at the neat stacks of research materials on her dining room table the pretty coffee carafe and china cup there were small containers all in matching red plastic that held pencils paper clips postits a glass paperweight swirling with ribbons of color anchored a few typed pages a storage box was tucked under the table and he imagined she placed everything that related to her project inside it every night and took it out again every morning it was amazing to him and oddly charming even alone and at work she kept things tidy moe bumped her leg with his snout then gathered himself to leap recognizing the signal now malory stuck out a hand no jumping she ordered and had moe quivering in his desire to obey as a reward she gave him a congratulatory pat on the head i dont have anyвђ dont say it flynn warned dont say any food words he loses his head come on its great out he caught malorys hand in his well go for a walk im working why arent you because its after six and i like to pretend i have a life outside of the newspaper after six she glanced down at her watch remembered she hadnt put it on that morning it was just another sign that the efficient train of her life had jumped its tracks i didnt realize it was so late which is why you need to go for a walk fresh air and exercise maybe but i cant go out like this why not im in my pajamas they dont look like pajamas well they are and im not going out in them and with my hair all horrible and no makeup on theres no dress code for walking the dog still he was a man who had a mother and a sister and he knew the rules but if you want to change well wait heвђd dealt with enough women to know the wait could be anywhere from ten minutes to the rest of his life since hed learned to think of the female grooming process as a kind of ritual he didnt mind it gave him a chance to sit out on the patio with moe flopped over his feet and scribble ideas for articles in his notebook in his opinion time was only wasted if you didnt do something with it if the something was staring off into space and letting the mind drift on whatever current was the strongest at that moment that was fine but since that current was how he might get his hands on malory again he figured it would be more productive all around to channel his energies into work since brad was coming back to the valley the dispatch would need a solid feature on him on the vanes on homemakers the history of the family and their business the face of that business in todays economic climate and any plans for the future he would handle that one himself and combine his professional and personal interests just as he was doing with malory so he began to note down various aspects that described her blond brainy beautiful headed his list hey its a start he said to moe she was picked for a reason and the reason has to have something to do with who or what she is or isnt organized arty he had never met anyone who managed to be both single unemployed huh maybe they should do an article on twenty and thirtysomething singles in the valley the dating scene in smalltown usa if he gave that to rhoda she might start speaking to him again he glanced up when he caught a movement out of the corner of his eye and watched malory walk to the patio door it hadnt taken her as long to transform herself as hed figured it would he got to his feet hooking a hand in moes collar before the dog could leap on malory you look great smell even better and id like to keep it that way she leaned down tapped a finger lightly on moes nose so no jumping why dont we take a drive down to the river then he can run around like crazy she had to give him points hed managed to turn walking the dog into a date and had done it smoothly so smoothly she didnt realize she was on a date until they were sitting on a blanket by the river eating fried chicken while moe raced around barking hopefully at squirrels but it was hard to complain when the air was cool and fresh and the light softening as the sun sank lower in the west when it dropped beneath those peaks everything would go soft and gray and it would be cooler yet she would need the light jacket shed brought alongвђat least she would if they stayed to watch the stars come out and how long had it been since shed watched the stars come out now that she was here she wondered if the enforced hibernation however brief had accomplished anything more than creating a logjam in her mind she wasnt an isolationist she needed contact with people conversations stimuli sound and movement and realizing that only made her understand how much she needed to be part of the workforce again if she grabbed the million dollars at the end of this strange rainbow she would still need to work just for the daytoday energy i have to admit im glad you got me out youre not a cave dweller he dug in the bucket for another drumstick when she frowned at him youre a social animal take dana shes more cave dweller than social animal if you left her alone shed be perfectly happy holed up with mountains of books and a vat of coffee at least for a few weeks then shed need to come up for air me id go nuts after a day or two i need the charge so do you youre right and im not sure how i feel about you figuring that out so soon soons relative ive spent oh about a year thinking about you in the past week given time and energy ratios its been a while since ive given that much thought to a woman in case youre wondering i dont know what im wondering yes i do she corrected why havent you brought up the key or asked me what im doing about finding it because youve had enough of that for now if youd wanted to get into it youd have brought it up youre not shy youre right why did you bring me out here away from town its quiet nice view moe likes it theres the slim chance i can get you naked on this blanketвђ вђњtry slim to none slims enough to keep me going he dipped a plastic fork into the fastfood potato salad and i wanted to see if brads moving in yet he looked across the ribbon of water to the rambling twostory frame house on the opposite bank doesnt look like it you miss him you got that right she plucked a blade of grass ran it idly through her fingers i have some friends from college we were so close and i guess we all thought wed be close forever now were all scattered and hardly see each other once or twice a year if we can all manage it we talk on the phone or through email now and then but its not the same i miss them i miss who we were when we were friends and that telepathy you develop so that you know what the others thinking or what shed do in some situation is it that way for you pretty much he reached over toyed with the ends of her hair in the same absent way she toyed with the blade of grass but we go back to being kids together none of us are big on phone calls maybe because brad and i end up on the phone through most of our workday email does the job jordan hes the email king i met him for about ninety seconds at a book signing in pittsburgh about four years ago all dark and handsome with a dangerous gleam in his eye you want dangerous it made her laugh he was sitting on a ratty blanket eating bucket chicken while his big silly dog barked at a squirrel that was ten feet up a tree then she was flat on her back his body pressed to hers and the laugh died in her throat his mouth was dangerous foolish of her to have forgotten that however affable and easy he appeared on the surface there were storms inside him hot whippy storms that could crash over the unwary before they could think about taking shelter so she didnt think at all but let it rage and let that secret part of herself that part shed never risked exposing slide out and take even as it was taken hows this working for you he murmured as he fixed that amazing mouth on her throat so far so good he lifted his head looked down at her and his heart shuddered in his chest something here some big something here i dont thinkвђ yes you do impatience potent and unexpected snapped out you may not want to thinkвђim not real keen on it myself but you do i really hate using the obvious metaphor but this is like turning a key in a lock i can hear the goddamn click he pushed up dragged an unsteady hand through his hair im not ready to hear any goddamn click she sat up quickly brushed fussily at the front of her shirt it threw her off balance that she could find his temper both irritating and arousing at the same time you think want to hear one ive got enough on my mind right now without you clicking around in my head i need to find the first key ive got to work this out i need to find a job and i dont even want a stupid job i wantвђ what what do you want i dont know she scrambled to her feet there was a fury inside her she didnt know where it came from or where it needed to go turning away she stared at the house across the river folded her arms firmly over her chest and i always know what i want youre one up on me there he rose but didnt go to her whatever was pumping inside himвђanger need fearвђwas too unstable to risk touching her the breeze was playing with the ends of her hair as he had all those tumbling clouds the color of old gold like something out of a painting she looked so slim so perfect standing there half turned away from him while the dying sun shot a thin line of fire along the rise of western hills the only thing ive been absolutely sure i wantedвђ ever he realized is you she glanced back as nervous wings began to stir in her belly i dont imagine im the only woman youve wanted to sleep with no actually the first was joley ridenbecker we were thirteen and that particular desire was never fulfilled now youre making a joke of it im not not really he stepped toward her and his voice was gentle i wanted joley as much as i knew what that meant at thirteen it was intense even painful and kind of sweet eventually i found out what that meant i wanted other women along the way i even loved one which is why i know the difference between wanting a woman and wanting you if it was just sex it wouldnt piss me off its hardly my fault youre pissed off she scowled at him and you dont look or sound as if you are i tend to get really reasonable when im seriously annoyed its a curse he picked up the ball moe spat at his feet then threw it with a strong whiplash of arm and if you think its a joy to be able to see both sides of an argument to see the validity on each end let me tell you its a pain in the ass who was she he shrugged then picked up the ball moe returned threw it again doesnt matter id say it does and that she still does it just didnt work out fine i should be getting back now she walked back to kneel on the blanket and tidy the remains of their impromptu picnic thats a skill i admire and nobody does it like a woman the implied fuck you he explained then shot the ball in the air for moe once more she left me or i didnt go with her depends on your point of view we were together the best part of a year she was a reporter for the local station moved up to weekend anchor then evening anchor she was good and we got to have all these arguments and discussions over the impact and value of our particular news medium which is sexier than it may sound anyway we planned to get married move to new york eventually on the moving part then she got an offer from an affiliate up there she went i stayed why did you stay because im george fucking bailey the ball burst out of his hand again like a rocket i dont understand george bailey giving up his dreams of travel and adventure to stay in his hometown and rescue the old savings and loan im no jimmy stewart but the dispatch sure as hell turned out to be my savings and loan my stepfather danas dad had been ill my mother shifted some of the responsibilities of editor in chief to me i assumed it was temporary until joe got back on his feet but the doctors and my mother wanted him out of the cold winters and they wanted deserved to enjoy a retirement period she threatened that if i didnt take over for her at the paper she would shut it down my mother doesnt make idle threats with a humorless laugh he tossed the ball again you can bet your ass she doesnt a flynn runs the valley dispatch or there is no dispatch michael flynn hennessy she thought so flynn was a family name and a legacy if she knew you wanted something differentвђ he managed to smile she didnt want something different i couldve gone just kicked the dust off my heels and gone with lily to new york and all the people who work at the paper wouldve been out of a job half of them maybe more wouldnt have been picked up by whoever started another paper she knew i wouldnt go he studied the ball in his hand turned it slowly spoke softly she never did like lily anyway flynnвђ he gave in to moes desperate excitement and heaved the ball before i make it sound pitiful and patheticвђi did want to go then i loved lily then but i didnt love her enough to pack up and go when she gave me the ultimatum she didnt love me enough to stay or to give me the time to work things out here and meet up with her then you didnt love each other at all malory thought but she remained silent less than a month after shed landed in new york she called and broke our engagement she needed to concentrate on her career couldnt handle the stress of a relationship much less a longdistance one i should be free to see other people and make a life while she was going to be married to her job and in six months she was married to an nbc news exec and moving steadily up the ladder she got what she wanted and in the end so did i he turned back to malory his face was calm again the deep green eyes clear as if the fury had never been behind them my mother was rightвђand i really hate that part but she was right this is my place and im doing exactly what i want to do the fact that you see that says a lot more about you than about either one of them he threw the ball one last time i made you feel sorry for me no though he had you made me respect you she rose walked to him and kissed his cheek i think i remember this lily from the local news redhead right lots of teeth thatd be lily her voice was entirely too nasal and she had a weak chin he leaned over kissed her cheek in turn вђњthats a really nice thing to say thanks moe raced back and spat out the ball on the ground between them how long will he do that malory asked for all eternity or until my arm falls off she gave the ball a good boot with her foot its getting dark she said as moe raced happily off you should take me home or i could take moe home and we couldвђah i see by the way your eyebrows have arched and your lip has curled that your mind is in the gutter i was going to say we could go to the movies you were not i certainly was in fact it so happens i have the movie section in the car for your perusal they were all right again she realized and wanted to kiss himвђthis time in friendship instead she fell into the rhythm and played the game out you have the entire paper in the car because its your paper be that as it may ill still let you pick the flick what if its an art film with subtitles then ill suffer in silence you already know there arent any such films playing at the local multiplex dont you thats neither here nor there come on moe lets go for a ride it had done her good malory decided to step away from the puzzle and the problems for an evening she felt fresher this morning and more optimistic and it felt good to be interested in and attracted to a complicated man he was complicated she thought only more so because he gave the impression at least initially of being simple and so that made him yet another puzzle to solve she couldnt deny that click hed spoken of why should she she wasnt a game player when it came to relationshipsвђshe was cautious it meant she needed to find out if the click was merely sexual or tangled around something more puzzle number three she decided as she hunkered down to continue her research her first phone call of the morning left her stunned moments after hanging up she was tearing through her old college textbooks on art history the door of the vane house was wide open a number of burly men were hauling furniture and boxes in or hauling furniture and boxes out just watching them gave flynn a backache he recalled the weekend years before when he and jordan had moved into an apartment how they with brads help had carted a secondhand sofa that weighed as much as a honda up three flights of stairs those were the days flynn reminisced thank god they were over moe leaped out of the car behind him and without waiting for an invitation raced straight into the house there was a crash a curse flynn could only pray that one of the vane family antiques hadnt bit the dust as he hurriedly followed jesus christ you call this a puppy he was a puppyвђa year ago flynn looked at his oldest friend currently being greeted by and slobbered on by his dog and his heart simply sang sorry about theвђ was that a lamp brad glanced at the broken china scattered in the foyer it was a minute ago all right big guy down outside moe chase the rabbit in response moe let out a series of barks and bombed out the door what rabbit the one that lives in his dreams hey flynn stepped forward crunching broken shards under his feet and caught brad in one hard hug looking good for a suit whos a suit he couldnt have looked less like one in worn jeans and a denim work shirt he looked flynn thought tall and lean and fit the vanes golden child the family prince who was as happy running a construction crew as he was a board meeting maybe happier i came by last evening but the place was deserted when did you get in late lets get out of the way brad suggested as the movers carried in another load he jerked a thumb and led the way to the kitchen the house was always furnished and made available to execs or visiting brass from the vane corporation once it had been their home in the valley a place flynn had known as well as his own the kitchen had been redone since the days when hed begged cookies there but the view out the windows off the surrounding deck was the same woods and water and the rising hills beyond some of the best parts of his childhood were tied up in this house just as they were tied up in the man who now owned it brad poured coffee then led flynn out on the deck hows it feel to be back flynn asked him dont know yet odd mostly he leaned on the rail looked out beyond everything was the same nothing was the same he turned back a man comfortable in his frame he had a layer or two of big city on him and was comfortable with that as well his hair was blood that had darkened with the years just as the dimples in his cheeks were closer to creases now much to his relief his eyes were a stone gray under straight brows they tended to look intense even when the rest of his face smiled flynn knew it wasnt the mouth that showed brads mood it was the eyes when they smiled he meant it they did so now son of a bitch its good to see you i never figured you for coming back not for any length of time neither did i things change flynn theyre meant to i guess ive been itchy the last few years i finally figured out i was itchy for home how are things with you mr editor in chief theyre okay i assume youll be subscribing to our paper ill make arrangements for that he added with a grin we put up a nice red box next to the mailbox on the road morning delivery out here usually hits by seven sign me up i will and im going to want to interview bradley charles vane iv at his earliest convenience shit give me a while to settle in before i have to put on my corporate hat how about next monday ill come to you christ youve become clark kent no worse lois laneвђwithout the great legs i dont know what ive got going on monday but ill have my assistant set it up great how about we grab some beer and catch up tonight i can get behind that hows your family mom and joe are doing fine out in phoenix actually i was thinking more about the delicious dana youre not going to start hitting on my sister again its embarrassing she hooked up with anybody no shes not hooked up with anybody she still built flynn winced shut up vane i love yanking your chain over that one and with a sigh brad was home вђњthough its entertaining thats not why i asked you to come out theres something i think youre going to want to see i did some thinking when you told me about this deal dana and her friends got themselves into you know something about these people up at warriors peak no but i know something about art come on i had them put it in the great room id just finished uncrating it personally when i heard you drive up he walked along the deck around the corner of the house to the double glass doors bordered by etched panels the great room boasted a towering ceiling with a circling balcony a generous fireplace with hearth and mantel of huntergreen granite framed in golden oak there was space for two sofas one in the center of the room the other tucked into a cozy conversation area along the far wall more space spilled through a wide arch where the piano stood and where brad had spent countless tedious hours practicing there propped against the hearth of a second fireplace was the painting the muscles in flynns belly went loose jesus oh jesus its called after the spell i got it at an auction about three years ago do you remember i mentioned id bought a painting because one of the figures in it looked like dana i didnt pay any attention you were always razzing me about dana he crouched down now stared hard at the painting he didnt know art but even with his limited eye hed have bet the farm that the same hand had painted this that had created the painting at warriors peak there was no joy or innocence here however the tone was dark a kind of grieving with the only light pale pale light glowing from the three glass coffins where three women seemed to sleep his sisters face and malorys and zoes i have to make a phone call flynn straightened and dug out his cell phone theres someone who has to see this right away chapter nine she didnt like to be told to hurry especially when she wasnt given a good reason why so on principle malory took her time driving to the vane house she had a lot on her mind and a little drive in the country was just the ticket she decided to line those thoughts up in some organized fashion and she liked tooling along in her little car over the windy road that followed the river and the way the sun sprinkled through the leaves overhead to splatter patterns of light on the roadbed if she could paint she would do a study of thatвђjust the way light and shadow played on something as simple and ordinary as a country road if she could paint she thought againвђwhich she couldnt despite all the desire all the study all the years of trying but someone sure as hell could she shouldve tried to track down dana and zoe before driving out here really she was supposed to be working with them not with flynn he wasвђ like an accessory she told herself a really attractive sexy interesting accessory boy she loved accessories not a productive train of thought she switched the car radio off steeped herself in silence what she needed to do was find dana and zoe tell them what shed discovered maybe if she said it all out loud she or they could decipher what it meant because at the moment she didnt have a clue all she knew in her gut was that it was important even vital if not the answer it was one of the bread crumbs that would lead to the answer she turned off the road and onto the private lane no gates here no circling walls the vanes were certainly wealthy enough to rate them she wondered why they hadnt chosen to buy warriors peak instead of building by the river closer to town then the house came into view and answered her question it was beautiful and it was wood a lumber baron would hardly build or buy in stone or brick he would as he had build to illustrate the art of his product the wood was honey gold set off by copper trim that had gone dreamy green with age and weather there was a complex arrangement of decks and terraces skirting or jutting from both stories half a dozen rooflines peaked or sloped all with a kind of artful symmetry that brought harmony to the whole the grounds were informal as suited the site and the style but she imagined that the placement of every shrub every tree every flower bed had been meticulously selected and designed malory approved of meticulous design and execution she pulled up beside a moving van and was about to step out when she heard the wild delighted barking oh no not this time ive got your number buddy she reached into the box on the floor beside her and pulled out a large dog biscuit even as moes homely face smooshed against the car window she rolled it down moe get the cookie and threw the dog biscuit as far as she could manage as he raced in pursuit she nipped out of the car and made a dash for the house nice job flynn met her at the door im a quick study counting on that malory price brad vane already called it flynn added in subtle warning as he saw the interest light in brads eye oh well cant blame you brad smiled at malory its still nice to meet you malory what are you talking about its guyspeak flynn told her and dipped his head to kiss her just bringing brad uptodate dana and zoe on the way no danas working and i couldnt reach zoe i left messages for both of them whats this all about youre going to want to see it for yourself see what you drag me out hereвђno offense she added to brad you have a beautiful houseвђwithout any explanation and i was busy the time factorвђ im starting to think times a real factor flynn tugged her along toward the great room excuse the disorder ive got a lot going out a lot coming in today brad kicked aside a chunk of broken lamp flynn tells me you managed the art gallery in town yes until recently oh what a fabulous room she stopped absorbed the space it needed paintings sculpture more color more texture such a wonderful space deserved art if shed had a free hand and an unlimited budget she couldve made this room a showcase you must be eager to unpack your things settle in andвђ oh my god the shock struck the instant she saw the painting the stunning blast of discovery pumped straight into her blood had her fumbling her glasses out of her purse and going down to her knees in front of it for a closer study the colors the brushstrokes the technique even the medium the same the same she thought as the other the three main subjects the same after the theft of the souls she stated theyre here in this box on the pedestal in the foreground my god look at how the light and color seem to pulse inside the glass its genius there in the background the two figures from the first painting with their backs turned here theyre leaving banished about to walk through that mist the curtain of dreams the keys she scooped her hair back held the mass of it in one hand as she peered more closely where are the keys there you can just see them on a chain the female figure holds in her hand three keys shes the keeper wanting to see more detail she fished a small silverhandled magnifying glass out of a felt bag in her purse she carries a magnifying glass in her purse brad uttered in amazement yeah flynn grinned like a fool isnt she great focused on the painting she shut out the comments behind her and peered through the glass yes yes its the same design of key theyre not worked into the background the way they are in the other painting not symbolism this time but fact she has the keys she lowered the glass eased back slightly for an overview the shadows still in the trees but farther back now you can barely see his shape his works done but still he watches gloats who is he brad wanted to know quiet shes working malory slipped the glass back into its pouch then returned it to her purse such a sad painting such grief in the light in the body language of the two as they step toward that curtain of mist the main subjects in their crystal coffins look serene but theyre not its not serenity its emptiness and theres such desperation in that light inside the box its painful and its brilliant is it the same artist flynn asked her of course this is no student no mimic no homage but thats opinion she sat back on her heels im not an authority couldve fooled me he thought between you and brad i figure weve got all the authority we need shed forgotten brad and flushed a bit with embarrassment shed all but lapped the painting up kneeling before it like a supplicant sorry still kneeling she looked up at him i got carried away could you tell me where you acquired this at auction in new york a small house banderbys ive heard of them the artist unknown you can just make out a partial signatureвђ an initial really might be an r or a p followed by the key symbol malory bent lower to study the lower left corner you had it dated authenticated of course seventeenth century though the style has a more contemporary feel the painting was tested extensively if you know banderbys you know its both meticulous and reputable yes yes i know and i had it tested independently just a little habit of mine brad added the results coincided i have a theory flynn began but malory waved him off can i ask you why you bought it banderbys isnt known for its bargains and its an unknown artist one reason is i was struck how much the middle figure resembled dana it was true enough brad thought if not the whole truth the overall painting the power of it caught me first then that detail drew me in andвђ he hesitated his gaze tracking across the painting then feeling foolish he shrugged you could say it spoke to me i wanted it yes i understand that she took her glasses off folded them and slipped them carefully back in their case then slid the case into her purse flynn must have told you about the painting at warriors peak sure i told him and when i saw this i figuredвђ ssh malory tapped him on the knee then held up a hand for him to help her to her feet it has to be a series theres another painting that comes before or after or in between but there have to be three its consistently three three keys three daughters the three of us well there are five of us now brad put in but yeah i follow you you followed me when i said the same damn thing a half hour ago flynn complained my theory sorry this time malory patted him on the arm its all tumbling around in my head i can almost make out the pieces but i cant quite see the shape or where they go what they mean do you mind if we sit down sure sorry immediately brad took her arm led her to a sofa can i get you something to drink got any brandy i know its early but i could really use just a little brandy ill find some flynn sat beside her as brad left the room what is it mal you look a little pale all of a sudden it hurts me she looked toward the painting again then closed her eyes as tears gathered in them even as it dazzles my mind and my spirit it hurts to look at it i saw this happen flynn i felt this happen to them ill put it away no no she caught his hand and the contact comforted her arts supposed to touch you in some way thats its power what will the third be and when when she shook her head how flexible is your mind i wonder im just starting to find out how flexible mine is youve told brad all of it yeah something here he realized as he watched her something she wasnt quite sure she could say you can trust him malory you can trust me the question will be if either of you will trust me after i tell you both what i found out this morning and what i think it means your old friend might politely nudge me out the door and bolt it behind me i never lock beautiful women out of the house brad walked back in with a snifter of brandy he handed it to her then sat on the coffee table facing her go ahead knock it back she did just that downing the brandy as she might a quick dose of medicine it slid smoothly down her throat and soothed her jittery stomach its a crime to treat a napoleon that carelessly thanks knows her brandy he said to flynn color was seeping back into her cheeks to give her a chance to recover more fully he rapped flynn with his elbow how the hell did you manage to get a woman with taste and class to look twice at you i had moe knock her down pin her to the ground better mal yes she blew out a breath yes your paintings seventeenth century thats absolutely conclusive thats right i found out this morning that the painting at warriors peak is twelfth century possibly earlier but no later if you got that from pitte or rowenaвђ flynn began no i got that from dr stanley bower of philadelphia hes an expert and a personal acquaintance i sent him scrapings of the painting howd you get scrapings flynn wanted to know more color rose in her cheeks but it wasnt the brandy that caused it she cleared her throat fussed with the clasp of her purse i took them when you went up there with me last week when you and moe distracted them it was completely inappropriate absolutely unethical i did it anyway cool pure admiration shone in flynns tone so that means either brads experts or yours is off or youre wrong about both being done by one artist orвђ or the experts are right and so am i malory set her purse aside folded her hands tight in her lap dr bower would have to run more complex and indepth tests to verify the date but he wouldnt be off by centuries ive seen both paintings up close everything i know tells me they were done by the same hand i know it sounds crazy it feels crazy but i believe it whoever created the portrait at warriors peak did so in the twelfth century and that same artist painted brads five hundred years later brad slid his gaze toward flynn surprised that his friend wasnt goggling or grinning instead flynns face was sober and considering you want to believe that my painting was executed by a fivehundredyearold artist older i think much older than that and i think the artist painted both from memory rethinking bolting the door malory asked him im thinking both of you have gotten caught up in a fantasy a romantic and tragic story that has no basis in reality you havent seen the painting you havent seen the daughters of glass no but ive heard about it all accounts place it in london during the blitz where it was destroyed most likely answer is that the one at the peak is a copy its not you think im being stubborn i can be malory admitted but this isnt one of those times im not a fanciful person eitherвђor i havent been she shifted her attention to flynn and her voice grew urgent flynn everything they told me everything they told me and dana and zoe that first night was absolutely true even more amazing is what they didnt tell us rowena and pitteвђteacher and warriorвђtheyre the figures in the background of each painting they were there in reality and one of them painted both those portraits i believe you her breath shuddered out in relief at flynns simple faith i dont know what it means or how it helps but learning thisвђand believing itвђis why i was picked if i dont find the key and dana and zoe dont find theirs after me those souls will keep screaming inside that box forever he reached out ran a hand over her hair we wont let that happen excuse me zoe hesitated at the entrance to the room she was hardpressed not to rub her hands over the satiny trim or kick off her shoes to slide barefoot across the glossy floors she wanted to rush to the windows and study every view the men outside said i should come right in um flynn moes out there rolling around in something that looks a lot like dead fish shit be right back zoe brad and he ran outside brad got to his feet he wasnt sure how he managed it when his knees had dissolved he heard his own voice a bit cooler than normal a bit stilted over the roar of blood in his head come in please sit down can i get you something no thanks sorry malory i got your message and came right out is something wrong i dont know brad here thinks ive slipped a few gears and i dont blame him thats ridiculous in her instant leap to defend she forgot the charm of the house the aloof charm of the man her cautious and apologetic smile turned into a chilly scowl as she strode across the room to malorys side and if you said any such thing youre not only wrong youre rude actually i didnt get around to saying it yet and as you dont know the circumstancesвђ i dont have to i know malory and if youre a friend of flynns you should know better than to upset her i beg your pardon where had that stiff superior tone come from how had his fathers voice popped out of his mouth its not his fault zoe really as to being upset i dont know what i am malory shoved back her hair and rising gestured toward the painting you should take a look at this zoe moved closer then clutched her throat oh oh and her eyes filled with hot tears its so beautiful its so sad but it belongs with the other how did it get here malory slipped an arm around her waist so they stood joined together why do you think it belongs with the other its the daughters of glass after theвђ the spell or the curse the box with the blue lights its just the way you described it from your dream and its the sameвђ the sameвђ i dont know how to say it its like a set or part of a set painted by the same person malory glanced over her shoulder at brad cocked a brow are you an art expert brad asked zoe no she didnt bother to look at him and her tone was flat im a hairdresser but im not stupid i didnt mean to implyвђ no you meant to say will it help you find the key malory i dont know but it means something i have a digital camera out in the car can i take some pictures of it be my guest brad jammed his hands into his pockets as malory hurried out and left him alone with zoe are you sure i cant get you something coffee no im fine thank you i ah came in on this after the first reel he began you might give me a little time to catch up im sure flynn will tell you everything you need to know she crossed the room using the excuse of looking out for malory as a chance to see the lovely river view what would it be like she wondered to be able to stand here whenever you wanted to see the water and the light the hills liberating she imagined and peaceful malory just told me she believes the daughters of glass exist in reality in some reality and that the people you met at warriors peak are several thousand years old she turned back didnt so much as blink if she believes that she has good reason and i trust her enough to believe it too now would you like to tell me ive slipped a couple of gears irritation flickered over his face i never said that to her i thought it but i didnt say it im not saying it to you either but youre thinking it you know i only have two feet but im managing to stay on the wrong one with you since i doubt were going dancing anytime soon im not really worried about your feet i like your house thanks so do i zoeвђ ive done a lot of business at homemakers ive found good values and excellent customer service in the local store good to know i hope youre not planning on making any major changes there but i wouldnt mind a little more variety on the seasonal stuff you know bedding plants snow shovels outdoor furniture his lips twitched ill keep that in mind and it wouldnt hurt to add a couple more cashiers on saturdays theres always a wait at the checkout so noted im starting my own business so i pay attention to how things run are you opening your own salon yes she said it firmly despite the way her stomach muscles clutched i was looking at space before i got malorys message to come out here and why didnt malory come back in she was running out of steam now that her temper had leveled off she didnt know what to talk about with a man who lived in a house like this one who helped run an enormous national conglomerate if conglomerate was the word for it in the valley what oh yes im looking for a place in town im not interested in a mall space i think its important to maintain a good downtown and i want to be close to home so i can be more available to my son you have a son his gaze zeroed in on her left hand and he nearly sighed with relief at the lack of a wedding ring all zoe saw was the quick look she straightened her shoulders stiffened them yes simons nine sorry it took me so long malory apologized as she came back in flynns got moe tied to a tree in the side yard hes hosing him down for all the good thats going to do hell just be a wet incredibly smelly dog instead of only an incredibly smelly one he said to ask if you had any shampoo or soap you could spare i can come up with something go ahead and take your pictures malory aimed the camera waited until brads footsteps receded вђњtalk about gods she murmured to zoe what bradley charles vane iv his kind of looks just smack a woman right in the hormones looks are genetic zoe very nearly sniffed personality and manners are developed it was one fine day in the gene pool when he was made she lowered the camera i gave you the impression he was giving me a hard time really he wasnt maybe maybe not but hes an arrogant snob wow malory blinked at the vehemence in zoes voice i didnt get that i cant imagine flynn being friends with anyone who fits the snob category arrogant is debatable zoe jerked a shoulder ive run into his type before theyre more interested in looking good than in being human anyway hes not important the painting is i think it is and what you said about them being a set part of a set i think thats true and theres at least one more i have to find it something in them or about them is going to point me toward the key id better hit the books want some help all i can get ill head back now there are a couple of things i need to do then ill swing by your place about the time brad unearthed a bottle of shampoo he heard a car start he went to the window cursed under his breath as he watched zoe and malory head down his lane as far as first impressions went hed made a complete mess of it he didnt usually alienate women on sight but then again the sight of a woman didnt usually slam into him like a hard sweaty fist considering that he supposed he could be excused for not being at his best he went downstairs then detoured back into the great room instead of continuing to the outside he stood staring at the painting as he had the first time hed seen it at the auction house the way hed stared at it countless times since hed acquired it hed have paid any price for it it was true enough what hed told malory and flynn hed bought it because it was magnificent powerful compelling hed been intrigued by the one figures face its resemblance to his childhood friend but it had been another face in the painting that had dazzled him consumed him undone him one look at that face zoes face and hed fallen unreasonably in love strange enough he thought when the woman had simply been a figure in a painting how much more complicated and impossible was it now that he knew she was real he thought about it while he put some of his house in order he continued to think about it later when he and flynn climbed up to sit on the wall surrounding warriors peak they each opened a beer and studied the exotic silhouette etched against a gloomy sky lights glowed against the windows here and there but as they drank their beers in silence they saw no figure pass behind the glass they probably know were out here flynn said after a time if we take your girlfriends theory to heart and label them celtic gods with a few thousand years under their belts yeah pretty safe bet they know were out here you used to be more openminded flynn noted ah no not really jordan would be the one inclined to bite on this kind of a story line and run with it you see him lately a couple months ago hes been doing a lot of traveling so we dont manage to get together as often as we used to fuck it flynn brad flung an arm around flynns shoulder ive missed you assholes same goes you going to tell me what you thought of malory classy intellectual and very very hotвђdespite her dubious taste in men flynn tapped the heels of his ancient tennis shoes against the stone of the wall im about half crazy about her serious crazy or lets mambo crazy i dont know havent figured it yet he studied the house and the quarter slice of moon that drifted over it im hoping its door number two because id just as soon not get serious crazy at this point lily was a socialclimbing opportunist with a great rack jesus vane he wasnt sure whether to laugh or give his friend a hard shove off the sevenfoot wall so he did neither and only brooded instead i was in love with her i was going to marry her now youre not and you didnt lucky break for you she wasnt worthy flynn flynn shifted he couldnt see brads eyes clearly their color blended into the night worthy of what of you thats a hell of a thing to say youll feel better about the whole thing once you admit im right now back to current affairs i liked herвђyour maloryвђif youre keeping score even though you think shes whacked boggy ground brad mused even when you were walking it with a friend i think shes found herself in extraordinary circumstances and shes caught up in the mystique why wouldnt she be flynn had to smile thats just a diplomatic bullshit way of saying shes whacked you once punched me in the face for saying joley ridenbecker had beaver teeth im not heading meetings on monday with a black eye see you are a suit if i admit that joley did indeed have teeth like a beaver will you believe me if i tell you ive never known anyone with less of a whack quotient than malory price okay ill take your word and ill admit the whole thing about the paintings is intriguing brad gestured with the beer then drank again id like to get a look at the one in there myself we can go up knock on the door in the daylight brad decided when we havent been drinking probably better meanwhile why dont you tell me more about this zoe havent known her long but i did some background checking on her and mal just in case dana was getting sucked into some weirdass scam she moved to the valley three years ago with her kid husband nope single parent looks like a good one to me i met the kid hes bright normal appealing she worked at hair today girly hair place on market word is shes good at her profession personable with customers reliable got canned the same time malory did and around the same time they cut danas hours at the library to the bone another weird coincidence she bought this little cardboard box of a house when she moved here apparently shes done most of the fixingup work herself boyfriend not that i know of sheвђ wait a minute you ask two questions husband boyfriend my razorsharp reporters instinct leads me to the conclusion that youre thinking of the mambo or something i should get back ive got a hell of a lot to do in the next couple of days but theres this one thing brad took another pull on the bottle how the hell are we going to get off this wall good question flynn pursed his lips studied the ground we could just sit here and keep drinking until we fall off brad sighed drained the bottle theres a plan chapter ten malory was barely out of the shower when she heard the knock on her front door she belted her robe snagged a towel and wound it around her hair as she hurried to answer вђњtod youre up and about early on my way to the coffee shop to ogle the ninetofivers before heading to work he peered over her right shoulder her left then gave her a leer got company malory swung the door wider in invitation no all alone ah too bad youre telling me she tucked up the ends of the towel more securely want coffee here ive already put the pot on not unless you can offer me a skinny mocha latte and a hazelnut muffin sorry fresh out well maybe i should just give you the good news then be on my way still he flopped into a chair oh new boots fabulous arent they he stretched out his legs turned his feet right and left to admire them theyre killing me of course but i couldnt resist them i made a quick run through nordstroms on saturday darling youve got to go he sat up grabbed her hand as she curled on the end of the sofa the cashmere theres a cowl neck in periwinkle thats calling your name periwinkle she sighed long and deep like a woman under the hands of a skilled lover dont say periwinkle cashmere when im in the middle of a shopping moratorium mal if you dont treat yourself who will thats true thats so true she bit her lip nordstroms and theres a twinset in a strong peachy pink that was made for you you know i have no defense against twinsets tod youre killing me ill stop ill stop he held up his hands but on to our morning bulletin the pamela has stepped in deep and stinky doodoo oh boy malory wiggled into the cushions вђњtell me everything dont spare the details as if okay we got in a deco bronzeвђfemale figure wearing a flapperstyle dress feathered headband pearls gorgeous opentoed shoes trailing a long scarf shes absolutely charming witty terrific details with this sly lets you and me charleston big boy smirk on her face i fell in love did you call mrs karterfield in pittsburgh ah see he shot a finger in the air as if proving a point naturally you would assume that or would have done so personally had you still been in charge which you should be goes without saying i did of course call mrs karterfield who as expected asked us to hold it for her until she could come down personally to see it next week and what happens when our darling mrs karterfield from pittsburgh comes into the gallery to see a deco figure she buys it and often at least one other piece if she comes in with a friend which is usually the case she harangues her companion until she buys something too its a good day when mrs karterfield comes to town pamela sold it out from under her it took malory ten seconds to find her voice what what how why mrs ks one of our best customers she always gets first look at deco bronzes his lips folded into a thin derisive smile a bird in the hand thats what the twit told me when i found out and how did i find out ill tell you he said with a triumphant ring in his voice i found out when mrs k came in unexpectedly yesterday afternoon to see it just couldnt wait she told me and she brought two friends two mal i could cry what happened what did she say i took her over to see it and theres a sold sign tucked under the base i assumed it was a mistake but i went to check pamela sold it that morning apparently while i was in the back on the phone trying to soothe alfred because pamela the putrid had accused him of overcharging for the crating for the marble nudes alfred overcharging malory pressed her hands to her temples i cant keep up it was horrible just horrible it took me twenty minutes to talk him down and even then i wasnt sure he wouldnt stomp in and beat her with his hammer maybe i shouldve let him tod considered then waved the thought away with both hands anyway while i was busy with alfred pamela sold mrs ks deco to a stranger to some flybynight some wanderer in off the street he flopped back splaying a hand over his chest i still cant believe it mrs k was naturally very upset and demanded to see you then i had to tell her you werent with us any longer and the doodoo hit the fan big time she asked for me thats so sweet it gets sweeter pamela came down and they got into it boy did they mrs k asking how an item on hold for her could be sold pamela getting snippy and says how its not gallery policy to hold a piece without a cash deposit can you imagine cash deposit horrified malory could only goggle from one of our oldest and most reliable clients exactly then mrs ks all well ive been patronizing the gallery for fifteen years and my word has always been good enough and where is james and pamelas i beg your pardon but im in charge here and mrs k shoots back that if james has put a moron in charge hes obviously gone senile oh go mrs k meanwhile julia runs into the back and calls james to let him know theres a big fat problem pamela and mrs k are practically coming to blows over the bronze when he comes rushing in hes trying to calm them both down but theyre too into it mrs ks saying she wont deal with this woman i loved the way she said it this woman it sang and pamelas saying the gallerys a business and can hardly run on one customers whim oh my god james is frantic promising mrs k hell sort all this out but shes furious her face is positively puce she tells him she wont set foot in the place again as long as that woman is associated with the gallery and youll love thisвђif he let a jewel like malory price slip through his fingers he deserves to go out of business and with that she sails out the door she called me a jewel delighted malory hugged herself i love her this is good stuff tod its really started my day off on a high note theres even more james is pissed whens the last time youve seen james pissed um never bingo tod punched a finger in the air he was pale as a sheet his mouth was all tight and grim and he told pamela between clenched teethвђtod clamped his together to demonstrateвђi need to speak with you pamela upstairs what did she say well she stormed up and he went behind her then he closed the door which was very disappointing i couldnt hear much of what he said even though i went up and lurked around hoping to but you could hear her clearly enough when she started raging im making something out of this place she tells him you said i was in charge im tired of having malory price thrown in my face every time i turn around why the hell didnt you marry her instead of me oh malory thought about that scenario for a couple of seconds eeuuw then she started crying saying she was working so hard and nobody appreciated her and she ran out i barely scrambled away in time it was all so exhausting yet oddly exhilarating crying damn it a little worm of sympathy crawled into malorys chest were they imreallyhurtandsad tears or were they just imreallypissedoff tears pissedoff tears okay then she squashed the worm without mercy im probably going to hell right for getting such a charge out of all this well get a nice little condo together but while were still shuffling on this mortal coil i think james is going to ask you to come back in fact mal im sure of it really her heart gave a quick leap what did he say its not so much what he said as what he didnt say he didnt go running after the weeping pamela to dry her beady eyes in fact he stayed for the rest of the day going over accounts and he looked grim when he left absolutely grim id say pamelas reign of terror is at an end this is a good day malory let out a long sigh a really good day and ive got to get started on it not to worry he said as he got up ill keep you updated with bulletins meanwhile the painting you were wondering about the portrait the what oh yes what about it remember how we both thought there was something familiar about it it came to me do you remember about five years ago the oil on canvas unsigned young arthur of britain on the verge of drawing excalibur from an altar of stone chilly fingers brushed the nape of her neck as the painting floated into her mind my god i remember of course i remember the color the intensity the way the light pulsed around the sword definitely the same style and school as the one you showed me might be the same artist yesвђ yes it might how did we acquire it through an estate wasnt it in ireland james went to europe for several weeks to acquire that was the best piece he brought back with him who bought it even my razorsharp memory has its limits but i looked it up julia sold it to jordan hawke the writer local boy or was lives in new york now i think her stomach did a long slow roll jordan hawke maybe you can contact him through his publisher if you want to talk to him about the painting well got to run sugarplum he leaned down to give her a kiss let me know the minute james calls you to grovel i want all the deets there were half a dozen people at keyboards and phones when malory reached the third level of the dispatch where flynn had his office she saw him immediately through the glass walls he paced back and forth in front of a desk tipping a bright silver slinky from one hand to the other and appeared to be holding a conversation with himself she wondered how he could stand the lack of privacy while he worked that constant sensation of being on display and the noise she thought with all the clacking ringing talking and beeping she would go mad trying to formulate a single creative thought she wasnt sure whom to speak with no one looked particularly like an assistant or secretary and despite the retro toy that flynn was currently playing with it suddenly dawned on malory that he was a busy man an important man not a man she should pop in on without notice as she stood undecided flynn sat on the corner of his desk pouring the slinky from right hand to left and back again his hair was mussed as if hed spent some time playing with it before hed gotten hold of the toy he wore a dark green shirt tucked into casual khakis and very possibly the oldest athletic shoes shed ever seen there was a quick tingle in her belly followed by a helpless little thud just under her heart it was all right to be attracted to him she told herself that was acceptable but she couldnt let this move to the level it was headed for so quickly that wasnt smart it wasnt safe it wasnt evenвђ then he looked out through the glass his eyes meeting hers for one fast hot beat before he smiled and the tingle the thud became more intense he flicked his wrist and the slinky fell back into itself then he gave her a comeahead gesture with his free hand she wound her way through the desks and the din when she stepped through the open office door she saw with some relief that he hadnt been talking to himself but on a speakerphone out of habit she closed the door behind her then looked toward the sound of heroic snoring to see moe sprawled bellyup between two filing cabinets what did you do about a man who brought his big silly dog to work with him she wondered maybe more to the point how did you resist such a man flynn held up a finger to signal one more minute so she took the time to study his work area there was a huge corkboard on one wall jammed with notes articles photographs and phone numbers her fingers itched to organize it as well as the maze of papers on his desk shelves were full of books several of which seemed to be law and medical journals there were phone books for a number of pennsylvania counties books of famous quotations movie and music guides in addition to the slinky he had a yoyo and a number of warlike action figures there were several plaques and awardsвђto the paper and to flynn personally stacked together as if he hadnt gotten around to hanging them she didnt know where she would have hung them either as what little wall space he had was taken up by the corkboard and an equally large wall calendar for the month of september she turned around when he ended the call then stepped back as he moved toward her he stopped problem no maybe yes pick one he suggested i got a tingle in my stomach when i saw you in here his grin spread thanks no no i dont know if im ready for that i have a lot on my mind i didnt come here to talk about that but seeвђim already distracted hold that thought he told her when his phone rang again hennessy uhhuh uhhuh when no thats no problem he continued and scribbled on a pad that he unearthed from the rubble ill take care of it he hung up then unplugged the phone its the only way to kill the beast tell me more about this tingle no i dont know why i told you in the first place im here about jordan hawke what about him he bought a painting from the gallery about five years agoвђ a painting are we talking about the same jordan hawke yes its of young arthur about to draw the sword from the stone i thinkвђim nearly sureвђits by the same artist as the painting at warriors peak and the one your other friend owns i need to see it again it was years ago and i want to be sure im remembering the details of it correctly and not just adding them in because its convenient if youre right its an awfully big coincidence if im right its not a coincidence at all theres a purpose to it to all of it can you get in touch with him because his mind was racing through the details and possibilities flynn filled his hands with the slinky again yeah if hes traveling it might take a while but ill track him down i didnt know jordan had ever been in the gallery his names not on our client list so im assuming this was a oneshot deal to my mind that only makes it more important excitement rose in her throat and bubbled out in her voice flynn i nearly bought that painting myself it was beyond my budget at the time but i was doing some creative math to justify the purchase it was sold on my morning off just before i was planning to go to james to ask him if i could buy it on a payment plan i have to believe all this means something ill get in touch with jordan my take would be he bought it for somebody hes not much on stuff unlike brad he tends to travel light and keep the acquisitions to a minimum i need to see the painting again got that im on it ill find out what i can today and fill you in over dinner tonight no thats not a good idea its a really really bad idea dinners a bad idea people have embraced the concept of the evening meal throughout history theres documentation us having dinner is the bad part i need to slow things down he set the toy down he shifted his body and when she would have countered to keep that distance between them he grabbed her hand tugged her forward somebody rushing you more like something her pulse began to skipвђin her wrists in her throat even at the back of her suddenly shaky knees there was something about that cool calculation that came into his eyes the sort that reminded her he tended to think two or three steps ahead look this is my problem not yours andвђ stop she ordered when his free hand cupped the back of her neck this is hardly the place forвђ theyre reporters he inclined his head toward the glass wall between his office and the newsroom as such theyre aware that i kiss women i think im in love with you she felt his hand jerk then go limp she saw the amusement and purpose on his face slide into blank shock and twin demons of hurt and temper stabbed at her heart there now ive made it your problem too she pushed back from himвђa simple matter as he was no longer touching her maloryвђ i dont want to hear it i dont need to hear you tell me its too soon too fast youre not looking for this level of a relationship im not stupid i know all the brushoff lines and i wouldnt be in this position right now if youd taken no for an answer in the first place wait a minute now panic washed over his face into his voice lets take a second here вђњtake a second mortification was quickly outweighing the hurt and the anger take a week take the rest of your life just take it someplace where im not she stormed out of his office since bloodcurdling terror still had a grip on him he didnt consider going after her in love with him she wasnt supposed to fall in love with him she was supposed to let him seduce her into bed be sensible enough to keep things simple she was supposed to be careful and practical and smart enough to keep him from falling in love with her hed worked it all out and now she was messing up the plan hed made himself very specific promises when his engagement had fallen apart the first of which was to be sure he didnt put himself in that position againвђa position where he was vulnerable to someone elses whims and wishes to the point that his own ended up shattered around him his life was nothing like hed thought it would be womenвђhis mother lilyвђhad shifted the lines on him but damn it he liked his life now women disgusted he dropped into the chair behind his desk вђњtheres no figuring them men they want everything their way dana lifted her glass of wine in malorys direction sing it sister hours after shed stalked out of flynns office malory was soothing her wounded pride with a nice pinot grigio female companionship and salon treatments in the comfort of her own home there were a number of things to discuss but she couldnt think about paintings and keys and destiny until shed vented her spleen i dont care if he is your brother hes still a man he is dana looked mournfully into her wine im sorry to say but he is have some more potato chips i will with her hair pulled back from a face coated with a greenclay refining mask malory sipped and munched she studied the folds of tinfoil zoe was layering in danas hair maybe i should have highlights too you dont need them zoe told her and painted another section of danas hair you need shaping shaping involves scissors you wont even know ive cut it except itll look and feel better let me drink a little more first and see how it looks after youve whacked at danas dont say whack in a sentence about my hair dana cautioned are you going to tell us what you and flynn fought about malory sniffed he just wants sex typical pig dana reached into the chip bowl i really miss sex me too zoe set another square of foil not just the sex part but the leading up to it and the coming down from it parts the excitement and the nerves and the anticipation beforehand then all that skin and movement and discovery during and the full and floating feeling after i miss that a lot i need another drink malory reached for the bottle i havent had sex in four months got that beat dana raised her hand seven and a half and counting sluts zoe said with a laugh вђњtry a year and a half oh ouch dana took the bottle topped off her glass and zoes no thanks all the same but i dont think i want to try a year and a half of celibacy its not so bad if you keep busy youre set for a while zoe patted dana on the shoulder just relax while i take off malorys mask whatever you do to me make sure im gorgeous i want flynn to suffer the next time he sees me guaranteed its really sweet of you to do all this i like it its good practice dont say practice when ive got a headful of tinfoil dana complained around a mouthful of chips its going to be great zoe assured her i want to have a fullservice salon and i need to be sure i can handle all the treatments i want to offer i looked at this wonderful building today her face went wistful as she cleaned and blotted malorys skin its way too big for what i need but it was just great two stories with a big attic space a frame house right on the border of business and residential on oak leaf drive its got a wonderful covered porch even a garden in the back where you could set tables and benches high ceilings solid hardwood floors that need work the rooms all sort of tumble into each other on the first floor a really nice flow of space that keeps it all intimate i didnt know you were looking at houses malory said im just looking this is the first place ive seen that caught at me you know yeah i know if its too big and you really love it maybe you could get somebody to take part of it for another business with the mask removed zoe began to stroke on a moisturizer i thought of that actually i have this wild idea dont tell me im crazy until i finish each of us said what we really wanted was to have our own place oh butвђ not till im finished zoe cut malory off as she dabbed on eye cream the lower floor has two wonderful bow windows perfect for displays theres a central hall and on each side are those nice rooms if someone was interested in opening a tasteful gallery for art and local crafts she couldnt find a better place at the same time on the other side of that hall theres a wonderful set of parlors that would make a terrific bookstore with room for a hip little bistro or tearoom i didnt hear anything about a salon in there dana pointed out but she was listening upstairs when someone comes in to get her hair or nails done or enjoy any number of our wonderful treatments and services shell have to pass by the gallery and the bookstore coming and going perfect time to select that lovely gift for aunt mary or pick up a book to read while shes being combed out maybe even have a nice glass of wine or cup of tea before heading home its all there in one fabulous setting you really have been thinking malory murmured i sure have i even have a name for it indulgence people need to indulge themselves from time to time we could do packages and crosspromotions i know its a big idea especially when we havent known each other very long but i think it could work i think it could be great just look at it before you say no id like to see it dana said im miserable at work and whats the point of being miserable malory could almost see the energy and enthusiasm for the idea pumping off zoe in waves there were a dozen rational comments she could make to point out why it wasnt just a big idea but a messy one she didnt have the heart to do that but she felt obliged to ease carefully back i dont want to muck things up but im pretty sure im going to be asked to come back to the gallery in fact my old boss called this afternoon and asked if id come in and speak with him tomorrow oh well thats great zoe stepped behind malorys chair began to run her fingers through malorys hair to get a feel for the weight and the lines i know you love working there it was like home malory lifted a hand covered one of zoes im sorry it did sound like a good idea a fun one butвђ dont worry about it hey dana waved a hand remember me im still interested i can take a look at the place tomorrow maybe we can make it work between the two of us great mal lets wet down your hair she felt too guilty to argue and with her hair dampened she sat stoically while zoe snipped id better tell you both why i went by the newspaper this morning to see flynn to whom im no longer speaking zoe continued to snip as she told them about the painting in the gallery and her belief that it was done by the same artist youll never guess who bought it she continued jordan hawke jordan hawke dana all but squeaked goddamn it now i want chocolate you must have some emergency supply deli drawer of the fridge whats the problem we were semiinvolved a million years ago damn it damn it damn it dana repeated as she yanked open the drawer and found two bars of godiva godivas your emergency chocolate why not have the best when youre feeling your worst good point you were involved with jordan hawke zoe wanted to know romantically it was years ago when i was still young and stupid dana unwrapped the bar took a big bite bad breakup he took off end of story bastard creep asshole she took another bite okay im done im sorry dana if id knownвђ well i dont know what id have done i need to see the painting doesnt matter im over him im so over him but she picked up the chocolate bar again had another bite i have to say something and you might want the second emergency bar after i do i cant buy coincidence on this i cant rationalize it all the three of usвђand flynn your brother now flynns two best friends and one of those friends is a former lover of yours that makes a very tight circle dana stared at her just let me go on record as saying i really hate that part do you have another bottle of this wine i do rack above the fridge ill either walk home or call flynn to pick me up but im planning on being toasted by the time i leave ill drive you home zoe offered go ahead and get toastedвђas long as youre ready to leave by ten your hair looks fabulous swaying a little from trying to keep dana company with wine consumption malory waved her fingers at danas new hair the subtle blond highlights accented danas dusky skin tone and dark eyes and as a result of whatever else zoes magic fingers had done the long straight sweep looked sleeker glossier ill have to take your word im pretty blind mine looks fabulous too zoe youre a genius yes i am flushed with success zoe nodded at both of them use that night cream sample i gave you for the next couple of days she told malory let me know what you think come on dana lets see if i can pour you into the car kay i really like you guys with a drunk and sentimental smile dana threw her arms around each of them i cant think of anybody id rather be in the big mess with and when its over we should have hair and drinking nights once a month like a book club good idea night mal you want some help with her nope zoe wrapped a supporting arm around danas waist ive got her im stronger than i look ill call you tomorrow me too did i tell you jordan hawke is a jerk only about five hundred times zoe guided dana toward the car you can tell me again on the drive home malory closed the door carefully locked it then wove her way to the bedroom unable to resist she stood in front of the mirror and experimented with the new cut tossing her hair tilting her head at different angles she couldnt tell not exactly what zoe had done but whatever it was it was right could be she mused it paid to keep her mouth shut for a change instead of directing the hairdressers every snip maybe she should feel guilty and drink wine every time she visited the salon she could try the combination in other areas of her life the dentist ordering in restaurants men no no not men she scowled at herself in the mirror if you didnt direct men they directed you besides she wasnt going to think about men she didnt need men she didnt even like men at the moment in the morning she would spend an hour working on the puzzle of the key then she would dress very carefully very professionally a suit she decided the dove gray with the white shell no no the red yes the red suit powerful and professional she raced to the closet scanned her wardrobe which was arranged precisely according to function and color with the red suit in hand she danced back to the mirror held it in front of her james she began trying out a sympathetic yet aloof expression im so sorry to hear that the gallery is going to hell in a handbasket without me come back well i dont know if thats possible i have several other offers oh please please dont grovel its embarrassing she fluffed her hair yes i know pamela is the devil we all know that well i suppose if things are that bad ill have to help you out now now dont cry everythings going to be fine everythings going to be perfect again just as it should be she snickered and pleased that all would soon be right with her world again turned away to prepare for bed she undressed and lectured herself into putting her clothes away instead of just throwing them around the room when she heard the knock on her front door she was wearing only a white silk sleep shirt assuming it was one of her friends whod forgotten something she turned off the locks and opened the door and blinked at a grimfaced flynn i want to talk to you maybe i dont want to talk to you she responded trying to enunciate each word instead of slurring them together we need to work this out if were going toвђ he took a good look at her the wonderfully tumbled hair the glowing face the slim curves under clingy white silk and the vague and glassy look of her eyes what youre drunk im only half drunk which is completely my business and my right your sister is fully drunk but youve no cause for concern as zoe who is not in any way drunk is driving her home it takes countless beers or an entire bottle of wine to get dana completely drunk that seems to be correct and in this case it was wine now that weve established that ill remind you im only half drunk come in and take advantage of me he let out what mightve been a laugh and decided the best place for his handsвђwell not the best but the smartestвђwas his pockets thats a delightful invitation sweetie butвђ she solved the problem by gripping his shirt firmly and giving a good yank come on in she repeated then fixed her mouth on his chapter eleven flynn found himself shoved back against the door tripping over his own feet as it swung shut behind him most of the blood had drained out of his head by the time shed gone to work on his throat with lips and teeth whoa wait mal dont wanna wait her hands got as busy as her mouth had she actually thought she didnt like men she certainly liked this one so much that she wanted to gobble him up in quick and greedy bites how come people always say you gotta wait i want you toвђ she clamped her teeth on his earlobe then whispered a creative demand oh god he wasnt entirely sure if it was a prayer of thanks or a plea for help but he was sure his willpower had a very specific limit and he was fast approaching it okay okay lets just calm down here a minute malory she slid her body over his and when her eager fingers danced down down he felt his eyes do a slow roll to the back of his head now hold on i am she tipped her head back to send him a wicked grin ha ha yeah you are he closed his hands over her wrists and with no little regret lifted her busy hands to his shoulders he was out of breath and hard as stone weve got a choice here you can hate me in the morning or i can her eyes sparkled up at him and her lips were curved in a feline smile that had his throat going dry god youre pretty when youre half plowed you should go lie down now okay she pressed herself against him gave her hips a suggestive little grind lets slippery knots of lust tied and tangled in his belly im just going to back away from the beautiful drunk woman uhuh she rose on her toes to rub her lips over his again felt the desperate plunge of his heart youll never make it out the door i know what im doing and i know what i want does that scare you pretty much yeah honey i came by to talk to you about something im currently incapable of remembering why dont i make us some coffee and wellвђ i guess i have to do everything in one fluid motion she slid the sleep shirt over her head and tossed it aside oh sweet jesus her body was pink and whiteвђdeliciousвђwith that elegant cloud of hair tumbling down to tease her breasts her eyes deeply blue and suddenly full of knowledge fixed on his as she stepped close to him again her arms had wound around his neck and her mouth was a hot silky temptation on his dont be afraid she whispered ill take very good care of you i bet somehow his hands had gotten lost in the sexy mass of her hair his body was a maze of aches and needs and reason couldnt find the exit malory im no hero who wants one with a laugh she nipped at his jaw lets be bad flynn lets be really bad since you put it that way he swung her around reversing their position so she was trapped between the door and his body i hope to god you remember whose idea this was and that i tried toвђ shut up and take me if he was going to hell hed make damn sure it was worth the trip with his hands on her hips he jerked her up to her toes and caught the light of triumph on her face an instant before his mouth crushed hers it was like holding a lit fuse all sizzle and spark a dangerous woman who knew her own power who was testing his her skin was already flushed and hot and as he took his hands over her the soft sounds she made in her throat werent whimpers but urgings already desperate he buried his face in her hair pressed his hand between her thighs she erupted a throaty cry a bite of nails on his back a lightning surge of hips then she was dragging his shirt over his head scraping her teeth over his shoulder as her quick hands yanked at his jeans in bed though he had wild erotic visions of taking her against the door the pleasure would end too soon that way instead he circled her prying off his shoes as they bumped into a corner of the wall she didnt care where she only wanted to go on feeling this wild whiplash of power having these wonderful pulsing aches continue to dominate her body she was spinning in some mad world of exquisite sensations and every touch every taste added more she wanted to feel his muscles quiver to feel the heat pumping out of his pores and to know deep inside that she had caused it they fell on the bed breathless and insane and rolled an erotic tangle of limbs on the pretty pastel covers she laughed when he clamped his hands on hers and yanked her arms over her head gotta slow down a little he managed she arched up to him why because im going to do things to you and that takes time she ran her tongue over her top lip where would you like to start his belly tightened to the edge of pain he lowered his head to start with her mouth plump and soft hot and wet he drugged himself with her until they both trembled he slid his tongue over the hollow of her throat where her pulse hammered then down slowly until he could taste the delicate scented breasts and when he caught her nipple between his teeth and tugged she began to moan she gave herself over to the pleasure the sheer bliss of being savored and exploited her body was open to him to that ravenous mouth those questing hands when he took her up she flew free riding the hot punch of air tumbling down again to draw him closer she could see him in the light that spilled from the hallway and her heart leaped at the intensity on his face as he watched her love and delight raced through her here was an answer the answer to at least one question he was for her and she rose up wrapping herself around him with a kind of giddy glee their mouths met again in a deep shuddering kiss that had his heart flipping over inside his chest she smelled of something secret of seduction those quick catchy gasps coming from her sliced through him like tiny silver knives he wanted to bury himself inside her until the world ended and when her hands cruised over him when those soft sounds of approval hummed in her throat as she explored him he wondered if it already had she scraped her nails over his belly and had him quivering like a stallion i want you i want you inside me tell me you want me i do i want you he lowered his mouth to hers once more malory from the first minute her lips curved under his i know she arched her hips now he braced himself then a sliver of sanity cut through the madness oh christ condom wallet pants where are my pants mmm its okay she rolled over him nipping at his shoulder as she pulled open the nightstand drawer condom drawer nightstand have i mentioned that i love practical prepared women why dont i help you on with this she took her sweet time so that he had to fist his hands in the tangled spread to keep himself from flying to the ceiling the woman had wicked hands he thought and bit back a groan wonderful wicked hands she rose over him shook her hair back and smiled now she said he moved fast flipping her onto her back pinning her body with his now he repeated and drove deep inside her he watched the shock race over her face felt the waves of it vibrate through him they trembled there each caught on some fine edge and with her eyes locked on his she began to move a rising up a falling away so smooth so fluid it was like sliding through silk her name echoed in his head like a song or a prayer he clung to the echo of it clung to the frayed threads of control as she shattered around him she fell apart oh god the most wonderful sensation a losing of self then a gathering back her mind hazed and with one last liquid sigh she rode the final crest locking him close she took him with her he didnt want to think thinking under the current circumstances couldnt be productive it would be much better for all involved if he kept his mind a solid blank and just enjoyed the superior sensation of having a soft sexy woman under him if he didnt think he might be able to keep her there long enough to make love with her again then thered be another period of notthinking who knew how long he could keep up that pattern maybe indefinitely when she moved under him a lazy kind of stretch it seemed a very good possibility i want some water she stroked a hand down his back you thirsty not if it means moving for the next five or ten years she gave his ass a light pinch m thirsty so you have to move okay but he nuzzled her hair a moment longer ill get it вђњthats all right she gave him a little shove and wiggled out from under him ill get it she stopped by the closet on the way out and he had a glimpse of something thin and silky billowing out over that gorgeous body before she strolled out the door maybe im dreaming maybe this is just some wishfulfillment fantasy and im really in my own bed with moe snoring on the floor or maybe not he sat up scrubbed his hands over his face and unfortunately began to think hed come over because hed been churned up pissed off and generally confused by the scene theyd had in his office that morning and now he was in her bed naked and theyd just had incredible sex when shed been drunk well maybe not drunk but impaired he shouldve walked away he shouldve found the moral fortitude to walk away from a naked willing woman when that naked willing womans inhibitions had been erased by alcohol and what was he a saint when she walked back in wearing nothing but a short red robe he scowled at her im a human being im a man yes i think weve established that beyond doubt she sat on the side of the bed offered him the glass shed brought in you were naked he took the glass gulped down water you were all over me she cocked her head and your point is if you regret thisвђ why should i she took the glass back swallowed the stingy sip hed left behind i got you where i wanted you id been drinking flynn but i knew what i was doing okay then okay its just that after what you said this morningвђ that im in love with you she set the glass on the coaster she kept on her nightstand i am in love with you emotions ran through him all too hot and fast to decipher but layered over all of them was sheer sweaty fear malory when she only continued to study him with a quiet patience the fear began to trickle into his throat listen i dont want to hurt you then dont she gave his hand a comforting little squeeze actually youve got a lot more to worry about than i do i do yes you do i love you which means naturally i want you to love me back i dont always get what i want but i usually find a way to get it almost always in fact so to my way of thinking youll end up in love with me since the idea of that scares you youve got more to worry about than i do she trailed a hand over his chest youre in really good shape for somebody who works at a desk he grabbed her hand before it could head south lets stay focused here the whole love deal just isnt in the cards for me you had a bad experience she leaned in to give him a light kiss that sort of things bound to leave a mark lucky for you i can be patient and gentle she added as she shifted then straddled him and very very determined oh boy maloryвђ why dont you just lie back and enjoy the fringe benefits of being courted aroused flustered grateful he let her nudge him back sort of hard to argue with that as well as a waste of time she unbelted her robe let it slide from her shoulders she ran her hands up his chest then caught his face in them before she kissed him senseless im going to marry you she murmured and laughed when his body jerked in shock dont worry youll get used to the idea still laughing she smothered his unintelligible protest with her mouth she felt so good not just the sex malory thought as she sang in the shower though that could hardly be discounted she always felt good confident directed when she had a clear welldefined purpose the quest for the key was so nebulous that it confused as much as it energized but convincing flynn that they belonged together was crystal clear a goal she could get her teeth into she hadnt a clue why shed fallen in love with him and thats what told her it was real he certainly didnt fit her image of her dream man he didnt cook gourmet meals or speak fluent french or love spending his free time in museums he didnt wear tailored suits or read poetry at least she didnt think he read poetry shed always planned to fall in love with a man who had some of those attributes and naturally in her outline the right man would court her charm her seduce her then pledge his undying love at the perfect romantic moment before flynn she had analyzed and dissected every relationship picked at every flaw until shed worked a dozen holes into the cloth of it and in the end that hadnt mattered because none of them had been right she had no desire to worry about the flaws with flynn she only knew her heart had gone splat when shed least expected it and she liked it she had to admit she also liked the idea that he was spooked it was intriguing and it was challenging to be the pursuer for a change to be the aggressor and to keep a man slightly off balance with honesty when hed finally managed to stumble out of bed sometime around three in the morning shed sensed his fear and confusion just as much as shed sensed his desire to stay let him stew about it for a while she decided she amused herself by calling the local florist and ordering a dozen red roses to be delivered to his office she almost danced out of her apartment to keep her appointment with james well arent we bright and sassy this morning tod commented when she swung into the gallery arent we just she caught his face in her hand and gave him a noisy kiss is he in upstairs hes expecting you sugarpie you look fabulous good enough to eat i feel good enough to eat she patted his cheek then glided up the steps she knocked on the office door stepped in hello james malory he rose from the desk both hands extended thank you so much for coming in of course she took the chair he gestured toward how are things with a pained expression on his face he sat im sure youve heard about the difficulty pamela had with mrs k a terrible misunderstanding which im afraid may have cost the gallery a valued client malory forced herself to appear concerned even while her mind jumped with glee yes im so sorry that things haveвђ dont say gone to hell in a handbasket she ordered herself and continued without missing a beat been a bit difficult during this transition yes difficult pamelas very enthusiastic about the gallery but im afraid shes still learning i see now that i gave her too much autonomy too quickly to keep from punching her fists in the air malory sedately folded her hands on her knee she has a very precisely defined vision yes yes he worried his gold pen fiddled with his tie i think her strengths may lie in a more peripheral area than actual clientstaff relations i realize theres friction between the two of you cool she reminded herself i also had a very precisely defined vision which unfortunately clashed with hers so yes there was considerable friction well he cleared his throat perhaps i let pamela influence me in that regard i felt sincerely that it might be time for you to explore your talents to experiment however i see i didnt take into consideration your affection and loyalty to the gallery or how being nudged out of the nest as it were might upset you i admit it did but she tempered her statement with the sweetest of smiles i have considered all of this over the last couple of weeks id very much like you to come back malory to resume your managerial duties at a ten percent increase in salary this is so unexpected she had to imagine her butt glued to the chair so she couldnt leap up and do a victory dance and im flattered butвђ can i be frank of course the friction we spoke of is still going to be there i have to admit i hadnt been happy here the last several months yourвђ nudging me out of the nest she said was painful and frightening but once i was out i had the opportunity to look back and realize that the nest had becomeвђ lets say a little crowded i understand he held up his hands then clasped then together under his chin i can promise that pamela wont interfere with your authority or with the policies that have long been in effect here youll have the last word barring mine of course on acquisitions and displays on featured artists and so on just as before it was exactly what shed wanted more than she realized when she calculated the bonus in salary she would be back doing what she did best and with considerable financial reward and she would have the personal if unattractive satisfaction of putting pamelas nose out of joint she would have won without firing a shot thank you james i cant tell you how much it means to me to know you want me back that you have confidence in me wonderful wonderful he beamed at her you can start right away today if thats good for you itll be like the last two weeks never even happened like they never even happened her stomach gave a mighty pitch then suddenly it was as if sensible malory stepped to the side and listened in shock as reckless malory took charge but i cant come back ill always be grateful for everything you taught me all the opportunities you gave meвђthe last being pushing me out the door so id have to leave my comfort zone im going to open my own business oh my god she thought im going to open my own business it wont be anything as grand as the gallery smaller moreвђ she nearly said accessible then managed to backtrack lowkey she continued im going to focus primarily on local artists and craftspeople malory you must be aware how much time and energy that sort of thing consumes and more the financial risk involved there was no doubt about it james was panicking i know i dont seem to be as worried about taking risks as i used to be in fact im excited by the prospect of taking them but thank you thank you so much for all youve done for me i really have to go now she got up quickly afraid she would change her mind here was her safety net spread out ready to catch her and she was swinging out beyond it to where the ground was very hard and very far away malory i wish youd take some time to think this through do you know what happens when you always look before you leap she reached out and touched his hand before hurrying toward the door you hardly ever make the jump she didnt waste time malory hunted down the address zoe had relayed and pulled into a double driveway behind danas car good location she decided sliding practical malory back into place there would be some pedestrian traffic and reasonable parking for people who needed it the house was charming homey she thought and the three of them working together could certainly perk it up paint the porch plant some trailing vines zoe probably already had a horde of ideas on that the walkway needed to be repaired or replaced she noted that detail down on the clipboard shed brought with her window boxes yes planted seasonally and wouldnt it snazz up the entrance to have a stainedglass window replace the clear one over the front door something designed specifically for them she had some contacts in that area still making notes she opened the front door the foyer could be a showcase for all three businesses yes there was a way to do that with clever placement and displays keeping it friendly and informal while advertising their goods and services the light was good the floors a treasure once they were refinished the walls well paint would solve that she wandered through delighted with the rooms they did seem to tumble together she thought just as zoe had said an excellent way to blend businesses after filling pages with notes she strolled back just as dana and zoe came down the stairs eventually id like to refit the master bath with a swedish shower and aromatherapy station zoe was saying but for nowвђ malory hi hi malory lowered her clipboard im in i knew it with a whoop zoe flew down the stairs and grabbed her i just knew it did you see have you been through isnt it great isnt it perfect yes yes and yes i havent been upstairs yet but down hereвђ i love it she said dana stood on the stairs her lips pursed in speculation whyd you change your mind i dont know at least i dont know in any reasonable logical sense when james offered me my job back with a raise i thought thank god everythingll be back to normal now she let out a breath and hugging the clipboard to her chest spun in a circle then i dont know i heard myself telling him i couldnt come back i was starting my own business i guess i realized i dont want everything to be back to normal i want to do this and i want to do it with both of you thats all i know weve all got to be really sure zoe tell her what you told me about the house well the owners willing to rent it but theyre looking for a buyer the fact is it makes more financial sense to buy it buy it the gorge she was leaping across suddenly widened how much zoe named a price then hurried on when malory paled but thats just the asking price plus ive been doing some figuring and if you compare the mortgage payment at current interest rates over a thirtyyear term to the proposed monthly rent its not that much more and its equity its an investment then theres the tax break dont get her started on the tax break dana warned your brains will start leaking out of your ears just take my word for it shes got it covered we need a lawyer to draw up a legal partnership zoe continued then we pool our money we have enough for the down payment especially once we negotiate the asking price down and still theres enough left over to hold us well take a loan for the property and the startup costs we can do it i believe you i think thats why my stomach hurts malory pressed a hand to it then looked at dana buy god help us buy she agreed i guess we should shake or something zoe held out a hand wait before we do i should tell you something malory cleared her throat i had sex with flynn last night three times three dana abruptly sat down on the stairs ah go flynn youre okay with that im his sister not his mother but she rubbed at her temple werent you drunk last night no you were i was just buzzed ill add that being aware i was buzzed he attempted pretty strongly to be a gentleman and step back thats so sweet zoe offered even after i got naked and jumped him thatsвђ wow with a laugh malory patted zoes shoulder but dana remained silent i didnt get naked and jump him just because i was buzzed and well horny im in love with him i dont have the whys on that any more than i know why i want to own this house with the two of you it just is from somewhere deep inside me it just is im in love with him and im going to marry him malory this is wonderful leading with her romantic heart zoe flung her arms around her friend im so happy for you dont hand out the orange blossoms yet i still have to convince him he cant live without me she stepped forward im in love with him dana im getting that i know this might complicate our friendship and any business relationship we might plan on having and if it does then im sorry ill back out of the friendship ill back out of the business plans but im going to keep flynn whether he likes it or not danas lips twitched as she got to her feet i guess hes toast we going to shake hands on this deal and get us a lawyer or what chapter twelve she didnt know what she was feeling she wasnt sure what she was doing but little snags like that had never stopped dana before the minute she could manage it she tracked down flynn she missed him at the paper followed his trail to the vets where she was told shed missed him and moe by fifteen minutes the irritation of that had her deciding she was angry with him though she had no concrete reason to be but by the time she arrived at his house she was enjoying her temper she slammed the door and stalked into the living room where both her brother and his dog were sprawled out like the dead i need to talk to you casanova dont yell flynn remained on the sofa on the floor beside him moe whimpered moe needed his shots weve both been traumatized go away come back tomorrow now right now before i find a sharp implement to stick in your rump whats the idea of banging malory when you know perfectly well she has to keep her mind on the goal i dont know mightve had something to do with my tripping and falling over her naked body and it wasnt banging i object to the term banging which is beside the fact that its none of your goddamn business its my business when shes just become my business partner when prior to that we were partners of another sort and its my business because i like her a lot and shes in love with you this shows a remarkable lack of taste but is nonetheless the way it is guilt crept slyly into his belly its not my fault she thinks shes in love with me i didnt say thinks shes not an idiot despite her lousy taste in men she knows her own mind and heart and if youre not taking her feelings into consideration before you unzip your flyвђ for christs sake give me a break he sat up now dropped his head in his hands she wont listen to me and she did the unzipping you were just an innocent bystander theres no point in blasting me about this ive spent considerable time blasting myself for all the good thats done i dont know what the hell to do she sat on the table leaned toward him what do you want to do i dont know she sent me flowers excuse me she sent me a dozen red roses this morning the card said think of me how the hell could i not think of her roses the idea just tickled her where are they he squirmed um i put them up in the bedroom goofy this role reversal its just not right its not natural i think it flies in the face of countless rules of scientific order i need to put things back on track somehow back on track stop grinning at me youre hooked i am not hooked and thats another term i object to someone with a degree in library science should be able to find more appropriate terms shes perfect for you she kissed his cheek congratulations im not mad at you anymore i dont care who youre mad at and its not a matter of whos perfect for me im not perfect for anyone im a slob im inconsiderate and selfish i like having my life loose and unstructured youre a slob no question but youre neither inconsiderate nor selfish its that inconsiderate and selfish bitch lily who put that in your head if you buy that youre just stupid so are you wishing a stupid slob on your new pal maybe i love you flynn man im getting a lot of that lately he tapped a finger on her nose love you too no say i love you come on all three words flynn choke them out i love you now go away im not finished he groaned and fell back on the couch were trying to take a nap here for our mental health she never loved you flynn she liked who you were in the valley she liked being seen with you and she liked picking your brain you may be stupid but youre pretty smart in some areas she used you and thats supposed to make me feel better knowing i let myself be used its supposed to make you stop blaming yourself for what happened with lily im not blaming myself i hate women he showed his teeth in a vicious smile i just want to bang them now will you go away youve got red roses in your bedroom oh man hooked she repeated and drilled a finger in his belly he took the sisterly poke like a man let me ask you something did anybody like lily no he hissed out a breath stared up at the ceiling just checking the knock on the door had him cursing and her bounding up ill get it she sang it out maybe its more flowers amused she pulled open the door and it was her turn to curse with more imagination and viciousness than flynn had managed hey nice mouth stretch jordan hawke handsome as the devil and to danas mind twice as evil gave her a wink and strolled back into her life she considered for one brief heady moment tripping him she grabbed his arm instead imagined twisting it into cartoon taffy hey nobody asked you in you living here now he shifted his body in a slow easy move hed always had moves at six three he had five inches on her shed once found that fact exciting but now it was simply irritating he hadnt gotten fat or ugly or fallen victim to malepattern baldness and wasnt that just too damn bad no he was still lanky and gorgeous and all that thick black hair remained sexily rumpled around a tanned rawboned face set off by sizzling blue eyes his mouth was full and sculpted and she had reason to know very inventive it curved now in a lazy mocking smile that made her want to bloody it looking good dane he smoothed a hand over her hair and had her head jerking back before she could stop herself hands off and no im not living here what do you want a date with julia roberts a chance to jam with bruce springsteen and the e street band and a really cold beer how about you вђњto read the details of your slow painful death what are you doing here annoying you apparently but thats just a side benefit flynn home he didnt wait for an answer but stepped away from her and headed for the living room moe roused himself sent out a halfhearted growl thats it moe dana said cheerfully sic im obviously unconcerned about being attacked by an enormous mass of canine jordan crouched down so this is the famous moe veterinary trauma forgotten moe scrambled up he charged flopped both front paws on jordans shoulders and gave him a welcoming kiss dana could only grind her teeth as jordans laugh joined moes happy bark youre a big guy arent you look at that face he rumpled moes fur scratched his ears then glanced over at flynn hows it going okay didnt know you were coming so soon had some time got a beer sure i hate to interrupt this emotional heartfelt reunion danas voice was an ice pick aimed at the nape of jordans neck but what the hells he doing here spending some time with friends in my hometown jordan got to his feet still okay to bunk here absolutely flynn unfolded himself from the couch man its good to see you same here big house great dog bad couch with a laugh flynn swung his arms around his oldest friend really good to see you for a moment just an instant as she watched the two grown men hug danas heart softened whatever else she could say about jordan hawkeвђand the list was longвђ he was and had always been flynns as much brother she supposed as friend then those hot blue eyes met hers and baked her heart hard again how about that beer stretch we can play catchup and you can tell me how you got roped into looking for imaginary keys she shot her brother one accusatory look then jerked her chin up unlike the two of you i actually have things to do dont you want to see the painting that nearly stopped her but giving in to curiosity wouldve spoiled her exit she continued to the door and strode out without a backward glance she had things to do all right the first of which was to carve a wax doll in jordans image and stick pins in sensitive areas did you have to piss her off flynn demanded my breathing pisses her off and knowing that put a little hole in his gut how come shes not living here the house is big enough she wont with a shrug flynn led the way back to the kitchen wants her own space and blahblah you know dana once her minds set you cant move her with a forklift tell me about it because moe was dancing around flynn dug out a dog biscuit and flipped it to him before getting the beers you brought the painting yeah i dont know what its going to tell you me either im hoping it tells malory something so when am i going to meet this malory jordan leaned back against the counter i dont know soon i thought there was a deadline on this deal jordan said yeah yeah weve still got a couple weeks problem pal no maybe weve gotten tangled up and its getting really serious really fast i cant think whats she like smart funny sexy you put sexy third jordan gestured with his beer thats serious what else goaloriented id say he began to pace with a kind of tidy nature honest not much gameplaying there grounded you could say shes grounded which is why her getting wound up in this key business makes it all seem possible shes got blue eyes big blue eyes flynn sighed again the physical falls well down the list youre stuck on her uneasy flynn lifted his beer there are degrees of being stuck true enough but if shes got you this worried id say youre already in to your knees and sinking why dont you give her a call she can come get a look at the painting and i can get a look at her lets give it till tomorrow youre scared of her make that up to your waist and sinking shut up i just think itd be smart for brad to bring his painting over let the three of us give them both a good look see what we come up with without the female element works for me you got any food around here not really but ive got all the takeout and delivery places on speed dial take your pick surprise me ill go get my stuff it wasnt so different from their youth unless you considered that the living room where they sprawled belonged to one of them rather than to a parent since the choice had been left to flynn they were eating italian but the beer had been upgraded to a bottle of johnnie walker blue that brad had brought with him the paintings were propped side by side against the wall while the three of them sat on the floor moe took the couch i dont know much about art flynn began but you know what you like brad finished i wasnt going to stoop to a clichг actually its a valid statement jordan agreed art by its very nature is subjective warhols campbells soup can dalis melting watch da vincis mona lisa its all in the eye of the beholder as impossible to compare monets water lilies with picassos lady in blue as it is to compare dashiell hammett and steinbeck its all in the style purpose and perception flynn rolled his eyes toward brad what i was going to say before the two of you went off on that little intellectual riff is that it seems to me that the same person painted both of these or if it was two different people one was emulating the others style oh brad swirled the liquor in his glass and grinned okay then ill go along with that and what does that tell us itll tell us a lot if we have jordans painting tested we already know the one at warriors peak and brads were done more than five hundred years apart we need to know where jordans fits in fifteenth century flynn turned his head stared at jordan you had it dated already a couple years after i bought it i needed to get some stuff insured turned out it was worth several times what i paid for it kinda weird when you think of it as the gallerys got a rep for being pricey whyd you buy it brad asked him i dont know how many times ive asked myself that i dont even know why i went in there that day it wasnt one of my usual stops then i saw it and it just grabbed me that moment that breath just before destiny between innocence and power hell pull the sword free you know it and in that moment the world changes camelots born arthurs fate is sealed hell unite a people be betrayed by a woman and a friend and sire the man wholl kill him in this moment hes a boy in the next hell be a king some would argue that he was born a king jordan shook his head at brads statement not until he put his hands on the hilt of the sword he could have walked away from it i wonder if he would have if hed known what was coming glory and grandeur sure and a slice of peace but then deceit deception war and an early death well thats cheerful flynn started to pour another drink then he stopped looked back at the paintings wait a minute maybe youre on to something in the other youve got the results after that moment of destiny you were talking about would the godking have married the mortal conceived three daughters if hed known thenfate is it about choices which direction we take and if it is brad put in it doesnt tell us much it gives us a theme and if we make the leap that the paintings are clues to the location of the keys then we have to follow the theme maybe the first is in a place where a decision was made one that changed the course of lives flynn jordan hesitated swirled his drink you seriously believe these keys exist thats right and if you guys had been around since the beginning of this youd have come around to that by now theres no way to explain it jordan no more than you can explain why that boy was the only person in the world who could pull excalibur from the stone how about you jordan asked brad im trying to keep an open mind youve got to add up the coincidences or what appear to be coincidences you and i own those paintings were all back in the valley and so are they flynns involved personally involved with two of the women who were invited to warriors peak jordan and dana used to be an item and i bought the painting because i was caught by that faceвђ zoes face it just about knocked me on my ass and lets keep that little tidbit among the three of us youre interested in zoe flynn asked yeah which is dandy since she appears to have taken an instant dislike to me which i dont get he added with some heat women dont dislike me right off the bat no it usually takes a little time jordan agreed then they dislike you on the contrary im a very smooth operator usually yeah i remember how smooth you were with marsha kent i was seventeen brad argued fuck you do you still have her footprint on your ass jordan wanted to know you still got danas on your balls jordan winced tit for tat there question does that painting look as much like the other two as it does like dana oh yeah flynn told him different dos but the faces are dead on no question as to the age on it brad none jordan sat silent a moment nursing his drink studying danas face so still so pale so empty okay ill take a side step out of logic and into the zone there are six of us and three keys and what just over two weeks left to find the first one he reached for the bottle again itll be a snap beyond the puzzle to be solved flynn thought it was good to have his friends back good to know even as he crawled into bed in the early hours of the morning that jordan was crawling onto the mattress in the spare room and brad was already zonked out on the sofa downstairs guarded by moe it had always seemed to him that thered been nothing they couldnt do together whether it had been fighting off imaginary alien invaders learning how to unhook a girls bra onehanded or driving crosscountry in a secondhand buick theyd always come through for each other when jordans mother had died both he and brad had been there holding vigil during those endless nights at the hospital when lily had dumped him the one constant flynn had been sure of was his friends through good times and not so good times he thought sentimentally theyd been there for each other physical distance never meant a damn but it was better a hell of a lot better to have them here since they were the first key was practically in the lock he closed his eyes and instantly fell asleep the house was dark and bitterly cold he could see his breath puff out in thin white vapors as he wandered aimlessly down dark corridors that turned that twisted there was a storm blasting a crash and boom that shook the air and shot out fast angry light zigzagging in the dark in the dream he knew he walked the halls of warriors peak though he could barely see he recognized it and knew the turn of the corridor the feel of the wall under his trailing fingers though he had never walked there before he could see the rain whipping outside the secondstory window could see the way it glowed blue in the lightning strikes and he saw the ghost of his own face blurry in the glass he called out and his voice echoed on and on like a rolling wave there was no one to answer and yet he knew he wasnt alone something walked those halls with him lurking just behind out of sight out of reach something dark that pushed him on up the stairs fear tripped into his heart doors lined the corridor but all of them were locked he tried each one turning tugging the knob with fingers gone stiff with cold whatever stalked him crept closer he could hear it breathe now horrible somehow liquid pulls on the air that merged with his own rapid panting he had to get out get away so he began to run loping through the stormslashed dark while what pursued him followed with rapid clicks on the wood like eager claws he burst out onto a parapet into the storm where lightning speared down and set the stone to smoking the air burned and froze and the rain pelted him like shards of glass with nowhere left to run with fear a cold snake crawling in his belly he turned to fight but the shadow was so huge so close it covered him before he could raise his fists the cold tore through him drove him to his knees he felt something ripped from himвђwild unspeakable pain dull shocking horror and knew it was his soul flynn woke shuddering with cold clammy with the dregs of terror and with the sun pouring in onto his face struggling for breath he sat up hed had his share of nightmares but never one this intense never one where hed actually felt pain could still feel it he thought as he gritted his teeth against the sharp stabs in his chest and belly he tried to tell himself it was the combination of pizza and whiskey and late night but he didnt believe it as the pain dulled he slid gingerly out of bed walked as cautiously as an old man to the bathroom and turned the shower on hot he was freezing he reached up to swing open the mirrored medicine cabinet for aspirin and caught a glimpse of his face the pallor of his skin the glassy edge of shock in his eyes were bad enough but they were nothing compared to the rest he was soaking wet his hair was drenched his skin beaded with water like a man whod been out in a storm he thought and lowered himself to the seat of the toilet as his legs gave way not just a nightmare hed been inside warriors peak hed been out on the parapet and he hadnt been alone this was more than a quest for magic keys more than a puzzle to be solved with the promise of a pot of gold at the end there was something else here something powerful dark and powerful he was going to find out what the hell was going on before any of them got in any deeper he stepped into the shower and let the hot water beat on him until it penetrated the chill in his bones then calmer he downed some aspirin pulled his sweatpants on he would go down and make coffee then hed be able to think once his head was clear he would roust both of his friends and get their take maybe it was time for the three of them to go up to warriors peak and get the truth out of rowena and pitte he was halfway down when the bell rang and moe raced out barking like the hounds of hell on speed okay okay shut up johnnie walker hadnt given flynn a hangover but the nightmare had stepped up to the plate and knocked one home he grabbed moe by the collar yanked back as he pulled the door open with his other hand she looked like a sunbeam it was his only clear thought as he stared at malory dressed in a pretty blue suit that showed off her legs she smiled at him then stepped forward wrapped her arms around him good morning she said and by pressing her lips to his drained even that single thought out of his mind his fingers went limp on moes collar then fell away from it to lift up dive into her hair the aches and dread hed awakened with fell away as well in that one moment he felt as if nothing would ever be beyond his reach again moe gave up trying to shoehorn himself between them and settled on leaping and barking for attention christ jesus hennessy cant you get your dog toвђ at the top of the stairs jordan trailed off below him stood his friend and the woman bathed in morning sunlight and drowning in each other the fact was even when flynn eased back from the embrace and glanced up he had the look of a man going under for the third time blissfully morning sorry to interrupt you must be malory yes i must be her brain was a bit muddled from the kiss but she was pretty sure she was staring up at a greatlooking guy wearing nothing but black boxer shorts im sorry i didnt realize flynn had companyвђ oh her brain cleared youre jordan hawke im a big fan thanks hold it flynn held up a hand as jordan started down maybe you could go put some pants on sure come on back i need to let moe out giving her hand a tug flynn managed to dislodge her from the spot shed frozen in to stare at jordan but she dug in again at the living room entrance brad was facedown on the couch with one arm and one leg drooping off he was dressed like jordan though his boxers were white it was interesting to note malory thought that the scion of the vane empire had an excellent butt slumber party she ventured guys dont have slumber parties we just hang out moe flynn called the dog whod wandered in to lick the portion of brads face that wasnt smashed into the cushions brads always been able to sleep through anything so it would seem its nice to have your friends back in town yeah he pulled her back to the kitchen moe beat them to it and stood dancing at the back door as if hed been waiting for hours he streaked out the instant flynn opened it why dont i make some coffee malory offered yeah youll make it just part of the service since the coffee can was already on the counter she measured enough for a full pot if you marry me id make the coffee every morning of course id expect you to take out the trash every day she tossed a grin over her shoulder i believe in sharing household chores uhhuh and theres the unlimited access to sex thats a big plus she laughed as she measured the water i like making you nervous i dont think ive ever made a man nervous before then againвђ she switched the pot on turned around ive never been in love with one before not like this maloryвђ im a very determined woman flynn oh yeah thats coming through loud and clear he stepped back even as she moved in on him i just think we shouldвђ what she trailed her hands up his chest see i cant remember once you start looking at me i take that as a good sign she touched her lips lightly to his im already making a habit of this jordan said as he came in sorry its all right malory brushed her hair back as she turned away to find clean coffee mugs i just stopped in to ask flynn to marry me its nice to meet another of his friends are you in town for long depends what did he say when you asked him oh he has trouble making complete sentences when i bring up love and marriage odd isnt it seeing as hes a journalist you know im standing right here flynn pointed out is that coffee brad stumbled in blinked when he spotted malory then stumbled back out again sorry amused she wiped out the mugs this house is full of attractive men and ive seen all of them without their clothes on my life has certainly changed how do you take your coffee jordan blacks fine he leaned a hip on the counter while she poured flynn said you were smart funny and sexy he was right thanks ive got to run ive got an appointment to sign papers for what flynn asked the partnership papers with dana and zoe i thought dana told you told me what that were buying the house going into business what house what business the house on oak leaf and our business businesses i suppose my gallery danas bookstore zoes salon were calling it indulgence catchy jordan decided i cant believe im jumping in like this she pressed a hand to her stomach so unlike me im terrified well i dont want to be late she stepped over caught flynns baffled face in her hands and kissed him again ill call you later were hoping youll do a story on our new enterprise nice meeting you jordan really nice meeting you he watched her walk down the hall nice legs killer eyes and bright enough to light up a cave you got yourself a live wire there buddy his lips were still vibrating from hers now that ive got her what am i going to do with her youll figure it out he moved over to top off his coffee or she will yeah flynn rubbed a hand over his heart there was a flutter in it maybe thats what came from handling a live wire i need more coffee then i need to talk to you and brad you guys arent going to believe the dream i had last night chapter thirteen i cant believe they didnt show it to you dana dug the key to flynns house out of her purse neither can i i didnt even think malory added as annoyance propelled her from the car to flynns front door i just assumed jordan was having it shipped plus the three of them were half naked it was distracting dont blame yourself zoe gave her a bolstering pat on the back and anyway youll get to see it now theyre up to something dana muttered i can just feel it when the three of them get together theyre always up to something she unlocked the door pushed it open waited a beat nobodys home they were just getting up when i was here a couple of hours ago malory walked inside without a qualm and now that i think about it flynn did look like he was up to something theyll try to cut us out ready and willing to work herself into a rant on men in general dana tossed her keys back in her purse its typical behavior for their species oh we know better dont you worry your pretty head little lady i hate that firing up zoe hissed a breath between her teeth you know how an auto mechanic always gives you that smirk and says hell explain the problem to your husband dana sucked air through her nose that burns my ass if you ask me that bradley vanes at the bottom of it zoe set her fists on her hips hes just the type to try to run everything and everyone i pegged him from the getgo no itll be jordan dana kicked a shoe out of her way hes an instigator its flynns responsibility malory disagreed its his house theyre his friends andвђ oh my god light slanted across both paintings as they stood propped carelessly against the wall just where flynn had left them her heart squeezed with admiration and envy at the sight she walked toward them slowly as she might a lover who both dazzled and titillated her throat ached as she knelt on the floor in front of them theyre beautiful zoe said from behind her theyre more gently malory lifted the portrait of arthur tilting it toward the light its not just talent talent can be technical achieve a kind of perfection of balance and proportion she came close to that she thought when she painted fell just short of technical perfection and miles away from the magic that made an image art its genius when youre able to take that talent beyond technique and into emotion she continued вђњto message or just to simple beauty when you have that you light up the world cant you feel his heart pounding she asked as she studied the young arthur his muscles quivering as he takes the hilt thats the power of the artist id give anythingвђanythingвђto be able to create like this a shiver ran through her twin snakes of hot and cold for a heartbeat her fingers seemed to burn and for that heartbeat something inside her opened and lit and she saw how it could be done must be done how she could explode on canvas into art the knowledge filled her to bursting left her breathless then was gone in an instant mal malory zoe crouched down took her shoulders whats wrong what nothing i got dizzy for a second your eyes went funny they went huge and dark it mustve been the light but she felt strangely queasy as she pulled her purse over and took out her magnifying glass using the natural light she began a slow careful study of each painting there was the shadow just the hint of a form lurking deep deep in the green of the forest and two figuresвђ a man and a womanвђwatching the boy the sword the stone from the far background from a chain at the womans waist hung three gold keys what do you think dana demanded i think weve got a couple of choices considering them malory sat back rolled her shoulders we can convince brad and jordan to have these sent to experts for verification of whether or not its the same artist and by doing so we risk this entire business getting out whats the other choice zoe asked her we can take my word for it everything i know everything ive studied and learned tells me the same person painted both of these the same person who painted the portrait at warriors peak if we go with that what do we do with it dana demanded we figure out what the paintings are telling us and we go back up to warriors peak we ask rowena and pitte how at least two of these works were done more than a century apart theres another part that goes with that zoe said quietly we accept the magic we believe i always have time to entertain three handsome men rowena all but purred it as she showed flynn brad and jordan into the parlor where the portrait of the daughters of glass dominated she paused waiting until all attention was focused on it i assume the painting interests you mr vane your family has quite an extensive and eclectic art collection im told he stared at the portrait at the figure carrying both a short sword and a little dog zoes eyes stared back at him yes we do and has the interest passed down to you it has as a matter of fact i believe i own another painting by this artist she sat a secret smile playing around her mouth as she spread the long skirts of her white dress is that so what a small world it gets smaller jordan put in i seem to have another painting that may be by this artist fascinating ah she gestured as a servant rolled a cart in coffee i assumed youd prefer it to tea american men arent much on tea are they you dont ask about the subject of the other paintings flynn sat beside her im sure youll tell me cream sugar black seems a waste of time when im pretty sure you already know whos the artist rowena she poured the coffee with a steady hand taking the liquid to within a half inch of the rim while her gaze stayed level with flynns did malory ask you to come here today no why the quest is hers as are the questions such matters have rules if she asked you to represent her thats a different thing altogether did you bring your dog yeah hes outside her face went wistful i dont mind if he comes in white dress big black dog you might want to rethink that rowena malory didnt ask us to come but she and the others know were helping them look into things its okay with them but you didnt tell them you were coming to speak with me men often make the mistake of assuming that a woman wishes to be relieved of responsibilities and details her face was open and friendly her voice carrying the lilt of a laugh why is that we didnt come here to discuss malefemale dynamics jordan began what else is there really man to man woman to woman certainly rowena continued with an elegant spread of her hands but it all comes down to people what they are to each other what theyll do for and to one another even art is only a representation of that in one form or another if malory has concerns or questions about the painting or paintings she must ask you wont find the key for her flynn its not for you i dreamed i was in this house last night only it wasnt a dream it was more he watched her eyes change go dark with shock or something else something bigger such a dream isnt unusual under the circumstances ive only been in the foyer and in two rooms in this place or had been until last night i can tell you how many rooms are on the second floor and that theres a staircase on the east side leading to the third that has a newel post carved like a dragon i couldnt see it well in the dark but i felt it wait please she rose quickly and hurried from the room вђњthis is some strange deal youve got going here flynn jordan poked at the pretty cookies arranged on a glass plate theres something familiar about that woman ive seen her somewhere before where brad demanded i dont know itll come to me hell of a looker a face like that you dont forget and why should she freak over you having a dream because freaks just what she did in her own classy way shes afraid brad walked closer to the portrait she went from sly to scared in a heartbeat she knows the answer to the paintings and she was having a good time toying with us about that until flynn dropped his dream adventure on her and i didnt even get to the best part flynn got to his feet to explore the room before rowena got back somethings off here you just getting that son flynn spared a glance at jordan as he opened a lacquered cabinet not just the already established off thats a woman in control he said with a jerk of his thumb toward the doorway cool confident sure of herself the woman who just took a flyer out of here wasnt any of those things man theres some highclass booze in here would you care for a drink mr hennessy though he winced a little flynn turned toward the doorway and spoke equably to pitte no thanks a little early for me yet he closed the cabinet hows it going rowena laid a hand on pittes arm before he could respond finish it she ordered flynn finish the dream lets talk quid pro quo inclining his head flynn walked back to sit on the sofa you want to hear about the rest of the dream and we want to know about the paintings i show you mine you show me yours you bargain with us flynn was amazed at the stunned outrage in pittes voice yeah its not permitted again rowena laid a hand on pittes arm but from the hot impatient look he sent her flynn didnt bank on her restraining him for long we cant give you answers just because you ask there are limits there are paths its important that we know what happened to you give me something back pitte snapped something out and though the language was a mystery to flynn he recognized an oath when he heard one following it was a bright flash an electric slice through the air warily flynn looked down at his lap and the banded stacks of hundreddollar bills that now rested there ah nice trick youve got to be kidding jordan had already leaped forward and now reached down and plucked up a stack of bills he fanned them then patted them against his palm as he stared at pitte definitely time for some answers do you require more pitte demanded and rowena turned on him with a kind of stunning female fury the words they hurled at each other were unintelligible gaelic flynn thought maybe welsh but the gist was clear enough their temper rocked the room okay take five with three determined strides brad moved forward stepped between them this isnt getting us anywhere his voice was calm and controlled and had both of them snarling at him still he stayed where he was and glanced back at flynn our host just pulledвђ how much looks like about five thousand five grand out of thin airвђand boy have i got some stockholders whod like to talk to you he seems to think you want cash for information do you tough as it is to turn down five thousand magic dollars no it stung he could admit it but flynn set the stack on the table im worried about three women who havent hurt anyone and im a little worried about myself i want to know whats going on вђњtell us the rest and well tell you what we can tell us freely rowena added as she moved back to flynn id prefer not to make you tell us irritated now flynn leaned forward make me her voice was winter cool against the heat of his when she spoke my dear i could make you quack like a duck but as i imagine your brave and sensible friend would say such an incident wouldnt accomplish anything you think we wish harm to you or to your women we dont we wish harm to none that i can tell you freely pitte she shifted angled her head youve insulted our guest with this crass display apologize apologize yes she sat again brushed at her skirts waited pitte bared his teeth he tapped his fingers restlessly on his thighs women are a plague to man arent they just jordan agreed im sorry to have offended you then he flicked a wrist the money vanished better theres no reasonable way to answer that question so ill ask one instead who the hell are you people flynn demanded were not here to answer your questions pitte walked over to the silver pot poured coffee into a dresden cup even a journalistвђwhich i warned you would be an annoyance he added as an aside to rowenaвђ вђshould be aware of certain rules of behavior when invited into someones home why dont i just tell you who you are flynn began then broke off as the delighted bark banged into the room seconds before moe arrived oh shit there he is rowena simply spread her arms in welcome and had them full of dog when the women walked into the room how nice how lovely its like a party sorry to burst in on you this way malory scanned the room then zeroed in on flynn but theres an issue of certain people thinking they should take over from the womenfolk thats not exactly true really and what would be exactly true just following a lead thats all you were busy rushing into business partnerships buying houses ive been rushing into a lot of things lately maybe we should debate the fact that i rushed you into bed the twin claws of embarrassment and annoyance pricked him as he got to his feet sure we can do that maybe we can find a more appropriate time and place for it you want to talk about appropriate when you and your testosterone team try to take over my responsibilities my business just because im in love with you just because i sleep with you doesnt mean ill sit back and let you run my life whos running whose life frustration had him flinging out his arms youre the one who has mine mapped out im in this malory whether i want to be or not and im here to find out what that means and if its heading where i think it is youre out all of you he shot scathing looks at dana and zoe out who made you boss dana demanded you couldnt tell me what to do when i was ten you sure as hell cant pull it off now oh you watch me you made it seem like a game he shot the accusation at rowena even some sort of romantic quest but you didnt tell them what might be at stake what are you talking about malory jabbed at his shoulder the dreams ignoring malory flynn continued to speak to rowena theyre warnings arent they you never finished telling us perhaps everyone should sit down and you can start from the beginning you had a dream like mine malory jabbed at him again why didnt you tell me just shut it down a damn minute out of patience he nudged her onto the couch just be quiet he ordered i dont want to hear anything out of you until im finished he started at the beginning with him wandering the house with the sensation of being watched stalked he related the experience on the parapet the fear and pain and ended with his waking in his own bed drenched with rain heвђitвђwanted my soul was letting me know that that could be the price for being in this this isnt the way pitte clamped a hand on rowenas and spoke to her as if no one else was in the room this cant be the way they arent to be harmed that was the first and most sacred promise we cant know if were not allowed behind the curtain we cant know what situation now exists if hes broken the vow he must believe he can escape the consequences he must believeвђ they are the ones she said in a whisper it can be done and they can succeed hes opened the curtain to stop them hes come through if they failвђ they cannot fail she spun around her face set with purpose well protect you will you shaken malory folded her hands on her lap squeezing her fingers until the pain cleared her head the way you protected the daughters of glass teacher and warrior somehow you are she got up walked to the portrait youre here she said gesturing to the couple in the background and here in this room in this place and you think that whats there in the shadows of the trees is here too you dont show his face he has more than one rowena spoke in a matteroffact tone that was utterly chilling you painted this and the two that we have painting is one of my passions rowena confirmed one of my constants pitte she turned to him they know this much i dont know a damn thing dana declared step over here to the cynical side of the room jordan invited its what malory knows that matters now rowena held out a hand all that i have will be used to keep you safe not good enough flynn shook his head shes out of it theyre all out of it you want your money back wellвђ excuse me i can speak for myself this isnt a matter of a refund is it she asked rowena theres no turning back no saying uhoh the stakes are higher than i realized game over the agreement was made without full disclosure brad put in whatever sort of contract these women signed with you wont hold up legally вђњthe issue isnt legal malory said impatiently its moral and more than that its destiny as long as i am as long as i know im part of it until the four weeks are up and if i find the first key one of them is next she looked at dana and zoe one of them will be at risk for the next phase of the moon yes you know where the keys are flynn exploded just hand them over end this do you think if that were possible we would remain in this prison in a gesture that mirrored both disgust and bitterness pitte flung out his arms year by century by millennium trapped in a world not our own do you think we live with you out of choice that we place our fates the fates of those in our charge in your hands because we wish it we are bound here bound by this single task and now so are you you cant go home after the boom of pittes zoes quiet voice was like a hammer blow we are home you had no right to trick us into being part of this without telling us the risks we didnt know rowena spread her hands for a couple of gods theres a hell of a lot you dont know and cant do pittes eyes went to smoke as he rounded on flynn perhaps youd like a demonstration of what we can do fists already clenched flynn stepped forward bring it on gentlemen rowenas heavy sigh was like a flood of cool water designed to lower the rising temperature of the room the male regardless of his origins remains woefully predictable in some areas your pride and manhood arent at risk here in either case flynn whatever the world there are laws woven through the fabric of it rip the fabric break the law if it were within my power to hand out the keys at this moment it would solve nothing they wouldnt work malory stated and earned a nod of approval from rowena you understand i think i do if this spellвђ is it a spell thats the simplest word for it rowena agreed if its to be broken it has to be by us women mortal women using our brains our wits and energies our resources in our world otherwise no key opens the box becauseвђ were the real keys the answers in us youre so close to where you need to be emotions storming across her face rowena rose laid her hands on malorys arms closer than any have come before but not close enough not yet and half my time is gone i need to ask you some questions in private hey one for all here dana reminded her malory sent her a silent plea okay okay well wait outside ill stay with you flynn laid a hand on malorys shoulder but she shrugged it off i said this was private i dont want you here his face went blank and cold fine then ill get out of your way with obvious regret rowena gave moe a little nudge to send him along she frowned at the sharp slam of the door behind flynn your man has a sensitive heart more easily bruised than yours is he my man before rowena could speak malory shook her head first things first why was i taken behind the curtain he wanted to show you his power who is he rowena hesitated then when pitte nodded continued he is kane a sorcerer the dark one the one in the shadows the one i saw in my dream the stealer of souls he showed himself to you so you would be frightened theres no need to frighten you unless you can succeed why did he hurt flynn because you love him do i malorys voice thickened with emotion or have i been made to think i do is that just one more trick ah rowena let out a soft breath perhaps youre not as close as i thought dont you know your own heart malory ive known him two weeks and i feel as if my life will never be quite right if hes not in it but is it real at the end of my four weeks will i still feel that way she pressed a hand to her heart or will it be taken away from me is it any worse to have your soul taken from you than your heart i think not for one feeds the other and i cant give you the answer because you already have it if you choose to look then tell me this will he be safe if i step away from him if i close my heart to him will he be safe youd give him up to protect him pitte asked yes thoughtful he walked to the lacquered cabinet opened it to take out a bottle of brandy and youd tell him this no hed neverвђ ah so you would deceive him with a small smile pitte poured brandy into a snifter and justify the lie by saying that it was for his own good women whatever their world are predictable he said with a mocking bow to rowena love she corrected is a constant force in any universe your decisions your choices must be yours she told malory but your man wont thank you for any sacrifice you make to protect him she gave pitte a mocking bow in turn they never do go now she touched a hand to malorys cheek rest your mind a while until you can think clearly with it and you have my word whatever can be done to keep you your man your friends safe will be done i dont know them she pointed to the portrait but i know those people outside you should know if it comes down to a choice ill choose those i know pitte waited until they were alone before bringing rowena a second snifter i have loved you through time and through worlds and i you my heart but ive never understood you you could have answered her question about love and eased her mind shell be the wiser and the happier for finding the answer herself how much can we do for them he leaned down pressed his lips to her brow our best chapter fourteen she needed time malory admitted shed been on a roller coaster since the first of the month and though thered been a thrill in riding those fast dips and sharp turns she needed a break nothing in her life was the same as it had been she thought as she let herself into her apartment shed always counted on consistency and that single element had slipped through her fingers or been tossed aside on impulse she didnt have the gallery she wasnt completely certain she had her sanity on one of those dips and turns shed stopped being sensible dependable malory price and had become irrational emotional fanciful malory priceвђa woman who believed in magic in love at first sight all right maybe third sight she corrected as she closed her curtains and crawled onto her bed but it was the same thing essentially shed taken money that could have seen her through several lean months and invested it in an enterprise with two women shed known for less than four weeks and trusted implicitly she decided without reservation she was about to embark on a business of her own without any stock any solid plan any safety net against all logic the idea of it made her happy and still her head was pounding her stomach churning over the thought that she might not be in love at all that the blissful confidence and pleasure she felt in flynn was only an illusion if the illusion shattered she was afraid she would grieve for the rest of her life she bunched the pillow under her head curled into a ball and begged for sleep it was sunny and warm when she woke and the air smelled like summer roses she snuggled in for a moment warm sheets carrying the faint scent of her man the soft drift of silence she rolled over lazily blinked something odd hung over her mind not really unpleasant just odd the dream the strangest dream she sat up and stretched feeling the healthy pull of muscles naked and easy with it she slid out of bed sniffed the butteryellow roses on the dresser before picking up her robe she paused by the window to admire her garden draw in the fragrant air she pushed the window open wider and let the sound of birdsong follow her out of the room the odd feeling was already fadingвђas a dream does on wakingвђas she glided down the stairs trailing a hand over the silky wood of the banister jewel lights from the window over the door played on the floor more flowers exotic sprays of white orchids speared out of the antique vase on the entrance table his keys were tossed beside them in the little mosaic bowl shed bought just for that purpose she wound her way through the house to the kitchen then grinned he was at the stove sliding a battered slice of bread into the skillet there was a tray beside him already topped with a flute of sparkling juice a single rose in a bud vase her pretty coffee cup the back door was open through it she could hear the birds continuing to sing and the dogs occasional happy barks blissful she crept forward then wrapped her arms around his waist pressed a kiss to the nape of his neck watch it my wife could wake up any minute lets risk it he turned caught her up in a long hard kiss her heart leaped her blood fired even as she thought perfect its all so perfect i was going to surprise you flynn ran his hands over her back as he eased her away breakfast in bed the hennessy special make it a better surprise and have breakfast in bed with me i could probably be persuaded hold on he grabbed a spatula flipped the bread over mmm its after eight you shouldnt have let me sleep so late i didnt let you get much sleep last night he winked at her seemed only fair to let you catch a little this morning youve been working so hard mai getting ready for your show im nearly done and when its over im going to take my incredibly beautiful and talented wife on a welldeserved vacation do you remember that week we spent in florence sundrenched days lovedrenched nights how could i forget are you sure you can take the time off im not the only one whos been busy around here well make time he flipped the french toast onto a plate why dont you grab the paper and well crawl back into bed for an hourвђ or two sleepy cries began to sound from the baby monitor on the counter flynn glanced toward it or maybe not ill get him meet me upstairs she hurried up part of her mind acknowledging the paintings lining the walls the street scene shed done in florence the seascape from the outer banks the portrait of flynn sitting at his desk in his office she turned toward the nursery the walls there were decorated with her paintings as well the bright faerietale scenes shed done the entire time shed been pregnant and in the crib with its glossy spindle bars her little boy cried impatiently for attention there now sweetheart mamas right here she picked him up cuddled him close he would have his fathers hair she thought as she cooed and swayed it was already coming in dark with those hints of chestnut shining through when the light caught it he was so perfect so absolutely perfect but as she carried him toward the changing table her legs went weak what was his name what was her babys name panicked she clutched him close then whirled as she heard flynn come to the door you look so beautiful malory i love you flynn something was wrong with her eyes it was as if she could see through him as if he were fading away somethings wrong nothings wrong everythings exactly right everythings just the way you wanted it to be its not real is it tears began to sting her eyes its not real it could be a light flashed and she was standing in a studio awash with light canvases were stacked against the walls or rested on easels she faced another brilliant with color and shape a brush was in her hand and she was already daubing it on her palette ive done this she whispered as she stared at the canvas it was a forest misty with green light the figure walking on the path was alone not lonely she thought but solitary there was home at the end of the path and a bit of time yet to enjoy the quiet and the magic of the woods her hand had done that her mind her heart she could feel it just as she could feel and remember every brushstroke on every canvas in the room the power of that the glory of it with all its pain and pleasure i can do this with a kind of frantic glee she continued to paint i have to do this the joy was like a drug and she was greedy for it she knew how to mix just the right tone of color when to sweep it on when to switch for the fine fine details how to create that light that shadow so one might feel as if he or she could slip inside walk that path and find home at the end of it but even as she painted tears began to run down her cheeks its not real it could be the brush clattered to the floor splattering paint as she whirled he stood beside her with the suns rays flooding over him and still he was dark his hair black and glossy spread like wings to his shoulders his eyes were a strong stone gray sharp high cheekbones hollowed his cheeks and his mouth was full appealingly wicked beautiful she thought how could he be beautiful did you think id look like a demon like something out of a nightmare his amusement only added charm why should i theyve made you think poorly of me havent they youre kane fear was alive in her with its cold hands closing around her throat you stole the souls from the daughters of glass it neednt concern you his voice was beautiful as well melodic soothing youre an ordinary woman in an ordinary world you know nothing of me or mine i wish you no harm the opposite in fact with a dancers grace he wandered the room his soft boots silent on the paintsplattered floor this is your work no oh yes you know it he lifted a canvas studied the sinuous lines of a mermaid lounging on a rock you remember painting this and the others you know now how it feels to have that power art makes gods out of men he set the canvas down again or women what are we in my world but artists and bards magicians and warriors you want to keep the power malory she swiped at the tears saw her work through them yes you can have it all of it and more the man you want the life the family ill give them to you the child you held in your arms it can all be real it can all belong to you at what price so little he slid a finger over her damp cheek and the tear he stole flamed on its tip so very little youve only to stay within this dream to wake and sleep within it to walk to speak to eat to love all you can wish for will be here for you perfectionвђwithout pain without death she let out a shuddering breath there are no keys in this dream youre a clever woman why care about keys about bastard goddesses who have nothing to do with you why risk yourself and those you love for foolish girls who should never have been born would you give up your own dream for strangers i dont want a dream i want my life i wont trade my life for your illusions his skin went white his eyes black then lose all she screamed as he reached for her and again when the cold speared through her then she was pulled clear tumbled free to wake gasping in her own bed she heard the banging on the door the shouting terror leaped out of bed with her she made it to the living room at a stumbling run and spotted flynn on the other side of her patio doors about to smash one of her chairs through the glass he tossed it aside as she unlocked the door shoved it open whos in here he grabbed her shoulders lifted her right off her feet and set her out of his way who hurt you nobodys here you were screaming i heard you screaming he strode into the bedroom fists ready i had a nightmare it was just a bad dream no ones here but me i have to sit down she braced a hand on the couch lowered herself his own legs felt a little shaky shed screamed as if something was tearing her to pieces hed had a good taste of terror the night before but it had been nothing compared to what had pumped into him on the other side of that glass door he marched into the kitchen poured a glass of water here drink some take it slow ill be okay in a minute i woke up and you were pounding and shouting everythings still confused youre trembling he glanced around spotted a chenille throw wrapping it around her shoulders he sat on the couch beside her tell me about the dream she shook her head no i dont want to talk about it or think about it right now i just want to be alone for a while i dont want you here thats the second time today youve said that to me but this time youre not getting your way in fact im calling jordan and letting him know im staying here tonight this is my apartment nobody stays here unless i invite them wrong again get undressed get in bed ill make you some soup or something i dont want soup i dont want you and i certainly dont want to be coddled then what the hell do you want he lunged to his feet vibrating with fury and frustration one minute youre all over me telling me youre in love with me you want to spend your life with me then the next you want me to hit the road im sick to death of women and their mixed signals and capricious minds and their goddamn expectations of me right now youre going to do what i want and thats getting into bed while i make you something to eat she stared at him a dozen vile and vicious words leaped into her throat and she lost them all in a burst of tears oh christ flynn scrubbed his hands over his face nice job take a bow hennessy he stalked to the window stared out while she wept wildly behind him im sorry i dont know what to do about you i cant keep up you dont want me here fine ill call dana but i dont want you to be alone i dont know what to do about me either she reached in the drawer for a pack of tissues if ive sent you mixed signals it hasnt been deliberately she mopped at her face but the tears simply wouldnt stop i dont have a capricious mindвђat least i never used to and i dont know what my goddamn expectations of you are i dont even know what my goddamn expectations are of me anymore i used to im scared im scared of whats happening around me and inside me and im scared because i dont know whats real i dont know if youre actually standing over there he came back sat beside her again im here he said as he took her hand firmly in his this is real flynn she steadied herself by staring at their joined hands all my life ive wanted certain things i wanted to paint for as long as i can remember i wanted to be an artist a wonderful artist i studied and i worked and i never came close i dont have the gift she closed her eyes it hurt more than i can tell you to accept that steadier she let out a breath looked at him вђњthe best i could do was work with art to be around it to find some purpose for this love she fisted a hand on her heart and that i was good at dont you think theres something noble about doing what were really good at even if it wasnt our first choice thats a nice thought but its hard to set a dream aside i guess you know that yeah i know that the other thing i wanted was to love someone to be loved by him absolutely to know when i went to bed at night woke in the morning that this someone was with me understood me and wanted me i never had much luck with that one either i might meet someone and wed seem to click but it never got inside me i never felt that leap or the burn that eases into that wonderful spreading warmth when you just know this is the one you were waiting for until you dont say anything she said quickly i need to finish she picked up the water again soothed her throat when you wait all your life for something and then you find it its like a miracle all the parts inside you thatve been on hold they open up and start beating you were okay before you were good you had purpose and direction and everything was just fine but now its more you cant explain what that more is but you know if you lose it youll never be able to fill those empty spaces in just the same way again not ever thats terrifying im afraid that whats inside me is just a trick that ill wake up tomorrow and whats beating in here will have stopped itll be quiet again i wont feel this way i wont feel the way ive waited all my life to feel her eyes were dry again her hand steady as she set the water down i can stand you not loving me back theres always the hope that you will but i dont know if i can stand not loving you it would be likeвђ like having something stolen from inside me i dont know if i can handle going back to the way i was he brushed a hand down her hair then drew her close to his side so her head rested on his shoulder nobodys ever loved me not the way youre talking about i dont know what to do about it malory but i dont want to lose it either i saw the way things could be but it wasnt true just an ordinary day that was so perfect it was like a jewel in the palm of my hand he made me see it and feel it and want it he eased back turning her to face him the dream she nodded it hurt more than anything ive ever known to let it go its a hard price flynn can you tell me i think i have to i was tired i felt like id been through this emotional wringer i just wanted to lie down have it go away for a while she took him through it the waking with that sensation of absolute wellbeing of moving through a house that was full of love finding him in the kitchen making her breakfast that shouldve clued you in me cooking an obvious delusion you were making me french toast its my favorite lazymorning treat we talked about going on vacation and i remembered all the other places wed gone what wed done those memories were inside me then the baby woke up baby he went icy pale we hadвђthere wasвђ a baby i went up to get him out of the crib him yes him along the walls on the way were paintings id done they were wonderful and i could remember painting them just as i could remember painting the ones in the nursery i picked the baby up out of the crib and this love this terrible love for him i was full of it and thenвђ and then i didnt know his name i had no name for him i could feel the shape of him in my arms and how soft and warm his skin was but i didnt know his name you came to the door and i could see through you i knew it wasnt real none of it was real she had to stand up to move she walked over to open the curtains again even as i started to hurt i was in a studio my studio surrounded by my work i could smell the paint and the turpentine i had a brush in my hand and i knew how to use it i knew all the things id always wanted to know it was powerful like having the child who had come from me in my arms and just as false and he was there who was there she drew in a sharp breath turned back his name is kane the stealer of souls he spoke to me i could have it allвђthe life the love the talent it could be real if i just stayed inside it id never have to give it up we would love each other wed have a son id paint it would all be perfect just live inside the dream and the dreams real did he touch you he rushed to her to run his hands over her as if to check for wounds did he hurt you this world or that she said steady again my choice i wanted to stay but i couldnt i dont want a dream flynn no matter how perfect it is if its not real it means nothing and if id stayed isnt that just another way of giving him my soul you were screaming undone flynn laid his forehead on hers you were screaming he tried to take it but i heard you shouting for me why did you come here you were upset with me i didnt want you to be annoyed she corrected and slid her arms around him i still am but its a little hard to get through everything else to my irritation i want you to stay im afraid to sleep afraid i might go back and this time i wont be strong enough to come out again youre strong enough and if you need it ill help pull you out this might not be real either she lifted her mouth to his but i need you its real he lifted her hands kissed each one in turn thats the only thing im sure of in this whole damn mess whatever im feeling for you malory its real if you cant tell me what you feel then show me she drew him to her show me now all the conflicting emotions the needs and doubts and wants poured into the kiss and as she accepted them accepted him he felt himself settle tenderness spread through him as he picked her up cradled her in his arms i want to keep you safe i dont care if it irritates you he carried her to her room and laid her on the bed began to undress her ill keep getting in the way if thats what it takes i dont need someone to look out for me she lifted a hand to his cheek i just need you to look at me malory ive been looking at you from the beginning even when youre not around she smiled arched up so he could slip off her blouse вђњthats a strange thing to say but its nice lie down with me they were side by side faces close i feel pretty safe right now and its not particularly irritating maybe youre feeling a little too safe he skimmed a fingertip over the swell of her breast maybe she sighed when he began to nuzzle the side of her neck that doesnt scare me a bit youre going to have to try a lot harder he rolled over pinned her then plundered her mouth with his oh nice work she managed she was trembling just enough to arouse him and her skin was flushing warm he could steep himself in her in the tastes and textures he could lose himself in that low driving urge to give her pleasure he was tied to her perhaps he had been even before hed met her could it be that all the mistakes hed made all the changes in direction had been only to lead him to this time and this woman was there never any choice she sensed him drawing back dont dont go away she begged let me love you i need to love you she wound her arms around him used her mourn to seduce for now she would trade pride for power without a qualm as her body moved sinuously under his she felt his quiver hands stroked lips took breathy moans slid into air that had gone dim and thick long lazy kisses built in intensity and ended on gasps of greed he was with her now locked in a rhythm too primal to resist the hammer blows of his heart threatened to shatter his chest and still it wasnt enough he wanted to gorge on the flavors of her to drown in that sea of needs one moment she was pliant yielding the next as taut as a bunched fist when her breath sobbed out his name he thought he might go mad she rose over him locking her hands in his she took him into her a slow slow slide that tied his frantic system into knots malory she shook her head leaning down to rub her lips over his want me i do let me take you watch me take you she arched back stroking her hands up her torso over her breasts into her hair and she began to ride heat slapped him back a furnace blast that had his muscles going to jelly that scorched his bones she rose above him slim and strong white and gold she surrounded him possessed him spurred him toward madness the power and pleasure consumed her she drove them both faster harder until her vision was a blur of colors alive was all she could think they were alive blood burned in her veins pumped in her frenzied heart good healthy sweat slicked her skin she could taste him in her mouth feel him pounding in the very core of her this was life she clung to it clung even when the glory climbed toward the unbearable until his body plunged and she let go he made good on the soup though he could tell it amused her to have him stirring a pot at her stove he put on music kept the lights low not for seduction but because he desperately wanted to keep her relaxed he had questions a great many more questions about her dream the part of him that felt that asking questions was a human obligation warred with the part that wanted to tuck her up safe and quiet for a while i could run out he suggested grab some videos we can veg out dont go anywhere she snuggled closer to him on the couch you dont have to distract me flynn we have to talk about it eventually doesnt have to be now i thought a newspaperman dug for all the facts fit to print and then some since the dispatch isnt going to be running a story on celtic myths in the valley until all of this is finished theres no rush and if you were working for the new york times thatd be different he stroked her hair sipped his wine id be hardboiled and cynical and skewer you or anybody else for the story and id probably be strung out and stressed maybe have a drinking problem be working toward my second divorce i think id like bourbon and id have a redhead on the side what do you really think itd be like if youd gone to new york i dont know i like to think id have done good work important work you dont think your work heres important it serves a purpose an important purpose not only keeping people informed and entertained giving them the continuity of tradition but keeping a lot of them employed the people who work on the paper deliver it their families where would they have gone if youd left i wasnt the only one who could run it maybe you were the only one who was supposed to run it would you go now if you could he thought about it no i made the choice most of the time im glad i chose as i did just every once in a while i wonder i couldnt paint nobody told me i couldnt or made me give it up i just wasnt good enough its different when youre good enough but someone tells you you cant it wasnt exactly like that what was it like you have to understand my mother she makes very definite plans when my father died well that mustve really messed up plan a flynn im not saying she didnt love him or didnt mourn she did we did he made her laugh he could always make her laugh i dont think i heard her laugh not really for a year after we lost him flynn it broke her heart im so sorry shes tough one thing you can say about elizabeth flynn hennessy steele shes no wimp you love her malory brushed at his hair i wondered sure i do but you wont hear me say she was easy to live with anyway when she pulled herself out of it it was time for plan b big chunk of that was passing the paper to me when the time came no problem for me there since i figured that was way way down the road and that i would deal with it and her when i had to i liked working for the dispatch learning not just about reporting but about publishing too but you wanted to do that in new york i was too big for a podunk town like pleasant valley too much to say too much to do pulitzers to win then my mother married joe hes a great guy danas dad can he make your mother laugh yeah yeah he can we made a good family the four of us i dont know that i appreciated that at the time with joe around i figured some of the pressure on me was off i guess we all figured theyd work the paper together for decades joes a reporter yeah worked for the paper for years used to joke that hed married the boss they made a good team too so it looked like everything was going to work out fine and dandy after college i figured to build up another couple years experience here then give new york a break and offer my invaluable skills and services i met lily and that seemed to be the icing on the cake what happened joe got sick looking back i imagine my mother was frantic at the idea that she might lose somebody else she loved shes not big on emotional displays shes sort of contained and straightforward but i can see it hindsightwise and i cant imagine what it was like for her they had to move he had a better chance of copping more time if they got out of this climate and away from stress so either i stayed or the paper closed she expected you to stay he remembered what hed said about expectations yeah do my duty i was pissed off at her for a year then irritated for another somewhere in year three i hit resigned i dont know exactly when that becameвђ i guess you could say contentment but around the time i bumped into contentment i bought the house then i got moe id say youre off your mothers plan and on your own he let out a half laugh son of a bitch i guess i am chapter fifteen there was very little that dana dragged herself out of bed for work of course was the primary incentive but when she had the morning off her main choice for entertainment was sleep giving that up at flynns request demonstrated in her opinion extreme sisterly affection and should earn her major points to be redeemed in any future necessity she knocked on malorys door at seventhirty wearing a groucho marx tshirt ripped jeans and a pair of oakleys because he knew his sister flynn opened the door and shoved a steaming cup of coffee into her hands youre a peach youre a jewel you are my personal treasure chest stuff it she strode in sat on the couch and began to inhale the coffee wheres mal still sleeping got bagels i dont know i didnt look i shouldve looked he said instantly im a selfish bastard thinking only of myself excuse me but id have liked to say that just saving you the time and energy ive got to go i need to be at the paper inвђ shit twentysix minutes he said when he looked at his watch just tell me why im in malorys apartment drinking coffee and hoping there are bagels when shes asleep i dont have time to get into it she had a rough one and i dont want her to be alone at all dana jesus flynn what did somebody beat her up you could say that emotionally speaking and it wasnt me he added as he headed for the door just stick with her will you ill shake loose as soon as i can but ive got a full slate today let her sleep then i dont know keep her busy ill call he was out the patio door and loping away while dana scowled after him for a reporter youre sure stingy with the deets deciding to make the best of it she got up to raid malorys kitchen she was taking the first enthusiastic bite of a poppyseed bagel when malory came in heavyeyed dana noted a little pale considerably rumpled she imagined the rumpled part was on flynn hi want the other half obviously groggy malory just blinked hi yourself wheres flynn he had to run go stand for journalism and all that want some coffee instead yes she rubbed her eyes and tried to think whatre you doing here dana dont have a clue flynn called me at the ungodly hour of about forty minutes ago and asked me to come over he was short on details but long on pleading so i hauled my ass over here whats up i guess hes worried about me she considered it then decided she didnt mind very much thats sort of sweet yeah hes sugar why is he worried about you i think wed better sit down she told dana everything what did he look like dana demanded wellвђ strong face leaning toward the ascetic side wait a minuteвђi think i can sketch it she got up to take a pad and pencil from a drawer then sat down again he had very welldefined features so it wont be too hard but more than how he looked was the way he felt compelling even charismatic what about the house you were in dana pressed while malory worked i just got impressions it seemed so familiar in the dream the way your home does so you dont notice a lot of details twostory with a lawn in the back a pretty garden sunny kitchen it wasnt flynns house malory looked up then no she said slowly no it wasnt i didnt think of that wouldnt you assume it would be if its my fantasy why werent we living in his house its a great house its already in my head maybe he couldnt use flynns house because its already occupied andвђ i dont know its probably not important i think everythings important everything i saw and felt and heard i just dont know how yet hereвђ she turned the pad around its rough but thats the best i can do its a pretty decent impression of him anyway wow dana pursed her lips whistled so kane the sorcerers a hottie he scares me dana he couldnt hurt you not really not when it came right down to it not this time but he was in my head it was like an invasion she pressed her lips together a kind of rape he knows what i feel and what i wish for ill tell you what he didnt know he didnt know youd tell him to kiss your ass malory sat back youre right he didnt know id refuse or that id understandвђeven in the dreamвђthat he wanted me trapped somewhere however wonderful where i couldnt find the key both of those things surprised and irritated him and that means he doesnt know everything with considerable reluctance dana tagged along when malory decided to work at flynns house it made sense as the two paintings were there but so was jordan hawke her hopes that he would be out somewhere were quashed when she saw the vintage thunderbird in flynns driveway always had a thing about cars she muttered and though she sniffed at the tbird she secretly admired its lines the sweep of tail fins and the sparkle of chrome shed have paid money to get behind the wheel and open that engine up on a straightaway dont know why the jerk has to have a car when he lives in manhattan malory recognized the tone both the sulkiness and the bitterness and paused at the door is this going to be a problem for you maybe we can make arrangements to see the paintings again when jordans not here no problem for me he doesnt exist in my reality i long ago drowned him in a vat of ebola it was a messy yet oddly satisfying task okay then malory lifted a hand to knock but dana nudged her aside i do not knock on my brothers door she shot her key into the lock no matter what morons he might have staying with him she strode in prepared for a confrontation unwilling to be so easily deflated when she didnt see him she slammed the door dana oops slipped hooking her thumbs in her pockets she strolled into the living room just where we left them she said with a nod at the paintings and you know what i dont see anything different about them either jobs done for today lets go shopping or something i want to do a more thorough study of them and i want to go through all the research notes but theres no reason for you to hang around i promised flynn flynns a worrywart well yeah but i promised sensing movement in the doorway behind her she stiffened and unlike some i keep my promises and hold a grudge with equal fervor jordan commented hello ladies what can i do for you id like to go over the paintings and my notes again malory told him i hope you dont mind whos he to mind its not his house вђњtrue enough jordan tall and tough in black jeans and black tshirt leaned against the doorjamb help yourself havent you got something better to do than lurk dana tossed out a book to pretend to write a publisher to skin you know us commercial fiction hacks we just knock em out in a couple weeks then lounge around on our royalties i dont mind if the two of you want to fight really i dont malory dumped her briefcase fat with notes on the crate but maybe you could take it to another room were not fighting jordan replied this is foreplay in your dreams stretch in my dreams youre usually wearing a lot less let me know if i can help you out with anything malory he straightened then strolled away be right back dana was after him like a rocket in the kitchen hotshot she streamed by then gritted her teeth while she waited for him to catch up he moved at his own pace she thought and always had her temper sparked as he wandered in she was readying the first salvo when he stepped right up gripped her hips and covered her shocked mouth with his the blast of heat blew straight through her that had always been as well fire and flash and promise all balled together in some sort of molten comet that exploded in the brain and left the system wrecked not this time not this time not ever again with considerable force she shoved him back a step she wouldnt slap too predictable and female but she very nearly punched sorry i thought that was what you called me out here for вђњtry that again and youll be bleeding from various fatal wounds he shrugged sauntered over to the coffeepot my mistake damn right any rights you had to touch me expired a long time ago you may be part of this thing because you happened to buy that damn painting and ill tolerate you because of that and because youre flynns friend but as long as youre here youll abide by the rules he poured two mugs of coffee set hers on the counter spell them out for me you dont ever touch me if im about to step in front of a damn bus you dont so much as reach out to pull me back to the curb okay youd rather be run over by a bus than have me touch you check next youre a son of a bitch something that might have been regret flashed across his face i know it look lets step back a minute flynns important to both of us and this is important to flynn that woman out theres important to him and shes important to you were all connected here whether we want to be or not so lets try to figure it out he was in and out of here in about three minutes flat this morning i didnt get much more out of him then or when he called last night than that malorys in trouble fill me in if malory wants you to know shell tell you hand her an olive branch he thought and she rams it down your throat still a hardass its private stuff she snapped intimate stuff she doesnt know you despite a thousand vows she felt her eyes fill neither do i that single tearful look punched a hole in his heart dana when he stepped toward her she snatched a bread knife off the counter put your hands on me again ill hack them off at the wrist he stayed where he was slid his hands into his pockets why dont you just stick it in my heart and get it over with just stay away from me flynn doesnt want malory left alone you can consider this your shift because im leaving if im going to be guard dog it would help to know what im guarding against big bad sorcerers she yanked open the back door anything happens to her ill not only jam that knife in your heart ill cut it out and feed it to the dog always were good with imagery he drawled after shed slammed out he rubbed a hand over his stomach shed tied it in knotsвђsomething else she was damn good at he looked at the coffee she hadnt touched though he knew it was foolishly symbolic he picked up the cup and poured the coffee down the sink down the drain stretch just like us malory studied the paintings until her vision blurred she made more notes then stretched out on the floor to stare at the ceiling she jumbled what she knew in her head hoping it would form a new clearer pattern a singing goddess shadows and light what was within herself and outside herself to look and see what she hadnt seen love forged the key hell three paintings three keys did that mean there was a clue a sign a direction in each painting for each key or was there a compilation in the three paintings for the first key for hers either way she was missing it there were common elements in each portrait the legendary subject matter of course the use of forest and shadows the figure cloaked by them that would be kane why was kane in the portrait of arthur had he actually been there at the event or was his inclusion and rowenas and pittes symbolic but still even with those common elements the arthurian portrait didnt seem part of what she was certain was a set was there another painting to complete the triad of the daughters of glass where would she find it and what would it tell her when she did she rolled over examined the portrait of young arthur once more the white dove at the right top a symbol for guinevere the beginning of the end of that shining moment betrayal by love the consequences of love wasnt she dealing with consequences of love now within herself the soul was as much a symbol of love and beauty as the heart was emotions poetry art music magic soulful elements without a soul there were no consequences and no beauty if the goddess could sing didnt that mean she still had her soul the key might be in a place where there was art or love beauty or music or where the choice to keep them or discard them was made a museum then a gallery the gallery she thought and bolted to her feet dana she dashed toward the kitchen pulling up short when she saw jordan sitting at the scarred table working on a small sleek laptop sorry i thought dana was in here she took off hours ago hours malory passed a hand over her face as if coming out of a dream i lost track of time happens to me regularly want some coffee he glanced toward the empty pot on the counter all you have to do is make it no i really need toвђ youre working im sorry to interrupt no problem im having one of those days where i fantasize about having an alternate profession like being a lumberjack in the yukon or a bartender at a tropical resort pretty disparate choices either of which seems like more fun than what im doing she noted the empty coffee cup the halffull ashtray set beside the jazzy laptop on a secondhand picnic table in a stupendously ugly kitchen could be the ambience isnt particularly conducive to creativity when things are going well you can be in a sewer with a notebook and a ticonderoga i suppose thats true but im wondering if youre set up in thisвђ unfortunate room because youre watching out for me depends he eased back fiddled with his dwindling pack of cigarettes if thats okay with you sure if its going to piss you off then im afraid i dont know what youre talking about she cocked her head and if i said i had to leave now that theres something i want to check out he gave her an easy smile one she thought might pass for innocent on a less wicked face id say is it okay if i tag along it might do me good to get out of the house for a while where are we going the gallery it occurred to me that the key must be attached to art to beauty to the paintings its the most logical place in the area to look uhhuh so youre going to walk into a public place of business during business hours and nobodys going to mind if you go on a scavenger hunt through the stock and or office areas well when you put it that way deflated she sat across from him do you think this whole thing is just some kind of lunacy jordan recalled watching several thousand dollars appear and disappear not necessarily and if i said i might have a way to get into the gallery after business hours id say you wouldnt have been picked to be a part of this unless you were a creative woman with a flexible mind whos willing to take some chances i like that description i dont know if it always applied but it does now i need to make some phone calls and jordan i think it shows a strong sense of character and loyalty for a man to waste his day looking after a stranger because a friend asked him to malory took the keys from tod and gave him a huge hug in return i owe you big ill say but ill settle for any sort of an explanation as soon as i can i promise honeybun this is all getting really weird you get fired then you hack into pamelas files you turn down the invitation to come back to home and hearth with a substantial raise and now youre going to skulk around the place after closing you know what she jingled the keys in her hand thats not the really weird part all i can tell you is im doing something important and with the best intentions im not going to do the gallery or james or most especially you any harm id never think you would ill have these back to you tonight first thing in the morning at the latest tod glanced out the window to see flynn loitering on the sidewalk this doesnt have anything to do with sexual fetishes or fantasies no well thats a shame im walking away im going to have a lovely martini maybe two and put all this completely out of my mind do just that he started out then stopped and looked back at her whatever youre doing mal be careful i will promise she waited watched tod stop to speak to flynn before sauntering off she opened the door gestured flynn in then locked it set the security code what did tod say to you that if i got you into any sort of trouble hed hang me up by my balls and then snip off various other body parts with manicure scissors ouch good one you bet he peered out the window to make sure tod was gone and let me tell you if i was thinking about getting you into any sort of trouble that image would be a very strong deterrent i guess when it comes down to it im the one who could be getting you in trouble theres the legal angle the criminal angle and your reputation as publisher and editor in chief of the dispatch on the line here you dont have to do this im in manicure scissors are those little pointy ones that curve right thats right he hissed out a breath yeah i was afraid of that where do we start upstairs i think we can work our way down assuming the keys in the painting are in proportion itll be about three inches long little key yes a fairly little key the business end is a single simple drop she continued and handed him a small sketch the other end is decorative this complex pattern its a celtic design a triple spiral called a triskeles zoe found the pattern in one of danas books you three make a good team it feels like it its gold probably solid gold i cant imagine we wont recognize it when we see it he glanced toward the main showroom with its vaulted ceilings and generous space there were the paintings of course and the sculpture and other artworks display cases and tables drawers and chests and counters with infinite cubbyholes a lot of places a key might hide in here wait until we get into the storage and shipping areas they started in the offices malory set aside her guilt at going through drawers riffling through personal items this wasnt any time for delicacy she told herself she crawled around jamess desk searching under it do you really think people like rowena and pitte or whatever gods in charge of hiding the keys would tape the secret key to the bottom of a desk drawer she sent him a sulky look as she slid the drawer back in place i dont think we can afford to overlook any possibility she looked so cute he thought sitting on the floor with her hair tied back from her face and her mouth all pouty he wondered if shed worn black because she felt it suited the circumstances it would be just like her fair enough but wed get through those possibilities faster if we called the whole team in i cant have a pack of people running around here its just not right and the guilt of what she was doing scraped her conscience like ragged fingernails its bad enough youre here you cant use anything you see here in a story he crouched down with her stared into her face with eyes that had gone winter cool is that what you think it doesnt seem unreasonable that the thought crossed my mind she rose to take a painting off the wall youre a journalist she continued as she checked the frame tested the backing i owe something to this place to james im just saying that i dont want him involved she rehung the painting chose another maybe you should write up a list of what is and isnt appropriate for me to write about in your opinion вђњtheres no need to get testy oh yeah there is ive invested a lot of my time and energy in this and i havent printed a word dont question my ethics malory just because youre questioning your own and dont ever tell me what i can or cant write its just a matter of saying this is off the record no its not its a matter of you trusting and respecting someone you claim to love im going to start in the next room i think well do better separately just how she wondered had she managed to screw that one up so completely she took the last painting off the wall ordered herself to concentrate obviously flynn was oversensitive shed made a perfectly reasonable request and if he wanted to get huffy about it it was his problem she spent the next twenty minutes going over every inch of the room and comforting herself with her conviction that hed overreacted they didnt speak for the next hour and though they were two people performing the same task in the same space they managed to avoid contact by the time they started on the main level theyd developed a rhythm but they still werent speaking it was tedious frustrating work checking every painting every sculpture every pedestal and objet dart going over the stairs tread by tread crawling along the trim malory took herself off to the storeroom it was both painful and thrilling to come across newly acquired pieces or to see others that had been sold since shed left the gallery and were waiting to be crated and shipped once shed been privy to every step and stage and had been granted the right to acquire items and negotiate a price in her heart the gallery had been hers she couldnt count the times shed been inside it after hours like this no one would have questioned her presence then there would have been no need to beg the keys from a friend or to feel guilt to question her ethics she admitted she wouldnt have felt this awful grief she realized grief that this part of her life had been taken away from her maybe she was crazy for refusing the offer to take it back maybe she was making a huge mistake by deviating from the sensible the tangible she could go back and speak to james tell him shed changed her mind she could slide back into routine again have what shed always had and it would never be the same that was the grief her life was changed irrevocably and she hadnt taken the time to mourn the loss she did so now with every piece she touched every minute she spent in the space that had once been the most important part of her life she revisited a thousand memories so many of them part of the daytoday routine that had meant nothing at the time and everything once it had been taken away flynn pulled open the door where do you want toвђ he broke off when she turned toward him her eyes were dry but devastated she held a rough stone sculpture in her arms as she might a child what is it i miss this place so much its like somethings died very gently she replaced the sculpture on a shelf i acquired this piece about four months ago its a new artist hes young with all the fire and temperament youd expect from the feel of his work hes from a small town in maryland and hes had a little local luck but no major gallery showed any interest it felt good to give him his first real break and to think of what he might do what we might do in the future she ran a fingertip over the stone someone bought this i didnt have anything to do with that part dont even recognize the name on the invoice its not mine anymore it wouldnt have been here or have been sold if it wasnt for you maybe but those days are over i dont have a place here anymore im sorry for what i said before very sorry i hurt your feelings forget it no she drew a breath im not going to say i didnt have some concerns about how you might handle this whole thing eventually i cant claim that i have absolute trust in you that conflicts with loving you and i cant explain it no more than i can explain how i know the keys not here how i knew that the minute i walked in to get the keys from tod i still have to look have to finish what i started but its not here flynn theres nothing here for me now chapter sixteen flynn closed the door of his office a signal that he was writing and was not to be disturbed not that anybody paid a great deal of attention to the signal but it was the principle of the thing he let the idea for the column simply flow out initially a kind of serpentine river of thought that he would channel into a more disciplined form on the second pass what defined the artist were artists only those who created what was perceived as the beautiful or the shocking those who formed some piece of work that delivered a visceral punch in painting in music in literature or theater if so did that make the rest of the world nothing more than the audience passive observers whose only contribution was applause or criticism what became of the artist without the audience not his usual sort of column flynn mused but it had been kicking around in his head since the night he and malory had searched the gallery it was time to let it out he could still see the way shed looked in that storeroom a stone figure in her arms and grief swimming in her eyes in the three days since shed kept him and everyone else at arms length oh she paid lip service to being busy to following different angles on her quest to putting her life back in order though from his point of view thered never been any real disorder to it still she refused to come out and she wouldnt let him in maybe the column was a kind of message to her he rolled his shoulders tapped his fingers on the edge of his desk until his mind shifted back and found the words wasnt the child who first learned to form his own name with letters a kind of artist one who was exploring intellect coordination and ego when the child held that fat pencil or bright crayon in his fist then drew those letters on paper wasnt he creating a symbol of himself with lines and curves this is who i am and no one else is quite the same there is art in the statement and in the accomplishment what about the woman who managed to put a hot meal on the table in the evening to a cordon bleu chef this might be a pedestrian feat but to those who were baffled by the directions on a can of condensed soup having that meat loaf mashed potatoes and string beans hit the table in unison was a great and mysterious art flynn working he snapped without looking up youre not the only one rhoda shut the door at her back marched over and sat in a chair she folded her arms across her chest and stared holes at flynn through her squareframed glasses but without the audience ready and willing to consume the art it becomes congealed leftovers to be dumpedвђ damn it he shoved back from his keyboard what you cut an inch from my feature his hands itched to pick up his slinky and wrap its coils around rhodas skinny throat and you said it was running a full twelve inches and what you had was eleven solid inches and an inch of fill i cut the fill it was a good piece rhoda now its a better piece i want to know why youre always picking on me why youre always cutting my pieces you barely put a mark on johns or carlas and theyre all over my work john handles sports hes been handling sports for over a decade hes got it down to a science art and science flynn thought and made a quick shorthand note to remind himself to work it into the column and sportsвђ if anyone watched the way a pitcher sculpted the dirt on the mound with his feet until it was exactly the shape the texture the slope heвђ flynn what what he snapped back rewound the tape in his mind and i do edit carla when and if she needs it rhoda im on a deadline myself here if you want to get into this lets schedule some time tomorrow her mouth pruned if we dont resolve this now i wont be coming in tomorrow instead of reaching for his action figure of luke skywalker and imagining the jedi knight drawing his light saber and blasting the superior smirk off rhodas face flynn sat back the time had come he decided to do the blasting himself okay first im going to tell you im tired of you threatening to walk if youre not happy here not happy with the way i run the paper then go she flushed scarlet your mother neverвђ im not my mother deal i run the dispatch ive been running it for nearly four years now and i intend to run it for a long time get used to it now her eyes filled and since flynn considered tears fighting dirty he struggled to ignore them anything else he asked coolly ive been working here since before you could read the damn paper which may be our problem it suited you better when my mother was in charge now it suits you better to continue to think of me as a temporary annoyance and an incompetent one at that rhodas mouth dropped open in what appeared to be sincere shock i dont think youre incompetent i just thinkвђ вђњthat i should stay out of your work the genial tone was back in his voice but his expression remained frigid that i should do what you tell me instead of the other way around thats not going to happen if you dont think i do good work thenвђ sit down he ordered as she started to rise he knew the drill she would storm out slam things around glare at him through the glass then make sure her next piece slid in only minutes before deadline it so happens i think you do good work not that it matters a hell of a lot coming from me because you dont have any confidence in or respect for my skill or my authority i guess that makes it tough for you because youre a journalist were the only game in town and im in charge i dont see any of those factors changing next time i ask for twelve inches give me a solid twelve and we wont have a problem he tapped the tip of his pencil against the desk while she gaped at him perry white he mused mightve handled it better but he figured he was in the ballpark anything else im going to take the rest of the day off no youre not he swiveled back to his keyboard have that piece on the elementary school expansion on my desk by two close the door on your way out flynn went back to typing pleased when he heard the door click closed instead of slam he waited thirty seconds then shifted in his chair enough to look through the glass wall rhoda was sitting at her desk as if paralyzed he hated confrontations like that the woman used to sneak him gumdrops when he would come into the offices after school it was hell he decided rubbing his temple and pretending to concentrate on his work just hell being a grownup he escaped for an hour in the afternoon to meet brad and jordan at the main street diner it hadnt changed much since the three of them had gathered there regularly after football games or for latenight bullshit sessions that had revolved around girls and life plans the air was still ripe with the smell of the diners signature chickenfried steak and the counter still held a fourtiered display rack of that days pies as flynn looked down at the burger hed ordered out of habit he wondered if it was the diner that had gotten stuck in the past or himself he frowned at brads club sandwich trade me you want my sandwich i want your sandwich trade me to solve the matter flynn switched the plates himself if you didnt want a burger whyd you order one because im a victim of habit and tradition and eating my sandwich is going to solve that its a start i also started breaking habit by reaming rhoda out at the paper this morning once she comes out of shock im pretty sure shell start planning my demise how come you wanted his sandwich instead of mine jordan asked i dont like reubens jordan considered then switched his plate with brads jesus are we finished playing musical plates now brad scowled at the reuben then decided it actually looked pretty good though he was already wishing he had his burger back flynn picked at the club sandwich do you think staying in your hometown all your life keeps you too attached to the past too resistant to change and growth and thereby inhibits your ability to function as a mature adult i didnt know this was going to be a philosophical discussion but willing to play jordan considered the question as he squeezed ketchup on the burger it could be said that staying in your hometown means youre comfortable there and have created strong roots and ties or that youre just too lazy and complacent to get your ass out i like it here took me a while to come to that up until recently id been pretty complacent about how things were going complacencys taken a backseat since around the first of the month because of the keys brad asked or malory one goes with the other the keys thats an adventure right sir galahad and the holy grail indiana jones and the lost ark elmer fudd and bugs bunny jordan put in right same deal you could always count on jordan to get your drift flynn thought none of our lives are going to suffer if we dont find them not really one year brad said thats a pretty stiff penalty clause to my way of thinking okay yeah flynn plucked a potato chip from the little mound beside his sandwich but im having a hard time seeing either rowena or pitte punishing these women they may not be the ones who do the messing jordan commented they may simply be the conduit so to speak to reward or punishment why do we assume they have a choice either вђњtrying to think positive here flynn replied and the idea that we will find the keys and what happens then is compelling besides the fact that its a puzzle and its damn hard to walk away from a puzzle flynn nodded at brad shifted in his seat then theres the magic the acceptance that magic some kinds of magic are real not an illusion but an actual kick in the ass of the natural order i mean how cool is that thats the kind of thing we give up when we become adults the casual belief in magic this has given it back you want to look at it as a gift or a burden jordan wondered could go either way thanks again mr bright side but yes i know that too were coming up on deadline here a little more than a week if we dont find it maybe well pay maybe we wont but well never know you cant dismiss the potential consequences of failure brad pointed out im trying to believe that nobodys going to screw up the lives of three innocent women because they tried and failed you go back to the beginning of this and the lives of three innocent womenвђdemigoddesses or notвђwere screwed up simply because they existed jordan dashed salt on what had been flynns fries sorry pal add in that the women in the portrait look like the women we know brad drummed his fingers on the table theres a reason for that and the reason puts them at the core of it all im not letting anything happen to malory or any of them flynn responded jordan picked up his glass of iced tea just how stuck on her are you thats another question i havent figured it out well well help you there jordan winked at brad whatre friends for hows the sex whys that always first with you flynn demanded thats a lifelong pattern because im a guy and if you dont think women rate sex high on the list youre a sad and pitiful fool its great flynn met jordan sneer for sneer you only wish you were having this level of sex with a beautiful woman but its not like thats the only thing going on between us we have actual conversations with and without clothes on including phone conversations brad asked that last over five minutes yeah so just making the list have you cooked her anything not just nuking something but using an actual stove i just made her some soup whenвђ that counts take her to any chick flicks frowning flynn picked up a triangle of sandwich i dont know that it qualified as a chick flick he set it down again okay yes once but it wasвђ no explanations this part of the quiz is true or false we can move on to our essay section jordan assured him picture your life in lets say five years that work he asked brad some require ten but i think we can be more lenient five works for me okay picture your life in five years can you structure the visual without her being in it i dont know how im supposed to picture five years from now when im not sure what ill be doing in five days but he could he could see his house with some of the longterm plans he had for it in place he could see himself at the paper walking moe hanging out with dana and he could see malory at every angle walking down the stairs in the house coming by the paper to meet him chasing moe out of the kitchen he went a little pale oh man shes in there isnt she jordan asked shes in there all right congratulations son jordan slapped him on the shoulder youre in love wait a minute what if im not ready tough luck brad replied brad knew all about luck and decided his was in when he stepped out of the diner and spotted zoe stopped at the traffic light she was wearing dark wraparound sunglasses and moving her lips in a way that made him assume she was singing along with the car stereo it wasnt stalking exactly if he just happened to hop in his car zip out into traffic and follow the fact that he cut off a pickup truck was completely incidental it was reasonable even important that they get to know each other better he could hardly help flynn if he didnt know the women flynn was connected to that made sense it had nothing to do with obsession just because hed bought a painting with her face in it just because he couldnt get that face out of his mind all that didnt mean he was obsessed he was merely interested and if he was practicing various opening lines under his breath it was only because he understood the value of communication he certainly wasnt nervous about speaking to a woman he spoke to women all the time women spoke to him all the time if it came to that he was considered one of the top eligible bachelorsвђand god did he hate that termвђin the country women went out of their way to talk to him if zoe mccourt couldnt spare five minutes for some polite conversation well that was her loss by the time she pulled into a driveway hed worked himself into a mass of nerves and irritation the vaguely annoyed glance she sent him when he pulled up behind her put a cap on it feeling foolish and insulted he climbed out are you following me she demanded excuse me in defense his voice was flat and cold i think youre overestimating your charms flynns worried about malory i saw you and thought youd be able to tell me how shes doing zoe continued to observe him warily as she unlocked her trunk her jeans were tight enough to afford him an intriguing view of firm female butt she wore a short snug red jacket with an equally snug striped top that stopped a full inch above the waistband of the jeans he noted with some fascination that her belly button was pierced and sported a tiny silver bar he actually felt his fingertips grow warm with the urge to touch it i stopped by to see her before huh who oh malory now the back of his neck grew warm and he cursed himself how is she she looks tired and a little down on herself im sorry he stepped forward as she began to unload the trunk let me give you a hand i can get it im sure you can he solved the matter by taking the two heavy sample books of wallpaper from her but i dont see any reason you should redecorating she took out a paint sample book a small toolboxвђ which he pulled away from herвђa notebook and some tile chips we contracted for this house were going to open the business here it needs work he walked ahead leaving her to slam the trunk yes it did need work but it had a sturdy look and the lot was nicely established solid location decent parking looks like it has good bones he commented you have the foundation checked out yes wiring up to code she dug out the keys shed picked up from the realtor just because im a woman doesnt mean i dont know how to buy a house i looked at a number of properties and this was the best value with the best location most of the work it needs is cosmetic she shoved open the door you can just dump them on the floor thanks ill tell malory you asked about her brad just kept walking so that she had to step back though it took some effort he refused to let his gaze drift down to her navel again are you always irritated when someone tries to help you im irritated when someone thinks i cant handle myself look i dont have that much time to do what im here to do i need to get started then ill stay out of your way he studied the ceiling the floor the walls as he wandered through the entrance area nice space he didnt detect any damp but there was a definite chill he wasnt sure if it was a faulty furnace or the woman who was blowing cold which part are you taking upstairs okay he started up nearly amused now by her impatient indrawn breath nice stairs cant go wrong with white pine some of the trim needed to be replaced he noted and the doublehung window at the top of the steps had yet to be upgraded shed need to see to that get herself a doubleglazed for insulation the walls had gone dingy and there were a few cracks from settling but that was easily seen to he liked the way the rooms split off and ran together and wondered if she would remove some of the hollowcore doors altogether or replace them with something more solid and in tune with the feel of the house and what was she going to do about lighting he didnt know anything about salons but it seemed logical that good strong lighting would be essential excuse me i need my toolbox what oh sorry he handed it to her then ran his fingers over the chipped and peeling window trim you know you could go with cherry for contrast here different woods leaving the natural grain going with warm tones youre not going to cover these floors are you she took out her measuring tape no why didnt he go away she had work to do thinking to do and most of all shed wanted to be alone in her wonderful building planning and deciding and dreaming about how it was all going to be when shed finished the colors the textures the tones the smells everything and here he was in her way wandering around all male and gorgeous and distracting in his perfect suit and his expensive shoes he smelled oh so subtly of highend soap and aftershave he probably paid more for a cake of soap then she had for the jeans and shirt she was wearing and he thought he could just mill around wafting in her air making her feel clumsy and inferior what are your plans for this room she wrote down her measurements and kept her back to him this is the main salon its for hair manicures and makeup when he didnt respond she was compelled to look over her shoulder he was staring contemplatively at her ceiling what we have these mini track lights very practical but with a fun look they have the advantage of being able to be set in a number of directions you going for fun or elegant in here i dont see why it cant be both good point soft colors or bold bold here soft in the treatment rooms look bradleyвђ ouch that sounded like my mother hed already crouched down to flip through a sample book and cast her a quick grin do you guys have like a training center where you learn how to develop that withering tone men arent allowed to have that information if i told you id have to kill you and i just dont have the time were going to close on the property in a month and i want to have my plans outlined so i can start on them the minute we do i can help you i know what im doing and how i want to do it i dont know why you assumeвђ hold on boy are you touchy wouldnt you think a woman who wore skintight jeans and decorated her navel would be a little more approachable im in the business remember he tapped the homemakers logo on the sample book not only that but i like helping a building meet its potential i can give you a hand with some labor and material im not looking for a handout he set the book aside slowly got to his feet i said a hand not a handout what is it about me that puts your back up everything thats unfair she shrugged but its true i dont understand people like you so i tend to distrust them people like me rich privileged people who run american empires im sorry im sure you have some very nice qualities or you wouldnt be flynns friend but you and i have nothing in common plus i have a lot on my plate right now and no time to play games so lets clear this up then we can move on im not going to have sex with you okay well obviously my life is no longer worth living she wanted to smile at that nearly did but she had reason to know his sort was very tricky are you going to tell me that youre not hoping to sleep with me he took a careful breath before speaking shed hooked the earpiece of her sunglasses in the v of her shirt and those long tawny eyes were staring very directly into his you and i both know theres no way for me to answer that question correctly its the mother of trick questions others in this category are do i look fat in this do you think shes pretty and if you dont know im certainly not going to tell you now she had to bite the inside of her lip to hold back the laughter the last isnt a question its still a mystery and a trap so why dont i just say i find you very attractive and we have more in common than you seem to think starting with a circle of friends im willing to help you malory and dana with this place none of you has to have sex with me in return though if the three of you wanted to get together and organize a nice tasteful orgy i wouldnt say no meanwhile ill let you get back to work he started out then said casually as he walked down the stairs by the way homemakers is having a sale on wall treatmentsвђpaper and paintвђnext month fifteen to thirty percent off all stock zoe hurried to the top of the steps when next month ill let you know so she wasnt going to have sex with him brad shook his head as he walked to his car that had been an unfortunate statement on her part obviously she wasnt aware that the one thing no vane could resist was a direct challenge his only plan had been to ask her out to dinner now he decided as he studied the windows on the second level hed have to take a little time and work out a strategy zoe mccourt was about to go under siege zoe had other things on her mind she was running late but that was nothing new there always seemed to be another flood of things to do or remember or fix right before she walked out the door you give those cookies to chucks mother shell divvy them up zoe turned the car into the driveway two blocks from her own house then sent her son a stern look i mean it simon i dont have time to take them in myself if i go to the door shell keep me there for twenty minutes and im already late okay okay i coulda walked yeah but then i wouldntve been able to do this she grabbed him dug her fingers into his ribs to make him squeal mom simon she said in the same exasperated tone he was laughing as he got out and dragged his duffel from the backseat you mind chucks mother and dont keep everybody up all night youve got malorys number yes ive got malorys number and i know how to dial nineoneone and to run out of the house if i set it on fire when i play with matches smart guy come over here and give me a kiss he made a show of dragging his feet keeping his head dipped to hide his grin as he approached her car window make it quick somebody might see us just tell them i wasnt kissing you i was yelling at you she gave him a kiss resisted hugging him see you tomorrow have a good time baby you too baby he snickered then raced for the house with a mothers skill she backed out of the drive while watching her boy until he was safely inside then she headed off to malorys and her first grownup sleepover chapter seventeen malory knew what was going on nobody wanted her to be alone and her new friends were worried about her zoe had been so enthusiastic about the brainstorm of an allgirl sleepover that malory hadnt been able to refuse the very fact that shed wanted to refuse had wanted to burrow into her cave alone forced her to admit she needed a change shed never been a loner nor had she been much of a brooder in the past when she was troubled she went out saw people bought things gave a party zoes request for an allnighter gave malory the push to do all of that she bought food and pretty new candles with citrusy scents and fragrant soaps and fussy new guest towels then some good wine she cleaned the apartment shed been neglecting spilled spicy potpourri into bowls and groomed herself in the meticulous way that women groomed for other women by the time dana arrived she had cheese and fruit and fancy crackers set out the candles lit and music set on low wow pretty elegant around here i shouldve dressed up some you look great determined to be cheerful malory leaned in to kiss danas cheek i appreciate you guys doing this doing what hanging out with me giving me a boost ive been feeling down the last couple of days none of us figured on the energy drain this deal would be she passed malory a grocery bag then set down her overnight case i bought extra supplies wine cheezits chocolate truffles and popcorn you know the four basic food groups dana flipped through the movie selection next to the entertainment center did you rent every chick flick ever made every one currently available on dvd how about some wine you dont have to twist my arm new perfume no must be the candles nice thats zoe better pour another glass zoe came in through the patio doors loaded down with bags cookies she said a little breathlessly videos aromatherapy and coffee cake for the morning nice job dana took one of the bags from her and handed her a glass of wine then she leaned closer and said how do you get your lashes to look like that all sooty and spiky ill show you this is fun i went by the house today to do some measuring and to look at some samples there in the space and light ive got wallpaper books and paint chips in the car if we want to look later bradley vane caught me while i was there whats his story golden boy with a social conscience dana attacked the brie star athlete high school and college track a specialty honor student but not a nerd semiengaged a couple of times but always managed to wiggle out before it stuck been friends with flynn just about from birth excellent body which ive been fortunate enough to see through various stages interested in seeing it yourself not that way i havent had much luck with men so the only one whos going to be in my life for the time being is simon oh i love this song she slipped out of her shoes to dance so mal hows it going with flynn well i love him so its pretty irritating i wish i could dance like that like what all long legs and loose hips come on then zoe set her wine down held out her hands well work on it you do one of two things pretend nobodys watching or pretend that this guy this incredibly sexy guy is watching either way depending on your mood you just let go how come girls always end up dancing with girls malory wondered as she tried to get her hips to move independent of the rest of her body as zoes seemed to do because were better at it actually dana said helping herself to a little tree of green grapes its a kind of social sexual ritual the female performs tempts and teases the male observes fantasizes and selects or is selected jungle drums or the dave matthews band it comes down to the same thing are you going to dance malory asked her sure popping one more grape dana got up hips and shoulders went into a sinuous rhythm as she moved toward zoe they slithered into a dance that was to malorys mind both sexy and free now im totally outclassed youre doing fine loosen your knees and speaking of rituals i have some ideas butвђ zoe grabbed her wine again i think we should have some more wine before i bring it up you cant do that dana complained i hate that whats the idea she took zoes glass had a hurried sip look i drank more tell me okay lets sit down remembering her role as hostess malory brought the wine and the tray of food to the coffee table if this ritual has anything to do with leg waxing i need much more wine first no zoe laughed but i have an almost painless technique with hot wax i can give you a brazilian without anyone shedding a tear a brazilian вђњtidy up the bikini area it leaves just a neat little strip so you can wear the tiniest thong without looking well unkempt oh instinctively malory folded her hands over her crotch not even if you use morphine and shackles honest its all in the wrist zoe explained well soвђ back to what i was saying she continued i know weve all been reading and researching and trying to come up with theories and ideas to help malory find the first key and youve both been great really i just feel like im missing something some little thing that could open it all up maybe weve all missed something zoe countered the legend itself mortal woman mates with celtic god and becomes queen female power she has three daughters female again one of their guardians is a female well it is a fiftyfifty shot dana pointed out even for gods wait so when their souls are stolen and trapped by a man its said that three mortals mortal women have to find and turn the keys sorry zoe im not following you we already know all this malory reached halfheartedly for a grape lets take it a little further gods in celtic lore are well earthier than say the greek or roman ones theyre more like wizards and sorcerers thanвђ whats the word um omniscient beings is that right she asked dana yeah they have ties to the earth to nature like well witches theres black magic and white but they both use natural elements and forces and heres where you sort of have to step out of the box we havent been in the box since september the fourth dana pointed out what if we were chosen because wereвђ well because were witches malory frowned at the level of wine in zoes glass how much did you have to drink before you got here no just think about it we look like them maybe were somehow related to thatвђ bloodline or something maybe we have power but we just never knew it the legend says mortal women malory reminded her witches arent necessarily immortal theyre just people with more ive been reading up in wicca the female witch has three stages the maiden the mother the crone and they pay homage to the goddess theyвђ wicca is a young religion zoe dana said but its roots are old and three thats a magic number there are three of us i really think id know if i were a witch malory considered it as she sipped her wine and if this has somehow escaped my notice for nearly thirty years what am i supposed to do about it now conjure something cast a spell turn jordan into a horses ass sorry dana shrugged when malory stared at her just daydreaming we could try it together i bought some things zoe jumped up pulled open her bag ritual candles she said digging through incense table salt table salt baffled malory picked up the dark blue box of mortons and studied the cheerful girl with her umbrella you can make a protective circle with it it wards off evil spirits ash wands sort of wands i bought a baseball bat and cut it up to make them martha stewart meets glenda the good witch dana picked up the thin wooden wand waved it shouldnt it sprinkle fairy dust drink more wine zoe ordered crystals amethyst and rose quartz and this really great ball she held up the globe whered you get all this loot malory demanded new age shop at the mall tarot cardsвђceltic ones because it seemed right andвђ a ouija board dana pounced on it man oh man i havent seen one of these since i was a kid i found it at the toy store they dont carry them in the new age place we had this pj party when i was a kid got all toked up on pepsi and m ms and lit candles everybody asked the name of the guy theyd marry mine came up ptzbah dana gave a sentimental sigh it was really sweet lets do the ouija first dana suggested for old times sake okay but weve got to do it right take it seriously zoe rose to turn off the lights and music i wonder if ptzbah is still out there dana slid to the floor opened the box wait we have to set up the ritual i got a book they sat in a circle on the floor we have to cleanse our minds zoe instructed visualize opening our chakras i never open my chakras in public dana giggled unrepentant until malory slapped her knee and we light the ritual candles white for purity yellow for memory purple for power zoe bit her lip as she carefully ignited the tapers place the crystals amethyst forвђ shoot she reached for her book flipped pages here amethyst for intuition and the incense rose quartz for psychic power and divination its pretty malory decided soothing i think we should all take turns with the tarot cards and maybe try some chants but lets make dana happy and do this first zoe set the board between them and placed the pointer in its center we have to concentrate she said focus our minds and our powers on one question can it be about the love of my life i pine for ptzbah no zoe swallowed a laugh and tried to look stern this is serious business we want the location of the first key malory should do the asking but you and i need to think it we should close our eyes malory rubbed her fingers on her pants took a deep breath ready they laid fingertips on the pointer sat in silence should we call on the otherworld or something malory whispered pay our respects ask for guidance what zoe opened one eye maybe you should call on the ones behind the curtain of dreams denizens dana suggested вђњthats a good word call on the denizens behind the curtain of dreams for guidance okay here goes everybody quiet everyone be calm concentrate malory waited ten seconds in silence we call on the denizens behind the curtain of dreams to aid and to guide us in our um in our quest tell them youre one of the chosen ones zoe said out of the corner of her mouth and was shushed by dana i am one of the chosen one of the seekers of the keys time is short i ask you to show me the way to the key so that we can free the souls ofвђ dana no pushing the pointer im not really mouth dry malory opened her eyes and watched the pointer shudder under their fingertips the candles zoe whispered oh jeez look at the candles the flames shot up a trio of slim gold edged with red light began to throb like a pulse something blew cold through the room and set those flames dancing this is wild dana exclaimed i mean seriously wild its moving the pointer jerked with malorys fingers trembling on it she heard nothing but the roar of blood in her own head as she watched it slide from letter to letter your death her gasp was still strangled in her throat when the room suddenly burst with light and wind she heard someone scream threw up an arm to shield her eyes as a form coalesced out of a whirlpool of air the board shattered as if made of glass what are you playing at rowena stood in the center of them the sharp heel of her shoe digging into a shard of the board have you no more sense than to open a door to such things as you cannot understand or defend against with an annoyed sigh she stepped gracefully out of the circle and picked up the wine id like a glass please how did you get here how did you know malory pushed herself up on rubbery legs its fortunate for you that i did both she picked up the salt and upended the box over the remains of the board oh now just a damn minute sweep it up together rowena ordered zoe then burn it id very much appreciate a glass of wine she handed the bottle to malory then sat on the sofa outraged malory stalked into the kitchen yanked a wineglass from the cupboard she marched back and shoved the glass into rowenas hand i didnt invite you into my home on the contrary you invited me and whoever else chose to come through the opening then we are witches rowenas expression changed as she looked over at zoes rapt face no not the way you mean her tone was more gentle now patient teacher to eager student though every woman has some magic still together your powers are trebled and you had just enough skill just enough desire to issue an invitation im not the only one who answered it you felt him she said to malory youve felt him before kane she cupped her elbows and shuddered as the memory of the cold seeped into her he moved the pointer not us he was playing with us he threatened malory the thrill forgotten zoe was on her feet now what are you going to do about it all i can maybe thats not good enough dana reached up to link her hand with malorys i heard you scream i saw your face when you did you felt something zoe and i didnt and it was real terror it was real pain its the cold itsвђ i cant describe it the absence of all warmth rowena murmured all hope all life but he cant touch you unless you allow it allow it how the hell did sheвђ zoe broke off looked down at the broken board at her feet oh god im so sorry mal im so sorry its not your fault its not she took zoes hand so for a moment the three of them were linked seeing them rowena smiled into her wine we were looking for answers and you had an idea which is more than ive had the last couple of days we tried something maybe it was the wrong something she added as she whipped back to rowena but that doesnt give you the right to slap at us for it youre absolutely right i apologize she leaned forward to spread brie on a cracker then tapped a finger against the tarot deck light flickered over them then was gone these will do you no harm you may develop a skill for readings or even find you have a gift for them youвђ zoe pressed her lips together if you hadnt come when you didвђ its my duty and my wish to keep you from harm when and how i can now i should go leave you to your evening rowena rose looked around the room you have a pretty home malory it suits you feeling ungracious and childish malory huffed out a breath why dont you stay finish your wine surprise ran across rowenas face thats very kind of you id like that its been a very long time since ive sat in the company of women ive missed it it wasnt very strange after the initial awkwardness to have a woman whod lived for thousands of years sitting in her living room drinking her wine and it became apparent by the time they started on the truffles that womenвђgoddess or mortalвђwere the same under the skin i rarely fuss with it rowena said while zoe worked her mane of hair into an elegant upsweep its not one of my talents so i tend to wear it down ive cut it occasionally but i always regret it not everyone can wear it simply as you do and still look regal rowena studied herself in the hand mirror as zoe worked then tilted the glass to study her stylist id love to have your hair its so striking couldnt you i mean if you wanted to look a certain way couldnt you justвђ zoe fluttered her fingers and made rowena laugh that isnt my gift what about pitte dana rolled over on the couch whats his deal hes a warrior full of pride and arrogance and will hes maddening and exciting she lowered the mirror zoe youre an artist oh i just like playing with hair she stepped in front of rowena and released a few tendrils around her face a great look for that important board meeting or the afteroscars bash sexy female and powerful well you give that off no matter what the do excuse me but i just have to ask said dana whats it like to be with the same guy for well basically forever hes the only man i want rowena answered oh come on come on youve got to have had a few hundred fantasies about other men in the last couple of millennia of course rowena set the mirror down and her lips bowed into a dreamy smile there was a young waiter once in rome such a face and form with eyes so dark it seemed i could see worlds drowning in them and he served me coffee and a bun he called me bella donna with such a knowing smile while i ate my bun i imagined biting into his tasty bottom lip she pressed her own together then laughed i painted him in my studio and let him flirt with me outrageously and when i nudged him along after a session i would drag pitte away from whatever he might be doing and seduce him you never cheated i love my man rowena said simply were bound body heart soul theres magic in that more potent than any spell more wicked than any curse she reached up laid a hand over zoes you loved a boy and he gave you a son for that youll always love him even though he was weak and betrayed you simons my world and youve made it a bright and loving world i so envy you your child you she rose stepped closer to trail her fingers over danas hair you loved one who was no longer a boy yet not quite a man for that youve never forgiven him why should i theres a question rowena replied what about me malory asked and rowena sat on the arm of the sofa touched a hand to her shoulder you love the man so much so fast and fierce it makes you doubt your own heart for that you cant trust him how can i trust what doesnt make sense as long as you need to ask you wont have the answer she leaned down pressed her lips to malorys brow thank you for having me in your home for sharing yourselves with me here take this she held out her hand offered malory the pale blue stone in the palm what is it a small charm put it under your pillow tonight youll sleep well i must go she smiled a little lifting her hand to her hair as she rose and crossed to the glass door i wonder what pitte will think pf my hair good night she opened the door and slipped into the night zoe waited three seconds then scurried to the door framing her face with her hands she pressed it close to the glass shoot i thought shed go poof or something but shes just walking like a normal person she seems pretty normal dana shifted around to reach the popcorn you know for a goddess with a few thousand years under her belt but sad malory turned the blue stone over in her hand theres all that sophistication and cool amusement on the surface but theres this terrible sadness under it she meant it when she said she was envious of you for having simon zoe its funny to think about zoe wandered back chose a brush a rattail comb and pins then moved behind the sofa she lives in that big well castle really with all those beautiful things she began to brush danas hair and shes beautiful even wise i think shes rich and has a man she loves shes traveled and she can paint those wonderful pictures dividing sections of danas hair she began to braid but she envies someone like me because i have a kid do you think she cant have children i didnt want to ask its so personal but i wonder why she couldnt if she can do all the things she can do why couldnt she have a baby maybe pitte doesnt want to have kids dana shrugged her shoulders some people dont whatre you doing back there zoe new do im mixing some skinny braids in it should be young and kicky do you do i what want to have kids dana munched popcorn and considered yeah id like to have a couple i figure if i dont find a guy i can stand being with for the long term in the next few years ill just do it on my own you know make love with medical science youd do that fascinated malory reached into the bowl raise a child on your own i mean on purpose she added looking up at zoe you know what i mean sure i would dana settled the bowl between them why not im healthy i think id be good at the parenting thing that i have a lot to offer a kid id want to make sure i had solid financial security first but if im cruising toward say thirtyfive and theres no guy in the picture id do the deed sort of takes the romance out of it malory commented maybe but it gets results youve got to look at the big picture if theres something you want deep down want you cant let anything stop you from getting it malory thought of her dream of the child shed held in her arms of the light filling her world her heart even if you really really want something there are lines well murder and a certain amount of mayhem are discouraged im talking about making important choices then going the distance and dealing with the results what about you zoe would you do it again the raiseakidonyourown part dana asked i dont think id set out to do it again its hard theres nobody to share the load with and sometimes the load seems impossible for one person but more theres nobody who looks at the child and feels what you feel nobody to share that love and pride and i dont know surprise with were you scared malory asked her yeah oh yeah i still get scared i think its supposed to be scary because its so important do you want babies mal i do she rubbed the stone gently between her fingers more than i realized by three dana and zoe were sleeping in her bed and malory was picking up the worst of the debris too restless to settle in on the sofa there were too many thoughts too many images flitting around in her mind she studied the little blue stone again maybe it would work shed accepted bigger things than having a piece of rock under her pillow as the cure for the insomnia that was plaguing her or maybe she hadnt maybe she really hadnt accepted any of it not in that deepdown way dana spoke of she was exhausted yet she wasnt putting the stone under her pillow and letting herself try she claimed to love flynn yet she was waiting tucking a small part of herself safely away and waiting for the feeling to pass and at the same time she was annoyed and hurt that he didnt simply fall over in love with her and even things out after all how could she keep her balance outline plans and keep it all tidy if everything between them wasnt equal everything belongs in its place doesnt it everything has its slot and if it doesnt fit just right well youre not the one whos going to change thats up to the other guy with a sigh she dropped down on the couch shed pursued a career in art like a demon because while fate hadnt cooperated by giving her talent she wasnt about to admit that all those years of study and work had been wasted she made it fit shed stayed at the gallery because it was comfortable because it was sensible and convenient shed made noise about striking out on her own one day but she hadnt meant it too big a risk too messy if pamela hadnt come along she would still be at the gallery and why did she resent pamela with every fiber of her being all right the woman was pushy and had all the taste of overcooked trout but a more flexible woman than malory price wouldve found a way around that she resented pamela primarily because shed shifted the balance shed changed the lines she just hadnt fit now there was the business she and dana and zoe were starting shed been the one to drag her feet on that oh shed come through in the end but how many times had she questioned that decision since how many times had she considered backing out because it was too hard to see how it could all be neatly done and she hadnt moved forward on it hadnt gone back to the property or made any plans put out any feelers for artists and craftspeople hell she hadnt even mailed off the application for her business license because once she did she was committed she was using the key as an excuse not to take the final step oh she was looking for it giving the quest her time and her energy one thing she took seriously was responsibility but here and now alone and awake at three in the morning it was time to admit one undeniable fact her life may have changed in a dozen strange and fascinating ways in three weeks time but she hadnt changed at all she put the stone under her pillow theres still time she murmured and curled up to sleep when she woke the apartment was silent as a tomb she lay still a moment studying the lance of light that sneaked through the chink in the patio drapes and onto her floor morning she thought full morning she didnt remember falling asleep better much much better she didnt remember tossing and turning and worrying about sleep slowly she slid a hand under her pillow feeling for the stone she frowned groping now then sat up to lift the pillow there was no stone under it she searched under the cushions on the floor under the couch before sitting down again with a huff of confusion stones didnt just disappear or maybe they did when theyd served their purpose shed slept and slept well hadnt she just as promised in fact she felt wonderful as if shed had a nice relaxing vacation okay thanks rowena chapter eighteen she stretched out her arms took a deep breath and drew in the unmistakable scent of coffee unless the gift included morning coffee someone else was up she walked into the kitchen and found a pleasant surprise zoes coffee cake was on the counter set on a pretty plate and protected with saran wrap the coffeepot was on warm and was threequarters full and the morning paper was neatly folded and placed between malory picked up the note tucked under the cake plate and read zoes somewhat exotic mix of cursive and printing good morning had to get goingвђhave a teachers conference at ten ten malory thought with an absent glance at the kitchen clock her mouth fell open when she saw that it was nearly eleven that cant be right can it didnt want to wake either of you tried to be quiet you must move like a ghost malory said aloud danas got to be at work at two just in case i set the alarm clock in your room for her set it for noon so she wouldnt have to rush and would have time for breakfast i had the best time just wanted to tell you both of you that whatever happens im so glad i found you or we found each other however it worked im just really grateful youre my friends maybe next time we can get together at my place love zoe looks like its a day for gifts smiling malory set the note down where dana would find it too hoping to extend her good mood she cut a sliver of cake poured the coffee she arranged them on a tray added the paper and a small glass of juice then carried it all out to her patio fall was teasing the air shed always enjoyed the faint smoky scent that autumn brought with it when the leaves began to take on hints of the vibrant colors to come she needed to pick up some potted mums she noted as she broke off a piece of coffee cake she was behind schedule on that and some pumpkins and gourds for festive arrangements she would gather some leaves the maple ones once theyd turned scarlet she could pick up some extra things and do something fun for flynns front porch she sipped coffee while she skimmed the front page reading the morning paper was a different experience now that shed met flynn she liked wondering how he decided what went where and how he juggled it allвђ stories ads pictures typeface toneвђand made it one cohesive whole she nibbled and sipped her way through then felt her heart give a quick jolt when she came to his column odd wasnt it that shed seen it before week after week what had she thought she wondered cute guy nice eyes or something just that casual and forgettable shed read his column had either agreed or disagreed she hadnt taken any notice of the work and effort he put into it what turned his mind to whatever subject he wrote about that week it was different now that she knew him now that she could hear his voice speaking the words she read she could envision his face its expressions and have some insight into the workings of his very flexible mind what defines the artist she read by the time shed finished the column and was going back to read it through a second time shed fallen in love with him all over again flynn sat on the corner of a desk and listened while one of his reporters pitched him an idea for an article about a local man who collected clowns stuffed clown dolls clown statues clown pictures porcelain clowns plastic clowns clowns with dogs clowns that danced or sang or drove little clown cars hes got more than five thousand clowns not including clown memorabilia flynn tuned out for a moment as the very idea of five thousand clowns in one place at one time was slightly terrifying he imagined them banding together in a clown army and waging war with seltzer bottles and rubber bats all those big red noses all that maniacal laughter all those huge scary smiles why flynn asked why why does he have five thousand clowns oh tim a young reporter who habitually wore suspenders and too much hair gel creaked back in his chair see his father started the collection back in the twenties or something its like this generational deal he started adding to it himself you know like in the fifties then the whole bunch of them got passed to him when his father died some of his collection is like museum quality this stuff goes for real bucks on ebay okay give it a run take a photographer i want a shot of the whole collection with the guy in it and him with a couple of the more interesting pieces get him to give you the history or significance of specific pieces play up the fatherson connection but lead off with the numbers and a couple of pieces from each end of the money scale it could work for the weekender section and tim try to edit out the you knows and likes when you interview him got it flynn looked over to see malory standing between the desks holding an enormous pot of rustcolored mums something about the sparkle in her eye made the rest of the room fade away hi doing some gardening maybe is this a bad time no come on back how do you feel about clowns wrathful when theyre painted on black velvet good one tim he called back get some shots of any clown paintings on black velvet sublime to ridiculous and back again flynn added it could be good she stepped into the office ahead of him continuing on to set the flowers on his window ledge i wanted toвђ wait he held up a finger while he tuned in to the call coming out of his police scanner hold that thought he told her and poked his head back out the door shelly theres a ta five hundred block of crescent local pd and emts responding take mark ta malory repeated when he turned back to her traffic accident oh i was thinking just this morning how much you have to juggle and weigh and shape to put out the paper every day she bent down to pat the snoring moe and you manage to have a life at the same time in a manner of speaking no you have a very good life friends family work that satisfies you a house a silly dog i admire that she straightened i admire you wow you mustve had a really good time last night i did ill tell you about that but i dont want toвђ what is itвђsmother my lead bury the lead right she stepped over the dog laid her hands on flynns shoulders and leaning in kissed him long long and warm thank you his skin had started to hum what for because if it was really good maybe you should thank me again okay this time she linked her hands behind his head and added a bit of heat to the warmth outside the office applause broke out jesus ive got to get blinds for this place he tried the psychological angle of shutting the door i dont mind being the hero but maybe you should tell me what dragon i slayed i read your column this morning yeah usually if somebody likes my column they just say nice job hennessy i like your way better it isnt only the artist holding brush and vision who paints the picture she quoted its those who look and see the power and the beauty the strength and the passion who bring brushstroke and color to life thank you youre welcome every time i start feeling sorry for myself because im not living in paris and setting the art world on its ear im going to take out your column and remind myself what ive got what i am i think youre extraordinary вђњtoday so do i i woke up feeling better than i have in days amazing what a good nights sleep will doвђor a little blue stone under the pillow you lost me its not important just something rowena gave me she joined our little sleepover last night yeah what was she wearing laughing she sat on the edge of his desk she didnt stay long enough for the pajama section of the nights entertainment but you could say she arrived in the nick the three of us were fooling around with a ouija board youve got to be kidding no zoe had this theory that maybe the three of us were witches but didnt know it which is why we were chosenвђ and really it made some sense at the time in any case things got very strange candle flames rising wind blowing and kane he got in rowena said wed opened a door like an invitation damn it malory goddamn it whatre you doing playing around withвђwith mystical forces hes already had a shot at you you couldve been hurt he had such a face she thought such a great face it could change from interested to amused to furious in a split second вђњthats something rowena made very clear last night theres no point in being angry with me about it now i didnt have the option of being angry with you before now true enough she grunted when moe awakened by the temper in flynns voice tried to jump in her lap youre absolutely right that we shouldnt have played with something we didnt understand im sorry believe me and it isnt something i plan on trying again he reached over to give her hair a quick tug im trying to have an argument here the least you could do is cooperate im too happy with you to argue today lets pencil something in for next week besides i just came by to bring you the flowers ive interrupted your day long enough he glanced at the mumsвђthe second bunch of flowers shed brought to him youre sure cheerful today why shouldnt i be im a woman in love whos made what i feel are very good decisions aboutвђ about he prompted when her eyes went blank choices she mumbled moments of decision moments of truth why didnt i think of that before maybe it was your house but my dream perception of perfection turned it around made it all fit more mine than yours or maybe that has nothing to do with it and its just you what is the key i need to search your house is that going to be a problem ahвђ impatient now she waved away his hesitation look if you have anything personal or embarrassing tucked away like skin magazines or adventurous sex toys ill give you a chance to get them out or promise to ignore them the skin mags and adventurous sex toys are all locked in the vault im afraid i cant give you the combination she moved into him trailed her hands up his chest i know its a lot to ask i wouldnt like anyone poking through my place when i wasnt there not that much to poke through but i dont want any grief about how i should spring for new underwear and use what ive got as dustrags im not your mother will you let jordan know im coming hes off somewhere today flynn pulled his keys out of his pocket worked the house key off the chain you think youll still be there when i get home why dont i make sure im there when you get home why dont you then ill call jordan tell him to stay away he can bunk with brad tonight and i can have you all to myself she took the key bumped her lips lightly on his ill look forward to being had the wicked gleam in her eye kept him grinning for an hour after shed gone malory jogged up the steps to flynns front door she was going to be systematic slow and thorough she told herself she should have thought of this before it was like connecting the dots the paintings reflected moments of change of destiny certainly her life had changed when shed fallen for flynn and this was flynns house she thought as she stepped inside hadnt he said hed bought it when hed accepted his destiny looking within and without she remembered as she merely stood and tried to absorb the feel of the place inside the house outside in the yard or was it more metaphorical in that shed begun to see herself inside this space light and shadows the house was full of both she could only be grateful it wasnt full of things flynns spartan style was going to make the search simpler she started in the living room automatically wincing at the couch she looked under the cushions found eightynine cents in loose change a bic lighter a paperback edition of a robert parker novel and cookie crumbs unable to stand it she hunted up the vacuum cleaner and a dustrag and began to clean as she went this twoforone process kept her in the kitchen for more than an hour at the end of it she was sweaty and the kitchen sparkled but she hadnt turned up anything resembling a key she switched gears and headed upstairs shed begun and ended her dream upstairs she recalled maybe that was symbolic and certainly there couldnt be anything up here in as deplorable shape as the kitchen one glance at the bathroom disabused her of that notion even loveвђof a man and of orderвђhad its limits she decided and shut the door without going inside she stepped into his office and was immediately charmed all the dark thoughts that had damned him for a pig vanished it wasnt neat god knew it needed a good dusting and there was enough dog hair balled in the corners to knit an afghan but the walls were sunny the desk was a beauty and the framed posters showed an eye for art and style that she hadnt given him credit for youve got all these wonderful sides to you dont you she trailed her fingers over the desk impressed by the stack of files amused by the action figures it was a good work space a good thinking space she imagined he didnt give a damn about the state of his kitchen his sofa was just a place to take a nap or stretch out and read a book but he took care with his surroundings when it was important to him beauty knowledge courage shed been told she would need all three in the dream there had been beautyвђlove home art then the knowledge that it was illusion and finally the courage to break that illusion maybe that was a part of it and love would forge the key well she loved flynn she accepted that she loved flynn so where was the damn key she turned a circle then wandered over to take a closer look at his art collection pinup girls he was such aвђ guy she decided a very clever guy there was a sexual punch to the photographs but an innocence underlying that betty grables legs rita hayworths mane of hair monroes unforgettable face legends as much for their beauty as their talent goddesses of the screen goddesses her fingers shook as she took the first print from the wall she had to be right this had to be it but she examined every print every frame then every inch of the room and found nothing refusing to be discouraged she sat at his desk she was close a step off one way or the other but close the pieces were all there she was certain of it now she just needed to find the right pattern and make them fit she needed to get out in the air for a while let it turn over in her mind she would do something ordinary while it brewed in there no not something ordinary something inspired something artful flynn decided it was time to reverse the roles back to where they had started and so he stopped off on the way home to buy her flowers there was a bite of fall in the air and its nip had already teased color into the trees the surrounding hills were hazed with reds and golds and umbers over the green over those hills a threequarter moon would rise tonight did she think of that he wondered and worry of course she did it would be impossible for a woman like malory to do otherwise still shed been happy when she came to his office he meant to keep her that way he would take her out to dinner maybe drive into pittsburgh for a change of scene a long drive a fancy dinnerвђthat would appeal to her keep her mind offвђ the minute he stepped in the front door he knew something was off it smelledвђ good a little lemony he thought as he approached the living room a little spicy with female undertones did women just sort of exude scent when theyd been in a place for a few hours mal back here in the kitchen the dog beat him by a mile and was already being given a biscuit a stroke and a firm nudge out the back door flynn wasnt sure what made his mouth water the scents pumping out of the stove or the woman wearing a white bib apron god who knew an apron could be sexy hi whatre you doing cooking she shut the back door i know its an eccentric use for a kitchen but call me crazy flowers her eyes went soft almost dewy theyre pretty you are too cooking he tossed his embryonic plans for the evening aside without a qualm would that involve anything resembling dinner it would she took the flowers kissed him over them i decided to dazzle you with my culinary talents so i went to the grocery store you didnt have anything in here that qualified as actual food cereal i have a lot of cereal i noticed because he didnt own a vase she filled a plastic pitcher with water for the flowers the fact that she didnt cringe while doing so made her very proud of herself you also didnt appear to own any of the usual implements used in preparing actual food not a single wooden spoon i dont understand why they make spoons out of wood havent we progressed beyond carving tools out of trees he picked one up off the counter then frowned somethings different in here something changed its clean shock registered on his face as he stared around the room it is clean what did you do hire a brigade of elves what do they charge by the hour they work for flowers she sniffed at them and decided they looked very sweet in the plastic pitcher after all youre paid in full you cleaned thats soвђ weird presumptuous but i got carried away no presumptuous isnt the word that springs to mind he took her hand kissed her fingers the words wow should i be really embarrassed i wont if you wont deal he drew her close rubbed his cheek against hers and youre cooking in the oven i wanted to take my mind off things for a while so did i i was going to play the letsgoouttoafancydinner card but you trumped my ace you can tuck the ace up your sleeve and play it anytime putting things in order helps clear my mind and there was a lot to put in order around here i didnt find the key yeah i got that im sorry im close she stared at the steam puffing out of a pot as if the answer might appear in it i feel like im just missing a step somewhere well well talk about that dinners about ready why dont you pour the wine i think itll complement the meat loaf sure he picked up the wine she had breathing on the counter then set it down again meat loaf you made meat loaf mashed potatoes tooвђshortly she added as she set up the mixer shed brought over from her own kitchen and green beans it seemed harmonious considering your column and i assumed that since you used the meal you must like meat loaf im a guy we live for meat loaf malory ridiculously moved he caressed her cheek i shouldve brought you more flowers she laughed and got to work on the potatoes shed boiled those will do nicely thanks this is actually my first meat loaf im more a tosssomepastatogether or a sautгsomechicken girl but i got the recipe from zoe who swears its foolproof and guyfriendly she claims simon inhales it ill try to remember to chew then he took her arm to turn her toward him and moved in slowly ran his hands up her body until his fingers skimmed her jaw he laid his lips on hers softly sliding her into the kiss the way he might slide her into a feather bed her heart did one long lazy roll even as the mists shimmered over her brain the rubber spatula she held slipped out of limp fingers as everything inside her melted against him into him he felt it that shudder and give that surrender to self as much as to him when he eased her back her eyes were blue and blurry it was woman he realized who had the power to make man feel like a god flynn his lips curved as he brushed them over her forehead malory iвђ i forgot what i was doing he bent down to retrieve the spatula i think you were mashing potatoes oh right potatoes feeling a bit drunk she walked to the sink to wash the spatula this has to be the nicest thing anyones ever done for me i love you she pressed her lips together stared out the window dont say anything i dont want to make things uncomfortable for either of us ive been thinking about this a lot i know ive rushed and ive pushed neither of which is much like me she spoke briskly now as she went back to the mixer maloryвђ really you dont need to say anything itd be enough more than enough for now if you just accepted it maybe enjoyed it a little it seems to me love shouldnt be a weapon or a device or a weight its beauty is that it be a gift with no strings attached to it just like this meal she smiled though the steady way he watched her was unnerving so why dont you pour the wine then wash up and well both just enjoy it okay it could wait flynn thought maybe it was meant to wait in any case the words in his head sounded offkey when compared with the simplicity of hers so they would enjoy each other and the meal shed prepared in the awkward homely kitchen with fresh flowers arranged in a plastic pitcher as beginnings went this one had elements of both of them wasnt it interesting how one managed to complement the other you know if you made me a list of stuff i should have in here i could pick it up she arched her brows took the wine he offered then pulled a little notepad out of her apron pocket this is already half full i was planning to wait until you were lulled into complacency by meat and potatoes he flipped through the notebook and noted that items were listed under specific headings foodstuffs cleaning suppliesвђwith subheadings kitchen bathroom laundryвђhousehold necessities jesus the woman was irresistible am i going to need to take out a loan вђњthink of it as an investment taking the notebook from him she tucked it into his shirt pocket then concentrated on the potatoes oh by the way i really like the art in your office upstairs art it took him a minute oh my girls really clever nostalgic sexy stylish its a great room altogether which i admit was something of a relief to me considering the rest of the house enough that i wasnt flattened by disappointment when my brainstorm about the key didnt pan out she drained the beans that shed dashed with basil into one of her serving bowls handed it to him monroe grable hayworth and so on screen goddesses goddess key good segue yeah it seemed so but no luck she passed him the bowl of potatoes then using the potholders shed bought took the meat loaf out of the oven still i think im on the right track and it gave me the chance to see your thinking space she sat scanned the table hope youre hungry they dished up the meal at the first bite of meat loaf flynn sighed good thing you put moe out id hate to torment him with this since he wont be getting much of it my compliments to the artist there was pleasure malory discovered in watching someone you loved eat what youd prepared pleasure in sharing a simple meal at the kitchen table at the end of the day shed never felt deprived eating dinner alone or in the company of a friend but now it was easy to see herself sharing this hour with him night after night year after year flynn you said that when you accepted that you were meant to stay in the valley you bought this house did youвђdo youвђhave a vision for it how you want it to look and feel i dont know if youd call it a vision i liked the look of it the lines of it and the big yard something about a big yard makes me feel prosperous and safe he went back for seconds i figure ill have to gut this room sooner or later rip it into the new millennium buy stuff for the rest of the place eventually but i never seem to get around to it i guess because its just me and moe he poured more wine for both of them if youve got some ideas im open to suggestions ive always got ideas and you should be careful before you get me started but that wasnt why i asked i had a vision for the property we boughtвђdana and zoe and i as soon as i walked into that house i could see how it would work what it needed from me what i could bring to it and i havent been back since youve been pretty busy thats not it i deliberately havent been back thats not like me usually when i have a project i cant wait to get started to start fiddling with things lining them up making lists i took the step i signed on the dotted line but i havent taken the next step its a big commitment mal im not afraid of commitment hell i thrive on it but ive been a little afraid of this im going to go over tomorrow take a look at the place apparently the previous owners left a lot of stuff they didnt want in the attic zoe asked me to go through it before she started hauling things out what kind of attic a dark spooky attic or a big fun grandmas attic i have no idea i havent been up there it shamed her to admit that i havent been off the ground floor which is ridiculous as i own a third of the property or will im going to change that change isnt my best thing want me to go with you id like to see the place anyway i was hoping youd say that she reached over to give his hand a squeeze thanks now since you asked about ideas on this house id suggest you start in the living room which by my definition is an area where youre supposed to live youre going to insult my sofa again arent you i dont believe i have the skills to form the insult that sofa merits but you might want to think about actual tables lamps area rugs curtains i was thinking i could just order a bunch of stuff out of a catalogue she sent him a very long very dry stare youre trying to scare me but it wont work and since youve generously offered to help me out tomorrow ill return the favor id be glad to give you a hand with turning that space into a room since hed all but licked his plate clean a second time he resisted going for thirds was that a trick some clever ploy to drag me off to a furniture store it wasnt but it sure circled around to it well didnt it i can give you some of my thoughts while we do the dishes she rose to stack dishes but he put a hand over hers lets just go in there now and you can show me whats so wrong with my simple minimalist approach after the dishes uhuh now he began to pull her out of the room amused at the struggle on her face as she glanced back at the table theyll still be there when we get back trust me its not going to hurt to do them out of the logical order yes it does a little five minutes then the condensed consultation first you did a good job with the walls its a goodsized room and the strong colors a complement which you could enhance with touches of other strong colors in curtains andвђ whatre you doing she demanded when he began unbuttoning her shirt getting you naked excuse me she tapped his fingers away i charge extra for naked decorating consults bill me he swept her off her feet this was just a trick wasnt it a ploy to get my clothes off and have your way with me sure circled around nicely didnt it he dumped her on the couch and dived on top of her chapter nineteen he made her laugh as he nipped along her jawline playfully wrestled her down when she tried to squirm away you taste even better than meat loaf if thats the best you can do then youre the one wholl be washing dishes your threats dont scare me he walked his fingers up her ribs toward her breast theres a dishwasher somewhere in that kitchen yes there is and you had a bag of dog food stored in it is that where that went to he nibbled at her earlobe its now in the utility closet where it belongs she turned her head slightly to give him easier access to her neck youre obviously unaware that there are very practical even attractive containers manufactured to store items such as dog food no kidding looks like ive got my work cut out for me getting these domestic worries out of your mind but i like a challenge after a good meal lets just get this off he tugged at her shirt then made a throaty sound as he smoothed a finger over the salmoncolored lace of her bra i like this well leave that on a while we could take this upstairs you know i cleaned under the cushions and learned just what this monster can swallow we could be next ill protect you he replaced his fingertips with his lips skimmed them over lace and flesh the enormous cushions gave under their weight cradled them together as he sampled her she wiggled and squirmed in mock resistance an erotic game that aroused them both her mind began to fog as he scraped his teeth down her torso what do you think of brazilians baffled he lifted his head what the people or the nuts she stared at him amazed that shed spoken out loud delighted with his response laughter shook her rolled straight up from her belly as she grabbed him and rained kisses over his face nothing never mind there she dragged his shirt over his head now were even she loved the feel of his skin under her hands the sturdy shoulders the play of muscles she loved oh yes the feel of his hands on her gentle or rough rushed or patient and as the evening light slipped through the windows as he roamed down her body she closed her eyes and let sensation rule flutters and tugs heat and chills each was a separate thrill blending into a single steady ache his fingers danced over her belly made it quiver before he drew her pants down her hips and legs then his tongue slid over her down her into her and flashed her to peak she moaned his name when her body went bowstring taut under his sighed his name as she seemed to dissolve under his hands he wanted as hed wanted in that stunning moment in his kitchen to give her anything everything she wanted all she needed more than she could imagine hed never known what it was to be offered unconditional love to know it waited for him hed never felt deprived of it because hed never known it existed and now he held the woman whod given it to him she was his miracle his magic his key he pressed his lips to her shoulder her throat rode on the punch of these huge new emotions when her arms came around him words tumbled through his mind but none of them were enough he found her mouth with his cupped her hips and filled her warm and loose and sleepy she curled into him she was more than willing to cocoon herself in this lovely sexual haze to drift in it to the sound of her own skin humming chores could wait forever if need be as long as she could snuggle here feeling flynns heart pound against hers she wondered why they didnt just drift off to sleep this way warm naked and tangled with the bloom of lovemaking covering them both like soft silky clouds she stretched luxuriously under his hand when he stroked her back mmmm lets just stay here all night like a couple of bears in a cave youre happy she tipped her face up to smile at him of course i am she snuggled back in so happy im pretending there arent dishes waiting to be washed or leftovers to put away you havent been happy the last few days no i guess i havent she settled her head more comfortably on his shoulder i felt like id lost my direction and everything around me was shifting and changing so fast i couldnt keep up then it occurred to me that if i didnt change at least open myself to changing the direction didnt matter because i was going nowhere there are some things i want to tell you if you can handle some more changes uneasy as his tone was so serious she braced herself all right about lily he felt her tense an instant tightening of muscles and could all but feel her will herself to relax again this may not be the best moment to tell me about another woman especially one you loved and planned to marry i think it is we knew each other casually for several months then intimately for the best part of a year we clicked on a number of levels professionally socially sexuallyвђ her lovely cocoon was now in shreds and she began to feel the cold flynnвђ hear me out it was the longest adult relationship id had with a woman serious relationship with longterm planning i thought we were in love with each other she hurt you i know im sorry butвђ quiet he tapped a finger on the top of her head she didnt love me or if she did that love had specific requirements so you couldnt call it a gift he was silent for a moment selecting his words carefully it isnt easy looking in the mirror and accepting that you were missing some element some thing that kept a person you wanted from loving you she tried to keep steady no its not and even when you come to terms with it when you realize it just wasnt right that there was something missing from the other person too something missing from the whole it still breaks your stride it makes you a lot more hesitant about taking that kind of chance again i understand that and you end up going nowhere he stated echoing her earlier statement jordan said something to me the other day that had me thinking and thinking back i asked myself if id ever really imagined life with lily you know pictured how wed be together a few years down the road i could see the immediate future the movingtonewyork thing how wed get jobs in our chosen fields find a place to live and then i realized that was pretty much it that was all id been able to see not how we would live or what wed do beyond that vague picture not how wed look together in a decade it wasnt hard to picture my life without her in it maybe harder to pick up my life at the point she dumped me lots of bruises on the pride and ego lots of anger and hurt and the byproduct of feeling like i probably wasnt cut out for the whole loveandmarriage thing her heart was twisting for both of them you dont have to explain im not finished i was bumping along pretty well had my life in orderвђnot so youd think so but it suited me then moe knocked you flat on the sidewalk and things began to change no secret i was attracted to you from the getgo and hoped wed end up naked on this sofa sooner or later but initially thats as far as i could see things regarding you and me this time he tipped her face up he wanted her to look at him now wanted to see her face ive known you less than a month on a lot of basic points we come at it from opposite angles but i can see my life with you the way you can look through a window and see your own little world spread out i can see how it could be a year from now or twenty years from now with you and me and what we make he skimmed his fingers along her cheek just to feel the shape of it what i cant see is how id pick up my life from this point and make it without you he watched her eyes fill with tears watched them spill over i love you he brushed away a tear with his thumb i dont have a master plan for what happens next i just know i love you emotions surged through her so bright and rich she wondered that they didnt burst out of her in colored light terrified that she was about to fall apart she struggled to smile i have to ask you for something important anything promise me youll never get rid of this couch he laughed nuzzled her cheek youre going to regret that no i wont im not going to regret a thing with the two women who had become her friends and partners malory sat on the front porch of the house that would be onethird hers the sky had clouded up since shed arrived clouds stacking on clouds to make a multilayered sweep of grays storm brewing she figured and found herself pleased with the idea of being inside with rain pounding on the roof but first she wanted to sit while the electricity gathered in the air and those first puffs of wind bent the trees more than anything shed needed to share her joy and her nerves with her friends he loves me she didnt think she would ever tire of saying it aloud flynn loves me its so romantic zoe dug a tissue out of her purse and sniffled into it it was you know there was a time i wouldnt have thought so id have had a very detailed outline in my mind candlelight music with me and the perfect man in some elegant room or outdoors in some spectacular setting it would all have had to be arranged just so with a shake of her head she laughed at herself thats why i know its the real thing because it didnt have to be just so and elegant and perfect it just had to be it had to be flynn jeez its hard for me to equate the stars in your eyes with flynn dana rested her chin on her fist nice and all because i love him too but its flynn my favorite moron ive never pictured him as a romantic figure she turned toward zoe what the hells in that meat loaf maybe i should get the recipe im going to take another look at it myself she patted malorys knee im really happy for you i liked the way you two looked together right from the start hey you moving in with him dana perked up вђњthat would set jordan out on his butt that much sooner sorry we didnt get to that stage yet were just basking in the wereinlove moment for now and that friends and neighbors is a real change for me im not making schedules and lists im just going with it god i feel like i could take on the world which brings me to the next part of this session im sorry i havent contributed to any of the plans for the house here or done anything about moving forward with ideas for fixing it up putting it all together i wondered if you were going to bail dana admitted i was thinking about it im sorry i didnt tell you i guess i had to work out for myself what i was doing and why now i know im starting my own business because the longer you put off dreams the less chance you have of making them real im going into a partnership with two women i like a lot not only am i not going to let them down but im not going to let me down either she got to her feet and with her hands planted on her hips turned to look at the house i dont know if im ready for this but im ready to try i dont know if im going to find the key in the time i have left but i know ive tried there too i know what i think zoe rose to join her if it werent for the key you wouldnt be with flynn now we wouldnt be together and we wouldnt have this place because of that ive got a chance to make something special for myself for simon i wouldnt have had that without the two of you let me start off saying we can skip the group hug still dana walked over to them but i feel the same way i wouldnt have had the chance for this without both of you my idiot brother has a classy lady in love with him all that starts with the key i say youre going to find it she looked up as rain began to splatter now lets get the hell in out of the rain inside they stood in a loose semicircle вђњtogether or separate malory asked вђњtogether zoe answered вђњtop or bottom вђњtop dana glanced over got assenting nods you said flynn was coming by yeah hes going to slip over for an hour we can use him as a pack mule then for anything we want to haul out of the attic some of the stuff up there is great zoes face shone with enthusiasm as they started up i know it looks like junk at first glance but i think once we get to it well be able to use some theres an old wicker chair that could be rewoven and painted itd look good on the porch and theres a couple of those pole lamps the shades are trash but the poles could be cleaned up and antiqued her voice faded away as malory climbed the steps the window at the top was wet with rain dull with dust and her heart began to thud like a fist against her ribs this is the place she whispered yeah it is this is it dana set her hands on her hips as she looked around the second floor itll be ours and the banks in a few weeks no this is the place from my dream this is the house how could i be so stupid not to realize not to understand excitement pitched into her voice rushing the words out it wasnt what was flynns but what was mine im the key isnt that what rowena said she whirled back to face them her eyes brilliant and bright beauty knowledge courage thats the three of us thats this place and the dream that was my fantasy my idea of perfection so it had to be my place she pressed a hand to her heart as if to keep it from leaping free the keys here in this house in the next instant she was alone the staircase behind her filled with a thin blue light like a mist it rolled toward her crawled along the floor at her feet until she stood ankledeep in the damp chill of it rooted in shock she called out but her voice rang hollow in a mocking echo with her heart drumming she looked at the rooms on either side of her the eerie blue fog snaked and twined its way up the walls over the windows blocking even the gloomy light of the storm run it was a frantic whisper in her mind run get out now before its too late this wasnt her fight she was an ordinary woman leading an ordinary life she gripped the banister took the first step down she could still see the door through that sheer blue curtain that so quickly ate the true light through the door was the real world her world she had only to open that door and walk out for normalcy to click back into place that was what she wanted wasnt it a normal life hadnt her dream shown her that marriage and family french toast for breakfast and flowers on the dresser a pretty life of simple pleasures built on love and affection it was waiting for her outside the door she walked down the steps like a woman in a trance she could see beyond the door somehow through the door where the day was perfect with autumn trees a wash of color gilded by sunlight air brisk and tart and though her heart continued to gallop inside her chest her lips curved in a dreamy smile as she reached for the door this is wrong she heard her own voice oddly flat and calm this is another trick a part of her shuddered in shock as she turned away from the door turned from the perfect life waiting outside whats out there isnt real but this is this is our place now stunned that shed nearly deserted her friends she called out for dana and zoe again where had he put them what illusion had separated them fear for them had her rushing back up the steps her flight tore the blue mists only to have it gather back into nasty ribbons be hind her to orient herself she went to the window at the top of the stairs and rubbed away those frigid mists her fingertips went numb but she could see it was still storming rain whipped down out of a bruised sky her car was in the drive just where shed left it across the street a woman with a red umbrella and a bag of groceries dashed toward a house that was real malory told herself that was life messy and inconvenient and she would get it back shed find her way back but first she had a job to do chills crawled along her skin as she turned to the right she wished for a jacket for a flashlight for her friends for flynn she forced herself not to run not to rush blindly the room was a maze of impossible corridors it didnt matter just another trick one meant to confuse and frighten her somewhere in this house was the key and her friends she would find them panic tickled her throat as she walked the air was silent now even her lonely footsteps were smothered by the blue mist what was more frightening to the human heart than being cold and lost and alone he was using that against her playing her with her own instinct because he couldnt touch her unless she allowed it youre not going to make me run she shouted i know who i am and where i am and youre not going to make me run she heard someone call her name just the faintest ripple through the thick air using it as a guide she turned again the cold intensified and the mists swirled with wet her clothes were damp her skin chilled the call could have been another trick she thought she could hear nothing now but the blood beating inside her own head it hardly mattered which direction she chose she could walk endlessly in circles or stand perfectly still it wasnt a matter of finding her way or being misdirected now it was she realized nothing more than a battle of wills the key was here she meant to find it he meant to stop her it must be lowering to pit yourself against a mortal woman wasting all your power and skill on someone like me and still the best you can do is this irritating bluelight special an angry red glow edged the mist though malorys heart plunged she gritted her teeth and kept moving maybe it wasnt wise to challenge a sorcerer but aside from the risk she realized another side effect she could see another door now where the red and blue lights merged the attic she thought it had to be not illusionary corridors and turns but the true substance of the house she focused on it as she walked forward when the mists shifted thickened swirled she ignored them and kept the image of the door in her head at last her breath shallow she plunged a hand through the fog and clamped her fingers around the old glass knob warmth a welcome flood of it poured over her as she pulled the door open she started up into the dark with the blue mist creeping behind her outside flynn navigated through the meantempered storm edging forward in the drivers seat to peer through the curtain of rain that his wipers could barely displace in the backseat moe whimpered like a baby come on you coward its just a little rain lightning pitchforked through the black sky followed by a boom of thunder like a cannon blast and some lightning flynn cursed and muscled the wheel in position when the car bucked and shuddered and some wind he added with gusts approaching gale force it hadnt seemed like more than a quick thunderstorm when hed left the office but it worsened with every inch of road as moes whimpers turned to pitiful howls flynn began to worry that malory or dana or zoe maybe all three of them had gotten caught in the storm they should have been at the house by now he reminded himself but he would have sworn that the rage of the storm was worse considerably worse on this end of town fog had rolled down from the hills blanketed them in gray as thick and dense as wool his visibility decreased forcing him to slow down even at a crawl the car fishtailed madly on a turn well just pull over he said to moe pull over and wait it out anxiety skated up his spine but instead of easing when he nudged the car to the curb it clamped on to the back of his neck like claws the sound of the rain pounding like fists on the roof of the car seemed to hammer into his brain somethings wrong he pulled out into the street again his hands vising on the wheel as the wind buffeted the car sweat born of effort and worry snaked down his back for the next three blocks he felt like a man fighting a war there was a trickle of relief when he spotted the cars in the driveway they were okay he told himself they were inside no problem he was an idiot вђњtold you there was nothing to worry about he said to moe now youve got two choices you can pull yourself together and come inside with me or you can stay here quaking and quivering up to you pal relief drained away when he parked at the curb and looked at the house if the storm had a heart it was there black clouds boiled over the house pumped the full force of their fury even as he watched lightning lanced down speared like a fiery arrow into the front lawn the grass went black in a jagged patch malory he didnt know if he spoke it shouted it or his mind simply screamed it but he shoved open the car door and leaped into the surreal violence of the storm the wind slapped him back a backhanded blow so intense that he tasted blood in his mouth lightning blasted like a mortar directly in front of him and the air stank with burning blind from the driving rain he bent over and lurched toward the house he stumbled on the steps and was calling her name over and over like a chant when he saw the hard blue light leaking around the front door the knob burned with cold and refused to turn under his hand baring his teeth flynn reared back then rammed the door with his shoulder once twice and on the third assault he broke it in he leaped inside into that blue mist malory he shoved his dripping hair out of his face dana he whirled when something brushed his leg and lifted his fists only to lower them on an oath when it turned out to be wet dog goddamn it moe i dont have time toвђ he broke off when moe growled deep in his throat let out a vicious bark and charged up the stairs flynn sprinted after him and stepped into his office if im going to do a decent job covering the foliage festival then i need the front page of the weekender section and a sidebar on the related events rhoda folded her arms her posture combative tims interview with clown guy should go on page two there was a vague ringing in his ears and a cup of coffee in his hand flynn stared at rhodas irritated face he could smell the coffee and the white shoulders fragrance that rhoda habitually wore behind him his scanner squawked and moe snored like a steam engine this is bullshit youve got no business using that kind of language with me rhoda snapped no this is bullshit im not here neither are you its about time i got treated with a little respect around here youre only running this paper because your mother wanted to keep you from making a fool of yourself in new york bigcity reporter my butt youre a smalltime smalltown guy always have been always will be kiss my ass flynn invited and threw the coffee cup and all in her face she let out one short scream and he was back in the mist shaken he rounded once again toward the sound of moes barking through that rolling mist he saw dana on her knees with her arms flung around moes neck oh god thank god flynn she sprang up wrapped herself around him as she had the dog i cant find them i cant find them i was here then i wasnt now i am hysteria pitched and rocked in her voice we were together right over there then we werent stop stop he yanked her back shook her breathe sorry im sorry she shuddered then scrubbed her hands over her face i was at work but i wasnt i couldnt have been it was like being in a daze going through the motions and not being able to pinpoint what was wrong then i heard moe barking i heard him barking and i remembered we were here then i was back standing here in thisвђwhatever the hell this isвђand i couldnt find them she fought for calm the key malory said the keys here i think she must be right go get outside wait for me in the car she breathed deep shuddered again im freaked but im not leaving them here or you either jesus flynn your mouths bleeding he swiped the back of his hand over it its nothing okay we stick together he took her hand linked fingers they heard it at the same time the hammering of fists on wood with moe once again in the lead they rushed through the room zoe stood at the attic door beating on it over here she called out shes up there i know shes up there but i cant get through get back flynn ordered youre all right dana gripped her arm are you hurt no i was home dana puttering around the kitchen with the radio on wondering what to fix for dinner my god how long how long were we separated how long has she been up there alone chapter twenty she was afraid it helped to admit it accept it to know that she was more afraid than shed ever been in her life and to realize she was determined not to give in the warmth was already being eaten away as the light took on that harsh blue hue fingers of mist crawled along the exposed beams on the ceiling down the unfinished walls along the dusty floor through it she could see the pale white vapor of her own breath real she reminded herself that was real a sign of life proof of her own humanity the attic was a long wide room with two stingy windows at either end and the ceiling rising to a narrow pitch but she recognized it in her dream there had been skylights and generous windows her paintings had been stacked against walls done in soft cream the floor had been clean of dust and speckled with a cheerful rainbow of paint drops and splatters the air had carried a summer warmth and the scent of turpentine it was dank now and cold rather than canvases cardboard boxes were stacked against the walls old chairs and lamps and the debris of other lives were stored there but she could seeвђoh so clearly seeвђhow it could have been as she imagined it it began to form warm washed with light alive with color there on her worktable with her brushes and palette knives was the little white vase filled with the pink snapdragons shed picked from her own garden that morning she remembered going out after flynn had left for work remembered picking those sweet and tender flowers to keep her company while she worked worked in her studio she thought dreamily where the blank canvas waited and she knew oh yes she knew how to fill it she walked to the canvas waiting on an easel picked up her palette and began to mix her paints sun streamed through her windows several were open for the practical purpose of crossventilation and for the simple pleasure of feeling the breeze music pumped passionately out of the stereo what she intended to paint today required passion she could already see it in her mind feel the power of it gathering in her like a storm she raised her brush swirled it in color for the first stroke her heart lifted the magnitude of the joy was almost unbearable she might burst from it if she didnt transfer it onto canvas the image was burned in her mind like a scene etched on glass with stroke after stroke color blended on color she began to bring it to life you know this was always my deepest dream she spoke conversationally as she worked for as long as i can remember i wanted to paint to have the talent the vision the skill to be an important artist now you have it she switched brushes glancing at kane before she faced the canvas again yes i do you were wise making the right choice in the end a shopkeeper he laughed dismissed the idea with a wave of his hand where is the power in that where is the glory in selling what others have created when you can create yourself you can be and have whatever you choose here yes i understand youve shown me the way she slid him a coy look what else can i have you want the man kane shrugged elegantly hes bound to you here a slave to love and if id chosen otherwise men are capricious creatures how could you ever be sure of him now you paint your world as you do that canvas as you wish fame fortune his lip curled so it is with mortals always love they say is what matters more than even life but its wealth and its glory that they really crave take it all then and you what will you take i have already taken it she nodded switched brushes youll have to excuse me i need to concentrate she painted in the warm bath of sunlight while the music soared flynn hit the door with his shoulder then gripped the knob and prepared to ram it again the knob turned smoothly in his hand zoe gave him a jittery smile i mustve loosened it for you stay down here save your breath dana advised and pushed up behind him the light seemed to pulse now thicker and somehow animate moes growling became wet snarls flynn saw malory standing at the far end of the attic relief was like a hammer blow to his heart malory thank god he leaped forward and hit the solid wall of mist its some sort of barrier he spoke frantically now as he pushed and slammed against it shes trapped in there i think were trapped out here zoe pressed her hands against the mist she doesnt hear us we have to make her hear us dana looked around for something to batter against the wall she must be somewhere else in her head the way we were we have to make her hear us so shell snap out of it moe went wild leaping up to tear and bite at the wall of mist his barks echoed like gunshots and still malory stood like a statue her back to them there has to be another way zoe dropped to her knees pressed her fingers along the mist its freezing you can see her trembling from the cold we have to get her out malory helpless rage had flynn pummeling the wall until his hands bled im not going to let this happen you have to hear me i love you damn it malory i love you you listen to me wait dana gripped his shoulder she moved i saw her move keep talking to her flynn just keep talking to her struggling for calm he pressed his forehead to the wall i love you malory youve got to give us a chance to see where we can go with it i need you with me so either come out or let me in malory pursed her lips at the image taking shape on canvas did you hear something she asked absently theres nothing kane smiled at the three mortals on the other side of the mist nothing at all what are you painting there uhuhuh she wagged a playful finger at him im temperamental i dont like anyone looking at my work until its done my world she reminded him and daubed on color my rules he gave a single elegant shrug as you wish oh dont pout im nearly done she worked quickly now all but willing the image from her mind onto the canvas it was she thought her masterpiece nothing shed ever done would be so important art isnt just in the eye of the beholder she said but in that in the artist in the subject in the purpose and in those who see her pulse skipped and stumbled but her hand remained steady and sure for a timeless moment she shut everything out of her mind but the colors the textures the shapes and when she stepped back her eyes glittered with triumph its the finest thing ive ever done she declared perhaps the finest thing i will ever do i wonder what youll think of it she gestured in invitation light and shadow she said as he stepped toward the easel in looking within and without from within me to without and onto the canvas what my heart speaks i call it the singing goddess it was her face shed painted her face and the first daughter of glass she stood in a forest full of sparkling gold light softened with green shadows with the river sliding over rock like tears her sisters sat on the ground behind her their hands clasped venora for she knew it was venora carried her harp and with her face lifted toward the sky you could almost hear the song she sang did you think i would settle for cold illusion when i have a chance for the real thing did you think id trade my life and her soul for a dream you underestimate mortals kane as he spun toward her fury leaping off him like flames she prayed she hadnt overestimated herself or rowena the first key is mine as she spoke she reached toward the painting reached into it a stunning blast of heat shot up her arm as she closed her fingers around the key shed painted at the feet of the goddess the key that gleamed in a beam of light that cut the shadows like a gilded sword she felt its shape its substance then with a cry of victory she drew it free вђњthis is my choice and you can go to hell the mists roiled as he cursed her as he lifted his hand to strike both flynn and moe burst through the wall with a barrage of sharp staccato barks moe leaped kane faded like a shadow in the dark and was gone as flynn plucked malory off her feet sunlight shimmered in the tiny windows and rain dripped musically from the eaves outside the room was only an attic filled with dust and clutter the painting shed created out of love knowledge and courage was gone ive got you flynn buried his face in her hair as moe leaped on them youre all right ive got you i know i know she began to weep quietly as she looked down at the key still clutched in her fingers i painted it she held it out to dana and zoe i have the key because she insisted flynn drove her directly to warriors peak with dana and zoe following he kept the heater on high and had wrapped her in a blanket from his trunk that unfortunately smelted of moe and still she shivered you need a hot bath or something tea soup he dragged a hand that was still far from steady through his hair i dont know brandy ill take all of the above she promised as soon as we get the key where it belongs i wont be able to relax until its out of my hand she clutched it in a fist held tight to her breast i dont know how it can be in my hand neither do i maybe if you explain it to me well both get it he tried to confuse me the way he separated us to make me feel lost and alone and afraid but he must have some limits he couldnt keep all three of us and you in those illusions not all at once were connected and were stronger than he realized at least thats what i think i can go with that to give him credit he had rhoda pretty much down pat i made him mad just mad enough i guess i knew the key was in the house she pulled the blanket a little tighter but couldnt find warmth im not telling this in good journalistic style dont worry about that ill edit it later how did you know the attics where i made the choice when he showed me all the things i wanted so much i realized that was the dream place once i went upstairs with zoe and dana and the studio the artists studio had been on the top floor the attic it had to be where i had that moment of decisionвђlike in the paintings at first i thought we would have to hunt through whatever was up there and wed find something that jibed with the clue but it was more than that and less she closed her eyes and sighed youre tired just rest until we get there we can talk later no im okay it was so strange flynn when i got up there and i realized it all my placeвђin reality and in my dream and how he brought the dream back tried to slide me into it i let him think he had i thought about the clue and saw the painting in my head i knew how to paint it every stroke the third painting of the set the key wasnt in the world he created for me she said as she turned to him but it was in what i created if i had the courage to do it if i could see the beauty of it and make it real he gave me the power to bring the key into the illusion to forge it she thought with love i bet that burns his ass she laughed yeah thats a nice side benefit i heard you what i heard you calling to me all of you but especially you i couldnt answer you im sorry because i know you were afraid for me but i couldnt let him know i heard he reached over to cover her hand with his i couldnt get to you i didnt know what fear was until then when i couldnt get to you i was afraid at first that it was just another of his tricks i was afraid that if i turned around and saw you id break your poor hands she lifted his hand pressed her lips gently to the torn knuckles my hero heroes she corrected looking back at moe she kept her hand in his as they drove through the gates at warriors peak rowena stepped out her hands folded at the waist of a flamered sweater malory could see the gleam of tears in her eyes as she walked across the portico to meet them youre safe and well she touched malorys cheek and the chill malory had been unable to shake slid into blessed warmth yes im fine i haveвђ not yet your hands she laid her palms under flynns lifted them this will scar she said there beneath the third knuckle of your left hand a symbol flynn herald and warrior she opened the back door of the car herself so moe could leap out and greet her with wags and licks ah there the fierce and brave one she hugged him then leaned back on her heels listening attentively as he barked and grumbled yes you had quite the adventure she rose resting a hand on moes head as she smiled at dana and zoe all of you did please come in moe didnt need to be asked twice he bounded across the stones and straight through the doorway where pitte stood pitte raised an elegant eyebrow as the dog skidded over the foyer floor then turned the look onto rowena she only laughed and hooked an arm through flynns i have a gift for the loyal and courageous moe if youll allow it sure look we appreciate the hospitality but malorys pretty worn out soвђ im fine really we wont keep you long pitte gestured them into what malory thought of as the portrait room were in your debt more than can be paid what youve done whatever tomorrow brings will never be forgotten he tipped malorys face up with one long finger and laid his lips on hers zoe nudged dana i think were getting gypped in this oneforall deal pitte glanced over and his sudden grin was alive with charm my woman is a jealous creature no such thing rowena objected then lifted a brightly woven collar from a table these symbols speak of valor and a true heart the colors are also symbolic red for courage blue for friendship black for protection she crouched to remove moes frayed and faded collar and replace it he sat through the business of it flynn thought with the stalwart dignity of a soldier being awarded a medal there how handsome you are rowena kissed moes nose then got to her feet will you still bring him to see me now and then she asked flynn sure kane underestimated you all of youвђheart and spirit and spine hes unlikely to do so again pitte pointed out but rowena shook her head this is a time for joy you are the first she told malory i know i wanted to get this to you right away she started to hold out the key then stopped wait do you mean im the first the first to ever find a key saying nothing rowena turned to pitte he walked to a carved chest beneath the window lifted the lid the blue light that spilled out made malorys stomach clutch but this was different from the mist she realized this was deeper brighter then he lifted from the chest a glass box alive with that light and her throat filled with tears the box of souls you are the first pitte repeated as he set the box on a marble pedestal the first mortal to turn the first key he turned stood beside the box he was the soldier now malory thought the warrior at guard rowena stepped to the other side so they flanked the glass and the swirling blue lights inside it its for you to do rowena said quietly it was always for you to do malory clutched the key tighter in her fist her chest was so full it hurt and still seemed incapable of containing the galloping racing of her heart she tried to draw a calming breath but it came out short and sharp as she stepped closer those lights seemed to fill her vision then the room then the world her fingers wanted to tremble but she bore down she would not do this thing with a shaking hand she slid the key into the first of the three locks worked into the glass she saw the light spread up the metal and onto her fingers bright as hope and she turned the key in the lock there was a soundвђshe thought there was a sound but it was no more than a quiet sigh even as it faded the key dissolved in her fingers the first lock vanished and there were two its gone just gone a symbol again for us rowena said and laid a hand gently on the box for them two are left do weвђ they were weeping inside that glass dana thought she could almost hear them and it ripped at her heart do we pick now which one of us goes next not today you should rest your minds and hearts rowena turned to pitte there should be champagne in the parlor would you see to our guests id like a private word with malory before we join you she lifted the glass box herself carefully placed it back in the chest when she was alone with malory she turned pitte said we owe you a debt we can never pay thats true i agreed to look for the key and i was paid malory corrected she looked at the chest imagined the box within it seems wrong now to have taken the money the money is nothing to us i promise you others have taken it and done nothing others have tried and failed and youve done something brave and interesting with the money she crossed over took malorys hands in hers that pleases me but it isnt dollars and cents i speak of when i speak of debt if not for me there would be no box of souls no keys no locks you wouldnt have had to face what you faced today you love them malory gestured toward the chest as sisters young sweet sisters wellвђ she walked over to look at the portrait i have hope to see them like this again i can give you a gift malory its my right to do so you refused what kane offered you it wasnt real it can be she turned back i can make it real what you felt what you knew what you had inside you i can give you the power you had in his illusion dizzy malory groped for the arm of a chair then slowly lowered herself into it you can give me painting i understand the needвђand the joys and pain of having that beauty inside you feeling it leap out she laughed or fighting to get it out which is every bit as brilliant you can have it my gift to you for a moment the idea of it swarmed through malory intoxicating as wine seductive as love and she saw rowena watching her so calm so steady with a soft smile on her lips youd give me yours malory realized thats what you mean you would give me your talent your skill your vision it would be yours no it would never be mine and i would always know it iвђ painted them because i could see them just as i could see them in that first dream as if i were there in the painting and i painted the key i forged the key was able to because i loved enough to give it up i chose the light instead of the shadow isnt that right yes having made that choice knowing it was the right one i cant take whats yours but thank you she said as she rose its nice to know i can be happy doing what i do im going to make a beautiful shop and a successful business and a damn good life she added i have no doubt will you take this then rowena gestured smiling when malory let out a shocked gasp the singing goddess she rushed to the framed canvas that rested on a table the painting i did when kaneвђ you painted it rowena joined her laid a hand on her shoulder whatever his trick this was your vision and your heart that found the answer but if having this if seeing it is painful i can put it away no its not painful its a wonderful gift rowena this was an illusion you brought it into my reality its solid it exists bracing herself she stepped back kept her eyes level with rowenas can youвђhave you done the same with emotions you question if your feelings for flynn are real no i know they are she pressed a hand to her heart this is no illusion but his for meвђif thats some kind of rewardвђ its not fair to him and i cant accept it you would give him up no her expression went combative hell no id just deal with it and him until he fell in love with me if i can find some mystical key i can sure as hell make michael flynn hennessy realize im the best thing thats ever happened to him which i am she added which i absolutely am i like you very much rowena said with a grin and ill promise you this when flynn walks into this room again whatever he feels or doesnt feel will be a true reflection of his heart the rest is up to you wait here ill send him in rowena when will we begin the second round soon rowena called out as she left the room very soon which one of them would be next malory wondered as she studied the portrait and what would the second one risk what would she win or lose in the search shed lost one love she thought lifting her painting one love so briefly tasted and now with flynn she had to risk another the most vital love of her life i brought you some of this very jazzy champagne flynn said walking in with two brimming flutes youre missing the party pitte actually laughed it was a moment i just needed a couple of minutes first she set the painting down and reached for a glass whats this one of rowenas he hooked an arm companionably around malorys shoulder and she felt his body stiffen when he understood its yours this is what you did the painting you did in the attic with the key its here he brushed his fingers over the gold key only painted now at the feet of the goddess its amazing even more when youre the one who reached into a painting and pulled out a magic key no i mean yeah thats out there but i meant the whole thing its beautiful malory hell its stupendous you gave this up he spoke softly then looked over at her youre the one whos amazing ill have this rowena clicked her heels together twitched her nose whatever she does and brought it here for me it means a lot to have it flynnвђ she had to take a drink had to put some distance between them whatever shed said to rowena she understood now that she was a about to do something much more wrenching than giving up a talent with paint and brush this has been a strange month for all of us and then some he agreed most of whats happened its beyond the scope of anything we could have imagined anything we might have believed a few weeks ago and whats happened its changed me in a good way she added turning toward him i like to think its a good way if youre going to tell me you turned the key in that lock and now you dont love me anymore thats too damn bad for you because youre stuck no imвђ stuck she repeated what do you mean stuck with me my ugly couch and my sloppy dog youre not wiggling your way out of it malory dont take that tone with me she set the flute down and dont think for one minute you can stand there and tell me im stuck with you because youre stuck with me he set his flute beside hers is that right thats exactly right ive just outwitted an evil celtic god youre childs play for me you want to fight maybe they both grabbed for each other with his mouth on hers she let out a strangled sigh and held on for her life she drew back but kept her arms linked around his neck im exactly right for you flynn then its really handy that im in love with you youre my key mal the one key to all the locks you know what i want right now i want a hot bath some soup and a nap on an ugly couch вђњtodays your lucky day i can arrange that for you taking her hand he led her from the room later rowena leaned her head against pittes shoulder as they watched the cars drive away its a good day she told him i know its not over but today is a good day we have a little time before we begin the next a few days then the four weeks kane will watch them more carefully now so will we beauty prevailed now knowledge and courage will be tested theres so little really that we can do to help but these mortals are strong and clever odd creatures pitte commented yes she smiled up at him odd and endlessly fascinating they stepped back into the house closed the door at the end of the drive the iron gates quietly swung shut the warriors that flanked them would stand vigil through the next phase of the moon
