in the valley of the shadow the rubbertyred wheels jolt unevenly over the granite setts dimly i recognise the familiar grey streets and gardencentred squares we stop and through the little crowd on the pavement i am carried indoors and up to the highceiling ward gently they lift me off the stretcher and put me in bed and i say what queer curtains you have they have faces worked on the border are they those of your friends the matron smiles and i think what a quaint idea it is then suddenly it strikes me that i have said something foolish but still the faces are there right enough even when i got well i could sometimes see them in certain lights one of the faces is familiar and i am just going to ask how they know soandso when i am left alone for hours and hours it seems no one comes near me at first i am patient but gradually a fierce anger seizes me did i submit to be brought here merely to die in solitude and in suffocating darkness i will not stay in this place far better to go back and die at home suddenly i am borne in a winged machine up up into the cool air far below and infinitesimally small lies the new town halfhid beneath the fluffy smoke yonder clear and blue and glittering is the firth of forth and beyond the sunlit hills of fife are the advanceguards of the grampians a moment only of sheer palpitating ecstasy then a soulshattering fall into the black abyss of oblivion i hold mr h g wells partially responsible for this little excursion it is light again but what is that which prevents my seeing the window a screen what does that betoken a blackness of despair grips me it is all over then no more mountaineering no more pleasant holidays this is the end of all my little ambitions this is in truth the bitterness of death presently a nurse comes with a cooling drink and making a tremendous effort to look unconcerned i ask for the screen to be removed she laughs and folds it up when i see another screen opposite partially concealing a bed so i have company this was a comparatively lucid interval what a queer place to have texts right round the cornice of the room and they are constantly changing too the lord is my shepherd i will arise really this is most irritating i cannot finish any of them if the letters would only stay still for a single moment but what is that below it is a wide sandy beach with the blue sea beyond on the top of a pole in the foreground is awhat is ityes a mans head of course it was really a hanging electric light which by some curious means i must have seen in an inverted position sister i am sure that could be worked up into a splendid story please give me some paper and my fountain pen if i dont write it down now i shall forget it just as has happened before when i have thought of things during the night as a matter of fact when i was convalescent i did want to write not only this particular tale but a complete account of my visions of course i was not permitted and now alas it has gone to join that great company of magnificentseeming but elusive ideas one has in dreams honestly sister i must go out for a few moments the man is in great danger and i alone can save him there is a desperate plot against his life he lives quite close by in one of the two houses on each side of this sister promises to see about this and i lie back only halfsatisfied presently my bed begins noiselessly to move it goes through the wall into the next house room after room is visited but my doomed friend is not there the other houses are then inspected in turn with no result i have a feeling that he is being spirited away just in front of me so as to be always in the next house sister is at the bottom of this trick i am sure here began that absurd hatred and suspicion of her which only left me with the delirium oh doctor i am glad to see you really in a free country it is intolerable that a simple request like this cannot be granted me and to save a mans life too you can see for yourself that i am quite sensible and very much in earnest try me the doctor asks what day of the week it is i answer scots fashion oh thats easy if i am the man who came here on monday then it is wednesday but if i came on thursday then its saturday if you will tell me which man i am i will tell you what day it is overcome by this logic the doctor gives in but suggests a compromise to which i agree it is that the four neighbouring houses be brought in and placed before my bed so that i can make sure of seeing and warning my friend in distress no i will not drink whisky surely you know perfectly well that i am a mussulman and forbidden to drink spirits you cannot wish me to violate the principles of my religion sister assures me that the draught is not whisky and puts the glass to my lips in horror i dash it to the floor devil in human form you tempt me to my destruction begone and let me die in the true faith of course it was not whisky but something of quite an opposite nature weeks later on recounting this incident i was reminded of having one day casually read a page or two of a novel in which a mohammedan is tempted to drink wine it made no impression whatever at the time but it must have been stored up somewhere presently sister returns with three other nurses and a fresh supply of the accursed stuff all means are tried from argument in which they are signally worsted to persuasion and gentle force suddenly i resolve on flight and actually reach the door of the room before being overpowered and brought back to bed then i am asked to put my finger in the dose and prove to myself that it is not whisky in this suggestion i see sisters malicious cunning so i smell the wet finger and triumphantly assert that it is whisky when they say it is twelve oclock and that i am keeping them all out of bed i answer that they need not stay for me and anyway what is that to the loss of my soul at length i am forced down and the glass put to my clenched teeth i pray inwardly for help in this dire extremity lo a brilliant idea i will pretend to be dead i stiffen myself and hold my breath i can remember no further effort but i was told afterwards the imitation was wonderful even the nurses grew alarmed and the doctor was sent for i have a dim recollection of his coming and before i knew where i was he had injected something which i thought was the whisky into my arm i sit up in bed and glare at them all with concentrated hatred then i fall back heartbroken at my forced abjuration sobbing sobbing i am suffering for my sin sister is stabbing me in the shoulderblade with a redhot dagger it was a flyblister and my skin is very sensitive i am aching all over suddenly i am alone on a flat desert plain i am sitting with my back against one of the stone pillars of a huge closed gateway reaching to the sky in front of me is proceeding a cinematographic entertainment on a stupendous scale i cannot now remember much about it but the series was long and of an appalling character below each picture was a placard stating the subject of the next one i had the feeling that they were not pictures at all but real events in the process of happening further that by answering a question put to me by a mysterious voice i could bring the series to an end but though i knew the answer it was quite beyond my power to give it immediately following my failure to reply from somewhere behind me a full organ pealed forth and a choir of voices broke into a mocking ditty which embodied the proper answer and also words of scorn directed against myself till recently this ditty haunted me occasionally but i have now i am glad to say forgotten both air and words all i know is that it was like a quick chant and quite unfamiliar to me when the horrid song was over i fell into a state of selfcondemnation mixed with helpless expectancy which was so poignant as to move me still when i think of it this picture is one of wars and earthquakes and burning mountains underneath it are the words end of the world i have a vision of the countless myriads of mankind kneeling in agony on the other side of the gate a multitudinous murmur swells into an awful shriek for pity who am i o god that this burden is laid on me am i the keeper of that countless host i cannot answer even as i speak a shudder cleaves the air a cataclysmal mirage comes into view the organ booms and the impish choir begins its torturing refrain underneath this picture there is no placard the dreadful music ceases and the horrid scene before me works on in silence it passes and then there is neither light nor darkness the desert disappears the gateway is no more the infinite host has gone like the dew of the morning and i am left in presence of nothing the realisation is frightful my brain is whirling relief must come human nature cannot bear it ah thank god i am going madwhen from somewhere but whence i know not comes a light scornful laugh a satanic voice says sold again the organ swells the invisible choir sings anew and the whole series of pictures begins again from the beginning for a moment the tension is relaxed gods in his heaven after all when like the clang of steel the voice utters the unanswerable question oh god i musti shall speak the answer the answer is what time is it russell russell was the male nightnurse the necessity for whose presence the reader will by this time fully understand halfpast four sir well i must get up to catch the first train to glasgow it is a matter of life and death please give me my clothes russell endeavours to soothe me with promises of going tomorrow and so forth all of which i see through with merciless clearness in the end as i threaten to alarm the whole household i am wrapped up in blankets carried to an easychair before the fire and a screen put behind me you cant get a train sir before halfpast six excuse me there is a train at and i am going to get it by the way are you sure sister is not about i thought i saw her round the corner of the screen no then give me some soda and milk and have you a cigarette anywhere russell naturally denied having cigarettes whereupon as he afterwards told me i proceeded to curse him his family antecedents and descendants together with such copiousness and minuteness of diction that i spoke without stopping for an hour and a half i fancy mr kipling is responsible for at least the indian meticulosity of my comminations anyhow the effort having exhausted me on russell saying that i had now missed the train and had better go back to bed to wait for the next i sensibly agreed that was the climax and on awaking some hours later from a peaceful sleep i found that the crisis was past and that i was as sane again as usual the first book i asked for was the pilgrims progress and as soon as i was permitted to read i turned to the account of christians passage through the valley of the shadow i had felt before that bunyans demons were stage demons his quagmires and pits merely simulacra the accessories generally such as drury lane would laugh to scorn now i am sure of it the real difficulty of course is to do it better
