indian summer of a forsyte contents indian summer of a forsyte in chancery to andre chevrillon indian summer of a forsyte and summers lease hath all too short a date shakespeare i in the last day of may in the early nineties about six oclock of the evening old jolyon forsyte sat under the oak tree below the terrace of his house at robin hill he was waiting for the midges to bite him before abandoning the glory of the afternoon his thin brown hand where blue veins stood out held the end of a cigar in its tapering longnailed fingers a pointed polished nail had survived with him from those earlier victorian days when to touch nothing even with the tips of the fingers had been so distinguished his domed forehead great white moustache lean cheeks and long lean jaw were covered from the westering sunshine by an old brown panama hat his legs were crossed in all his attitude was serenity and a kind of elegance as of an old man who every morning put eau de cologne upon his silk handkerchief at his feet lay a woolly brownandwhite dog trying to be a pomeranian the dog balthasar between whom and old jolyon primal aversion had changed into attachment with the years close to his chair was a swing and on the swing was seated one of hollys dolls called duffer alice with her body fallen over her legs and her doleful nose buried in a black petticoat she was never out of disgrace so it did not matter to her how she sat below the oak tree the lawn dipped down a bank stretched to the fernery and beyond that refinement became fields dropping to the pond the coppice and the prospect fine remarkable at which swithin forsyte from under this very tree had stared five years ago when he drove down with irene to look at the house old jolyon had heard of his brothers exploit that drive which had become quite celebrated on forsyte change swithin and the fellow had gone and died last november at the age of only seventynine renewing the doubt whether forsytes could live for ever which had first arisen when aunt ann passed away died and left only jolyon and james roger and nicholas and timothy julia hester susan and old jolyon thought eightyfive i dont feel it except when i get that pain his memory went searching he had not felt his age since he had bought his nephew soames illstarred house and settled into it here at robin hill over three years ago it was as if he had been getting younger every spring living in the country with his son and his grandchildren june and the little ones of the second marriage jolly and holly living down here out of the racket of london and the cackle of forsyte change free of his boards in a delicious atmosphere of no work and all play with plenty of occupation in the perfecting and mellowing of the house and its twenty acres and in ministering to the whims of holly and jolly all the knots and crankiness which had gathered in his heart during that long and tragic business of june soames irene his wife and poor young bosinney had been smoothed out even june had thrown off her melancholy at last witness this travel in spain she was taking now with her father and her stepmother curiously perfect peace was left by their departure blissful yet blank because his son was not there jo was never anything but a comfort and a pleasure to him nowadays an amiable chap but women somehow even the best got a little on ones nerves unless of course one admired them faroff a cuckoo called a woodpigeon was cooing from the first elmtree in the field and how the daisies and buttercups had sprung up after the last mowing the wind had got into the sou west too a delicious air sappy he pushed his hat back and let the sun fall on his chin and cheek somehow today he wanted company wanted a pretty face to look at people treated the old as if they wanted nothing and with the unforsytean philosophy which ever intruded on his soul he thought ones never had enough with a foot in the grave onell want something i shouldnt be surprised down here away from the exigencies of affairs his grandchildren and the flowers trees birds of his little domain to say nothing of sun and moon and stars above them said open sesame to him day and night and sesame had opened how much perhaps he did not know he had always been responsive to what they had begun to call nature genuinely almost religiously responsive though he had never lost his habit of calling a sunset a sunset and a view a view however deeply they might move him but nowadays nature actually made him ache he appreciated it so every one of these calm bright lengthening days with hollys hand in his and the dog balthasar in front looking studiously for what he never found he would stroll watching the roses open fruit budding on the walls sunlight brightening the oak leaves and saplings in the coppice watching the waterlily leaves unfold and glisten and the silvery young corn of the one wheat field listening to the starlings and skylarks and the alderney cows chewing the cud flicking slow their tufted tails and every one of these fine days he ached a little from sheer love of it all feeling perhaps deep down that he had not very much longer to enjoy it the thought that some day perhaps not ten years hence perhaps not five all this world would be taken away from him before he had exhausted his powers of loving it seemed to him in the nature of an injustice brooding over his horizon if anything came after this life it wouldnt be what he wanted not robin hill and flowers and birds and pretty faces too few even now of those about him with the years his dislike of humbug had increased the orthodoxy he had worn in the sixties as he had worn sidewhiskers out of sheer exuberance had long dropped off leaving him reverent before three things alone beauty upright conduct and the sense of property and the greatest of these now was beauty he had always had wide interests and indeed could still read the times but he was liable at any moment to put it down if he heard a blackbird sing upright conduct property somehow they were tiring the blackbirds and the sunsets never tired him only gave him an uneasy feeling that he could not get enough of them staring into the stilly radiance of the early evening and at the little gold and white flowers on the lawn a thought came to him this weather was like the music of orfeo which he had recently heard at covent garden a beautiful opera not like meyerbeer nor even quite mozart but in its way perhaps even more lovely something classical and of the golden age about it chaste and mellow and the ravogli almost worthy of the old days highest praise he could bestow the yearning of orpheus for the beauty he was losing for his love going down to hades as in life love and beauty did go the yearning which sang and throbbed through the golden music stirred also in the lingering beauty of the world that evening and with the tip of his corksoled elasticsided boot he involuntarily stirred the ribs of the dog balthasar causing the animal to wake and attack his fleas for though he was supposed to have none nothing could persuade him of the fact when he had finished he rubbed the place he had been scratching against his masters calf and settled down again with his chin over the instep of the disturbing boot and into old jolyons mind came a sudden recollection a face he had seen at that opera three weeks ago irene the wife of his precious nephew soames that man of property though he had not met her since the day of the at home in his old house at stanhope gate which celebrated his granddaughter junes illstarred engagement to young bosinney he had remembered her at once for he had always admired her a very pretty creature after the death of young bosinney whose mistress she had so reprehensibly become he had heard that she had left soames at once goodness only knew what she had been doing since that sight of her face a side view in the row in front had been literally the only reminder these three years that she was still alive no one ever spoke of her and yet jo had told him something once something which had upset him completely the boy had got it from george forsyte he believed who had seen bosinney in the fog the day he was run over something which explained the young fellows distress an act of soames towards his wife a shocking act jo had seen her too that afternoon after the news was out seen her for a moment and his description had always lingered in old jolyons mind wild and lost he had called her and next day june had gone there bottled up her feelings and gone there and the maid had cried and told her how her mistress had slipped out in the night and vanished a tragic business altogether one thing was certain soames had never been able to lay hands on her again and he was living at brighton and journeying up and down a fitting fate the man of property for when he once took a dislike to anyone as he had to his nephew old jolyon never got over it he remembered still the sense of relief with which he had heard the news of irenes disappearance it had been shocking to think of her a prisoner in that house to which she must have wandered back when jo saw her wandered back for a moment like a wounded animal to its hole after seeing that news tragic death of an architect in the street her face had struck him very much the other night more beautiful than he had remembered but like a mask with something going on beneath it a young woman still twentyeight perhaps ah well very likely she had another lover by now but at this subversive thought for married women should never love once even had been too much his instep rose and with it the dog balthasars head the sagacious animal stood up and looked into old jolyons face walk he seemed to say and old jolyon answered come on old chap slowly as was their wont they crossed among the constellations of buttercups and daisies and entered the fernery this feature where very little grew as yet had been judiciously dropped below the level of the lawn so that it might come up again on the level of the other lawn and give the impression of irregularity so important in horticulture its rocks and earth were beloved of the dog balthasar who sometimes found a mole there old jolyon made a point of passing through it because though it was not beautiful he intended that it should be some day and he would think i must get varr to come down and look at it hes better than beech for plants like houses and human complaints required the best expert consideration it was inhabited by snails and if accompanied by his grandchildren he would point to one and tell them the story of the little boy who said have plummers got leggers mother no sonny then darned if i havent been and swallowed a snileybob and when they skipped and clutched his hand thinking of the snileybob going down the little boys red lane his eyes would twinkle emerging from the fernery he opened the wicket gate which just there led into the first field a large and parklike area out of which within brick walls the vegetable garden had been carved old jolyon avoided this which did not suit his mood and made down the hill towards the pond balthasar who knew a waterrat or two gambolled in front at the gait which marks an oldish dog who takes the same walk every day arrived at the edge old jolyon stood noting another waterlily opened since yesterday he would show it to holly tomorrow when his little sweet had got over the upset which had followed on her eating a tomato at lunch her little arrangements were very delicate now that jolly had gone to school his first term holly was with him nearly all day long and he missed her badly he felt that pain too which often bothered him now a little dragging at his left side he looked back up the hill really poor young bosinney had made an uncommonly good job of the house he would have done very well for himself if he had lived and where was he now perhaps still haunting this the site of his last work of his tragic love affair or was philip bosinneys spirit diffused in the general who could say that dog was getting his legs muddy and he moved towards the coppice there had been the most delightful lot of bluebells and he knew where some still lingered like little patches of sky fallen in between the trees away out of the sun he passed the cowhouses and the henhouses there installed and pursued a path into the thick of the saplings making for one of the bluebell plots balthasar preceding him once more uttered a low growl old jolyon stirred him with his foot but the dog remained motionless just where there was no room to pass and the hair rose slowly along the centre of his woolly back whether from the growl and the look of the dogs stivered hair or from the sensation which a man feels in a wood old jolyon also felt something move along his spine and then the path turned and there was an old mossy log and on it a woman sitting her face was turned away and he had just time to think shes trespassing i must have a board put up before she turned powers above the face he had seen at the opera the very woman he had just been thinking of in that confused moment he saw things blurred as if a spirit queer effect the slant of sunlight perhaps on her violetgrey frock and then she rose and stood smiling her head a little to one side old jolyon thought how pretty she is she did not speak neither did he and he realized why with a certain admiration she was here no doubt because of some memory and did not mean to try and get out of it by vulgar explanation dont let that dog touch your frock he said hes got wet feet come here you but the dog balthasar went on towards the visitor who put her hand down and stroked his head old jolyon said quickly i saw you at the opera the other night you didnt notice me oh yes i did he felt a subtle flattery in that as though she had added do you think one could miss seeing you theyre all in spain he remarked abruptly im alone i drove up for the opera the ravoglis good have you seen the cow houses in a situation so charged with mystery and something very like emotion he moved instinctively towards that bit of property and she moved beside him her figure swayed faintly like the best kind of french figures her dress too was a sort of french grey he noticed two or three silver threads in her ambercoloured hair strange hair with those dark eyes of hers and that creamypale face a sudden sidelong look from the velvety brown eyes disturbed him it seemed to come from deep and far from another world almost or at all events from some one not living very much in this and he said mechanically where are you living now i have a little flat in chelsea he did not want to hear what she was doing did not want to hear anything but the perverse word came out alone she nodded it was a relief to know that and it came into his mind that but for a twist of fate she would have been mistress of this coppice showing these cowhouses to him a visitor all alderneys he muttered they give the best milk this ones a pretty creature woa myrtle the fawncoloured cow with eyes as soft and brown as irenes own was standing absolutely still not having long been milked she looked round at them out of the corner of those lustrous mild cynical eyes and from her grey lips a little dribble of saliva threaded its way towards the straw the scent of hay and vanilla and ammonia rose in the dim light of the cool cowhouse and old jolyon said you must come up and have some dinner with me ill send you home in the carriage he perceived a struggle going on within her natural no doubt with her memories but he wanted her company a pretty face a charming figure beauty he had been alone all the afternoon perhaps his eyes were wistful for she answered thank you uncle jolyon i should like to he rubbed his hands and said capital lets go up then and preceded by the dog balthasar they ascended through the field the sun was almost level in their faces now and he could see not only those silver threads but little lines just deep enough to stamp her beauty with a coinlike fineness the special look of life unshared with others ill take her in by the terrace he thought i wont make a common visitor of her what do you do all day he said teach music i have another interest too work said old jolyon picking up the doll from off the swing and smoothing its black petticoat nothing like it is there i dont do any now im getting on what interest is that trying to help women whove come to grief old jolyon did not quite understand to grief he repeated then realised with a shock that she meant exactly what he would have meant himself if he had used that expression assisting the magdalenes of london what a weird and terrifying interest and curiosity overcoming his natural shrinking he asked why what do you do for them not much ive no money to spare i can only give sympathy and food sometimes involuntarily old jolyons hand sought his purse he said hastily how dyou get hold of them i go to a hospital a hospital phew what hurts me most is that once they nearly all had some sort of beauty old jolyon straightened the doll beauty he ejaculated ha yes a sad business and he moved towards the house through a french window under sunblinds not yet drawn up he preceded her into the room where he was wont to study the times and the sheets of an agricultural magazine with huge illustrations of mangold wurzels and the like which provided holly with material for her paint brush dinners in half an hour youd like to wash your hands ill take you to junes room he saw her looking round eagerly what changes since she had last visited this house with her husband or her lover or both perhaps he did not know could not say all that was dark and he wished to leave it so but what changes and in the hall he said my boy jos a painter you know hes got a lot of taste it isnt mine of course but ive let him have his way she was standing very still her eyes roaming through the hall and music room as it now was all thrown into one under the great skylight old jolyon had an odd impression of her was she trying to conjure somebody from the shades of that space where the colouring was all pearlgrey and silver he would have had gold himself more lively and solid but jo had french tastes and it had come out shadowy like that with an effect as of the fume of cigarettes the chap was always smoking broken here and there by a little blaze of blue or crimson colour it was not his dream mentally he had hung this space with those goldframed masterpieces of still and stiller life which he had bought in days when quantity was precious and now where were they sold for a song that something which made him alone among forsytes move with the times had warned him against the struggle to retain them but in his study he still had dutch fishing boats at sunset he began to mount the stairs with her slowly for he felt his side these are the bathrooms he said and other arrangements ive had them tiled the nurseries are along there and this is jos and his wifes they all communicate but you remember i expect irene nodded they passed on up the gallery and entered a large room with a small bed and several windows this is mine he said the walls were covered with the photographs of children and watercolour sketches and he added doubtfully these are jos the views firstrate you can see the grand stand at epsom in clear weather the sun was down now behind the house and over the prospect a luminous haze had settled emanation of the long and prosperous day few houses showed but fields and trees faintly glistened away to a loom of downs the countrys changing he said abruptly but there itll be when were all gone look at those thrushes the birds are sweet here in the mornings im glad to have washed my hands of london her face was close to the window pane and he was struck by its mournful look wish i could make her look happy he thought a pretty face but sad and taking up his can of hot water he went out into the gallery this is junes room he said opening the next door and putting the can down i think youll find everything and closing the door behind her he went back to his own room brushing his hair with his great ebony brushes and dabbing his forehead with eau de cologne he mused she had come so strangely a sort of visit ation mysterious even romantic as if his desire for company for beauty had been fulfilled by whatever it was which fulfilled that sort of thing and before the mirror he straightened his still upright figure passed the brushes over his great white moustache touched up his eyebrows with eau de cologne and rang the bell i forgot to let them know that i have a lady to dinner with me let cook do something extra and tell beacon to have the landau and pair at halfpast ten to drive her back to town tonight is miss holly asleep the maid thought not and old jolyon passing down the gallery stole on tiptoe towards the nursery and opened the door whose hinges he kept specially oiled that he might slip in and out in the evenings without being heard but holly was asleep and lay like a miniature madonna of that type which the old painters could not tell from venus when they had completed her her long dark lashes clung to her cheeks on her face was perfect peace her little arrangements were evidently all right again and old jolyon in the twilight of the room stood adoring her it was so charming solemn and loving that little face he had more than his share of the blessed capacity of living again in the young they were to him his future life all of a future life that his fundamental pagan sanity perhaps admitted there she was with everything before her and his blood some of it in her tiny veins there she was his little companion to be made as happy as ever he could make her so that she knew nothing but love his heart swelled and he went out stilling the sound of his patentleather boots in the corridor an eccentric notion attacked him to think that children should come to that which irene had told him she was helping women who were all once little things like this one sleeping there i must give her a cheque he mused cant bear to think of them they had never borne reflecting on those poor outcasts wounding too deeply the core of true refinement hidden under layers of conformity to the sense of property wounding too grievously the deepest thing in him a love of beauty which could give him even now a flutter of the heart thinking of his evening in the society of a pretty woman and he went downstairs through the swinging doors to the back regions there in the winecellar was a hock worth at least two pounds a bottle a steinberg cabinet better than any johannisberg that ever went down throat a wine of perfect bouquet sweet as a nectarine nectar indeed he got a bottle out handling it like a baby and holding it level to the light to look enshrined in its coat of dust that mellow coloured slendernecked bottle gave him deep pleasure three years to settle down again since the move from town ought to be in prime condition thirtyfive years ago he had bought it thank god he had kept his palate and earned the right to drink it she would appreciate this not a spice of acidity in a dozen he wiped the bottle drew the cork with his own hands put his nose down inhaled its perfume and went back to the music room irene was standing by the piano she had taken off her hat and a lace scarf she had been wearing so that her goldcoloured hair was visible and the pallor of her neck in her grey frock she made a pretty picture for old jolyon against the rosewood of the piano he gave her his arm and solemnly they went the room which had been designed to enable twentyfour people to dine in comfort held now but a little round table in his present solitude the big diningtable oppressed old jolyon he had caused it to be removed till his son came back here in the company of two really good copies of raphael madonnas he was wont to dine alone it was the only disconsolate hour of his day this summer weather he had never been a large eater like that great chap swithin or sylvanus heythorp or anthony thornworthy those cronies of past times and to dine alone overlooked by the madonnas was to him but a sorrowful occupation which he got through quickly that he might come to the more spiritual enjoyment of his coffee and cigar but this evening was a different matter his eyes twinkled at her across the little table and he spoke of italy and switzerland telling her stories of his travels there and other experiences which he could no longer recount to his son and granddaughter because they knew them this fresh audience was precious to him he had never become one of those old men who ramble round and round the fields of reminiscence himself quickly fatigued by the insensitive he instinctively avoided fatiguing others and his natural flirtatiousness towards beauty guarded him specially in his relations with a woman he would have liked to draw her out but though she murmured and smiled and seemed to be enjoying what he told her he remained conscious of that mysterious remoteness which constituted half her fascination he could not bear women who threw their shoulders and eyes at you and chattered away or hard mouthed women who laid down the law and knew more than you did there was only one quality in a woman that appealed to him charm and the quieter it was the more he liked it and this one had charm shadowy as afternoon sunlight on those italian hills and valleys he had loved the feeling too that she was as it were apart cloistered made her seem nearer to himself a strangely desirable companion when a man is very old and quite out of the running he loves to feel secure from the rivalries of youth for he would still be first in the heart of beauty and he drank his hock and watched her lips and felt nearly young but the dog balthasar lay watching her lips too and despising in his heart the interruptions of their talk and the tilting of those greenish glasses full of a golden fluid which was distasteful to him the light was just failing when they went back into the musicroom and cigar in mouth old jolyon said play me some chopin by the cigars they smoke and the composers they love ye shall know the texture of mens souls old jolyon could not bear a strong cigar or wagners music he loved beethoven and mozart handel and gluck and schumann and for some occult reason the operas of meyerbeer but of late years he had been seduced by chopin just as in painting he had succumbed to botticelli in yielding to these tastes he had been conscious of divergence from the standard of the golden age their poetry was not that of milton and byron and tennyson of raphael and titian mozart and beethoven it was as it were behind a veil their poetry hit no one in the face but slipped its fingers under the ribs and turned and twisted and melted up the heart and never certain that this was healthy he did not care a rap so long as he could see the pictures of the one or hear the music of the other irene sat down at the piano under the electric lamp festooned with pearlgrey and old jolyon in an armchair whence he could see her crossed his legs and drew slowly at his cigar she sat a few moments with her hands on the keys evidently searching her mind for what to give him then she began and within old jolyon there arose a sorrowful pleasure not quite like anything else in the world he fell slowly into a trance interrupted only by the movements of taking the cigar out of his mouth at long intervals and replacing it she was there and the hock within him and the scent of tobacco but there too was a world of sunshine lingering into moonlight and pools with storks upon them and bluish trees above glowing with blurs of winered roses and fields of lavender where milkwhite cows were grazing and a woman all shadowy with dark eyes and a white neck smiled holding out her arms and through air which was like music a star dropped and was caught on a cows horn he opened his eyes beautiful piece she played well the touch of an angel and he closed them again he felt mirac ulously sad and happy as one does standing under a limetree in full honey flower not live ones own life again but just stand there and bask in the smile of a womans eyes and enjoy the bouquet and he jerked his hand the dog balthasar had reached up and licked it beautiful he said go on more chopin she began to play again this time the resemblance between her and chopin struck him the swaying he had noticed in her walk was in her playing too and the nocturne she had chosen and the soft darkness of her eyes the light on her hair as of moonlight from a golden moon seductive yes but nothing of delilah in her or in that music a long blue spiral from his cigar ascended and dispersed so we go out he thought no more beauty nothing again irene stopped would you like some gluck he used to write his music in a sunlit garden with a bottle of rhine wine beside him ah yes lets have orfeo round about him now were fields of gold and silver flowers white forms swaying in the sunlight bright birds flying to and fro all was summer lingering waves of sweetness and regret flooded his soul some cigar ash dropped and taking out a silk handkerchief to brush it off he inhaled a mingled scent as of snuff and eau de cologne ah he thought indian summer thats all and he said you havent played me che faro she did not answer did not move he was conscious of something some strange upset suddenly he saw her rise and turn away and a pang of remorse shot through him what a clumsy chap like orpheus she of course she too was looking for her lost one in the hall of memory and disturbed to the heart he got up from his chair she had gone to the great window at the far end gingerly he followed her hands were folded over her breast he could just see her cheek very white and quite emotionalized he said there there my love the words had escaped him mechanically for they were those he used to holly when she had a pain but their effect was instantaneously distressing she raised her arms covered her face with them and wept old jolyon stood gazing at her with eyes very deep from age the passionate shame she seemed feeling at her abandonment so unlike the control and quietude of her whole presence was as if she had never before broken down in the presence of another being there there there there he murmured and putting his hand out reverently touched her she turned and leaned the arms which covered her face against him old jolyon stood very still keeping one thin hand on her shoulder let her cry her heart out it would do her good and the dog balthasar puzzled sat down on his stern to examine them the window was still open the curtains had not been drawn the last of daylight from without mingled with faint intrusion from the lamp within there was a scent of newmown grass with the wisdom of a long life old jolyon did not speak even grief sobbed itself out in time only time was good for sorrow time who saw the passing of each mood each emotion in turn time the layertorest there came into his mind the words as panteth the hart after cooling streams but they were of no use to him then conscious of a scent of violets he knew she was drying her eyes he put his chin forward pressed his moustache against her forehead and felt her shake with a quivering of her whole body as of a tree which shakes itself free of raindrops she put his hand to her lips as if saying all over now forgive me the kiss filled him with a strange comfort he led her back to where she had been so upset and the dog balthasar following laid the bone of one of the cutlets they had eaten at their feet anxious to obliterate the memory of that emotion he could think of nothing better than china and moving with her slowly from cabinet to cabinet he kept taking up bits of dresden and lowestoft and chelsea turning them round and round with his thin veined hands whose skin faintly freckled had such an aged look i bought this at jobsons he would say cost me thirty pounds its very old that dog leaves his bones all over the place this old shipbowl i picked up at the sale when that precious rip the marquis came to grief but you dont remember heres a nice piece of chelsea now what would you say this was and he was comforted feeling that with her taste she was taking a real interest in these things for after all nothing better composes the nerves than a doubtful piece of china when the crunch of the carriage wheels was heard at last he said you must come again you must come to lunch then i can show you these by daylight and my little sweet shes a dear little thing this dog seems to have taken a fancy to you for balthasar feeling that she was about to leave was rubbing his side against her leg going out under the porch with her he said hell get you up in an hour and a quarter take this for your protegees and he slipped a cheque for fifty pounds into her hand he saw her brightened eyes and heard her murmur oh uncle jolyon and a real throb of pleasure went through him that meant one or two poor creatures helped a little and it meant that she would come again he put his hand in at the window and grasped hers once more the carriage rolled away he stood looking at the moon and the shadows of the trees and thought a sweet night she ii two days of rain and summer set in bland and sunny old jolyon walked and talked with holly at first he felt taller and full of a new vigour then he felt restless almost every afternoon they would enter the coppice and walk as far as the log well shes not there he would think of course not and he would feel a little shorter and drag his feet walking up the hill home with his hand clapped to his left side now and then the thought would move in him did she come or did i dream it and he would stare at space while the dog balthasar stared at him of course she would not come again he opened the letters from spain with less excitement they were not returning till july he felt oddly that he could bear it every day at dinner he screwed up his eyes and looked at where she had sat she was not there so he unscrewed his eyes again on the seventh afternoon he thought i must go up and get some boots he ordered beacon and set out passing from putney towards hyde park he reflected i might as well go to chelsea and see her and he called out just drive me to where you took that lady the other night the coachman turned his broad red face and his juicy lips answered the lady in grey sir yes the lady in grey what other ladies were there stodgy chap the carriage stopped before a small threestoried block of flats standing a little back from the river with a practised eye old jolyon saw that they were cheap i should think about sixty pound a year he mused and entering he looked at the nameboard the name forsyte was not on it but against first floor flat c were the words mrs irene heron ah she had taken her maiden name again and somehow this pleased him he went upstairs slowly feeling his side a little he stood a moment before ringing to lose the feeling of drag and fluttering there she would not be in and then boots the thought was black what did he want with boots at his age he could not wear out all those he had your mistress at home yes sir say mr jolyon forsyte yes sir will you come this way old jolyon followed a very little maid not more than sixteen one would say into a very small drawingroom where the sunblinds were drawn it held a cottage piano and little else save a vague fragrance and good taste he stood in the middle with his top hat in his hand and thought i expect shes very badly off there was a mirror above the fireplace and he saw himself reflected an oldlooking chap he heard a rustle and turned round she was so close that his moustache almost brushed her forehead just under her hair i was driving up he said thought id look in on you and ask you how you got up the other night and seeing her smile he felt suddenly relieved she was really glad to see him perhaps would you like to put on your hat and come for a drive in the park but while she was gone to put her hat on he frowned the park james and emily mrs nicholas or some other member of his precious family would be there very likely prancing up and down and they would go and wag their tongues about having seen him with her afterwards better not he did not wish to revive the echoes of the past on forsyte change he removed a white hair from the lapel of his closelybuttonedup frock coat and passed his hand over his cheeks moustache and square chin it felt very hollow there under the cheekbones he had not been eating much lately he had better get that little whippersnapper who attended holly to give him a tonic but she had come back and when they were in the carriage he said suppose we go and sit in kensington gardens instead and added with a twinkle no prancing up and down there as if she had been in the secret of his thoughts leaving the carriage they entered those select precincts and strolled towards the water youve gone back to your maiden name i see he said im not sorry she slipped her hand under his arm has june forgiven me uncle jolyon he answered gently yes yes of course why not and have you i i forgave you as soon as i saw how the land really lay and perhaps he had his instinct had always been to forgive the beautiful she drew a deep breath i never regretted i couldnt did you ever love very deeply uncle jolyon at that strange question old jolyon stared before him had he he did not seem to remember that he ever had but he did not like to say this to the young woman whose hand was touching his arm whose life was suspended as it were by memory of a tragic love and he thought if i had met you when i was young i i might have made a fool of myself perhaps and a longing to escape in generalities beset him loves a queer thing he said fatal thing often it was the greeks wasnt it made love into a goddess they were right i dare say but then they lived in the golden age phil adored them phil the word jarred him for suddenly with his power to see all round a thing he perceived why she was putting up with him like this she wanted to talk about her lover well if it was any pleasure to her and he said ah there was a bit of the sculptor in him i fancy yes he loved balance and symmetry he loved the wholehearted way the greeks gave themselves to art balance the chap had no balance at all if he remembered as for symmetry cleanbuilt enough he was no doubt but those queer eyes of his and high cheekbones symmetry youre of the golden age too uncle jolyon old jolyon looked round at her was she chaffing him no her eyes were soft as velvet was she flattering him but if so why there was nothing to be had out of an old chap like him phil thought so he used to say but i can never tell him that i admire him ah there it was again her dead lover her desire to talk of him and he pressed her arm half resentful of those memories half grateful as if he recognised what a link they were between herself and him he was a very talented young fellow he murmured its hot i feel the heat nowadays lets sit down they took two chairs beneath a chestnut tree whose broad leaves covered them from the peaceful glory of the afternoon a pleasure to sit there and watch her and feel that she liked to be with him and the wish to increase that liking if he could made him go on i expect he showed you a side of him i never saw hed be at his best with you his ideas of art were a little new to me he had stiffed the word fangled yes but he used to say you had a real sense of beauty old jolyon thought the devil he did but answered with a twinkle well i have or i shouldnt be sitting here with you she was fascinating when she smiled with her eyes like that he thought you had one of those hearts that never grow old phil had real insight he was not taken in by this flattery spoken out of the past out of a longing to talk of her dead lover not a bit and yet it was precious to hear because she pleased his eyes and heart which quite true had never grown old was that because unlike her and her dead lover he had never loved to desperation had always kept his balance his sense of symmetry well it had left him power at eightyfour to admire beauty and he thought if i were a painter or a sculptor but im an old chap make hay while the sun shines a couple with arms entwined crossed on the grass before them at the edge of the shadow from their tree the sunlight fell cruelly on their pale squashed unkempt young faces were an ugly lot said old jolyon suddenly it amazes me to see how love triumphs over that love triumphs over everything the young think so he muttered love has no age no limit and no death with that glow in her pale face her breast heaving her eyes so large and dark and soft she looked like venus come to life but this extravagance brought instant reaction and twinkling he said well if it had limits we shouldnt be born for by george its got a lot to put up with then removing his top hat he brushed it round with a cuff the great clumsy thing heated his forehead in these days he often got a rush of blood to the head his circulation was not what it had been she still sat gazing straight before her and suddenly she murmured its strange enough that im alive those words of jos wild and lost came back to him ah he said my son saw you for a moment that day was it your son i heard a voice in the hall i thought for a second it was phil old jolyon saw her lips tremble she put her hand over them took it away again and went on calmly that night i went to the embankment a woman caught me by the dress she told me about herself when one knows that others suffer ones ashamed one of those she nodded and horror stirred within old jolyon the horror of one who has never known a struggle with desperation almost against his will he muttered tell me wont you i didnt care whether i lived or died when youre like that fate ceases to want to kill you she took care of me three days she never left me i had no money thats why i do what i can for them now but old jolyon was thinking no money what fate could compare with that every other was involved in it i wish you had come to me he said why didnt you but irene did not answer because my name was forsyte i suppose or was it june who kept you away how are you getting on now his eyes involuntarily swept her body perhaps even now she was and yet she wasnt thin not really oh with my fifty pounds a year i make just enough the answer did not reassure him he had lost confidence and that fellow soames but his sense of justice stifled condemnation no she would certainly have died rather than take another penny from him soft as she looked there must be strength in her somewhere strength and fidelity but what business had young bosinney to have got run over and left her stranded like this well you must come to me now he said for anything you want or i shall be quite cut up and putting on his hat he rose lets go and get some tea i told that lazy chap to put the horses up for an hour and come for me at your place well take a cab presently i cant walk as i used to he enjoyed that stroll to the kensington end of the gardens the sound of her voice the glancing of her eyes the subtle beauty of a charming form moving beside him he enjoyed their tea at ruffels in the high street and came out thence with a great box of chocolates swung on his little finger he enjoyed the drive back to chelsea in a hansom smoking his cigar she had promised to come down next sunday and play to him again and already in thought he was plucking carnations and early roses for her to carry back to town it was a pleasure to give her a little pleasure if it were pleasure from an old chap like him the carriage was already there when they arrived just like that fellow who was always late when he was wanted old jolyon went in for a minute to say goodbye the little dark hall of the flat was impregnated with a disagreeable odour of patchouli and on a bench against the wall its only furniture he saw a figure sitting he heard irene say softly just one minute in the little drawingroom when the door was shut he asked gravely one of your protegees yes now thanks to you i can do something for her he stood staring and stroking that chin whose strength had frightened so many in its time the idea of her thus actually in contact with this outcast grieved and frightened him what could she do for them nothing only soil and make trouble for herself perhaps and he said take care my dear the world puts the worst construction on everything i know that he was abashed by her quiet smile well then sunday he murmured goodbye she put her cheek forward for him to kiss goodbye he said again take care of yourself and he went out not looking towards the figure on the bench he drove home by way of hammersmith that he might stop at a place he knew of and tell them to send her in two dozen of their best burgundy she must want pickingup sometimes only in richmond park did he remember that he had gone up to order himself some boots and was surprised that he could have had so paltry an idea iii the little spirits of the past which throng an old mans days had never pushed their faces up to his so seldom as in the seventy hours elapsing before sunday came the spirit of the future with the charm of the unknown put up her lips instead old jolyon was not restless now and paid no visits to the log because she was coming to lunch there is wonderful finality about a meal it removes a world of doubts for no one misses meals except for reasons beyond control he played many games with holly on the lawn pitching them up to her who was batting so as to be ready to bowl to jolly in the holidays for she was not a forsyte but jolly was and forsytes always bat until they have resigned and reached the age of eightyfive the dog balthasar in attendance lay on the ball as often as he could and the pageboy fielded till his face was like the harvest moon and because the time was getting shorter each day was longer and more golden than the last on friday night he took a liver pill his side hurt him rather and though it was not the liver side there is no remedy like that anyone telling him that he had found a new excitement in life and that excitement was not good for him would have been met by one of those steady and rather defiant looks of his deepset irongrey eyes which seemed to say i know my own business best he always had and always would on sunday morning when holly had gone with her governess to church he visited the strawberry beds there accompanied by the dog balthasar he examined the plants narrowly and succeeded in finding at least two dozen berries which were really ripe stooping was not good for him and he became very dizzy and red in the forehead having placed the strawberries in a dish on the diningtable he washed his hands and bathed his forehead with eau de cologne there before the mirror it occurred to him that he was thinner what a threadpaper he had been when he was young it was nice to be slim he could not bear a fat chap and yet perhaps his cheeks were too thin she was to arrive by train at halfpast twelve and walk up entering from the road past drages farm at the far end of the coppice and having looked into junes room to see that there was hot water ready he set forth to meet her leisurely for his heart was beating the air smelled sweet larks sang and the grand stand at epsom was visible a perfect day on just such a one no doubt six years ago soames had brought young bosinney down with him to look at the site before they began to build it was bosinney who had pitched on the exact spot for the house as june had often told him in these days he was thinking much about that young fellow as if his spirit were really haunting the field of his last work on the chance of seeing her bosinney the one man who had possessed her heart to whom she had given her whole self with rapture at his age one could not of course imagine such things but there stirred in him a queer vague aching as it were the ghost of an impersonal jealousy and a feeling too more generous of pity for that love so early lost all over in a few poor months well well he looked at his watch before entering the coppice only a quarter past twentyfive minutes to wait and then turning the corner of the path he saw her exactly where he had seen her the first time on the log and realised that she must have come by the earlier train to sit there alone for a couple of hours at least two hours of her society missed what memory could make that log so dear to her his face showed what he was thinking for she said at once forgive me uncle jolyon it was here that i first knew yes yes there it is for you whenever you like youre looking a little londony youre giving too many lessons that she should have to give lessons worried him lessons to a parcel of young girls thumping out scales with their thick fingers where do you go to give them he asked theyre mostly jewish families luckily old jolyon stared to all forsytes jews seem strange and doubtful they love music and theyre very kind they had better be by george he took her arm his side always hurt him a little going uphill and said did you ever see anything like those buttercups they came like that in a night her eyes seemed really to fly over the field like bees after the flowers and the honey i wanted you to see them wouldnt let them turn the cows in yet then remembering that she had come to talk about bosinney he pointed to the clocktower over the stables i expect he wouldnt have let me put that there had no notion of time if i remember but pressing his arm to her she talked of flowers instead and he knew it was done that he might not feel she came because of her dead lover the best flower i can show you he said with a sort of triumph is my little sweet shell be back from church directly theres something about her which reminds me a little of you and it did not seem to him peculiar that he had put it thus instead of saying theres something about you which reminds me a little of her ah and here she was holly followed closely by her elderly french governess whose digestion had been ruined twentytwo years ago in the siege of strasbourg came rushing towards them from under the oak tree she stopped about a dozen yards away to pat balthasar and pretend that this was all she had in her mind old jolyon who knew better said well my darling heres the lady in grey i promised you holly raised herself and looked up he watched the two of them with a twinkle irene smiling holly beginning with grave inquiry passing into a shy smile too and then to something deeper she had a sense of beauty that child knew what was what he enjoyed the sight of the kiss between them mrs heron mamzelle beauce well mamzelle good sermon for now that he had not much more time before him the only part of the service connected with this world absorbed what interest in church remained to him mamzelle beauce stretched out a spidery hand clad in a black kid glove she had been in the best families and the rather sad eyes of her lean yellowish face seemed to ask are you wellbrrred whenever holly or jolly did anything unpleasing to her a not uncommon occurrence she would say to them the little tayleurs never did that they were such wellbrrred little children jolly hated the little tayleurs holly wondered dreadfully how it was she fell so short of them a thin rum little soul old jolyon thought her mamzelle beauce luncheon was a successful meal the mushrooms which he himself had picked in the mushroom house his chosen strawberries and another bottle of the steinberg cabinet filled him with a certain aromatic spirituality and a conviction that he would have a touch of eczema tomorrow after lunch they sat under the oak tree drinking turkish coffee it was no matter of grief to him when mademoiselle beauce withdrew to write her sunday letter to her sister whose future had been endangered in the past by swallowing a pin an event held up daily in warning to the children to eat slowly and digest what they had eaten at the foot of the bank on a carriage rug holly and the dog balthasar teased and loved each other and in the shade old jolyon with his legs crossed and his cigar luxuriously savoured gazed at irene sitting in the swing a light vaguely swaying grey figure with a fleck of sunlight here and there upon it lips just opened eyes dark and soft under lids a little drooped she looked content surely it did her good to come and see him the selfishness of age had not set its proper grip on him for he could still feel pleasure in the pleasure of others realising that what he wanted though much was not quite all that mattered its quiet here he said you mustnt come down if you find it dull but its a pleasure to see you my little sweet is the only face which gives me any pleasure except yours from her smile he knew that she was not beyond liking to be appreciated and this reassured him thats not humbug he said i never told a woman i admired her when i didnt in fact i dont know when ive told a woman i admired her except my wife in the old days and wives are funny he was silent but resumed abruptly she used to expect me to say it more often than i felt it and there we were her face looked mysteriously troubled and afraid that he had said something painful he hurried on when my little sweet marries i hope shell find someone who knows what women feel i shant be here to see it but theres too much topsyturvydom in marriage i dont want her to pitch up against that and aware that he had made bad worse he added that dog will scratch a silence followed of what was she thinking this pretty creature whose life was spoiled who had done with love and yet was made for love some day when he was gone perhaps she would find another mate not so disorderly as that young fellow who had got himself run over ah but her husband does soames never trouble you he asked she shook her head her face had closed up suddenly for all her softness there was something irreconcilable about her and a glimpse of light on the inexorable nature of sex antipathies strayed into a brain which belonging to early victorian civil isation so much older than this of his old age had never thought about such primitive things thats a comfort he said you can see the grand stand today shall we take a turn round through the flower and fruit garden against whose high outer walls peach trees and nectarines were trained to the sun through the stables the vinery the mushroom house the asparagus beds the rosery the summerhouse he conducted her even into the kitchen garden to see the tiny green peas which holly loved to scoop out of their pods with her finger and lick up from the palm of her little brown hand many delightful things he showed her while holly and the dog balthasar danced ahead or came to them at intervals for attention it was one of the happiest afternoons he had ever spent but it tired him and he was glad to sit down in the music room and let her give him tea a special little friend of hollys had come in a fair child with short hair like a boys and the two sported in the distance under the stairs on the stairs and up in the gallery old jolyon begged for chopin she played studies mazurkas waltzes till the two children creeping near stood at the foot of the piano their dark and golden heads bent forward listening old jolyon watched lets see you dance you two shyly with a false start they began bobbing and circling earnest not very adroit they went past and past his chair to the strains of that waltz he watched them and the face of her who was playing turned smiling towards those little dancers thinking sweetest picture ive seen for ages a voice said hollee mais enfin questce que tu fais la danser le dimanche viens donc but the children came close to old jolyon knowing that he would save them and gazed into a face which was decidedly caught out better the day better the deed mamzelle its all my doing trot along chicks and have your tea and when they were gone followed by the dog balthasar who took every meal he looked at irene with a twinkle and said well there we are arent they sweet have you any little ones among your pupils yes three two of them darlings pretty lovely old jolyon sighed he had an insatiable appetite for the very young my little sweet he said is devoted to music shell be a musician some day you wouldnt give me your opinion of her playing i suppose of course i will you wouldnt like but he stifled the words to give her lessons the idea that she gave lessons was unpleasant to him yet it would mean that he would see her regularly she left the piano and came over to his chair i would like very much but there is june when are they coming back old jolyon frowned not till the middle of next month what does that matter you said june had forgiven me but she could never forget uncle jolyon forget she must forget if he wanted her to but as if answering irene shook her head you know she couldnt one doesnt forget always that wretched past and he said with a sort of vexed finality well we shall see he talked to her an hour or more of the children and a hundred little things till the carriage came round to take her home and when she had gone he went back to his chair and sat there smoothing his face and chin dreaming over the day that evening after dinner he went to his study and took a sheet of paper he stayed for some minutes without writing then rose and stood under the masterpiece dutch fishing boats at sunset he was not thinking of that picture but of his life he was going to leave her something in his will nothing could so have stirred the stilly deeps of thought and memory he was going to leave her a portion of his wealth of his aspirations deeds qualities work all that had made that wealth going to leave her too a part of all he had missed in life by his sane and steady pursuit of wealth all what had he missed dutch fishing boats responded blankly he crossed to the french window and drawing the curtain aside opened it a wind had got up and one of last years oak leaves which had somehow survived the gardeners brooms was dragging itself with a tiny clicking rustle along the stone terrace in the twilight except for that it was very quiet out there and he could smell the heliotrope watered not long since a bat went by a bird uttered its last cheep and right above the oak tree the first star shone faust in the opera had bartered his soul for some fresh years of youth morbid notion no such bargain was possible that was real tragedy no making oneself new again for love or life or anything nothing left to do but enjoy beauty from afar off while you could and leave it something in your will but how much and as if he could not make that calculation looking out into the mild freedom of the country night he turned back and went up to the chimneypiece there were his pet bronzes a cleopatra with the asp at her breast a socrates a greyhound playing with her puppy a strong man reining in some horses they last he thought and a pang went through his heart they had a thousand years of life before them how much well enough at all events to save her getting old before her time to keep the lines out of her face as long as possible and grey from soiling that bright hair he might live another five years she would be well over thirty by then how much she had none of his blood in her in loyalty to the tenor of his life for forty years and more ever since he married and founded that mysterious thing a family came this warning thought none of his blood no right to anything it was a luxury then this notion an extravagance a petting of an old mans whim one of those things done in dotage his real future was vested in those who had his blood in whom he would live on when he was gone he turned away from the bronzes and stood looking at the old leather chair in which he had sat and smoked so many hundreds of cigars and suddenly he seemed to see her sitting there in her grey dress fragrant soft darkeyed graceful looking up at him why she cared nothing for him really all she cared for was that lost lover of hers but she was there whether she would or no giving him pleasure with her beauty and grace one had no right to inflict an old mans company no right to ask her down to play to him and let him look at her for no reward pleasure must be paid for in this world how much after all there was plenty his son and his three grandchildren would never miss that little lump he had made it himself nearly every penny he could leave it where he liked allow himself this little pleasure he went back to the bureau well im going to he thought let them think what they like im going to and he sat down how much ten thousand twenty thousand how much if only with his money he could buy one year one month of youth and startled by that thought he wrote quickly dear herring draw me a codicil to this effect i leave to my niece irene forsyte born irene heron by which name she now goes fifteen thousand pounds free of legacy duty yours faithfully jolyon forsyte when he had sealed and stamped the envelope he went back to the window and drew in a long breath it was dark but many stars shone now iv he woke at halfpast two an hour which long experience had taught him brings panic intensity to all awkward thoughts experience had also taught him that a further waking at the proper hour of eight showed the folly of such panic on this particular morning the thought which gathered rapid momentum was that if he became ill at his age not improbable he would not see her from this it was but a step to realisation that he would be cut off too when his son and june returned from spain how could he justify desire for the company of one who had stolen early morning does not mince words junes lover that lover was dead but june was a stubborn little thing warmhearted but stubborn as wood and quite true not one who forgot by the middle of next month they would be back he had barely five weeks left to enjoy the new interest which had come into what remained of his life darkness showed up to him absurdly clear the nature of his feeling admiration for beauty a craving to see that which delighted his eyes preposterous at his age and yet what other reason was there for asking june to undergo such painful reminder and how prevent his son and his sons wife from thinking him very queer he would be reduced to sneaking up to london which tired him and the least indisposition would cut him off even from that he lay with eyes open setting his jaw against the prospect and calling himself an old fool while his heart beat loudly and then seemed to stop beating altogether he had seen the dawn lighting the window chinks heard the birds chirp and twitter and the cocks crow before he fell asleep again and awoke tired but sane five weeks before he need bother at his age an eternity but that early morning panic had left its mark had slightly fevered the will of one who had always had his own way he would see her as often as he wished why not go up to town and make that codicil at his solicitors instead of writing about it she might like to go to the opera but by train for he would not have that fat chap beacon grinning behind his back servants were such fools and as likely as not they had known all the past history of irene and young bosinney servants knew everything and suspected the rest he wrote to her that morning my dear irene i have to be up in town tomorrow if you would like to have a look in at the opera come and dine with me quietly but where it was decades since he had dined anywhere in london save at his club or at a private house ah that newfangled place close to covent garden let me have a line tomorrow morning to the piedmont hotel whether to expect you there at oclock yours affectionately jolyon forsyte she would understand that he just wanted to give her a little pleasure for the idea that she should guess he had this itch to see her was instinctively unpleasant to him it was not seemly that one so old should go out of his way to see beauty especially in a woman the journey next day short though it was and the visit to his lawyers tired him it was hot too and after dressing for dinner he lay down on the sofa in his bedroom to rest a little he must have had a sort of fainting fit for he came to himself feeling very queer and with some difficulty rose and rang the bell why it was past seven and there he was and she would be waiting but suddenly the dizziness came on again and he was obliged to relapse on the sofa he heard the maids voice say did you ring sir yes come here he could not see her clearly for the cloud in front of his eyes im not well i want some sal volatile yes sir her voice sounded frightened old jolyon made an effort dont go take this message to my niece a lady waiting in the hall a lady in grey say mr forsyte is not well the heat he is very sorry if he is not down directly she is not to wait dinner when she was gone he thought feebly why did i say a lady in grey she may be in anything sal volatile he did not go off again yet was not conscious of how irene came to be standing beside him holding smelling salts to his nose and pushing a pillow up behind his head he heard her say anxiously dear uncle jolyon what is it was dimly conscious of the soft pressure of her lips on his hand then drew a long breath of smelling salts suddenly discovered strength in them and sneezed ha he said its nothing how did you get here go down and dine the tickets are on the dressingtable i shall be all right in a minute he felt her cool hand on his forehead smelled violets and sat divided between a sort of pleasure and a determination to be all right why you are in grey he said help me up once on his feet he gave himself a shake what business had i to go off like that and he moved very slowly to the glass what a cadaverous chap her voice behind him murmured you mustnt come down uncle you must rest fiddlesticks a glass of champagnell soon set me to rights i cant have you missing the opera but the journey down the corridor was troublesome what carpets they had in these newfangled places so thick that you tripped up in them at every step in the lift he noticed how concerned she looked and said with the ghost of a twinkle im a pretty host when the lift stopped he had to hold firmly to the seat to prevent its slipping under him but after soup and a glass of champagne he felt much better and began to enjoy an infirmity which had brought such solicitude into her manner towards him i should have liked you for a daughter he said suddenly and watching the smile in her eyes went on you mustnt get wrapped up in the past at your time of life plenty of that when you get to my age thats a nice dress i like the style i made it myself ah a woman who could make herself a pretty frock had not lost her interest in life make hay while the sun shines he said and drink that up i want to see some colour in your cheeks we mustnt waste life it doesnt do theres a new marguerite tonight lets hope she wont be fat and mephisto anything more dreadful than a fat chap playing the devil i cant imagine but they did not go to the opera after all for in getting up from dinner the dizziness came over him again and she insisted on his staying quiet and going to bed early when he parted from her at the door of the hotel having paid the cabman to drive her to chelsea he sat down again for a moment to enjoy the memory of her words you are such a darling to me uncle jolyon why who wouldnt be he would have liked to stay up another day and take her to the zoo but two days running of him would bore her to death no he must wait till next sunday she had promised to come then they would settle those lessons for holly if only for a month it would be something that little mamzelle beauce wouldnt like it but she would have to lump it and crushing his old opera hat against his chest he sought the lift he drove to waterloo next morning struggling with a desire to say drive me to chelsea but his sense of proportion was too strong besides he still felt shaky and did not want to risk another aberration like that of last night away from home holly too was expecting him and what he had in his bag for her not that there was any cupboard love in his little sweet she was a bundle of affection then with the rather bitter cynicism of the old he wondered for a second whether it was not cupboard love which made irene put up with him no she was not that sort either she had if anything too little notion of how to butter her bread no sense of property poor thing besides he had not breathed a word about that codicil nor should he sufficient unto the day was the good thereof in the victoria which met him at the station holly was restraining the dog balthasar and their caresses made jubey his drive home all the rest of that fine hot day and most of the next he was content and peaceful reposing in the shade while the long lingering sunshine showered gold on the lawns and the flowers but on thursday evening at his lonely dinner he began to count the hours sixtyfive till he would go down to meet her again in the little coppice and walk up through the fields at her side he had intended to consult the doctor about his fainting fit but the fellow would be sure to insist on quiet no excitement and all that and he did not mean to be tied by the leg did not want to be told of an infirmity if there were one could not afford to hear of it at his time of life now that this new interest had come and he carefully avoided making any mention of it in a letter to his son it would only bring them back with a run how far this silence was due to consideration for their pleasure how far to regard for his own he did not pause to consider that night in his study he had just finished his cigar and was dozing off when he heard the rustle of a gown and was conscious of a scent of violets opening his eyes he saw her dressed in grey standing by the fireplace holding out her arms the odd thing was that though those arms seemed to hold nothing they were curved as if round someones neck and her own neck was bent back her lips open her eyes closed she vanished at once and there were the mantelpiece and his bronzes but those bronzes and the mantelpiece had not been there when she was only the fireplace and the wall shaken and troubled he got up i must take medicine he thought i cant be well his heart beat too fast he had an asthmatic feeling in the chest and going to the window he opened it to get some air a dog was barking far away one of the dogs at gages farm no doubt beyond the coppice a beautiful still night but dark i dropped off he mused thats it and yet ill swear my eyes were open a sound like a sigh seemed to answer whats that he said sharply whos there putting his hand to his side to still the beating of his heart he stepped out on the terrace something soft scurried by in the dark shoo it was that great grey cat young bosinney was like a great cat he thought it was him in there that she that she was hes got her still he walked to the edge of the terrace and looked down into the darkness he could just see the powdering of the daisies on the unmown lawn here today and gone tomorrow and there came the moon who saw all young and old alive and dead and didnt care a dump his own turn soon for a single day of youth he would give what was left and he turned again towards the house he could see the windows of the night nursery up there his little sweet would be asleep hope that dog wont wake her he thought what is it makes us love and makes us die i must go to bed and across the terrace stones growing grey in the moonlight he passed back within how should an old man live his days if not in dreaming of his wellspent past in that at all events there is no agitating warmth only pale winter sunshine the shell can withstand the gentle beating of the dynamos of memory the present he should distrust the future shun from beneath thick shade he should watch the sunlight creeping at his toes if there be sun of summer let him not go out into it mistaking it for the indiansummer sun thus peradventure he shall decline softly slowly imperceptibly until impatient nature clutches his windpipe and he gasps away to death some early morning before the world is aired and they put on his tombstone in the fulness of years yea if he preserve his principles in perfect order a forsyte may live on long after he is dead old jolyon was conscious of all this and yet there was in him that which transcended forsyteism for it is written that a forsyte shall not love beauty more than reason nor his own way more than his own health and something beat within him in these days that with each throb fretted at the thinning shell his sagacity knew this but it knew too that he could not stop that beating nor would if he could and yet if you had told him he was living on his capital he would have stared you down no no a man did not live on his capital it was not done the shibboleths of the past are ever more real than the actualities of the present and he to whom living on ones capital had always been anathema could not have borne to have applied so gross a phrase to his own case pleasure is healthful beauty good to see to live again in the youth of the young and what else on earth was he doing methodically as had been the way of his whole life he now arranged his time on tuesdays he journeyed up to town by train irene came and dined with him and they went to the opera on thursdays he drove to town and putting that fat chap and his horses up met her in kensington gardens picking up the carriage after he had left her and driving home again in time for dinner he threw out the casual formula that he had business in london on those two days on wednesdays and saturdays she came down to give holly music lessons the greater the pleasure he took in her society the more scrupulously fastidious he became just a matter offact and friendly uncle not even in feeling really was he more for after all there was his age and yet if she were late he fidgeted himself to death if she missed coming which happened twice his eyes grew sad as an old dogs and he failed to sleep and so a month went by a month of summer in the fields and in his heart with summers heat and the fatigue thereof who could have believed a few weeks back that he would have looked forward to his sons and his granddaughters return with something like dread there was such a delicious freedom such recovery of that independence a man enjoys before he founds a family about these weeks of lovely weather and this new companionship with one who demanded nothing and remained always a little unknown retaining the fascination of mystery it was like a draught of wine to him who has been drinking water for so long that he has almost forgotten the stir wine brings to his blood the narcotic to his brain the flowers were coloured brighter scents and music and the sunlight had a living value were no longer mere reminders of past enjoyment there was something now to live for which stirred him continually to anticipation he lived in that not in retrospection the difference is considerable to any so old as he the pleasures of the table never of much consequence to one naturally abstemious had lost all value he ate little without knowing what he ate and every day grew thinner and more worn to look at he was again a threadpaper and to this thinned form his massive forehead with hollows at the temples gave more dignity than ever he was very well aware that he ought to see the doctor but liberty was too sweet he could not afford to pet his frequent shortness of breath and the pain in his side at the expense of liberty return to the vegetable existence he had led among the agricultural journals with the lifesize mangold wurzels before this new attraction came into his life no he exceeded his allowance of cigars two a day had always been his rule now he smoked three and sometimes four a man will when he is filled with the creative spirit but very often he thought i must give up smoking and coffee i must give up rattling up to town but he did not there was no one in any sort of authority to notice him and this was a priceless boon the servants perhaps wondered but they were naturally dumb mamzelle beauce was too concerned with her own digestion and too wellbrrred to make personal allusions holly had not as yet an eye for the relative appearance of him who was her plaything and her god it was left for irene herself to beg him to eat more to rest in the hot part of the day to take a tonic and so forth but she did not tell him that she was the a cause of his thinness for one cannot see the havoc oneself is working a man of eighty five has no passions but the beauty which produces passion works on in the old way till death closes the eyes which crave the sight of her on the first day of the second week in july he received a letter from his son in paris to say that they would all be back on friday this had always been more sure than fate but with the pathetic improvidence given to the old that they may endure to the end he had never quite admitted it now he did and something would have to be done he had ceased to be able to imagine life without this new interest but that which is not imagined sometimes exists as forsytes are perpetually finding to their cost he sat in his old leather chair doubling up the letter and mumbling with his lips the end of an unlighted cigar after tomorrow his tuesday expeditions to town would have to be abandoned he could still drive up perhaps once a week on the pretext of seeing his man of business but even that would be dependent on his health for now they would begin to fuss about him the lessons the lessons must go on she must swallow down her scruples and june must put her feelings in her pocket she had done so once on the day after the news of bosinneys death what she had done then she could surely do again now four years since that injury was inflicted on her not christian to keep the memory of old sores alive junes will was strong but his was stronger for his sands were running out irene was soft surely she would do this for him subdue her natural shrinking sooner than give him pain the lessons must continue for if they did he was secure and lighting his cigar at last he began trying to shape out how to put it to them all and explain this strange intimacy how to veil and wrap it away from the naked truth that he could not bear to be deprived of the sight of beauty ah holly holly was fond of her holly liked her lessons she would save him his little sweet and with that happy thought he became serene and wondered what he had been worrying about so fearfully he must not worry it left him always curiously weak and as if but half present in his own body that evening after dinner he had a return of the dizziness though he did not faint he would not ring the bell because he knew it would mean a fuss and make his going up on the morrow more conspicuous when one grew old the whole world was in conspiracy to limit freedom and for what reason just to keep the breath in him a little longer he did not want it at such cost only the dog balthasar saw his lonely recovery from that weakness anxiously watched his master go to the sideboard and drink some brandy instead of giving him a biscuit when at last old jolyon felt able to tackle the stairs he went up to bed and though still shaky next morning the thought of the evening sustained and strengthened him it was always such a pleasure to give her a good dinner he suspected her of undereating when she was alone and at the opera to watch her eyes glow and brighten the unconscious smiling of her lips she hadnt much pleasure and this was the last time he would be able to give her that treat but when he was packing his bag he caught himself wishing that he had not the fatigue of dressing for dinner before him and the exertion too of telling her about junes return the opera that evening was carmen and he chose the last entracte to break the news instinctively putting it off till the latest moment she took it quietly queerly in fact he did not know how she had taken it before the wayward music lifted up again and silence became necessary the mask was down over her face that mask behind which so much went on that he could not see she wanted time to think it over no doubt he would not press her for she would be coming to give her lesson tomorrow afternoon and he should see her then when she had got used to the idea in the cab he talked only of the carmen he had seen better in the old days but this one was not bad at all when he took her hand to say goodnight she bent quickly forward and kissed his forehead goodbye dear uncle jolyon you have been so sweet to me tomorrow then he said goodnight sleep well she echoed softly sleep welll and from the cab window already moving away he saw her face screwed round towards him and her hand put out in a gesture which seemed to linger he sought his room slowly they never gave him the same and he could not get used to these spickandspandy bedrooms with new furniture and greygreen carpets sprinkled all over with pink roses he was wakeful and that wretched habanera kept throbbing in his head his french had never been equal to its words but its sense he knew if it had any sense a gipsy thing wild and unaccountable well there was in life something which upset all your care and plans something which made men and women dance to its pipes and he lay staring from deepsunk eyes into the darkness where the unaccountable held sway you thought you had hold of life but it slipped away behind you took you by the scruff of the neck forced you here and forced you there and then likely as not squeezed life out of you it took the very stars like that he shouldnt wonder rubbed their noses together and flung them apart it had never done playing its pranks five million people in this great blunderbuss of a town and all of them at the mercy of that life force like a lot of little dried peas hopping about on a board when you struck your fist on it ah well himself would not hop much longer a good long sleep would do him good how hot it was up here how noisy his forehead burned she had kissed it just where he always worried just there as if she had known the very place and wanted to kiss it all away for him but instead her lips left a patch of grievous uneasiness she had never spoken in quite that voice had never before made that lingering gesture or looked back at him as she drove away he got out of bed and pulled the curtains aside his room faced down over the river there was little air but the sight of that breadth of water flowing by calm eternal soothed him the great thing he thought is not to make myself a nuisance ill think of my little sweet and go to sleep but it was long before the heat and throbbing of the london night died out into the short slumber of the summer morning and old jolyon had but forty winks when he reached home next day he went out to the flower garden and with the help of holly who was very delicate with flowers gathered a great bunch of carnations they were he told her for the lady in grey a name still bandied between them and he put them in a bowl in his study where he meant to tackle irene the moment she came on the subject of june and future lessons their fragrance and colour would help after lunch he lay down for he felt very tired and the carriage would not bring her from the station till four oclock but as the hour approached he grew restless and sought the schoolroom which overlooked the drive the sunblinds were down and holly was there with mademoiselle beauce sheltered from the heat of a stifling july day attending to their silkworms old jolyon had a natural antipathy to these methodical creatures whose heads and colour reminded him of elephants who nibbled such quantities of holes in nice green leaves and smelled as he thought horrid he sat down on a chintzcovered windowseat whence he could see the drive and get what air there was and the dog balthasar who appreciated chintz on hot days jumped up beside him over the cottage piano a violet dustsheet faded almost to grey was spread and on it the first lavender whose scent filled the room in spite of the coolness here perhaps because of that coolness the beat of life vehemently impressed his ebbeddown senses each sunbeam which came through the chinks had annoying brilliance that dog smelled very strong the lavender perfume was overpowering those silkworms heaving up their greygreen backs seemed horribly alive and hollys dark head bent over them had a wonderfully silky sheen a marvellous cruelly strong thing was life when you were old and weak it seemed to mock you with its multitude of forms and its beating vitality he had never till those last few weeks had this curious feeling of being with one half of him eagerly borne along in the stream of life and with the other half left on the bank watching that helpless progress only when irene was with him did he lose this double consciousness holly turned her head pointed with her little brown fist to the piano for to point with a finger was not wellbrrred and said slyly look at the lady in grey gran isnt she pretty today old jolyons heart gave a flutter and for a second the room was clouded then it cleared and he said with a twinkle whos been dressing her up mamzelle hollee dont be foolish that prim little frenchwoman she hadnt yet got over the music lessons being taken away from her that wouldnt help his little sweet was the only friend they had well they were her lessons and he shouldnt budge shouldnt budge for anything he stroked the warm wool on balthasars head and heard holly say when mothers home there wont be any changes will there she doesnt like strangers you know the childs words seemed to bring the chilly atmosphere of opposition about old jolyon and disclose all the menace to his newfound freedom ah he would have to resign himself to being an old man at the mercy of care and love or fight to keep this new and prized companionship and to fight tired him to death but his thin worn face hardened into resolution till it appeared all jaw this was his house and his affair he should not budge he looked at his watch old and thin like himself he had owned it fifty years past four already and kissing the top of hollys head in passing he went down to the hall he wanted to get hold of her before she went up to give her lesson at the first sound of wheels he stepped out into the porch and saw at once that the victoria was empty the trains in sir but the lady asnt come old jolyon gave him a sharp upward look his eyes seemed to push away that fat chaps curiosity and defy him to see the bitter disappointment he was feeling very well he said and turned back into the house he went to his study and sat down quivering like a leaf what did this mean she might have lost her train but he knew well enough she hadnt goodbye dear uncle jolyon why goodbye and not good night and that hand of hers lingering in the air and her kiss what did it mean vehement alarm and irritation took possession of him he got up and began to pace the turkey carpet between window and wall she was going to give him up he felt it for certain and he defenceless an old man wanting to look on beauty it was ridiculous age closed his mouth paralysed his power to fight he had no right to what was warm and living no right to anything but memories and sorrow he could not plead with her even an old man has his dignity defenceless for an hour lost to bodily fatigue he paced up and down past the bowl of carnations he had plucked which mocked him with its scent of all things hard to bear the prostration of willpower is hardest for one who has always had his way nature had got him in its net and like an unhappy fish he turned and swam at the meshes here and there found no hole no breaking point they brought him tea at five oclock and a letter for a moment hope beat up in him he cut the envelope with the butter knife and read dearest uncle jolyon i cant bear to write anything that may disappoint you but i was too cowardly to tell you last night i feel i cant come down and give holly any more lessons now that june is coming back some things go too deep to be forgotten it has been such a joy to see you and holly perhaps i shall still see you sometimes when you come up though im sure its not good for you i can see you are tiring yourself too much i believe you ought to rest quite quietly all this hot weather and now you have your son and june coming back you will be so happy thank you a million times for all your sweetness to me lovingly your irene so there it was not good for him to have pleasure and what he chiefly cared about to try and put off feeling the inevitable end of all things the approach of death with its stealthy rustling footsteps not good for him not even she could see how she was his new lease of interest in life the incarnation of all the beauty he felt slipping from him his tea grew cold his cigar remained unlit and up and down he paced torn between his dignity and his hold on life intolerable to be squeezed out slowly without a say of your own to live on when your will was in the hands of others bent on weighing you to the ground with care and love intolerable he would see what telling her the truth would do the truth that he wanted the sight of her more than just a lingering on he sat down at his old bureau and took a pen but he could not write there was some thing revolting in having to plead like this plead that she should warm his eyes with her beauty it was tantamount to confessing dotage he simply could not and instead he wrote i had hoped that the memory of old sores would not be allowed to stand in the way of what is a pleasure and a profit to me and my little granddaughter but old men learn to forego their whims they are obliged to even the whim to live must be foregone sooner or later and perhaps the sooner the better my love to you jolyon forsyte bitter he thought but i cant help it im tired he sealed and dropped it into the box for the evening post and hearing it fall to the bottom thought there goes all ive looked forward to that evening after dinner which he scarcely touched after his cigar which he left halfsmoked for it made him feel faint he went very slowly upstairs and stole into the nightnursery he sat down on the windowseat a nightlight was burning and he could just see hollys face with one hand underneath the cheek an early cockchafer buzzed in the japanese paper with which they had filled the grate and one of the horses in the stable stamped restlessly to sleep like that child he pressed apart two rungs of the venetian blind and looked out the moon was rising bloodred he had never seen so red a moon the woods and fields out there were dropping to sleep too in the last glimmer of the summer light and beauty like a spirit walked ive had a long life he thought the best of nearly everything im an ungrateful chap ive seen a lot of beauty in my time poor young bosinney said i had a sense of beauty theres a man in the moon tonight a moth went by another another ladies in grey he closed his eyes a feeling that he would never open them again beset him he let it grow let himself sink then with a shiver dragged the lids up there was something wrong with him no doubt deeply wrong he would have to have the doctor after all it didnt much matter now into that coppice the moonlight would have crept there would be shadows and those shadows would be the only things awake no birds beasts flowers insects just the shadows moving ladies in grey over that log they would climb would whisper together she and bosinney funny thought and the frogs and little things would whisper too how the clock ticked in here it was all eerie out there in the light of that red moon in here with the little steady nightlight and the ticking clock and the nurses dressinggown hanging from the edge of the screen tall like a womans figure lady in grey and a very odd thought beset him did she exist had she ever come at all or was she but the emanation of all the beauty he had loved and must leave so soon the violetgrey spirit with the dark eyes and the crown of amber hair who walks the dawn and the moonlight and at bluebell time what was she who was she did she exist he rose and stood a moment clutching the windowsill to give him a sense of reality again then began tiptoeing towards the door he stopped at the foot of the bed and holly as if conscious of his eyes fixed on her stirred sighed and curled up closer in defence he tiptoed on and passed out into the dark passage reached his room undressed at once and stood before a mirror in his nightshirt what a scarecrow with temples fallen in and thin legs his eyes resisted his own image and a look of pride came on his face all was in league to pull him down even his reflection in the glass but he was not down yet he got into bed and lay a long time without sleeping trying to reach resignation only too well aware that fretting and disappointment were very bad for him he woke in the morning so unrefreshed and strengthless that he sent for the doctor after sounding him the fellow pulled a face as long as your arm and ordered him to stay in bed and give up smoking that was no hardship there was nothing to get up for and when he felt ill tobacco always lost its savour he spent the morning languidly with the sunblinds down turning and returning the times not reading much the dog balthasar lying beside his bed with his lunch they brought him a telegram running thus your letter received coming down this afternoon will be with you at fourthirty irene coming down after all then she did exist and he was not deserted coming down a glow ran through his limbs his cheeks and forehead felt hot he drank his soup and pushed the tray table away lying very quiet until they had removed lunch and left him alone but every now and then his eyes twinkled coming down his heart beat fast and then did not seem to beat at all at three oclock he got up and dressed deliberately noiselessly holly and mamzelle would be in the schoolroom and the servants asleep after their dinner he shouldnt wonder he opened his door cautiously and went downstairs in the hall the dog balthasar lay solitary and followed by him old jolyon passed into his study and out into the burning afternoon he meant to go down and meet her in the coppice but felt at once he could not manage that in this heat he sat down instead under the oak tree by the swing and the dog balthasar who also felt the heat lay down beside him he sat there smiling what a revel of bright minutes what a hum of insects and cooing of pigeons it was the quintessence of a summer day lovely and he was happy happy as a sandboy what ever that might be she was coming she had not given him up he had everything in life he wanted except a little more breath and less weight just here he would see her when she emerged from the fernery come swaying just a little a violetgrey figure passing over the daisies and dandelions and soldiers on the lawn the soldiers with their flowery crowns he would not move but she would come up to him and say dear uncle jolyon i am sorry and sit in the swing and let him look at her and tell her that he had not been very well but was all right now and that dog would lick her hand that dog knew his master was fond of her that dog was a good dog it was quite shady under the tree the sun could not get at him only make the rest of the world bright so that he could see the grand stand at epsom away out there very far and the cows crop ping the clover in the field and swishing at the flies with their tails he smelled the scent of limes and lavender ah that was why there was such a racket of bees they were excited busy as his heart was busy and excited drowsy too drowsy and drugged on honey and happiness as his heart was drugged and drowsy summer summer they seemed saying great bees and little bees and the flies too the stable clock struck four in half an hour she would be here he would have just one tiny nap because he had had so little sleep of late and then he would be fresh for her fresh for youth and beauty coming towards him across the sunlit lawn lady in grey and settling back in his chair he closed his eyes some thistle down came on what little air there was and pitched on his moustache more white than itself he did not know but his breathing stirred it caught there a ray of sunlight struck through and lodged on his boot a bumblebee alighted and strolled on the crown of his panama hat and the delicious surge of slumber reached the brain beneath that hat and the head swayed forward and rested on his breast summer summer so went the hum the stable clock struck the quarter past the dog balthasar stretched and looked up at his master the thistledown no longer moved the dog placed his chin over the sunlit foot it did not stir the dog withdrew his chin quickly rose and leaped on old jolyons lap looked in his face whined then leaping down sat on his haunches gazing up and suddenly he uttered a long long howl but the thistledown was still as death and the face of his old master summer summer summer the soundless footsteps on the grass in chancery two households both alike in dignity from ancient grudge break into new mutiny romeo and juliet to jessie and joseph conrad part chapter i at timothys the possessive instinct never stands still through florescence and feud frosts and fires it followed the laws of progression even in the forsyte family which had believed it fixed for ever nor can it be dissociated from environment any more than the quality of potato from the soil the historian of the english eighties and nineties will in his good time depict the somewhat rapid progression from self contented and contained provincialism to still more selfcontented if less contained imperialism in other words the possessive instinct of the nation on the move and so as if in conformity was it with the forsyte family they were spreading not merely on the surface but within when in susan hayman the married forsyte sister followed her husband at the ludicrously low age of seventyfour and was cremated it made strangely little stir among the six old forsytes left for this apathy there were three causes first the almost surreptitious burial of old jolyon in down at robin hill first of the forsytes to desert the family grave at highgate that burial coming a year after swithins entirely proper funeral had occasioned a great deal of talk on forsyte change the abode of timothy forsyte on the bayswater road london which still col lected and radiated family gossip opinions ranged from the lamentation of aunt juley to the outspoken assertion of francie that it was a jolly good thing to stop all that stuffy highgate business uncle jolyon in his later years indeed ever since the strange and lamentable affair between his granddaughter junes lover young bosinney and irene his nephew soames forsytes wife had noticeably rapped the familys knuckles and that way of his own which he had always taken had begun to seem to them a little wayward the philosophic vein in him of course had always been too liable to crop out of the strata of pure forsyteism so they were in a way prepared for his interment in a strange spot but the whole thing was an odd business and when the contents of his will became current coin on forsyte change a shiver had gone round the clan out of his estate l gross with liabilities l s d he had actually left l to whomever do you think my dear to irene that runaway wife of his nephew soames irene a woman who had almost disgraced the family and still more amazing was to him no blood relation not out and out of course only a life interest only the income from it still there it was and old jolyons claim to be the perfect forsyte was ended once for all that then was the first reason why the burial of susan hayman at woking made little stir the second reason was altogether more expansive and imperial besides the house on campden hill susan had a place left her by hayman when he died just over the border in hants where the hayman boys had learned to be such good shots and riders as it was believed which was of course nice for them and creditable to everybody and the fact of owning something really countrified seemed somehow to excuse the dispersion of her remains though what could have put cremation into her head they could not think the usual invitations however had been issued and soames had gone down and young nicholas and the will had been quite satisfactory so far as it went for she had only had a life interest and everything had gone quite smoothly to the children in equal shares the third reason why susans burial made little stir was the most expansive of all it was summed up daringly by euphemia the pale the thin well i think people have a right to their own bodies even when theyre dead coming from a daughter of nicholas a liberal of the old school and most tyrannical it was a startling remark showing in a flash what a lot of water had run under bridges since the death of aunt ann in just when the proprietorship of soames over his wifes body was acquiring the uncertainty which had led to such disaster euphemia of course spoke like a child and had no experience for though well over thirty by now her name was still forsyte but making all allowances her remark did undoubtedly show expansion of the principle of liberty decentralisation and shift in the central point of possession from others to oneself when nicholas heard his daughters remark from aunt hester he had rapped out wives and daughters theres no end to their liberty in these days i knew that jackson case would lead to things lugging in habeas corpus like that he had of course never really forgiven the married womans property act which would so have interfered with him if he had not mercifully married before it was passed but in truth there was no denying the revolt among the younger forsytes against being owned by others that as it were colonial disposition to own oneself which is the paradoxical forerunner of imperialism was making progress all the time they were all now married except george confirmed to the turf and the iseeum club francie pursuing her musical career in a studio off the kings road chelsea and still taking lovers to dances euphemia living at home and complaining of nicholas and those two dromios giles and jesse hayman of the third generation there were not very many young jolyon had three winifred dartie four young nicholas six already young roger had one marian tweetyman one st john hayman two but the rest of the sixteen married soames rachel and cicely of james family eustace and thomas of rogers ernest archibald and florence of nicholas augustus and annabel spender of the haymans were going down the years unreproduced thus of the ten old forsytes twentyone young forsytes had been born but of the twentyone young forsytes there were as yet only seventeen descendants and it already seemed unlikely that there would be more than a further unconsidered trifle or so a student of statistics must have noticed that the birth rate had varied in accordance with the rate of interest for your money grandfather superior dosset forsyte in the early nineteenth century had been getting ten per cent for his hence ten children those ten leaving out the four who had not married and juley whose husband septimus small had of course died almost at once had averaged from four to five per cent for theirs and produced accordingly the twentyone whom they produced were now getting barely three per cent in the consols to which their father had mostly tied the settlements they made to avoid death duties and the six of them who had been reproduced had seventeen children or just the proper two and fivesixths per stem there were other reasons too for this mild reproduction a distrust of their earning powers natural where a sufficiency is guaranteed together with the knowledge that their fathers did not die kept them cautious if one had children and not much income the standard of taste and comfort must of necessity go down what was enough for two was not enough for four and so on it would be better to wait and see what father did besides it was nice to be able to take holidays unhampered sooner in fact than own children they preferred to concentrate on the ownership of them selves conforming to the growing tendency fin de siecle as it was called in this way little risk was run and one would be able to have a motorcar indeed eustace already had one but it had shaken him horribly and broken one of his eye teeth so that it would be better to wait till they were a little safer in the meantime no more children even young nicholas was drawing in his horns and had made no addition to his six for quite three years the corporate decay however of the forsytes their dispersion rather of which all this was symptomatic had not advanced so far as to prevent a rally when roger forsyte died in it had been a glorious summer and after holidays abroad and at the sea they were practically all back in london when roger with a touch of his old originality had suddenly breathed his last at his own house in princes gardens at timothys it was whispered sadly that poor roger had always been eccentric about his digestion had he not for instance preferred german mutton to all the other brands be that as it may his funeral at highgate had been perfect and coming away from it soames forsyte made almost mechanically for his uncle timothys in the bayswater road the old things aunt juley and aunt hester would like to hear about it his father james at eightyeight had not felt up to the fatigue of the funeral and timothy himself of course had not gone so that nicholas had been the only brother present still there had been a fair gathering and it would cheer aunts juley and hester up to know the kindly thought was not unmixed with the inevitable longing to get something out of everything you do which is the chief characteristic of forsytes and indeed of the saner elements in every nation in this practice of taking family matters to timothys in the bayswater road soames was but following in the footsteps of his father who had been in the habit of going at least once a week to see his sisters at timothys and had only given it up when he lost his nerve at eightysix and could not go out without emily to go with emily was of no use for who could really talk to anyone in the presence of his own wife like james in the old days soames found time to go there nearly every sunday and sit in the little drawingroom into which with his undoubted taste he had introduced a good deal of change and china not quite up to his own fastidious mark and at least two rather doubtful barbizon pictures at christmastides he himself who had done extremely well with the barbizons had for some years past moved towards the marises israels and mauve and was hoping to do better in the riverside house which he now inhabited near mapledurham he had a gallery beautifully hung and lighted to which few london dealers were strangers it served too as a sunday afternoon attraction in those weekend parties which his sisters winifred or rachel occasionally organised for him for though he was but a taciturn showman his quiet collected determinism seldom failed to influence his guests who knew that his reputation was grounded not on mere aesthetic fancy but on his power of gauging the future of market values when he went to timothys he almost always had some little tale of triumph over a dealer to unfold and dearly he loved that coo of pride with which his aunts would greet it this afternoon however he was differently animated coming from rogers funeral in his neat dark clothes not quite black for after all an uncle was but an uncle and his soul abhorred excessive display of feeling leaning back in a marqueterie chair and gazing down his uplifted nose at the skyblue walls plastered with gold frames he was noticeably silent whether because he had been to a funeral or not the peculiar forsyte build of his face was seen to the best advantage this afternoon a face concave and long with a jaw which divested of flesh would have seemed extravagant altogether a chinny face though not at all illlooking he was feeling more strongly than ever that timothys was hopelessly rumtitoo and the souls of his aunts dismally midvictorian the subject on which alone he wanted to talk his own undivorced position was unspeakable and yet it occupied his mind to the exclusion of all else it was only since the spring that this had been so and a new feeling grown up which was egging him on towards what he knew might well be folly in a forsyte of fortyfive more and more of late he had been conscious that he was getting on the fortune already considerable when he conceived the house at robin hill which had finally wrecked his marriage with irene had mounted with surprising vigour in the twelve lonely years during which he had devoted himself to little else he was worth today well over a hundred thousand pounds and had no one to leave it to no real object for going on with what was his religion even if he were to relax his efforts money made money and he felt that he would have a hundred and fifty thousand before he knew where he was there had always been a strongly domestic philoprogenitive side to soames baulked and frustrated it had hidden itself away but now had crept out again in this his prime of life concreted and focussed of late by the attraction of a girls undoubted beauty it had become a veritable prepossession and this girl was french not likely to lose her head or accept any unlegalised position moreover soames himself disliked the thought of that he had tasted of the sordid side of sex during those long years of forced celibacy secretively and always with disgust for he was fastidious and his sense of law and order innate he wanted no hole and corner liaison a marriage at the embassy in paris a few months travel and he could bring annette back quite separated from a past which in truth was not too distinguished for she only kept the accounts in her mothers soho restaurant he could bring her back as something very new and chic with her french taste and selfpossession to reign at the shelter near mapledurham on forsyte change and among his riverside friends it would be current that he had met a charming french girl on his travels and married her there would be the flavour of romance and a certain cachet about a french wife no he was not at all afraid of that it was only this cursed undivorced condition of his and and the question whether annette would take him which he dared not put to the touch until he had a clear and even dazzling future to offer her in his aunts drawingroom he heard with but muffled ears those usual questions how was his dear father not going out of course now that the weather was turning chilly would soames be sure to tell him that hester had found boiled holly leaves most comforting for that pain in her side a poultice every three hours with red flannel afterwards and could he relish just a little pot of their very best prune preserve it was so delicious this year and had such a wonderful effect oh and about the darties had soames heard that dear winifred was having a most distressing time with montague timothy thought she really ought to have protection it was said but soames mustnt take this for certain that he had given some of winifreds jewellery to a dreadful dancer it was such a bad example for dear val just as he was going to college soames had not heard oh but he must go and see his sister and look into it at once and did he think these boers were really going to resist timothy was in quite a stew about it the price of consols was so high and he had such a lot of money in them did soames think they must go down if there was a war soames nodded but it would be over very quickly it would be so bad for timothy if it wasnt and of course soames dear father would feel it very much at his age luckily poor dear roger had been spared this dreadful anxiety and aunt juley with a little handkerchief wiped away the large tear trying to climb the permanent pout on her now quite withered left cheek she was remembering dear roger and all his originality and how he used to stick pins into her when they were little together aunt hester with her instinct for avoiding the unpleasant here chimed in did soames think they would make mr chamberlain prime minister at once he would settle it all so quickly she would like to see that old kruger sent to st helena she could remember so well the news of napoleons death and what a relief it had been to his grandfather of course she and juley we were in pantalettes then my dear had not felt it much at the time soames took a cup of tea from her drank it quickly and ate three of those macaroons for which timothys was famous his faint pale supercilious smile had deepened just a little really his family remained hopelessly provincial however much of london they might possess between them in these goahead days their provinc ialism stared out even more than it used to why old nicholas was still a free trader and a member of that antediluvian home of liberalism the remove club though to be sure the members were pretty well all conservatives now or he himself could not have joined and timothy they said still wore a nightcap aunt juley spoke again dear soames was looking so well hardly a day older than he did when dear ann died and they were all there together dear jolyon and dear swithin and dear roger she paused and caught the tear which had climbed the pout on her right cheek did he did he ever hear anything of irene nowadays aunt hester visibly interposed her shoulder really juley was always saying something the smile left soames face and he put his cup down here was his subject broached for him and for all his desire to expand he could not take advantage aunt juley went on rather hastily they say dear jolyon first left her that fifteen thousand out and out then of course he saw it would not be right and made it for her life only had soames heard that soames nodded your cousin jolyon is a widower now he is her trustee you knew that of course soames shook his head he did know but wished to show no interest young jolyon and he had not met since the day of bosinneys death he must be quite middleaged by now went on aunt juley dreamily let me see he was born when your dear uncle lived in mount street long before they went to stanhope gate in december just before that dreadful commune over fifty fancy that such a pretty baby and we were all so proud of him the very first of you all aunt juley sighed and a lock of not quite her own hair came loose and straggled so that aunt hester gave a little shiver soames rose he was experiencing a curious piece of selfdiscovery that old wound to his pride and selfesteem was not yet closed he had come thinking he could talk of it even wanting to talk of his fettered condition and behold he was shrinking away from this reminder by aunt juley renowned for her malapropisms oh soames was not going already soames smiled a little vindictively and said yes goodbye remember me to uncle timothy and leaving a cold kiss on each forehead whose wrinkles seemed to try and cling to his lips as if longing to be kissed away he left them looking brightly after him dear soames it had been so good of him to come today when they were not feeling very with compunction tweaking at his chest soames descended the stairs where was always that rather pleasant smell of camphor and port wine and house where draughts are not permitted the poor old things he had not meant to be unkind and in the street he instantly forgot them repossessed by the image of annette and the thought of the cursed coil around him why had he not pushed the thing through and obtained divorce when that wretched bosinney was run over and there was evidence galore for the asking and he turned towards his sister winifred darties residence in green street mayfair chapter ii exit a man of the world that a man of the world so subject to the vicissitudes of fortunes as montague dartie should still be living in a house he had inhabited twenty years at least would have been more noticeable if the rent rates taxes and repairs of that house had not been defrayed by his fatherinlaw by that simple if wholesale device james forsyte had secured a certain stability in the lives of his daughter and his grandchildren after all there is something invaluable about a safe roof over the head of a sportsman so dashing as dartie until the events of the last few days he had been almostsupernaturally steady all this year the fact was he had acquired a half share in a filly of george forsytes who had gone irreparably on the turf to the horror of roger now stilled by the grave sleevelinks by martyr out of shirtonfire by suspender was a bay filly three years old who for a variety of reasons had never shown her true form with half ownership of this hopeful animal all the idealism latent somewhere in dartie as in every other man had put up its head and kept him quietly ardent for months past when a man has some thing good to live for it is astonishing how sober he becomes and what dartie had was really good a three to one chance for an autumn handicap publicly assessed at twentyfive to one the oldfashioned heaven was a poor thing beside it and his shirt was on the daughter of shirt onfire but how much more than his shirt depended on this granddaughter of suspender at that roving age of fortyfive trying to forsytes and though perhaps less distinguishable from any other age trying even to darties montague had fixed his current fancy on a dancer it was no mean passion but without money and a good deal of it likely to remain a love as airy as her skirts and dartie never had any money subsisting miserably on what he could beg or borrow from winifred a woman of character who kept him because he was the father of her children and from a lingering admiration for those nowdying wardour street good looks which in their youth had fascinated her she together with anyone else who would lend him anything and his losses at cards and on the turf extraordinary how some men make a good thing out of losses were his whole means of subsistence for james was now too old and nervous to approach and soames too formidably adamant it is not too much to say that dartie had been living on hope for months he had never been fond of money for itself had always despised the forsytes with their investing habits though careful to make such use of them as he could what he liked about money was what it bought personal sensation no real sportsman cares for money he would say borrowing a pony if it was no use trying for a monkey there was something delicious about montague dartie he was as george forsyte said a daisy the morning of the handicap dawned clear and bright the last day of september and dartie who had travelled to newmarket the night before arrayed himself in spotless checks and walked to an eminence to see his half of the filly take her final canter if she won he would be a cool three thou in pocket a poor enough recompense for the sobriety and patience of these weeks of hope while they had been nursing her for this race but he had not been able to afford more should he lay it off at the eight to one to which she had advanced this was his single thought while the larks sang above him and the grassy downs smelled sweet and the pretty filly passed tossing her head and glowing like satin after all if he lost it would not be he who paid and to lay it off would reduce his winnings to some fifteen hundred hardly enough to purchase a dancer out and out even more potent was the itch in the blood of all the darties for a real flutter and turning to george he said shes a clipper shell win hands down i shall go the whole hog george who had laid off every penny and a few besides and stood to win however it came out grinned down on him from his bulky height with the words so ho my wild one for after a chequered apprenticeship weathered with the money of a deeply complaining roger his forsyte blood was beginning to stand him in good stead in the profession of owner there are moments of disillusionment in the lives of men from which the sensitive recorder shrinks suffice it to say that the good thing fell down sleevelinks finished in the ruck darties shirt was lost between the passing of these things and the day when soames turned his face towards green street what had not happened when a man with the constitution of montague dartie has exercised selfcontrol for months from religious motives and remains un rewarded he does not curse god and die he curses god and lives to the distress of his family winifred a plucky woman if a little too fashionable who had borne the brunt of him for exactly twentyone years had never really believed that he would do what he now did like so many wives she thought she knew the worst but she had not yet known him in his fortyfifth year when he like other men felt that it was now or never paying on the nd of october a visit of inspec tion to her jewel case she was horrified to observe that her womans crown and glory was gone the pearls which montague had given her in when benedict was born and which james had been compelled to pay for in the spring of to save scandal she consulted her husband at once he poohpoohed the matter they would turn up nor till she said sharply very well then monty i shall go down to scotland yard myself did he consent to take the matter in hand alas that the steady and resolved continuity of design necessary to the accomplishment of sweeping operations should be liable to interruption by drink that night dartie returned home without a care in the world or a particle of reticence under normal conditions winifred would merely have locked her door and let him sleep it off but torturing suspense about her pearls had caused her to wait up for him taking a small revolver from his pocket and holding on to the dining table he told her at once that he did not care a cursh whether she lived slong as she was quiet but he himself wash tired o life winifred holding onto the other side of the dining table answered dont be a clown monty have you been to scotland yard placing the revolver against his chest dartie had pulled the trigger several times it was not loaded dropping it with an imprecation he had muttered for shake o the children and sank into a chair winifred having picked up the revolver gave him some soda water the liquor had a magical effect life had illused him winifred had never unshtoodm if he hadnt the right to take the pearls he had given her himself who had that spanish filly had gotm if winifred had any jection he wd cut her throat what was the matter with that probably the first use of that celebrated phrase so obscure are the origins of even the most classical language winifred who had learned selfcontainment in a hard school looked up at him and said spanish filly do you mean that girl we saw dancing in the pandemonium ballet well you are a thief and a blackguard it had been the last straw on a sorely loaded consciousness reaching up from his chair dartie seized his wifes arm and recalling the achievements of his boyhood twisted it winifred endured the agony with tears in her eyes but no murmur watching for a moment of weakness she wrenched it free then placing the dining table between them said between her teeth you are the limit monty undoubtedly the inception of that phrase so is english formed under the stress of circumstances leaving dartie with foam on his dark moustache she went upstairs and after locking her door and bathing her arm in hot water lay awake all night thinking of her pearls adorning the neck of another and of the consideration her husband had presumably received therefor the man of the world awoke with a sense of being lost to that world and a dim recollection of having been called a limit he sat for half an hour in the dawn and the armchair where he had slept perhaps the unhappiest halfhour he had ever spent for even to a dartie there is something tragic about an end and he knew that he had reached it never again would he sleep in his diningroom and wake with the light filtering through those curtains bought by winifred at nickens and jarveys with the money of james never again eat a devilled kidney at that rosewood table after a roll in the sheets and a hot bath he took his note case from his dress coat pocket four hundred pounds in fives and tens the remainder of the proceeds of his half of sleevelinks sold last night cash down to george forsyte who having won over the race had not conceived the sudden dislike to the animal which he himself now felt the ballet was going to buenos aires the day after tomorrow and he was going too full value for the pearls had not yet been received he was only at the soup he stole upstairs not daring to have a bath or shave besides the water would be cold he changed his clothes and packed stealthily all he could it was hard to leave so many shining boots but one must sacrifice something then carrying a valise in either hand he stepped out onto the landing the house was very quiet that house where he had begotten his four children it was a curious moment this outside the room of his wife once admired if not perhaps loved who had called him the limit he steeled himself with that phrase and tiptoed on but the next door was harder to pass it was the room his daughters slept in maud was at school but imogen would be lying there and moisture came into darties early morning eyes she was the most like him of the four with her dark hair and her luscious brown glance just coming out a pretty thing he set down the two valises this almost formal abdication of fatherhood hurt him the morning light fell on a face which worked with real emotion nothing so false as penitence moved him but genuine paternal feeling and that melancholy of never again he moistened his lips and complete irresolution for a moment paralysed his legs in their check trousers it was hard hard to be thus compelled to leave his home d nit he muttered i never thought it would come to this noises above warned him that the maids were beginning to get up and grasping the two valises he tiptoed on downstairs his cheeks were wet and the knowledge of that was comforting as though it guaranteed the genuineness of his sacrifice he lingered a little in the rooms below to pack all the cigars he had some papers a crush hat a silver cigarette box a ruffs guide then mixing himself a stiff whisky and soda and lighting a cigarette he stood hesitating before a photograph of his two girls in a silver frame it belonged to winifred never mind he thought she can get another taken and i cant he slipped it into the valise then putting on his hat and overcoat he took two others his best malacca cane an umbrella and opened the front door closing it softly behind him he walked out burdened as he had never been in all his life and made his way round the corner to wait there for an early cab to come by thus had passed montague dartie in the fortyfifth year of his age from the house which he had called his own when winifred came down and realised that he was not in the house her first feeling was one of dull anger that he should thus elude the reproaches she had carefully prepared in those long wakeful hours he had gone off to newmarket or brighton with that woman as likely as not disgusting forced to a complete reticence before imogen and the servants and aware that her fathers nerves would never stand the disclosure she had been unable to refrain from going to timothys that afternoon and pouring out the story of the pearls to aunts juley and hester in utter confidence it was only on the following morning that she noticed the disappearance of that photograph what did it mean careful examination of her husbands relics prompted the thought that he had gone for good as that conclusion hardened she stood quite still in the middle of his dressingroom with all the drawers pulled out to try and realise what she was feeling by no means easy though he was the limit he was yet her property and for the life of her she could not but feel the poorer to be widowed yet not widowed at fortytwo with four children made conspicuous an object of commiseration gone to the arms of a spanish jade memories feelings which she had thought quite dead revived within her painful sullen tenacious mechanically she closed drawer after drawer went to her bed lay on it and buried her face in the pillows she did not cry what was the use of that when she got off her bed to go down to lunch she felt as if only one thing could do her good and that was to have val home he her eldest boy who was to go to oxford next month at james expense was at littlehampton taking his final gallops with his trainer for smalls as he would have phrased it following his fathers diction she caused a telegram to be sent to him i must see about his clothes she said to imogen i cant have him going up to oxford all anyhow those boys are so particular vals got heaps of things imogen answered i know but they want overhauling i hope hell come hell come like a shot mother but hell probably skew his exam i cant help that said winifred i want him with an innocent shrewd look at her mothers face imogen kept silence it was father of course val did come like a shot at six oclock imagine a cross between a pickle and a forsyte and you have young publius valerius dartie a youth so named could hardly turn out otherwise when he was born winifred in the heyday of spirits and the craving for distinction had determined that her children should have names such as no others had ever had it was a mercy she felt now that she had just not named imogen thisbe but it was to george forsyte always a wag that vals christening was due it so happened that dartie dining with him a week after the birth of his son and heir had mentioned this aspiration of winifreds call him cato said george itll be damned piquant he had just won a tenner on a horse of that name cato dartie had replied they were a little on as the phrase was even in those days its not a christian name halo you george called to a waiter in knee breeches bring me the encycpedia brit from the library letter c the waiter brought it here you are said george pointing with his cigar cato publius valerius by virgil out of lydia thats what you want publius valerius is christian enough dartie on arriving home had informed winifred she had been charmed it was so chic and publius valerius became the babys name though it afterwards transpired that they had got hold of the inferior cato in however when little publius was nearly ten the word chic went out of fashion and sobriety came in winifred began to have doubts they were confirmed by little publius himself who returned from his first term at school com plaining that life was a burden to him they called him pubby winifred a woman of real decision promptly changed his school and his name to val the publius being dropped even as an initial at nineteen he was a limber freckled youth with a wide mouth light eyes long dark lashes a rather charming smile considerable knowledge of what he should not know and no experience of what he ought to do few boys had more narrowly escaped being expelled the engaging rascal after kissing his mother and pinching imogen he ran upstairs three at a time and came down four dressed for dinner he was awfully sorry but his trainer who had come up too had asked him to dine at the oxford and cambridge it wouldnt do to miss the old chap would be hurt winifred let him go with an unhappy pride she had wanted him at home but it was very nice to know that his tutor was so fond of him he went out with a wink at imogen saying i say mother could i have two plovers eggs when i come in cooks got some they top up so jolly well oh and look here have you any money i had to borrow a fiver from old snobby winifred looking at him with fond shrewdness answered my dear you are naughty about money but you shouldnt pay him tonight anyway youre his guest how nice and slim he looked in his white waistcoat and his dark thick lashes oh but we may go to the theatre you see mother and i think i ought to stand the tickets hes always hard up you know winifred produced a fivepound note saying well perhaps youd better pay him but you mustnt stand the tickets too val pocketed the fiver if i do i cant he said goodnight mum he went out with his head up and his hat cocked joyously sniffing the air of piccadilly like a young hound loosed into covert jolly good biz after that mouldy old slow hole down there he found his tutor not indeed at the oxford and cambridge but at the goats club this tutor was a year older than himself a goodlooking youth with fine brown eyes and smooth dark hair a small mouth an oval face languid immaculate cool to a degree one of those young men who without effort establish moral ascendancy over their companions he had missed being expelled from school a year before val had spent that year at oxford and val could almost see a halo round his head his name was crum and no one could get through money quicker it seemed to be his only aim in life dazzling to young val in whom however the forsyte would stand apart now and then wondering where the value for that money was they dined quietly in style and taste left the club smoking cigars with just two bottles inside them and dropped into stalls at the liberty for val the sound of comic songs the sight of lovely legs were fogged and interrupted by haunting fears that he would never equal crums quiet dandyism his idealism was roused and when that is so one is never quite at ease surely he had too wide a mouth not the best cut of waistcoat no braid on his trousers and his lavender gloves had no thin black stitchings down the back besides he laughed too much crum never laughed he only smiled with his regular dark brows raised a little so that they formed a gable over his just drooped lids no he would never be crums equal all the same it was a jolly good show and cynthia dark simply ripping between the acts crum regaled him with particulars of cynthias private life and the awful knowledge became vals that if he liked crum could go behind he simply longed to say i say take me but dared not because of his deficiencies and this made the last act or two almost miserable on coming out crum said its half an hour before they close lets go on to the pandemonium they took a hansom to travel the hundred yards and seats costing sevenandsix apiece because they were going to stand and walked into the promenade it was in these little things this utter negligence of money that crum had such engaging polish the ballet was on its last legs and night and the traffic of the promenade was suffering for the moment men and women were crowded in three rows against the barrier the whirl and dazzle on the stage the half dark the mingled tobacco fumes and womens scent all that curious lure to promiscuity which belongs to promenades began to free young val from his idealism he looked admiringly in a young womans face saw she was not young and quickly looked away shades of cynthia dark the young womans arm touched his unconsciously there was a scent of musk and mignonette val looked round the corner of his lashes perhaps she was young after all her foot trod on his she begged his pardon he said not at all jolly good ballet isnt it oh im tired of it arent you young val smiled his wide rather charming smile beyond that he did not go not yet convinced the forsyte in him stood out for greater certainty and on the stage the ballet whirled its kaleidoscope of snowwhite salmonpink and emeraldgreen and violet and seemed suddenly to freeze into a stilly spangled pyramid applause broke out and it was over maroon curtains had cut it off the semicircle of men and women round the barrier broke up the young womans arm pressed his a little way off disturbance seemed centring round a man with a pink carnation val stole another glance at the young woman who was looking towards it three men unsteady emerged walking arm in arm the one in the centre wore the pink carnation a white waistcoat a dark moustache he reeled a little as he walked crums voice said slow and level look at that bounder hes screwed val turned to look the bounder had disengaged his arm and was pointing straight at them crums voice level as ever said he seems to know you the bounder spoke hllo he said you fllows look theres my young rascal of a son val saw it was his father he could have sunk into the crimson carpet it was not the meeting in this place not even that his father was screwed it was crums word bounder which as by heavenly revelation he perceived at that moment to be true yes his father looked a bounder with his dark good looks and his pink carnation and his square selfassertive walk and without a word he ducked behind the young woman and slipped out of the promenade he heard the word val behind him and ran down deepcarpeted steps past the chuckersout into the square to be ashamed of his own father is perhaps the bitterest experience a young man can go through it seemed to val hurrying away that his career had ended before it had begun how could he go up to oxford now amongst all those chaps those splendid friends of crums who would know that his father was a bounder and suddenly he hated crum who the devil was crum to say that if crum had been beside him at that moment he would certainly have been jostled off the pavement his own father his own a choke came up in his throat and he dashed his hands down deep into his overcoat pockets damn crum he conceived the wild idea of running back and fending his father taking him by the arm and walking about with him in front of crum but gave it up at once and pursued his way down piccadilly a young woman planted herself before him not so angry darling he shied dodged her and suddenly became quite cool if crum ever said a word he would jolly well punch his head and there would be an end of it he walked a hundred yards or more contented with that thought then lost its comfort utterly it wasnt simple like that he remembered how at school when some parent came down who did not pass the standard it just clung to the fellow afterwards it was one of those things nothing could remove why had his mother married his father if he was a bounder it was bitterly unfair jolly lowdown on a fellow to give him a bounder for father the worst of it was that now crum had spoken the word he realised that he had long known subconsciously that his father was not the clean potato it was the beastliest thing that had ever happened to him beastliest thing that had ever happened to any fellow and downhearted as he had never yet been he came to green street and let himself in with a smuggled latchkey in the diningroom his plovers eggs were set invitingly with some cut bread and butter and a little whisky at the bottom of a decanter just enough as winifred had thought for him to feel himself a man it made him sick to look at them and he went upstairs winifred heard him pass and thought the dear boys in thank goodness if he takes after his father i dont know what i shall do but he wont hes like me dear val chapter iii soames prepares to take steps when soames entered his sisters little louis quinze drawingroom with its small balcony always flowered with hanging geraniums in the summer and now with pots of lilium auratum he was struck by the immutability of human affairs it looked just the same as on his first visit to the newly married darties twentyone years ago he had chosen the furniture himself and so completely that no subsequent purchase had ever been able to change the rooms atmosphere yes he had founded his sister well and she had wanted it indeed it said a great deal for winifred that after all this time with dartie she remained wellfounded from the first soames had nosed out darties nature from underneath the plausibility savoir faire and good looks which had dazzled winifred her mother and even james to the extent of permitting the fellow to marry his daughter without bringing anything but shares of no value into settlement winifred whom he noticed next to the furniture was sitting at her buhl bureau with a letter in her hand she rose and came towards him tall as himself strong in the cheekbones well tailored something in her face disturbed soames she crumpled the letter in her hand but seemed to change her mind and held it out to him he was her lawyer as well as her brother soames read on iseeum club paper these words you will not get chance to insult in my own again i am leaving country tomorrow its played out im tired of being insulted by you youve brought on yourself no selfrespecting man can stand it i shall not ask you for anything again goodbye i took the photograph of the two girls give them my love i dont care what your family say its all their doing im going to live new life md this afterdinner note had a splotch on it not yet quite dry he looked at winifred the splotch had clearly come from her and he checked the words good riddance then it occurred to him that with this letter she was entering that very state which he himself so earnestly desired to quit the state of a forsyte who was not divorced winifred had turned away and was taking a long sniff from a little goldtopped bottle a dull commiseration together with a vague sense of injury crept about soames heart he had come to her to talk of his own position and get sympathy and here was she in the same position wanting of course to talk of it and get sympathy from him it was always like that nobody ever seemed to think that he had troubles and interests of his own he folded up the letter with the splotch inside and said whats it all about now winifred recited the story of the pearls calmly do you think hes really gone soames you see the state he was in when he wrote that soames who when he desired a thing placated providence by pretending that he did not think it likely to happen answered i shouldnt think so i might find out at his club if george is there said winifred he would know george said soames i saw him at his fathers funeral then hes sure to be there soames whose good sense applauded his sisters acumen said grudgingly well ill go round have you said anything in park lane ive told emily returned winifred who retained that chic way of describing her mother father would have a fit indeed anything untoward was now sedulously kept from james with another look round at the furniture as if to gauge his sisters exact position soames went out towards piccadilly the evening was drawing in a touch of chill in the october haze he walked quickly with his close and concentrated air he must get through for he wished to dine in soho on hearing from the hall porter at the iseeum that mr dartie had not been in today he looked at the trusty fellow and decided only to ask if mr george forsyte was in the club he was soames who always looked askance at his cousin george as one inclined to jest at his expense followed the page boy slightly reassured by the thought that george had just lost his father he must have come in for about thirty thousand be sides what he had under that settlement of rogers which had avoided death duty he found george in a bowwindow staring out across a halfeaten plate of muffins his tall bulky black clothed figure loomed almost threatening though preserving still the supernatural neatness of the racing man with a faint grin on his fleshy face he said hallo soames have a muffin no thanks murmured soames and nursing his hat with the desire to say something suitable and sympathetic added hows your mother thanks said george soso havent seen you for ages you never go racing hows the city soames scenting the approach of a jest closed up and answered i wanted to ask you about dartie i hear hes flitted made a bolt to buenos aires with the fair lola good for winifred and the little darties hes a treat soames nodded naturally inimical as these cousins were dartie made them kin uncle jamesll sleep in his bed now resumed george i suppose hes had a lot off you too soames smiled ah you saw him further said george amicably hes a real rouser young val will want a bit of looking after i was always sorry for winifred shes a plucky woman again soames nodded i must be getting back to her he said she just wanted to know for certain we may have to take steps i suppose theres no mistake its quite ok said george it was he who invented so many of those quaint sayings which have been assigned to other sources he was drunk as a lord last night but he went off all right this morning his ships the tuscarora and fishing out a card he read mockingly mr montague dartie poste restante buenos aires i should hurry up with the steps if i were you he fairly fed me up last night yes said soames but its not always easy then conscious from georges eyes that he had roused reminiscence of his own affair he got up and held out his hand george rose too remember me to winifred youll enter her for the divorce stakes straight off if you ask me soames took a sidelong look back at him from the doorway george had seated himself again and was staring before him he looked big and lonely in those black clothes soames had never known him so subdued i suppose he feels it in a way he thought they must have about fifty thousand each all told they ought to keep the estate together if theres a war house property will go down uncle roger was a good judge though and the face of annette rose before him in the darkening street her brown hair and her blue eyes with their dark lashes her fresh lips and cheeks dewy and blooming in spite of london her perfect french figure take steps he thought reentering winifreds house he encountered val and they went in together an idea had occurred to soames his cousin jolyon was irenes trustee the first step would be to go down and see him at robin hill robin hill the odd the very odd feeling those words brought back robin hill the house bosinney had built for him and irene the house they had never lived in the fatal house and jolyon lived there now hm and suddenly he thought they say hes got a boy at oxford why not take young val down and introduce them its an excuse less bald very much less bald so as they went upstairs he said to val youve got a cousin at oxford youve never met him i should like to take you down with me tomorrow to where he lives and introduce you youll find it useful val receiving the idea with but moderate transports soames clinched it ill call for you after lunch its in the country not far youll enjoy it on the threshold of the drawingroom he recalled with an effort that the steps he contemplated concerned winifred at the moment not himself winifred was still sitting at her buhl bureau its quite true he said hes gone to buenos aires started this morning wed better have him shadowed when he lands ill cable at once otherwise we may have a lot of expense the sooner these things are done the better im always regretting that i didnt he stopped and looked sidelong at the silent winifred by the way he went on can you prove cruelty winifred said in a dull voice i dont know what is cruelty well has he struck you or anything winifred shook herself and her jaw grew square he twisted my arm or would pointing a pistol count or being too drunk to undress himself or no i cant bring in the children no said soames no i wonder of course theres legal separation we can get that but separation um what does it mean asked winifred desolately that he cant touch you or you him youre both of you married and unmarried and again he grunted what was it in fact but his own accursed position legalised no he would not put her into that it must be divorce he said decisively failing cruelty theres desertion theres a way of shortening the two years now we get the court to give us restitution of conjugal rights then if he doesnt obey we can bring a suit for divorce in six months time of course you dont want him back but they wont know that still theres the risk that he might come id rather try cruelty winifred shook her head its so beastly well soames murmured perhaps there isnt much risk so long as hes infatuated and got money dont say anything to anybody and dont pay any of his debts winifred sighed in spite of all she had been through the sense of loss was heavy on her and this idea of not paying his debts any more brought it home to her as nothing else yet had some richness seemed to have gone out of life without her husband without her pearls without that intimate sense that she made a brave show above the domestic whirlpool she would now have to face the world she felt bereaved indeed and into the chilly kiss he placed on her forehead soames put more than his usual warmth i have to go down to robin hill tomorrow he said to see young jolyon on business hes got a boy at oxford id like to take val with me and introduce him come down to the shelter for the weekend and bring the children oh by the way no that wont do ive got some other people coming so saying he left her and turned towards soho chapter iv soho of all quarters in the queer adventurous amalgam called london soho is perhaps least suited to the forsyte spirit soho my wild one george would have said if he had seen his cousin going there untidy full of greeks ishmaelites cats italians tomatoes restaurants organs coloured stuffs queer names people looking out of upper windows it dwells remote from the british body politic yet has it haphazard proprietary instincts of its own and a certain possessive prosperity which keeps its rents up when those of other quarters go down for long years soames acquaintanceship with soho had been confined to its western bastion wardour street many bargains had he picked up there even during those seven years at brighton after bosinneys death and irenes flight he had bought treasures there sometimes though he had no place to put them for when the conviction that his wife had gone for good at last became firm within him he had caused a board to be put up in montpellier square for sale the lease of this desirable residence enquire of messrs lesson and tukes court street belgravia it had sold within a week that desirable residence in the shadow of whose perfection a man and a woman had eaten their hearts out of a misty january evening just before the board was taken down soames had gone there once more and stood against the square railings looking at its unlighted windows chewing the cud of possessive memories which had turned so bitter in the mouth why had she never loved him why she had been given all she had wanted and in return had given him for three long years all he had wanted except indeed her heart he had uttered a little involuntary groan and a passing policeman had glanced suspiciously at him who no longer possessed the right to enter that green door with the carved brass knocker beneath the board for sale a choking sensation had attacked his throat and he had hurried away into the mist that evening he had gone to brighton to live approaching malta street soho and the restaurant bretagne where annette would be drooping her pretty shoulders over her accounts soames thought with wonder of those seven years at brighton how had he managed to go on so long in that town devoid of the scent of sweetpeas where he had not even space to put his treasures true those had been years with no time at all for looking at them years of almost passionate moneymaking during which forsyte bustard and forsyte had become solicitors to more limited companies than they could properly attend to up to the city of a morning in a pullman car down from the city of an evening in a pullman car law papers again after dinner then the sleep of the tired and up again next morning saturday to monday was spent at his club in town curious reversal of customary procedure based on the deep and careful instinct that while working so hard he needed sea air to and from the station twice a day and while resting must indulge his domestic affections the sunday visit to his family in park lane to timothys and to green street the occasional visits elsewhere had seemed to him as necessary to health as sea air on weekdays even since his migration to mapledurham he had main tained those habits until he had known annette whether annette had produced the revolution in his outlook or that outlook had produced annette he knew no more than we know where a circle begins it was intricate and deeply involved with the growing consciousness that property without anyone to leave it to is the negation of true forsyteism to have an heir some continuance of self who would begin where he left off ensure in fact that he would not leave off had quite obsessed him for the last year and more after buying a bit of wedgwood one evening in april he had dropped into malta street to look at a house of his fathers which had been turned into a restaurant a risky pro ceeding and one not quite in accordance with the terms of the lease he had stared for a little at the outside painted a good cream colour with two peacockblue tubs containing little bay trees in a recessed doorway and at the words restaurant bretagne above them in gold letters rather favourably impressed entering he had noticed that several people were already seated at little round green tables with little pots of fresh flowers on them and brittanyware plates and had asked of a trim waitress to see the proprietor they had shown him into a back room where a girl was sitting at a simple bureau covered with papers and a small round table was laid for two the impression of cleanliness order and good taste was confirmed when the girl got up saying you wish to see maman monsieur in a broken accent yes soames had answered i represent your landlord in fact im his son wont you sit down sir please tell maman to come to this gentleman he was pleased that the girl seemed impressed because it showed business instinct and suddenly he noticed that she was remarkably pretty so remarkably pretty that his eyes found a difficulty in leaving her face when she moved to put a chair for him she swayed in a curious subtle way as if she had been put together by someone with a special secret skill and her face and neck which was a little bared looked as fresh as if they had been sprayed with dew probably at this moment soames decided that the lease had not been violated though to himself and his father he based the decision on the efficiency of those illicit adaptations in the building on the signs of prosperity and the obvious business capacity of madame lamotte he did not however neglect to leave certain matters to future consideration which had necessitated further visits so that the little back room had become quite accustomed to his spare not unsolid but unobtrusive figure and his pale chinny face with clipped moustache and dark hair not yet grizzling at the sides un monsieur tres distingue madame lamotte found him and presently tres amical tres gentil watching his eyes upon her daughter she was one of those generously built finefaced darkhaired frenchwomen whose every action and tone of voice inspire perfect confidence in the thoroughness of their domestic tastes their knowledge of cooking and the careful increase of their bank balances after those visits to the restaurant bretagne began other visits ceased without indeed any definite decision for soames like all forsytes and the great majority of their countrymen was a born empiricist but it was this change in his mode of life which had gradually made him so definitely conscious that he desired to alter his condition from that of the unmarried married man to that of the married man remarried turning into malta street on this evening of early october he bought a paper to see if there were any afterdevelopment of the dreyfus case a question which he had always found useful in making closer acquaintanceship with madame lamotte and her daughter who were catholic and antidreyfusard scanning those columns soames found nothing french but noticed a general fall on the stock exchange and an ominous leader about the transvaal he entered thinking wars a certainty i shall sell my consols not that he had many personally the rate of interest was too wretched but he should advise his companies consols would assuredly go down a look as he passed the doorways of the restaurant assured him that business was good as ever and this which in april would have pleased him now gave him a certain uneasiness if the steps which he had to take ended in his marrying annette he would rather see her mother safely back in france a move to which the prosperity of the restaurant bretagne might become an obstacle he would have to buy them out of course for french people only came to england to make money and it would mean a higher price and then that peculiar sweet sensation at the back of his throat and a slight thumping about the heart which he always experienced at the door of the little room prevented his thinking how much it would cost going in he was conscious of an abundant black skirt vanishing through the door into the restaurant and of annette with her hands up to her hair it was the attitude in which of all others he admired her so beautifully straight and rounded and supple and he said i just came in to talk to your mother about pulling down that partition no dont call her monsieur will have supper with us it will be ready in ten minutes soames who still held her hand was overcome by an impulse which surprised him you look so pretty tonight he said so very pretty do you know how pretty you look annette annette withdrew her hand and blushed monsieur is very good not a bit good said soames and sat down gloomily annette made a little expressive gesture with her hands a smile was crinkling her red lips untouched by salve and looking at those lips soames said are you happy over here or do you want to go back to france oh i like london paris of course but london is better than orleans and the english country is so beautiful i have been to richmond last sunday soames went through a moment of calculating struggle mapledurham dared he after all dared he go so far as that and show her what there was to look forward to still down there one could say things in this room it was impossible i want you and your mother he said suddenly to come for the afternoon next sunday my house is on the river its not too late in this weather and i can show you some good pictures what do you say annette clasped her hands it will be lovelee the river is so beautiful thats understood then ill ask madame he need say no more to her this evening and risk giving himself away but had he not already said too much did one ask restaurant proprietors with pretty daughters down to ones country house without design madame lamotte would see if annette didnt well there was not much that madame did not see besides this was the second time he had stayed to supper with them he owed them hospitality walking home towards park lane for he was staying at his fathers with the impression of annettes soft clever hand within his own his thoughts were pleasant slightly sensual rather puzzled take steps what steps how dirty linen washed in public pah with his reputation for sagacity for farsightedness and the clever extrication of others he who stood for proprietary interests to become the plaything of that law of which he was a pillar there was something revolting in the thought winifreds affair was bad enough to have a double dose of publicity in the family would not a liaison be better than that a liaison and a son he could adopt but dark solid watchful madame lamotte blocked the avenue of that vision no that would not work it was not as if annette could have a real passion for him one could not expect that at his age if her mother wished if the worldly advantage were manifestly great perhaps if not refusal would be certain besides he thought im not a villain i dont want to hurt her and i dont want anything underhand but i do want her and i want a son theres nothing for it but divorce somehow anyhow divorce under the shadow of the planetrees in the lamplight he passed slowly along the railings of the green park mist clung there among the bluish tree shapes beyond range of the lamps how many hundred times he had walked past those trees from his fathers house in park lane when he was quite a young man or from his own house in montpellier square in those four years of married life and tonight making up his mind to free himself if he could of that long useless marriage tie he took a fancy to walk on in at hyde park corner out at knightsbridge gate just as he used to when going home to irene in the old days what could she be like now how had she passed the years since he last saw her twelve years in all seven already since uncle jolyon left her that money was she still beautiful would he know her if he saw her ive not changed much he thought i expect she has she made me suffer he remembered suddenly one night the first on which he went out to dinner alone an old malburian dinner the first year of their marriage with what eagerness he had hurried back and entering softly as a cat had heard her playing opening the drawingroom door noiselessly he had stood watching the expression on her face different from any he knew so much more open so confiding as though to her music she was giving a heart he had never seen and he remembered how she stopped and looked round how her face changed back to that which he did know and what an icy shiver had gone through him for all that the next moment he was fondling her shoulders yes she had made him suffer divorce it seemed ridiculous after all these years of utter separation but it would have to be no other way the question he thought with sudden realism is which of us she or me she deserted me she ought to pay for it therell be someone i suppose involuntarily he uttered a little snarling sound and turning made his way back to park lane chapter v james sees visions the butler himself opened the door and closing it softly detained soames on the inner mat the masters poorly sir he murmured he wouldnt go to bed till you came in hes still in the diningroom soames responded in the hushed tone to which the house was now accustomed whats the matter with him warmson nervous sir i think might be the funeral might be mrs darties comin round this afternoon i think he overheard something ive took him in a negus the mistress has just gone up soames hung his hat on a mahogany stagshorn all right warmson you can go to bed ill take him up myself and he passed into the diningroom james was sitting before the fire in a big armchair with a camelhair shawl very light and warm over his frockcoated shoulders on to which his long white whiskers drooped his white hair still fairly thick glistened in the lamplight a little moisture from his fixed lightgrey eyes stained the cheeks still quite well coloured and the long deep furrows running to the corners of the cleanshaven lips which moved as if mumbling thoughts his long legs thin as a crows in shepherds plaid trousers were bent at less than a right angle and on one knee a spindly hand moved continually with fingers wide apart and glistening tapered nails beside him on a low stool stood a halffinished glass of negus bedewed with beads of heat there he had been sitting with intervals for meals all day at eighty eight he was still organically sound but suffering terribly from the thought that no one ever told him anything it is indeed doubtful how he had become aware that roger was being buried that day for emily had kept it from him she was always keeping things from him emily was only seventy james had a grudge against his wifes youth he felt sometimes that he would never have married her if he had known that she would have so many years before her when he had so few it was not natural she would live fifteen or twenty years after he was gone and might spend a lot of money she had always had extravagant tastes for all he knew she might want to buy one of these motorcars cicely and rachel and imogen and all the young people they all rode those bicycles now and went off goodness knew where and now roger was gone he didnt know couldnt tell the family was breaking up soames would know how much his uncle had left curiously he thought of roger as soames uncle not as his own brother soames it was more and more the one solid spot in a vanishing world soames was careful he was a warm man but he had no one to leave his money to there it was he didnt know and there was that fellow chamberlain for james political principles had been fixed between and when that rascally radical had been the chief thorn in the side of property and he distrusted him to this day in spite of his conversion he would get the country into a mess and make money go down before he had done with it a stormy petrel of a chap where was soames he had gone to the funeral of course which they had tried to keep from him he knew that perfectly well he had seen his sons trousers roger roger in his coffin he remembered how when they came up from school together from the west on the box seat of the old slowflyer in roger had got into the boot and gone to sleep james uttered a thin cackle a funny fellow roger an original he didnt know younger than himself and in his coffin the family was breaking up there was val going to the university he never came to see him now he would cost a pretty penny up there it was an extravagant age and all the pretty pennies that his four grandchildren would cost him danced before james eyes he did not grudge them the money but he grudged terribly the risk which the spending of that money might bring on them he grudged the diminution of security and now that cicely had married she might be having children too he didnt know couldnt tell nobody thought of anything but spending money in these days and racing about and having what they called a good time a motorcar went past the window ugly great lumbering thing making all that racket but there it was the country rattling to the dogs people in such a hurry that they couldnt even care for style a neat turnout like his barouche and bays was worth all those newfangled things and consols at there must be a lot of money in the country and now there was this old kruger they had tried to keep old kruger from him but he knew better there would be a pretty kettle of fish out there he had known how it would be when that fellow gladstone dead now thank god made such a mess of it after that dreadful business at majuba he shouldnt wonder if the empire split up and went to pot and this vision of the empire going to pot filled a full quarter of an hour with qualms of the most serious character he had eaten a poor lunch because of them but it was after lunch that the real disaster to his nerves occurred he had been dozing when he became aware of voices low voices ah they never told him anything winifreds and her mothers monty that fellow dartie always that fellow dartie the voices had receded and james had been left alone with his ears standing up like a hares and fear creeping about his inwards why did they leave him alone why didnt they come and tell him and an awful thought which through long years had haunted him concreted again swiftly in his brain dartie had gone bankrupt fraudulently bankrupt and to save winifred and the children he james would have to pay could he could soames turn him into a limited company no he couldnt there it was with every minute before emily came back the spectre fiercened why it might be forgery with eyes fixed on the doubted turner in the centre of the wall james suffered tortures he saw dartie in the dock his grandchildren in the gutter and himself in bed he saw the doubted turner being sold at jobsons and all the majestic edifice of property in rags he saw in fancy winifred unfashionably dressed and heard in fancy emilys voice saying now dont fuss james she was always saying dont fuss she had no nerves he ought never to have married a woman eighteen years younger than himself then emilys real voice said have you had a nice nap james nap he was in torment and she asked him that whats this about dartie he said and his eyes glared at her emilys selfpossession never deserted her what have you been hearing she asked blandly whats this about dartie repeated james hes gone bankrupt fiddle james made a great effort and rose to the full height of his storklike figure you never tell me anything he said hes gone bankrupt the destruction of that fixed idea seemed to emily all that mattered at the moment he has not she answered firmly hes gone to buenos aires if she had said hes gone to mars she could not have dealt james a more stunning blow his imagination invested entirely in british securities could as little grasp one place as the other whats he gone there for he said hes got no money what did he take agitated within by winifreds news and goaded by the constant reiteration of this jeremiad emily said calmly he took winifreds pearls and a dancer what said james and sat down his sudden collapse alarmed her and smoothing his forehead she said now dont fuss james a dusky red had spread over james cheeks and forehead i paid for them he said tremblingly hes a thief i i knew how it would be hell be the death of me he words failed him and he sat quite still emily who thought she knew him so well was alarmed and went towards the sideboard where she kept some sal volatile she could not see the tenacious forsyte spirit working in that thin tremulous shape against the extravagance of the emotion called up by this outrage on forsyte principles the forsyte spirit deep in there saying you mustnt get into a fantod itll never do you wont digest your lunch youll have a fit all unseen by her it was doing better work in james than sal volatile drink this she said james waved it aside what was winifred about he said to let him take her pearls emily perceived the crisis past she can have mine she said comfortably i never wear them shed better get a divorce there you go said james divorce weve never had a divorce in the family wheres soames hell be in directly no he wont said james almost fiercely hes at the funeral you think i know nothing well said emily with calm you shouldnt get into such fusses when we tell you things and plumping up his cushions and putting the sal volatile beside him she left the room but james sat there seeing visions of winifred in the divorce court and the family name in the papers of the earth falling on rogers coffin of val taking after his father of the pearls he had paid for and would never see again of money back at four per cent and the country going to the dogs and as the afternoon wore into evening and teatime passed and dinnertime those visions became more and more mixed and menacing of being told nothing till he had nothing left of all his wealth and they told him nothing of it where was soames why didnt he come in his hand grasped the glass of negus he raised it to drink and saw his son standing there looking at him a little sigh of relief escaped his lips and putting the glass down he said there you are darties gone to buenos aires soames nodded thats all right he said good riddance a wave of assuagement passed over james brain soames knew soames was the only one of them all who had sense why couldnt he come and live at home he had no son of his own and he said plaintively at my age i get nervous i wish you were more at home my boy again soames nodded the mask of his countenance betrayed no understanding but he went closer and as if by accident touched his fathers shoulder they sent their love to you at timothys he said it went off all right ive been to see winifred im going to take steps and he thought yes and you mustnt hear of them james looked up his long white whiskers quivered his thin throat between the points of his collar looked very gristly and naked ive been very poorly all day he said they never tell me anything soames heart twitched well its all right theres nothing to worry about will you come up now and he put his hand under his fathers arm james obediently and tremulously raised himself and together they went slowly across the room which had a rich look in the firelight and out to the stairs very slowly they ascended goodnight my boy said james at his bedroom door goodnight father answered soames his hand stroked down the sleeve beneath the shawl it seemed to have almost nothing in it so thin was the arm and turning away from the light in the opening doorway he went up the extra flight to his own bedroom i want a son he thought sitting on the edge of his bed i want a son chapter vi nolongeryoung jolyon at home trees take little account of time and the old oak on the upper lawn at robin hill looked no day older than when bosinney sprawled under it and said to soames forsyte ive found the very place for your house since then swithin had dreamed and old jolyon died beneath its branches and now close to the swing nolongeryoung jolyon often painted there of all spots in the world it was perhaps the most sacred to him for he had loved his father contemplating its great girth crinkled and a little mossed but not yet hollow he would speculate on the passage of time that tree had seen perhaps all real english history it dated he shouldnt wonder from the days of elizabeth at least his own fifty years were as nothing to its wood when the house behind it which he now owned was three hundred years of age instead of twelve that tree might still be standing there vast and hollow for who would commit such sacrilege as to cut it down a forsyte might perhaps still be living in that house to guard it jealously and jolyon would wonder what the house would look like coated with such age wistaria was already about its walls the new look had gone would it hold its own and keep the dignity bosinney had bestowed on it or would the giant london have lapped it round and made it into an asylum in the midst of a jerrybuilt wilderness often within and without of it he was persuaded that bosinney had been moved by the spirit when he built he had put his heart into that house indeed it might even become one of the homes of england a rare achievement for a house in these degenerate days of building and the aesthetic spirit moving hand in hand with his forsyte sense of possessive continuity dwelt with pride and pleasure on his ownership thereof there was the smack of reverence and ancestorworship if only for one ancestor in his desire to hand this house down to his son and his sons son his father had loved the house had loved the view the grounds that tree his last years had been happy there and no one had lived there before him these last eleven years at robin hill had formed in jolyons life as a painter the important period of success he was now in the very van of watercolour art hanging on the line everywhere his drawings fetched high prices specialising in that one medium with the tenacity of his breed he had arrived rather late but not too late for a member of the family which made a point of living for ever his art had really deepened and improved in conformity with his position he had grown a short fair beard which was just beginning to grizzle and hid his forsyte chin his brown face had lost the warped expression of his ostracised period he looked if anything younger the loss of his wife in had been one of those domestic tragedies which turn out in the end for the good of all he had indeed loved her to the last for his was an affectionate spirit but she had become increasingly difficult jealous of her stepdaughter june jealous even of her own little daughter holly and making ceaseless plaint that he could not love her ill as she was and useless to everyone and better dead he had mourned her sincerely but his face had looked younger since she died if she could only have believed that she made him happy how much happier would the twenty years of their companionship have been june had never really got on well with her who had reprehensibly taken her own mothers place and ever since old jolyon died she had been established in a sort of studio in london but she had come back to robin hill on her stepmothers death and gathered the reins there into her small decided hands jolly was then at harrow holly still learning from mademoiselle beauce there had been nothing to keep jolyon at home and he had removed his grief and his paintbox abroad there he had wandered for the most part in brittany and at last had fetched up in paris he had stayed there several months and come back with the younger face and the short fair beard essentially a man who merely lodged in any house it had suited him perfectly that june should reign at robin hill so that he was free to go off with his easel where and when he liked she was inclined it is true to regard the house rather as an asylum for her proteges but his own outcast days had filled jolyon for ever with sympathy towards an outcast and junes lame ducks about the place did not annoy him by all means let her have them down and feed them up and though his slightly cynical humour perceived that they ministered to his daughters love of domination as well as moved her warm heart he never ceased to admire her for having so many ducks he fell indeed year by year into a more and more detached and brotherly attitude towards his own son and daughters treating them with a sort of whimsical equality when he went down to harrow to see jolly he never quite knew which of them was the elder and would sit eating cherries with him out of one paper bag with an affectionate and ironical smile twisting up an eyebrow and curling his lips a little and he was always careful to have money in his pocket and to be modish in his dress so that his son need not blush for him they were perfect friends but never seemed to have occasion for verbal confidences both having the competitive selfconsciousness of forsytes they knew they would stand by each other in scrapes but there was no need to talk about it jolyon had a striking horror partly original sin but partly the result of his early immorality of the moral attitude the most he could ever have said to his son would have been look here old man dont forget youre a gentleman and then have wondered whimsically whether that was not a snobbish sentiment the great cricket match was perhaps the most searching and awkward time they annually went through together for jolyon had been at eton they would be particularly careful during that match continually saying hooray oh hard luck old man or hooray oh bad luck dad to each other when some disaster at which their hearts bounded happened to the opposing school and jolyon would wear a grey top hat instead of his usual soft one to save his sons feelings for a black top hat he could not stomach when jolly went up to oxford jolyon went up with him amused humble and a little anxious not to discredit his boy amongst all these youths who seemed so much more assured and old than himself he often thought glad im a painter for he had long dropped underwriting at lloyds its so innocuous you cant look down on a painter you cant take him seriously enough for jolly who had a sort of natural lordliness had passed at once into a very small set who secretly amused his father the boy had fair hair which curled a little and his grandfathers deepset irongrey eyes he was wellbuilt and very upright and always pleased jolyons aesthetic sense so that he was a tiny bit afraid of him as artists ever are of those of their own sex whom they admire physically on that occasion however he actually did screw up his courage to give his son advice and this was it look here old man youre bound to get into debt mind you come to me at once of course ill always pay them but you might remember that one respects oneself more afterwards if one pays ones own way and dont ever borrow except from me will you and jolly had said all right dad i wont and he never had and theres just one other thing i dont know much about morality and that but there is this its always worth while before you do anything to consider whether its going to hurt another person more than is absolutely necessary jolly had looked thoughtful and nodded and presently had squeezed his fathers hand and jolyon had thought i wonder if i had the right to say that he always had a sort of dread of losing the dumb confidence they had in each other remembering how for long years he had lost his own fathers so that there had been nothing between them but love at a great distance he underestimated no doubt the change in the spirit of the age since he himself went up to cambridge in and perhaps he underestimated too his boys power of understanding that he was tolerant to the very bone it was that tolerance of his and possibly his scepticism which ever made his relations towards june so queerly defensive she was such a decided mortal knew her own mind so terribly well wanted things so inexorably until she got them and then indeed often dropped them like a hot potato her mother had been like that whence had come all those tears not that his incompatibility with his daughter was anything like what it had been with the first mrs young jolyon one could be amused where a daughter was concerned in a wifes case one could not be amused to see june set her heart and jaw on a thing until she got it was all right because it was never anything which interfered fundamentally with jolyons liberty the one thing on which his jaw was also absolutely rigid a considerable jaw under that short grizzling beard nor was there ever any necessity for real hearttoheart encounters one could break away into irony as indeed he often had to but the real trouble with june was that she had never appealed to his aesthetic sense though she might well have with her redgold hair and her vikingcoloured eyes and that touch of the berserker in her spirit it was very different with holly soft and quiet shy and affectionate with a playful imp in her somewhere he watched this younger daughter of his through the duckling stage with extraordinary interest would she come out a swan with her sallow oval face and her grey wistful eyes and those long dark lashes she might or she might not only this last year had he been able to guess yes she would be a swan rather a dark one always a shy one but an authentic swan she was eighteen now and mademoiselle beauce was gone the excellent lady had removed after eleven years haunted by her continuous reminiscences of the well brrred little tayleurs to another family whose bosom would now be agitated by her reminiscences of the wellbrrred little forsytes she had taught holly to speak french like herself portraiture was not jolyons forte but he had already drawn his younger daughter three times and was drawing her a fourth on the afternoon of october th when a card was brought to him which caused his eyebrows to go up mr soames forsyte the shelter connoisseurs club mapledurham st jamess but here the forsyte saga must digress again to return from a long travel in spain to a darkened house to a little daughter bewildered with tears to the sight of a loved father lying peaceful in his last sleep had never been was never likely to be forgotten by so impressionable and warmhearted a man as jolyon a sense as of mystery too clung to that sad day and about the end of one whose life had been so wellordered balanced and aboveboard it seemed incredible that his father could thus have vanished without as it were announcing his intention without last words to his son and due farewells and those incoherent allusions of little holly to the lady in grey of mademoiselle beauce to a madame errant as it sounded involved all things in a mist lifted a little when he read his fathers will and the codicil thereto it had been his duty as executor of that will and codicil to inform irene wife of his cousin soames of her life interest in fifteen thousand pounds he had called on her to explain that the existing investment in india stock earmarked to meet the charge would produce for her the interesting net sum of l odd a year clear of income tax this was but the third time he had seen his cousin soames wife if indeed she was still his wife of which he was not quite sure he remembered having seen her sitting in the botanical gardens waiting for bosinney a passive fascinating figure reminding him of titians heavenly love and again when charged by his father he had gone to montpellier square on the afternoon when bosinneys death was known he still recalled vividly her sudden appearance in the drawingroom doorway on that occasion her beautiful face passing from wild eagerness of hope to stony despair remembered the compassion he had felt soames snarling smile his words we are not at home and the slam of the front door this third time he saw a face and form more beautiful freed from that warp of wild hope and despair looking at her he thought yes you are just what the dad would have admired and the strange story of his fathers indian summer became slowly clear to him she spoke of old jolyon with reverence and tears in her eyes he was so wonderfully kind to me i dont know why he looked so beautiful and peaceful sitting in that chair under the tree it was i who first came on him sitting there you know such a lovely day i dont think an end could have been happier we should all like to go out like that quite right he had thought we should all a like to go out in full summer with beauty stepping towards us across a lawn and looking round the little almost empty drawingroom he had asked her what she was going to do now i am going to live again a little cousin jolyon its wonderful to have money of ones own ive never had any i shall keep this flat i think im used to it but i shall be able to go to italy exactly jolyon had murmured looking at her faintly smiling lips and he had gone away thinking a fascinating woman what a waste im glad the dad left her that money he had not seen her again but every quarter he had signed her cheque forwarding it to her bank with a note to the chelsea flat to say that he had done so and always he had received a note in acknowledgment generally from the flat but sometimes from italy so that her personality had become embodied in slightly scented grey paper an upright fine handwriting and the words dear cousin jolyon man of property that he now was the slender cheque he signed often gave rise to the thought well i suppose she just manages sliding into a vague wonder how she was faring otherwise in a world of men not wont to let beauty go unpossessed at first holly had spoken of her sometimes but ladies in grey soon fade from childrens memories and the tightening of junes lips in those first weeks after her grandfathers death whenever her former friends name was mentioned had discouraged allusion only once indeed had june spoken definitely ive forgiven her im frightfully glad shes independent now on receiving soames card jolyon said to the maid for he could not abide butlers show him into the study please and say ill be there in a minute and then he looked at holly and asked do you remember the lady in grey who used to give you music lessons oh yes why has she come jolyon shook his head and changing his holland blouse for a coat was silent perceiving suddenly that such history was not for those young ears his face in fact became whimsical perplexity incarnate while he journeyed towards the study standing by the frenchwindow looking out across the terrace at the oak tree were two figures middleaged and young and he thought whos that boy surely they never had a child the elder figure turned the meeting of those two forsytes of the second generation so much more sophisticated than the first in the house built for the one and owned and occupied by the other was marked by subtle defensiveness beneath distinct attempt at cordiality has he come about his wife jolyon was thinking and soames how shall i begin while val brought to break the ice stood negligently scrutinising this bearded pard from under his dark thick eyelashes this is val dartie said soames my sisters son hes just going up to oxford i thought id like him to know your boy ah im sorry jollys away what college bnc replied val jollys at the house but hell be delighted to look you up thanks awfully hollys in if you could put up with a female relation shed show you round youll find her in the hall if you go through the curtains i was just painting her with another thanks awfully val vanished leaving the two cousins with the ice unbroken i see youve some drawings at the water colours said soames jolyon winced he had been out of touch with the forsyte family at large for twentysix years but they were connected in his mind with friths derby day and landseer prints he had heard from june that soames was a connoisseur which made it worse he had become aware too of a curious sensation of repugnance i havent seen you for a long time he said no answered soames between close lips not since as a matter of fact its about that ive come youre her trustee im told jolyon nodded twelve years is a long time said soames rapidly i im tired of it jolyon found no more appropriate answer than wont you smoke no thanks jolyon himself lit a cigarette i wish to be free said soames abruptly i dont see her murmured jolyon through the fume of his cigarette but you know where she lives i suppose jolyon nodded he did not mean to give her address without permission soames seemed to divine his thought i dont want her address he said i know it what exactly do you want she deserted me i want a divorce rather late in the day isnt it yes said soames and there was a silence i dont know much about these things at least ive forgotten said jolyon with a wry smile he himself had had to wait for death to grant him a divorce from the first mrs jolyon do you wish me to see her about it soames raised his eyes to his cousins face i suppose theres someone he said a shrug moved jolyons shoulders i dont know at all i imagine you may have both lived as if the other were dead its usual in these cases soames turned to the window a few early fallen oakleaves strewed the terrace already and were rolling round in the wind jolyon saw the figures of holly and val dartie moving across the lawn towards the stables im not going to run with the hare and hunt with the hounds he thought i must act for her the dad would have wished that and for a swift moment he seemed to see his fathers figure in the old armchair just beyond soames sitting with knees crossed the times in his hand it vanished my father was fond of her he said quietly why he should have been i dont know soames answered without looking round she brought trouble to your daughter june she brought trouble to everyone i gave her all she wanted i would have given her even forgiveness but she chose to leave me in jolyon compassion was checked by the tone of that close voice what was there in the fellow that made it so difficult to be sorry for him i can go and see her if you like he said i suppose she might be glad of a divorce but i know nothing soames nodded yes please go as i say i know her address but ive no wish to see her his tongue was busy with his lips as if they were very dry youll have some tea said jolyon stifling the words and see the house and he led the way into the hall when he had rung the bell and ordered tea he went to his easel to turn his drawing to the wall he could not bear somehow that his work should be seen by soames who was standing there in the middle of the great room which had been designed expressly to afford wall space for his own pictures in his cousins face with its unseizable family likeness to himself and its chinny narrow concentrated look jolyon saw that which moved him to the thought that chap could never forget anything nor ever give himself away hes pathetic chapter vii the colt and the filly when young val left the presence of the last generation he was thinking this is jolly dull uncle soames does take the bun i wonder what this fillys like he anticipated no pleasure from her society and suddenly he saw her standing there looking at him why she was pretty what luck im afraid you dont know me he said my names val dartie im once removed second cousin something like that you know my mothers name was forsyte holly whose slim brown hand remained in his because she was too shy to withdraw it said i dont know any of my relations are there many tons theyre awful most of them at least i dont know some of them ones relations always are arent they i expect they think one awful too said holly i dont know why they should no one could think you awful of course holly looked at him the wistful candour in those grey eyes gave young val a sudden feeling that he must protect her i mean there are people and people he added astutely your dad looks awfully decent for instance oh yes said holly fervently he is a flush mounted in vals cheeks that scene in the pandemonium promenade the dark man with the pink carnation developing into his own father but you know what the forsytes are he said almost viciously oh i forgot you dont what are they oh fearfully careful not sportsmen a bit look at uncle soames id like to said holly val resisted a desire to run his arm through hers oh no he said lets go out youll see him quite soon enough whats your brother like holly led the way on to the terrace and down to the lawn without answering how describe jolly who ever since she remembered anything had been her lord master and ideal does he sit on you said val shrewdly i shall be knowing him at oxford have you got any horses holly nodded would you like to see the stables rather they passed under the oak tree through a thin shrubbery into the stableyard there under a clocktower lay a fluffy brownand white dog so old that he did not get up but faintly waved the tail curled over his back thats balthasar said holly hes so old awfully old nearly as old as i am poor old boy hes devoted to dad balthasar thats a rum name he isnt purebred you know no but hes a darling and she bent down to stroke the dog gentle and supple with dark covered head and slim browned neck and hands she seemed to val strange and sweet like a thing slipped between him and all previous knowledge when grandfather died she said he wouldnt eat for two days he saw him die you know was that old uncle jolyon mother always says he was a topper he was said holly simply and opened the stable door in a loosebox stood a silver roan of about fifteen hands with a long black tail and mane this is mine fairy ah said val shes a jolly palfrey but you ought to bang her tail shed look much smarter then catching her wondering look he thought suddenly i dont know anything she likes and he took a long sniff of the stable air horses are ripping arent they my dad he stopped yes said holly an impulse to unbosom himself almost overcame him but not quite oh i dont know hes often gone a mucker over them im jolly keen on them too riding and hunting i like racing awfully as well i should like to be a gentleman rider and oblivious of the fact that he had but one more day in town with two engagements he plumped out i say if i hire a gee tomorrow will you come a ride in richmond park holly clasped her hands oh yes i simply love riding but theres jollys horse why dont you ride him here he is we could go after tea val looked doubtfully at his trousered legs he had imagined them immaculate before her eyes in high brown boots and bedford cords i dont much like riding his horse he said he mightnt like it besides uncle soames wants to get back i expect not that i believe in buckling under to him you know you havent got an uncle have you this is rather a good beast he added scrutinising jollys horse a dark brown which was showing the whites of its eyes you havent got any hunting here i suppose no i dont know that i want to hunt it must be awfully exciting of course but its cruel isnt it june says so cruel ejaculated val oh thats all rot whos june my sister my halfsister you know much older than me she had put her hands up to both cheeks of jollys horse and was rubbing her nose against its nose with a gentle snuffling noise which seemed to have an hypnotic effect on the animal val contemplated her cheek resting against the horses nose and her eyes gleaming round at him shes really a duck he thought they returned to the house less talkative followed this time by the dog balthasar walking more slowly than anything on earth and clearly expecting them not to exceed his speed limit this is a ripping place said val from under the oak tree where they had paused to allow the dog balthasar to come up yes said holly and sighed of course i want to go everywhere i wish i were a gipsy yes gipsies are jolly replied val with a conviction which had just come to him youre rather like one you know hollys face shone suddenly and deeply like dark leaves gilded by the sun to go madrabbiting everywhere and see everything and live in the open oh wouldnt it be fun lets do it said val oh yes lets itd be grand sport just you and i then holly perceived the quaintness and gushed well weve got to do it said val obstinately but reddening too i believe in doing things you want to do whats down there the kitchengarden and the pond and the coppice and the farm lets go down holly glanced back at the house its teatime i expect theres dad beckoning val uttering a growly sound followed her towards the house when they reentered the hall gallery the sight of two middleaged forsytes drinking tea together had its magical effect and they became quite silent it was indeed an impressive spectacle the two were seated side by side on an arrangement in marqueterie which looked like three silvery pink chairs made one with a low teatable in front of them they seemed to have taken up that position as far apart as the seat would permit so that they need not look at each other too much and they were eating and drinking rather than talking soames with his air of despising the teacake as it disappeared jolyon of finding himself slightly amusing to the casual eye neither would have seemed greedy but both were getting through a good deal of sustenance the two young ones having been supplied with food the process went on silent and absorbative till with the advent of cigarettes jolyon said to soames and hows uncle james thanks very shaky were a wonderful family arent we the other day i was calculating the average age of the ten old forsytes from my fathers family bible i make it eightyfour already and five still living they ought to beat the record and looking whimsically at soames he added we arent the men they were you know soames smiled do you really think i shall admit that im not their equal he seemed to be saying or that ive got to give up anything especially life we may live to their age perhaps pursued jolyon but self consciousness is a handicap you know and thats the difference between us weve lost conviction how and when selfconsciousness was born i never can make out my father had a little but i dont believe any other of the old forsytes ever had a scrap never to see yourself as others see you its a wonderful preservative the whole history of the last century is in the difference between us and between us and you he added gazing through a ring of smoke at val and holly uncomfortable under his quizzical regard therell be another difference i wonder what soames took out his watch we must go he said if were to catch our train uncle soames never misses a train muttered val with his mouth full why should i soames answered simply oh i dont know grumbled val other people do at the front door he gave hollys slim brown hand a long and surreptitious squeeze look out for me tomorrow he whispered three oclock ill wait for you in the road itll save time well have a ripping ride he gazed back at her from the lodge gate and but for the principles of a man about town would have waved his hand he felt in no mood to tolerate his uncles conversation but he was not in danger soames preserved a perfect muteness busy with faraway thoughts the yellow leaves came down about those two walking the mile and a half which soames had traversed so often in those longago days when he came down to watch with secret pride the building of the house that house which was to have been the home of him and her from whom he was now going to seek release he looked back once up that endless vista of autumn lane between the yellowing hedges what an age ago i dont want to see her he had said to jolyon was that true i may have to he thought and he shivered seized by one of those queer shudderings that they say mean footsteps on ones grave a chilly world a queer world and glancing sidelong at his nephew he thought wish i were his age i wonder what shes like now chapter viii jolyon prosecutes trusteeship when those two were gone jolyon did not return to his painting for daylight was failing but went to the study craving unconsciously a revival of that momentary vision of his father sitting in the old leather chair with his knees crossed and his straight eyes gazing up from under the dome of his massive brow often in this little room cosiest in the house jolyon would catch a moment of communion with his father not indeed that he had definitely any faith in the persistence of the human spirit the feeling was not so logical it was rather an atmospheric impact like a scent or one of those strong animistic impressions from forms or effects of light to which those with the artists eye are especially prone here only in this little unchanged room where his father had spent the most of his waking hours could be retrieved the feeling that he was not quite gone that the steady counsel of that old spirit and the warmth of his masterful lovability endured what would his father be advising now in this sudden recrudescence of an old tragedy what would he say to this menace against her to whom he had taken such a fancy in the last weeks of his life i must do my best for her thought jolyon he left her to me in his will but what is the best and as if seeking to regain the sapience the balance and shrewd common sense of that old forsyte he sat down in the ancient chair and crossed his knees but he felt a mere shadow sitting there nor did any inspiration come while the fingers of the wind tapped on the darkening panes of the frenchwindow go and see her he thought or ask her to come down here whats her life been what is it now i wonder beastly to rake up things at this time of day again the figure of his cousin standing with a hand on a front door of a fine olivegreen leaped out vivid like one of those figures from oldfashioned clocks when the hour strikes and his words sounded in jolyons ears clearer than any chime i manage my own affairs ive told you once i tell you again we are not at home the repugnance he had then felt for soames for his flatcheeked shaven face full of spiritual bulldoggedness for his spare square sleek figure slightly crouched as it were over the bone he could not digest came now again fresh as ever nay with an odd increase i dislike him he thought i dislike him to the very roots of me and thats lucky itll make it easier for me to back his wife halfartist and halfforsyte jolyon was constitutionally averse from what he termed ructions unless angered he conformed deeply to that classic description of the shedog erd ruther run than fight a little smile became settled in his beard ironical that soames should come down here to this house built for himself how he had gazed and gaped at this ruin of his past intention furtively nosing at the walls and stairway appraising everything and intuitively jolyon thought i believe the fellow even now would like to be living here he could never leave off longing for what he once owned well i must act somehow or other but its a bore a great bore late that evening he wrote to the chelsea flat asking if irene would see him the old century which had seen the plant of individualism flower so wonderfully was setting in a sky orange with coming storms rumours of war added to the briskness of a london turbulent at the close of the summer holidays and the streets to jolyon who was not often up in town had a feverish look due to these new motor cars and cabs of which he disapproved aesthetically he counted these vehicles from his hansom and made the proportion of them one in twenty they were one in thirty about a year ago he thought theyve come to stay just so much more rattling round of wheels and general stink for he was one of those rather rare liberals who object to anything new when it takes a material form and he instructed his driver to get down to the river quickly out of the traffic desiring to look at the water through the mellowing screen of planetrees at the little block of flats which stood back some fifty yards from the embankment he told the cabman to wait and went up to the first floor yes mrs heron was at home the effect of a settled if very modest income was at once apparent to him remembering the threadbare refinement in that tiny flat eight years ago when he announced her good fortune everything was now fresh dainty and smelled of flowers the general effect was silvery with touches of black hydrangea colour and gold a woman of great taste he thought time had dealt gently with jolyon for he was a forsyte but with irene time hardly seemed to deal at all or such was his impression she appeared to him not a day older standing there in molecoloured velvet corduroy with soft dark eyes and dark gold hair with outstretched hand and a little smile wont you sit down he had probably never occupied a chair with a fuller sense of embarrassment you look absolutely unchanged he said and you look younger cousin jolyon jolyon ran his hands through his hair whose thickness was still a comfort to him im ancient but i dont feel it thats one thing about paint ing it keeps you young titian lived to ninetynine and had to have plague to kill him off do you know the first time i ever saw you i thought of a picture by him when did you see me for the first time in the botanical gardens how did you know me if youd never seen me before by someone who came up to you he was looking at her hardily but her face did not change and she said quietly yes many lives ago what is your recipe for youth irene people who dont live are wonderfully preserved hm a bitter little saying people who dont live but an opening and he took it you remember my cousin soames he saw her smile faintly at that whimsicality and at once went on he came to see me the day before yesterday he wants a divorce do you i the word seemed startled out of her after twelve years its rather late wont it be difficult jolyon looked hard into her face unless he said unless i have a lover now but i have never had one since what did he feel at the simplicity and candour of those words relief surprise pity venus for twelve years without a lover and yet he said i suppose you would give a good deal to be free too i dont know what does it matter now but if you were to love again i should love in that simple answer she seemed to sum up the whole philosophy of one on whom the world had turned its back well is there anything you would like me to say to him only that im sorry hes not free he had his chance once i dont know why he didnt take it because he was a forsyte we never part with things you know unless we want something in their place and not always then irene smiled dont you cousin jolyon i think you do of course im a bit of a mongrel not quite a pure forsyte i never take the halfpennies off my cheques i put them on said jolyon uneasily well what does soames want in place of me now i dont know perhaps children she was silent for a little looking down yes she murmured its hard i would help him to be free if i could jolyon gazed into his hat his embarrassment was increasing fast so was his admiration his wonder and his pity she was so lovely and so lonely and altogether it was such a coil well he said i shall have to see soames if theres anything i can do for you im always at your service you must think of me as a wretched substitute for my father at all events ill let you know what happens when i speak to soames he may supply the material himself she shook her head you see he has a lot to lose and i have nothing i should like him to be free but i dont see what i can do nor i at the moment said jolyon and soon after took his leave he went down to his hansom halfpast three soames would be at his office still to the poultry he called through the trap in front of the houses of parliament and in whitehall newsvendors were calling grave situation in the transvaal but the cries hardly roused him absorbed in recollection of that very beautiful figure of her soft dark glance and the words i have never had one since what on earth did such a woman do with her life backwatered like this solitary unprotected with every mans hand against her or rather reaching out to grasp her at the least sign and year after year she went on like that the word poultry above the passing citizens brought him back to reality forsyte bustard and forsyte in black letters on a ground the colour of peasoup spurred him to a sort of vigour and he went up the stone stairs muttering fusty musty ownerships well we couldnt do without them i want mr soames forsyte he said to the boy who opened the door what name mr jolyon forsyte the youth looked at him curiously never having seen a forsyte with a beard and vanished the offices of forsyte bustard and forsyte had slowly absorbed the offices of tooting and bowles and occupied the whole of the first floor the firm consisted now of nothing but soames and a number of managing and articled clerks the complete retirement of james some six years ago had accelerated business to which the final touch of speed had been imparted when bustard dropped off worn out as many believed by the suit of fryer versus forsyte more in chancery than ever and less likely to benefit its beneficiaries soames with his saner grasp of actualities had never permitted it to worry him on the contrary he had long perceived that providence had presented him therein with l a year net in perpetuity and why not when jolyon entered his cousin was drawing out a list of holdings in consols which in view of the rumours of war he was going to advise his companies to put on the market at once before other companies did the same he looked round sidelong and said how are you just one minute sit down wont you and having entered three amounts and set a ruler to keep his place he turned towards jolyon biting the side of his flat forefinger yes he said i have seen her soames frowned well she has remained faithful to memory having said that jolyon was ashamed his cousin had flushed a dusky yellowish red what had made him tease the poor brute i was to tell you she is sorry you are not free twelve years is a long time you know your law and what chance it gives you soames uttered a curious little grunt and the two remained a full minute without speaking like wax thought jolyon watching that close face where the flush was fast subsiding hell never give me a sign of what hes thinking or going to do like wax and he transferred his gaze to a plan of that flourishing town by street on sea the future existence of which lay exposed on the wall to the possessive instincts of the firms clients the whim sical thought flashed through him i wonder if i shall get a bill of costs for this to attending mr jolyon forsyte in the matter of my divorce to receiving his account of his visit to my wife and to advising him to go and see her again sixteen and eightpence suddenly soames said i cant go on like this i tell you i cant go on like this his eyes were shifting from side to side like an animals when it looks for way of escape he really suffers thought jolyon ive no business to forget that just because i dont like him surely he said gently it lies with yourself a man can always put these things through if hell take it on himself soames turned square to him with a sound which seemed to come from somewhere very deep why should i suffer more than ive suffered already why should i jolyon could only shrug his shoulders his reason agreed his instinct rebelled he could not have said why your father went on soames took an interest in her why goodness knows and i suppose you do too he gave jolyon a sharp look it seems to me that one only has to do another person a wrong to get all the sympathy i dont know in what way i was to blame ive never known i always treated her well i gave her everything she could wish for i wanted her again jolyons reason nodded again his instinct shook its head what is it he thought there must be something wrong in me yet if there is id rather be wrong than right after all said soames with a sort of glum fierceness she was my wife in a flash the thought went through his listener there it is ownerships well we all own things but human beings pah you have to look at facts he said drily or rather the want of them soames gave him another quick suspicious look the want of them he said yes but i am not so sure i beg your pardon replied jolyon ive told you what she said it was explicit my experience has not been one to promote blind confidence in her word we shall see jolyon got up goodbye he said curtly goodbye returned soames and jolyon went out trying to understand the look halfstartled halfmenacing on his cousins face he sought waterloo station in a disturbed frame of mind as though the skin of his moral being had been scraped and all the way down in the train he thought of irene in her lonely flat and of soames in his lonely office and of the strange paralysis of life that lay on them both in chancery he thought both their necks in chancery and hers so pretty chapter ix val hears the news the keeping of engagements had not as yet been a conspicuous feature in the life of young val dartie so that when he broke two and kept one it was the latter event which caused him if anything the greater surprise while jogging back to town from robin hill after his ride with holly she had been even prettier than he had thought her yesterday on her silverroan longtailed palfrey and it seemed to him selfcritical in the brumous october gloaming and the outskirts of london that only his boots had shone throughout their twohour companionship he took out his new gold hunter present from james and looked not at the time but at sections of his face in the glittering back of its opened case he had a temporary spot over one eyebrow and it displeased him for it must have displeased her crum never had any spots together with crum rose the scene in the promenade of the pandemonium today he had not had the faintest desire to unbosom himself to holly about his father his father lacked poetry the stirrings of which he was feeling for the first time in his nineteen years the liberty with cynthia dark that almost mythical embodiment of rapture the pandemonium with the woman of uncertain age both seemed to val completely off fresh from communion with this new shy darkhaired young cousin of his she rode jolly well too so that it had been all the more flattering that she had let him lead her where he would in the long gallops of richmond park though she knew them so much better than he did looking back on it all he was mystified by the barrenness of his speech he felt that he could say an awful lot of fetching things if he had but the chance again and the thought that he must go back to littlehampton on the morrow and to oxford on the twelfth to that beastly exam too without the faintest chance of first seeing her again caused darkness to settle on his spirit even more quickly than on the evening he should write to her however and she had promised to answer perhaps too she would come up to oxford to see her brother that thought was like the first star which came out as he rode into padwicks livery stables in the purlieus of sloane square he got off and stretched himself luxuriously for he had ridden some twentyfive good miles the dartie within him made him chaffer for five minutes with young padwick concerning the favourite for the cambridgeshire then with the words put the gee down to my account he walked away a little wide at the knees and flipping his boots with his knotty little cane i dont feel a bit inclined to go out he thought i wonder if mother will stand fizz for my last night with fizz and recollection he could well pass a domestic evening when he came down speckless after his bath he found his mother scrupulous in a low evening dress and to his annoyance his uncle soames they stopped talking when he came in then his uncle said hed better be told at those words which meant something about his father of course vals first thought was of holly was it anything beastly his mother began speaking your father she said in her fashionably appointed voice while her fingers plucked rather pitifully at seagreen brocade your father my dear boy has is not at newmarket hes on his way to south america he hes left us val looked from her to soames left them was he sorry was he fond of his father it seemed to him that he did not know then suddenly as at a whiff of gardenias and cigars his heart twitched within him and he was sorry ones father belonged to one could not go off in this fashion it was not done nor had he always been the bounder of the pandemonium promenade there were precious memories of tailors shops and horses tips at school and general lavish kindness when in luck but why he said then as a sportsman himself was sorry he had asked the mask of his mothers face was all disturbed and he burst out all right mother dont tell me only what does it mean a divorce val im afraid val uttered a queer little grunt and looked quickly at his uncle that uncle whom he had been taught to look on as a guarantee against the consequences of having a father even against the dartie blood in his own veins the flatchecked visage seemed to wince and this upset him it wont be public will it so vividly before him had come recollection of his own eyes glued to the unsavoury details of many a divorce suit in the public press cant it be done quietly somehow its so disgusting for for mother and and everybody everything will be done as quietly as it can you may be sure yes but why is it necessary at all mother doesnt want to marry again himself the girls their name tarnished in the sight of his schoolfellows and of crum of the men at oxford of holly unbearable what was to be gained by it do you mother he said sharply thus brought face to face with so much of her own feeling by the one she loved best in the world winifred rose from the empire chair in which she had been sitting she saw that her son would be against her unless he was told everything and yet how could she tell him thus still plucking at the green brocade she stared at soames val too stared at soames surely this embodiment of respectability and the sense of property could not wish to bring such a slur on his own sister soames slowly passed a little inlaid paperknife over the smooth surface of a marqueterie table then without looking at his nephew he began you dont understand what your mother has had to put up with these twenty years this is only the last straw val and glancing up sideways at winifred he added shall i tell him winifred was silent if he were not told he would be against her yet how dreadful to be told such things of his own father clenching her lips she nodded soames spoke in a rapid even voice he has always been a burden round your mothers neck she has paid his debts over and over again he has often been drunk abused and threatened her and now he is gone to buenos aires with a dancer and as if distrusting the efficacy of those words on the boy he went on quickly he took your mothers pearls to give to her val jerked up his hand then at that signal of distress winifred cried out thatll do soames stop in the boy the dartie and the forsyte were struggling for debts drink dancers he had a certain sympathy but the pearls no that was too much and suddenly he found his mothers hand squeezing his you see he heard soames say we cant have it all begin over again theres a limit we must strike while the irons hot val freed his hand but youre never going to bring out that about the pearls i couldnt stand that i simply couldnt winifred cried out no no val oh no thats only to show you how impossible your father is and his uncle nodded somewhat assuaged val took out a cigarette his father had bought him that thin curved case oh it was unbearable just as he was going up to oxford cant mother be protected without he said i could look after her it could always be done later if it was really necessary a smile played for a moment round soames lips and became bitter you dont know what youre talking of nothings so fatal as delay in such matters why i tell you boy nothings so fatal i know from experience his voice had the ring of exasperation val regarded him round eyed never having known his uncle express any sort of feeling oh yes he remembered now there had been an aunt irene and something had happened something which people kept dark he had heard his father once use an unmentionable word of her i dont want to speak ill of your father soames went on doggedly but i know him well enough to be sure that hell be back on your mothers hands before a years over you can imagine what that will mean to her and to all of you after this the only thing is to cut the knot for good in spite of himself val was impressed and happening to look at his mothers face he got what was perhaps his first real insight into the fact that his own feelings were not always what mattered most all right mother he said well back you up only id like to know when itll be its my first term you know i dont want to be up there when it comes off oh my dear boy murmured winifred it is a bore for you so by habit she phrased what from the expression of her face was the most poignant regret when will it be soames cant tell not for months we must get restitution first what the deuce is that thought val what silly brutes lawyers are not for months i know one thing im not going to dine in and he said awfully sorry mother ive got to go out to dinner now though it was his last night winifred nodded almost gratefully they both felt that they had gone quite far enough in the expression of feeling val sought the misty freedom of green street reckless and depressed and not till he reached piccadilly did he discover that he had only eighteenpence one couldnt dine off eighteenpence and he was very hungry he looked longingly at the windows of the iseeum club where he had often eaten of the best with his father those pearls there was no getting over them but the more he brooded and the further he walked the hungrier he naturally became short of trailing home there were only two places where he could go his grandfathers in park lane and timothys in the bayswater road which was the less deplorable at his grandfathers he would probably get a better dinner on the spur of the moment at timothys they gave you a jolly good feed when they expected you not otherwise he decided on park lane not unmoved by the thought that to go up to oxford without affording his grandfather a chance to tip him was hardly fair to either of them his mother would hear he had been there of course and might think it funny but he couldnt help that he rang the bell hullo warmson any dinner for me dyou think theyre just going in master val mr forsyte will be very glad to see you he was saying at lunch that he never saw you nowadays val grinned well here i am kill the fatted calf warmson lets have fizz warmson smiled faintly in his opinion val was a young limb i will ask mrs forsyte master val i say val grumbled taking off his overcoat im not at school any more you know warmson not without a sense of humour opened the door beyond the stagshorn coat stand with the words mr valerus maam confound him thought val entering a warm embrace a well val from emily and a rather quavery so there you are at last from james restored his sense of dignity why didnt you let us know theres only saddle of mutton champagne warmson said emily and they went in at the great diningtable shortened to its utmost under which so many fashionable legs had rested james sat at one end emily at the other val halfway between them and something of the loneliness of his grandparents now that all their four children were flown reached the boys spirit i hope i shall kick the bucket long before im as old as grandfather he thought poor old chap hes as thin as a rail and lowering his voice while his grandfather and warmson were in discussion about sugar in the soup he said to emily its pretty brutal at home granny i suppose you know yes dear boy uncle soames was there when i left i say isnt there anything to be done to prevent a divorce why is he so beastly keen on it hush my dear murmured emily were keeping it from your grandfather james voice sounded from the other end whats that what are you talking about about vals college returned emily young pariser was there james you remember he nearly broke the bank at monte carlo afterwards james muttered that he did not know val must look after himself up there or hed get into bad ways and he looked at his grandson with gloom out of which affection distrustfully glimmered what im afraid of said val to his plate is of being hard up you know by instinct he knew that the weak spot in that old man was fear of insecurity for his grandchildren well said james and the soup in his spoon dribbled over youll have a good allowance but you must keep within it of course murmured val if it is good how much will it be grandfather three hundred and fifty its too much i had next to nothing at your age val sighed he had hoped for four and been afraid of three i dont know what your young cousin has said james hes up there his fathers a rich man arent you asked val hardily i replied james flustered ive got so many expenses your father and he was silent cousin jolyons got an awfully jolly place i went down there with uncle soames ripping stables ah murmured james profoundly that house i knew how it would be and he lapsed into gloomy meditation over his fishbones his sons tragedy and the deep cleavage it had caused in the forsyte family had still the power to draw him down into a whirlpool of doubts and misgivings val who hankered to talk of robin hill because robin hill meant holly turned to emily and said was that the house built for uncle soames and receiving her nod went on i wish youd tell me about him granny what became of aunt irene is she still going he seems awfully workedup about something tonight emily laid her finger on her lips but the word irene had caught james ear whats that he said staying a piece of mutton close to his lips whos been seeing her i knew we hadnt heard the last of that now james said emily eat your dinner nobodys been seeing anybody james put down his fork there you go he said i might die before youd tell me of it is soames getting a divorce nonsense said emily with incomparable aplomb soames is much too sensible james had sought his own throat gathering the long white whiskers together on the skin and bone of it she she was always he said and with that enigmatic remark the conversation lapsed for warmson had returned but later when the saddle of mutton had been succeeded by sweet savoury and dessert and val had received a cheque for twenty pounds and his grandfathers kiss like no other kiss in the world from lips pushed out with a sort of fearful suddenness as if yielding to weakness he returned to the charge in the hall tell us about uncle soames granny why is he so keen on mothers getting a divorce your uncle soames said emily and her voice had in it an exaggerated assurance is a lawyer my dear boy hes sure to know best is he muttered val but what did become of aunt irene i remember she was jolly goodlooking she er said emily behaved very badly we dont talk about it well i dont want everybody at oxford to know about our affairs ejaculated val its a brutal idea why couldnt father be pre vented without its being made public emily sighed she had always lived rather in an atmosphere of divorce owing to her fashionable proclivities so many of those whose legs had been under her table having gained a certain notor iety when however it touched her own family she liked it no better than other people but she was eminently practical and a woman of courage who never pursued a shadow in preference to its substance your mother she said will be happier if shes quite free val goodnight my dear boy and dont wear loud waistcoats up at oxford theyre not the thing just now heres a little present with another five pounds in his hand and a little warmth in his heart for he was fond of his grandmother he went out into park lane a wind had cleared the mist the autumn leaves were rustling and the stars were shining with all that money in his pocket an impulse to see life beset him but he had not gone forty yards in the direction of piccadilly when hollys shy face and her eyes with an imp dancing in their gravity came up before him and his hand seemed to be tingling again from the pressure of her warm gloved hand no dash it he thought im going home chapter x soames entertains the future it was full late for the river but the weather was lovely and summer lingered below the yellowing leaves soames took many looks at the day from his riverside garden near mapledurham that sunday morning with his own hands he put flowers about his little houseboat and equipped the punt in which after lunch he proposed to take them on the river placing those chineselooking cushions he could not tell whether or no he wished to take annette alone she was so very pretty could he trust himself not to say irrevocable words passing beyond the limits of discretion roses on the veranda were still in bloom and the hedges evergreen so that there was almost nothing of middleaged autumn to chill the mood yet was he nervous fidgety strangely distrustful of his powers to steer just the right course this visit had been planned to produce in annette and her mother a due sense of his possessions so that they should be ready to receive with respect any overture he might later be disposed to make he dressed with great care making himself neither too young nor too old very thankful that his hair was still thick and smooth and had no grey in it three times he went up to his picturegallery if they had any knowledge at all they must see at once that his collection alone was worth at least thirty thousand pounds he minutely inspected too the pretty bedroom overlooking the river where they would take off their hats it would be her bedroom if if the matter went through and she became his wife going up to the dressingtable he passed his hand over the lilaccoloured pincushion into which were stuck all kinds of pins a bowl of potpourri exhaled a scent that made his head turn just a little his wife if only the whole thing could be settled out of hand and there was not the nightmare of this divorce to be gone through first and with gloom puckered on his forehead he looked out at the river shining beyond the roses and the lawn madame lamotte would never resist this prospect for her child annette would never resist her mother if only he were free he drove to the station to meet them what taste french women had madame lamotte was in black with touches of lilac colour annette in greyish lilac linen with cream coloured gloves and hat rather pale she looked and londony and her blue eyes were demure waiting for them to come down to lunch soames stood in the open frenchwindow of the diningroom moved by that sensuous delight in sunshine and flowers and trees which only came to the full when youth and beauty were there to share it with one he had ordered the lunch with intense consideration the wine was a very special sauterne the whole appointments of the meal perfect the coffee served on the veranda superexcellent madame lamotte accepted creme de menthe annette refused her manners were charming with just a suspicion of the conscious beauty creeping into them yes thought soames another year of london and that sort of life and shell be spoiled madame was in sedate french raptures adorable le soleil est si bon how everything is chic is it not annette monsieur is a real monte cristo annette murmured assent with a look up at soames which he could not read he proposed a turn on the river but to punt two persons when one of them looked so ravishing on those chinese cushions was merely to suffer from a sense of lost opportunity so they went but a short way towards pangbourne drifting slowly back with every now and then an autumn leaf dropping on annette or on her mothers black amplitude and soames was not happy worried by the thought how when where can i say what they did not yet even know that he was married to tell them he was married might jeopardise his every chance yet if he did not definitely make them understand that he wished for annettes hand it would be dropping into some other clutch before he was free to claim it at tea which they both took with lemon soames spoke of the transvaal therell be war he said madame lamotte lamented ces pauvres gens bergers could they not be left to themselves soames smiled the question seemed to him absurd surely as a woman of business she understood that the british could not abandon their legitimate commercial interests ah that but madame lamotte found that the english were a little hypocrite they were talking of justice and the uitlanders not of business monsieur was the first who had spoken to her of that the boers are only halfcivilised remarked soames they stand in the way of progress it will never do to let our suzerainty go what does that mean to say suzerainty what a strange word soames became eloquent roused by these threats to the principle of possession and stimulated by annettes eyes fixed on him he was delighted when presently she said i think monsieur is right they should be taught a lesson she was sensible of course he said we must act with moderation im no jingo we must be firm without bullying will you come up and see my pictures moving from one to another of these treasures he soon perceived that they knew nothing they passed his last mauve that remarkable study of a haycart going home as if it were a lithograph he waited almost with awe to see how they would view the jewel of his collection an israels whose price he had watched ascending till he was now almost certain it had reached top value and would be better on the market again they did not view it at all this was a shock and yet to have in annette a virgin taste to form would be better than to have the silly halfbaked pre dilections of the english middleclass to deal with at the end of the gallery was a meissonier of which he was rather ashamed meissonier was so steadily going down madame lamotte stopped before it meissonier ah what a jewel soames took advantage of that moment very gently touching annettes arm he said how do you like my place annette she did not shrink did not respond she looked at him full looked down and murmured who would not like it it is so beautiful perhaps some day soames said and stopped so pretty she was so selfpossessed she frightened him those cornflowerblue eyes the turn of that creamy neck her delicate curves she was a standing temptation to indiscretion no no one must be sure of ones ground much surer if i hold off he thought it will tantalise her and he crossed over to madame lamotte who was still in front of the meissonier yes thats quite a good example of his later work you must come again madame and see them lighted up you must both come and spend a night enchanted would it not be beautiful to see them lighted by moonlight too the river must be ravishing annette murmured thou art sentimental maman sentimental that blackrobed comely substantial frenchwoman of the world and suddenly he was certain as he could be that there was no sentiment in either of them all the better of what use sentiment and yet he drove to the station with them and saw them into the train to the tightened pressure of his hand it seemed that annettes fingers responded just a little her face smiled at him through the dark he went back to the carriage brooding go on home jordan he said to the coachman ill walk and he strode out into the darkening lanes caution and the desire of possession playing seesaw within him bon soir monsieur how softly she had said it to know what was in her mind the french they were like cats one could tell nothing but how pretty what a perfect young thing to hold in ones arms what a mother for his heir and he thought with a smile of his family and their surprise at a french wife and their curiosity and of the way he would play with it and buffet it confound them the poplars sighed in the darkness an owl hooted shadows deepened in the water i will and must be free he thought i wont hang about any longer ill go and see irene if you want things done do them yourself i must live again live and move and have my being and in echo to that queer biblicality church bells chimed the call to evening prayer chapter xi and visits the past on a tuesday evening after dining at his club soames set out to do what required more courage and perhaps less delicacy than anything he had yet undertaken in his life save perhaps his birth and one other action he chose the evening indeed partly because irene was more likely to be in but mainly because he had failed to find sufficient resolution by daylight had needed wine to give him extra daring he left his hansom on the embankment and walked up to the old church uncertain of the block of flats where he knew she lived he found it hiding behind a much larger mansion and having read the name mrs irene heron heron forsooth her maiden name so she used that again did she he stepped back into the road to look up at the windows of the first floor light was coming through in the corner fiat and he could hear a piano being played he had never had a love of music had secretly borne it a grudge in the old days when so often she had turned to her piano making of it a refuge place into which she knew he could not enter repulse the long repulse at first restrained and secret at last open bitter memory came with that sound it must be she playing and thus almost assured of seeing her he stood more undecided than ever shivers of anticipation ran through him his tongue felt dry his heart beat fast i have no cause to be afraid he thought and then the lawyer stirred within him was he doing a foolish thing ought he not to have arranged a formal meeting in the presence of her trustee no not before that fellow jolyon who sympathised with her never he crossed back into the doorway and slowly to keep down the beating of his heart mounted the single flight of stairs and rang the bell when the door was opened to him his sensations were regulated by the scent which came that perfume from away back in the past bringing muffled remembrance fragrance of a drawingroom he used to enter of a house he used to own perfume of dried roseleaves and honey say mr forsyte he said your mistress will see me i know he had thought this out she would think it was jolyon when the maid was gone and he was alone in the tiny hall where the light was dim from one pearlyshaded sconce and walls carpet everything was silvery making the walledin space all ghostly he could only think ridiculously shall i go in with my overcoat on or take it off the music ceased the maid said from the doorway will you walk in sir soames walked in he noted mechanically that all was still silvery and that the upright piano was of satinwood she had risen and stood recoiled against it her hand placed on the keys as if groping for support had struck a sudden discord held for a moment and released the light from the shaded pianocandle fell on her neck leaving her face rather in shadow she was in a black evening dress with a sort of mantilla over her shoulders he did not remember ever having seen her in black and the thought passed through him she dresses even when shes alone you he heard her whisper many times soames had rehearsed this scene in fancy rehearsal served him not at all he simply could not speak he had never thought that the sight of this woman whom he had once so passionately desired so completely owned and whom he had not seen for twelve years could affect him in this way he had imagined himself speaking and acting half as man of business half as judge and now it was as if he were in the presence not of a mere woman and erring wife but of some force subtle and elusive as atmosphere itself within him and outside a kind of defensive irony welled up in him yes its a queer visit i hope youre well thank you will you sit down she had moved away from the piano and gone over to a windowseat sinking on to it with her hands clasped in her lap light fell on her there so that soames could see her face eyes hair strangely as he remembered them strangely beautiful he sat down on the edge of a satinwood chair upholstered with silvercoloured stuff close to where he was standing you have not changed he said no what have you come for to discuss things i have heard what you want from your cousin well i am willing i have always been the sound of her voice reserved and close the sight of her figure watchfully poised defensive was helping him now a thousand memories of her ever on the watch against him stirred and perhaps you will be good enough then to give me information on which i can act the law must be complied with i have none to give you that you dont know of twelve years do you suppose i can believe that i dont suppose you will believe anything i say but its the truth soames looked at her hard he had said that she had not changed now he perceived that she had not in face except that it was more beautiful not in form except that it was a little fuller no she had changed spiritually there was more of her as it were something of activity and daring where there had been sheer passive resistance ah he thought thats her independent income confound uncle jolyon i suppose youre comfortably off now he said thank you yes why didnt you let me provide for you i would have in spite of everything a faint smile came on her lips but she did not answer you are still my wife said soames why he said that what he meant by it he knew neither when he spoke nor after it was a truism almost preposterous but its effect was startling she rose from the windowseat and stood for a moment perfectly still looking at him he could see her bosom heaving then she turned to the window and threw it open why do that he said sharply youll catch cold in that dress im not dangerous and he uttered a little sad laugh she echoed it faintly bitterly it was habit rather odd habit said soames as bitterly shut the window she shut it and sat down again she had developed power this woman this wife of his he felt it issuing from her as she sat there in a sort of armour and almost unconsciously he rose and moved nearer he wanted to see the expression on her face her eyes met his unflinching heavens how clear they were and what a dark brown against that white skin and that burntamber hair and how white her shoulders funny sensation this he ought to hate her you had better tell me he said its to your advantage to be free as well as to mine that old matter is too old i have told you do you mean to tell me there has been nothing nobody nobody you must go to your own life stung by that retort soames moved towards the piano and back to the hearth to and fro as he had been wont in the old days in their drawingroom when his feelings were too much for him that wont do he said you deserted me in common justice its for you he saw her shrug those white shoulders heard her murmur yes why didnt you divorce me then should i have cared he stopped and looked at her intently with a sort of curiosity what on earth did she do with herself if she really lived quite alone and why had he not divorced her the old feeling that she had never understood him never done him justice bit him while he stared at her why couldnt you have made me a good wife he said yes it was a crime to marry you i have paid for it you will find some way perhaps you neednt mind my name i have none to lose now i think you had better go a sense of defeat of being defrauded of his selfjustification and of something else beyond power of explanation to himself beset soames like the breath of a cold fog mechanically he reached up took from the mantelshelf a little china bowl reversed it and said lowestoft where did you get this i bought its fellow at jobsons and visited by the sudden memory of how those many years ago he and she had bought china together he remained staring at the little bowl as if it contained all the past her voice roused him take it i dont want it soames put it back on the shelf will you shake hands he said a faint smile curved her lips she held out her hand it was cold to his rather feverish touch shes made of ice he thought she was always made of ice but even as that thought darted through him his senses were assailed by the perfume of her dress and body as though the warmth within her which had never been for him were struggling to show its presence and he turned on his heel he walked out and away as if someone with a whip were after him not even looking for a cab glad of the empty embankment and the cold river and the thickstrewn shadows of the planetree leaves confused flurried sore at heart and vaguely disturbed as though he had made some deep mistake whose consequences he could not foresee and the fantastic thought suddenly assailed him if instead of i think you had better go she had said i think you had better stay what should he have felt what would he have done that cursed attraction of her was there for him even now after all these years of estrangement and bitter thoughts it was there ready to mount to his head at a sign a touch i was a fool to go he muttered ive advanced nothing who could imagine i never thought memory flown back to the first years of his marriage played him torturing tricks she had not deserved to keep her beauty the beauty he had owned and known so well and a kind of bitterness at the tenacity of his own admiration welled up in him most men would have hated the sight of her as she had deserved she had spoiled his life wounded his pride to death defrauded him of a son and yet the mere sight of her cold and resisting as ever had this power to upset him utterly it was some damned magnetism she had and no wonder if as she asserted she had lived untouched these last twelve years so bosinney cursed be his memory had lived on all this time with her soames could not tell whether he was glad of that knowledge or no nearing his club at last he stopped to buy a paper a headline ran boers reported to repudiate suzerainty suzerainty just like her he thought she always did suzerainty i still have it by rights she must be awfully lonely in that wretched little flat chapter xii on forsyte change soames belonged to two clubs the connoisseurs which he put on his cards and seldom visited and the remove which he did not put on his cards and frequented he had joined this liberal institution five years ago having made sure that its members were now nearly all sound conservatives in heart and pocket if not in principle uncle nicholas had put him up the fine readingroom was decorated in the adam style on entering that evening he glanced at the tape for any news about the transvaal and noted that consols were down sevensixteenths since the morning he was turning away to seek the readingroom when a voice behind him said well soames that went off all right it was uncle nicholas in a frockcoat and his special cutaway collar with a black tie passed through a ring heavens how young and dapper he looked at eightytwo i think rogerd have been pleased his uncle went on the thing was very well done blackleys ill make a note of them buxtons done me no good these boers are upsetting me that fellow chamberlains driving the country into war what do you think bound to come murmured soames nicholas passed his hand over his thin cleanshaven cheeks very rosy after his summer cure a slight pout had gathered on his lips this business had revived all his liberal principles i mistrust that chap hes a stormy petrel houseproperty will go down if theres war youll have trouble with rogers estate i often told him he ought to get out of some of his houses he was an opinionated beggar there was a pair of you thought soames but he never argued with an uncle in that way preserving their opinion of him as a longheaded chap and the legal care of their property they tell me at timothys said nicholas lowering his voice that dartie has gone off at last thatll be a relief to your father he was a rotten egg again soames nodded if there was a subject on which the forsytes really agreed it was the character of montague dartie you take care said nicholas or hell turn up again winifred had better have the tooth out i should say no use preserving whats gone bad soames looked at him sideways his nerves exacerbated by the interview he had just come through disposed him to see a personal allusion in those words im advising her he said shortly well said nicholas the broughams waiting i must get home im very poorly remember me to your father and having thus reconsecrated the ties of blood he passed down the steps at his youthful gait and was wrapped into his fur coat by the junior porter ive never known uncle nicholas other than very poorly mused soames or seen him look other than everlasting what a family judging by him ive got thirtyeight years of health before me well im not going to waste them and going over to a mirror he stood looking at his face except for a line or two and three or four grey hairs in his little dark moustache had he aged any more than irene the prime of life he and she in the very prime of life and a fantastic thought shot into his mind absurd idiotic but again it came and genuinely alarmed by the recur rence as one is by the second fit of shivering which presages a feverish cold he sat down on the weighing machine eleven stone he had not varied two pounds in twenty years what age was she nearly thirtyseven not too old to have a child not at all thirtyseven on the ninth of next month he remembered her birthday well he had always observed it religiously even that last birthday so soon before she left him when he was almost certain she was faithless four birthdays in his house he had looked forward to them because his gifts had meant a semblance of gratitude a certain attempt at warmth except indeed that last birthday which had tempted him to be too religious and he shied away in thought memory heaps dead leaves on corpselike deeds from under which they do but vaguely offend the sense and then he thought suddenly i could send her a present for her birthday after all were christians couldnt couldnt we join up again and he uttered a deep sigh sitting there annette ah but between him and annette was the need for that wretched divorce suit and how a man can always work these things if hell take it on himself jolyon had said but why should he take the scandal on himself with his whole career as a pillar of the law at stake it was not fair it was quix otic twelve years separation in which he had taken no steps to free himself put out of court the possibility of using her conduct with bosinney as a ground for divorcing her by doing nothing to secure relief he had acquiesced even if the evidence could now be gathered which was more than doubtful besides his own pride would never let him use that old incident he had suffered from it too much no nothing but fresh misconduct on her part but she had denied it and almost he had believed her hung up utterly hung up he rose from the scoopedout red velvet seat with a feeling of constriction about his vitals he would never sleep with this going on in him and taking coat and hat again he went out moving eastward in trafalgar square he became aware of some special commotion travelling towards him out of the mouth of the strand it materialised in newspaper men calling out so loudly that no words whatever could be heard he stopped to listen and one came by payper special ultimatium by krooger declaration of war soames bought the paper there it was in the stop press his first thought was the boers are committing suicide his second is there anything still i ought to sell if so he had missed the chance there would certainly be a slump in the city tomorrow he swallowed this thought with a nod of defiance that ultimatum was insolent sooner than let it pass he was prepared to lose money they wanted a lesson and they would get it but it would take three months at least to bring them to heel there werent the troops out there always behind time the government confound those newspaper rats what was the use of waking everybody up breakfast tomorrow was quite soon enough and he thought with alarm of his father they would cry it down park lane hailing a hansom he got in and told the man to drive there james and emily had just gone up to bed and after communicating the news to warmson soames prepared to follow he paused by afterthought to say what do you think of it warmson the butler ceased passing a hat brush over the silk hat soames had taken off and inclining his face a little forward said in a low voice well sir they avent a chance of course but im told theyre very good shots ive got a son in the inniskillings you warmson why i didnt know you were married no sir i dont talk of it i expect hell be going out the slighter shock soames had felt on discovering that he knew so little of one whom he thought he knew so well was lost in the slight shock of discovering that the war might touch one personally born in the year of the crimean war he had only come to consciousness by the time the indian mutiny was over since then the many little wars of the british empire had been entirely professional quite unconnected with the forsytes and all they stood for in the body politic this war would surely be no exception but his mind ran hastily over his family two of the haymans he had heard were in some yeomanry or other it had always been a pleasant thought there was a certain distinction about the yeomanry they wore or used to wear a blue uniform with silver about it and rode horses and archibald he remembered had once on a time joined the militia but had given it up because his father nicholas had made such a fuss about his wasting his time peacocking about in a uniform recently he had heard somewhere that young nicholas eldest very young nicholas had become a volunteer no thought soames mounting the stairs slowly theres nothing in that he stood on the landing outside his parents bed and dressing rooms debating whether or not to put his nose in and say a reassuring word opening the landing window he listened the rumble from piccadilly was all the sound he heard and with the thought if these motorcars increase itll affect house property he was about to pass on up to the room always kept ready for him when he heard distant as yet the hoarse rushing call of a newsvendor there it was and coming past the house he knocked on his mothers door and went in his father was sitting up in bed with his ears pricked under the white hair which emily kept so beautifully cut he looked pink and extraordinarily clean in his setting of white sheet and pillow out of which the points of his high thin nightgowned shoulders emerged in small peaks his eyes alone grey and distrustful under their withered lids were moving from the window to emily who in a wrapper was walking up and down squeezing a rubber ball attached to a scent bottle the room reeked faintly of the eaudecologne she was spraying all right said soames its not a fire the boers have declared war thats all emily stopped her spraying oh was all she said and looked at james soames too looked at his father he was taking it differently from their expectation as if some thought strange to them were working in him hm he muttered suddenly i shant live to see the end of this nonsense james itll be over by christmas what do you know about it james answered her with asperity its a pretty mess at this time of night too he lapsed into silence and his wife and son as if hypnotised waited for him to say i cant tell i dont know i knew how it would be but he did not the grey eyes shifted evidently seeing nothing in the room then movement occurred under the bedclothes and the knees were drawn up suddenly to a great height they ought to send out roberts it all comes from that fellow gladstone and his majuba the two listeners noted something beyond the usual in his voice something of real anxiety it was as if he had said i shall never see the old country peaceful and safe again i shall have to die before i know shes won and in spite of the feeling that james must not be encouraged to be fussy they were touched soames went up to the bedside and stroked his fathers hand which had emerged from under the bedclothes long and wrinkled with veins mark my words said james consols will go to par for all i know val may go and enlist oh come james cried emily you talk as if there were danger her comfortable voice seemed to soothe james for once well he muttered i told you how it would be i dont know im sure nobody tells me anything are you sleeping here my boy the crisis was past he would now compose himself to his normal degree of anxiety and assuring his father that he was sleeping in the house soames pressed his hand and went up to his room the following afternoon witnessed the greatest crowd timothys had known for many a year on national occasions such as this it was indeed almost impossible to avoid going there not that there was any danger or rather only just enough to make it necessary to assure each other that there was none nicholas was there early he had seen soames the night before soames had said it was bound to come this old kruger was in his dotage why he must be seventyfive if he was a day nicholas was eightytwo what had timothy said he had had a fit after majuba these boers were a grasping lot the darkhaired francie who had arrived on his heels with the contradictious touch which became the free spirit of a daughter of roger chimed in kettle and pot uncle nicholas what price the uitlanders what price indeed a new expression and believed to be due to her brother george aunt juley thought francie ought not to say such a thing dear mrs macanders boy charlie macander was one and no one could call him grasping at this francie uttered one of her mots scandalising and so frequently repeated well his fathers a scotchman and his mothers a cat aunt juley covered her ears too late but aunt hester smiled as for nicholas he pouted witticism of which he was not the author was hardly to his taste just then marian tweetyman arrived followed almost immediately by young nicholas on seeing his son nicholas rose well i must be going he said nick here will tell you whatll win the race and with this hit at his eldest who as a pillar of accountancy and director of an insurance company was no more addicted to sport than his father had ever been he departed dear nicholas what race was that or was it only one of his jokes he was a wonderful man for his age how many lumps would dear marian take and how were giles and jesse aunt juley supposed their yeomanry would be very busy now guarding the coast though of course the boers had no ships but one never knew what the french might do if they had the chance especially since that dreadful fashoda scare which had upset timothy so terribly that he had made no investments for months afterwards it was the ingratitude of the boers that was so dreadful after everything had been done for them dr jameson imprisoned and he was so nice mrs macander had always said and sir alfred milner sent out to talk to them such a clever man she didnt know what they wanted but at this moment occurred one of those sensations so precious at timothys which great occasions sometimes bring forth miss june forsyte aunts juley and hester were on their feet at once trembling from smothered resentment and old affection bubbling up and pride at the return of a prodigal june well this was a surprise dear june after all these years and how well she was looking not changed at all it was almost on their lips to add and how is your dear grandfather forgetting in that giddy moment that poor dear jolyon had been in his grave for seven years now ever the most courageous and downright of all the forsytes june with her decided chin and her spirited eyes and her hair like flame sat down slight and short on a gilt chair with a bead worked seat for all the world as if ten years had not elapsed since she had been to see them ten years of travel and independence and devotion to lame ducks those ducks of late had been all definitely painters etchers or sculptors so that her impatience with the forsytes and their hopelessly inartistic outlook had become intense indeed she had almost ceased to believe that her family existed and looked round her now with a sort of challenging directness which brought exquisite discomfort to the roomful she had not expected to meet any of them but the poor old things and why she had come to see them she hardly knew except that while on her way from oxford street to a studio in latimer road she had suddenly remembered them with compunction as two longneglected old lame ducks aunt juley broke the hush again weve just been saying dear how dreadful it is about these boers and what an impudent thing of that old kruger impudent said june i think hes quite right what business have we to meddle with them if he turned out all those wretched uitlanders it would serve them right theyre only after money the silence of sensation was broken by francie saying what are you a proboer undoubtedly the first use of that expression well why cant we leave them alone said june just as in the open doorway the maid said mr soames forsyte sensation on sensation greeting was almost held up by curiosity to see how june and he would take this encounter for it was shrewdly suspected if not quite known that they had not met since that old and lamentable affair of her fiance bosinney with soames wife they were seen to just touch each others hands and look each at the others left eye only aunt juley came at once to the rescue dear june is so original fancy soames she thinks the boers are not to blame they only want their independence said june and why shouldnt they have it because answered soames with his smile a little on one side they happen to have agreed to our suzerainty suzerainty repeated june scornfully we shouldnt like anyones suzerainty over us they got advantages in payment replied soames a contract is a contract contracts are not always just fumed out june and when theyre not they ought to be broken the boers are much the weaker we could afford to be generous soames sniffed thats mere sentiment he said aunt hester to whom nothing was more awful than any kind of disagreement here leaned forward and remarked decisively what lovely weather it has been for the time of year but june was not to be diverted i dont know why sentiment should be sneered at its the best thing in the world she looked defiantly round and aunt juley had to intervene again have you bought any pictures lately soames her incomparable instinct for the wrong subject had not failed her soames flushed to disclose the name of his latest purchases would be like walking into the jaws of disdain for somehow they all knew of junes predilection for genius not yet on its legs and her contempt for success unless she had had a finger in securing it one or two he muttered but junes face had changed the forsyte within her was seeing its chance why should not soames buy some of the pictures of eric cobbley her last lame duck and she promptly opened her attack did soames know his work it was so wonderful he was the coming man oh yes soames knew his work it was in his view splashy and would never get hold of the public june blazed up of course it wont thats the last thing one would wish for i thought you were a connoisseur not a picturedealer of course soames is a connoisseur aunt juley said hastily he has wonderful taste he can always tell beforehand whats going to be successful oh gasped june and sprang up from the beadcovered chair i hate that standard of success why cant people buy things because they like them you mean said francie because you like them and in the slight pause young nicholas was heard saying gently that violet his fourth was taking lessons in pastel he didnt know if they were any use well goodbye auntie said june i must get on and kissing her aunts she looked defiantly round the room said goodbye again and went a breeze seemed to pass out with her as if everyone had sighed the third sensation came before anyone had time to speak mr james forsyte james came in using a stick slightly and wrapped in a fur coat which gave him a fictitious bulk everyone stood up james was so old and he had not been at timothys for nearly two years its hot in here he said soames divested him of his coat and as he did so could not help admiring the glossy way his father was turned out james sat down all knees elbows frockcoat and long white whiskers whats the meaning of that he said though there was no apparent sense in his words they all knew that he was referring to june his eyes searched his sons face i thought id come and see for myself what have they answered kruger soames took out an evening paper and read the headline instant action by our government state of war existing ah said james and sighed i was afraid theyd cut and run like old gladstone we shall finish with them this time all stared at him james always fussy nervous anxious james with his continual i told you how it would be and his pessimism and his cautious investments there was something uncanny about such resolution in this the oldest living forsyte wheres timothy said james he ought to pay attention to this aunt juley said she didnt know timothy had not said much at lunch today aunt hester rose and threaded her way out of the room and francie said rather maliciously the boers are a hard nut to crack uncle james hm muttered james where do you get your information nobody tells me young nicholas remarked in his mild voice that nick his eldest was now going to drill regularly ah muttered james and stared before him his thoughts were on val hes got to look after his mother he said hes got no time for drilling and that with that father of his this cryptic saying produced silence until he spoke again what did june want here and his eyes rested with suspicion on all of them in turn her fathers a rich man now the conversation turned on jolyon and when he had been seen last it was supposed that he went abroad and saw all sorts of people now that his wife was dead his watercolours were on the line and he was a successful man francie went so far as to say i should like to see him again he was rather a dear aunt juley recalled how he had gone to sleep on the sofa one day where james was sitting he had always been very amiable what did soames think knowing that jolyon was irenes trustee all felt the delicacy of this question and looked at soames with interest a faint pink had come up in his cheeks hes going grey he said indeed had soames seen him soames nodded and the pink vanished james said suddenly well i dont know i cant tell it so exactly expressed the sentiment of everybody present that there was something behind everything that nobody responded but at this moment aunt hester returned timothy she said in a low voice timothy has bought a map and hes put in hes put in three flags timothy had a sigh went round the company if timothy had indeed put in three flags already well it showed what the nation could do when it was roused the war was as good as over chapter xiii jolyon finds out where he is jolyon stood at the window in hollys old night nursery converted into a studio not because it had a north light but for its view over the prospect away to the grand stand at epsom he shifted to the side window which overlooked the stableyard and whistled down to the dog balthasar who lay for ever under the clock tower the old dog looked up and wagged his tail poor old boy thought jolyon shifting back to the other window he had been restless all this week since his attempt to prosecute trusteeship uneasy in his conscience which was ever acute disturbed in his sense of compassion which was easily excited and with a queer sensation as if his feeling for beauty had received some definite embodiment autumn was getting hold of the old oaktree its leaves were browning sunshine had been plentiful and hot this summer as with trees so with mens lives i ought to live long thought jolyon im getting mildewed for want of heat if i cant work i shall be off to paris but memory of paris gave him no pleasure besides how could he go he must stay and see what soames was going to do im her trustee i cant leave her unprotected he thought it had been striking him as curious how very clearly he could still see irene in her little drawingroom which he had only twice entered her beauty must have a sort of poignant harmony no literal portrait would ever do her justice the essence of her was ah i what the noise of hoofs called him back to the other window holly was riding into the yard on her longtailed palfrey she looked up and he waved to her she had been rather silent lately getting old he supposed beginning to want her future as they all did youngsters time was certainly the devil and with the feeling that to waste this swifttravelling commodity was unforgivable folly he took up his brush but it was no use he could not concentrate his eye besides the light was going ill go up to town he thought in the hall a servant met him a lady to see you sir mrs heron extraordinary coincidence passing into the picturegallery as it was still called he saw irene standing over by the window she came towards him saying ive been trespassing i came up through the coppice and garden i always used to come that way to see uncle jolyon you couldnt trespass here replied jolyon history makes that impossible i was just thinking of you irene smiled and it was as if something shone through not mere spirituality serener completer more alluring history she answered i once told uncle jolyon that love was for ever well it isnt only aversion lasts jolyon stared at her had she got over bosinney at last yes he said aversions deeper than love or hate because its a natural product of the nerves and we dont change them i came to tell you that soames has been to see me he said a thing that frightened me he said you are still my wife what ejaculated jolyon you ought not to live alone and he continued to stare at her afflicted by the thought that where beauty was nothing ever ran quite straight which no doubt was why so many people looked on it as immoral what more he asked me to shake hands did you yes when he came in im sure he didnt want to he changed while he was there ah you certainly ought not to go on living there alone i know no woman i could ask and i cant take a lover to order cousin jolyon heaven forbid said jolyon what a damnable position will you stay to dinner no well let me see you back to town i wanted to go up this evening truly truly ill be ready in five minutes on that walk to the station they talked of pictures and music contrasting the english and french characters and the difference in their attitude to art but to jolyon the colours in the hedges of the long straight lane the twittering of chaffinches who kept pace with them the perfume of weeds being already burned the turn of her neck the fascination of those dark eyes bent on him now and then the lure of her whole figure made a deeper impression than the remarks they exchanged unconsciously he held himself straighter walked with a more elastic step in the train he put her through a sort of catechism as to what she did with her days made her dresses shopped visited a hospital played her piano translated from the french she had regular work from a publisher it seemed which supplemented her income a little she seldom went out in the evening ive been living alone so long you see that i dont mind it a bit i believe im naturally solitary i dont believe that said jolyon do you know many people very few at waterloo they took a hansom and he drove with her to the door of her mansions squeezing her hand at parting he said you know you could always come to us at robin hill you must let me know everything that happens goodbye irene goodbye she answered softly jolyon climbed back into his cab wondering why he had not asked her to dine and go to the theatre with him solitary starved hungup life that she had hotch potch club he said through the trapdoor as his hansom debouched on to the embankment a man in tophat and overcoat passed walking quickly so close to the wall that he seemed to be scraping it by jove thought jolyon soames himself whats he up to now and stopping the cab round the corner he got out and retraced his steps to where he could see the entrance to the mansions soames had halted in front of them and was looking up at the light in her windows if he goes in thought jolyon what shall i do what have i the right to do what the fellow had said was true she was still his wife absolutely without protection from annoyance well if he goes in he thought i follow and he began moving towards the mansions again soames advanced he was in the very entrance now but suddenly he stopped spun round on his heel and came back towards the river what now thought jolyon in a dozen steps hell recognise me and he turned tail his cousins footsteps kept pace with his own but he reached his cab and got in before soames had turned the corner go on he said through the trap soames figure ranged up alongside hansom he said engaged hallo hallo answered jolyon you the quick suspicion on his cousins face white in the lamplight decided him i can give you a lift he said if youre going west thanks answered soames and got in ive been seeing irene said jolyon when the cab had started indeed you went to see her yesterday yourself i understand i did said soames shes my wife you know the tone the halflifted sneering lip roused sudden anger in jolyon but he subdued it you ought to know best he said but if you want a divorce its not very wise to go seeing her is it one cant run with the hare and hunt with the hounds youre very good to warn me said soames but i have not made up my mind she has said jolyon looking straight before him you cant take things up you know as they were twelve years ago that remains to be seen look here said jolyon shes in a damnable position and i am the only person with any legal say in her affairs except myself retorted soames who am also in a damnable position hers is what she made for herself mine what she made for me i am not at all sure that in her own interests i shant require her to return to me what exclaimed jolyon and a shiver went through his whole body i dont know what you may mean by what answered soames coldly your say in her affairs is confined to paying out her income please bear that in mind in choosing not to disgrace her by a divorce i retained my rights and as i say i am not at all sure that i shant require to exercise them my god ejaculated jolyon and he uttered a short laugh yes said soames and there was a deadly quality in his voice ive not forgotten the nickname your father gave me the man of property im not called names for nothing this is fantastic murmured jolyon well the fellow couldnt force his wife to live with him those days were past anyway and he looked around at soames with the thought is he real this man but soames looked very real sitting square yet almost elegant with the clipped moustache on his pale face and a tooth showing where a lip was lifted in a fixed smile there was a long silence while jolyon thought instead of helping her ive made things worse suddenly soames said it would be the best thing that could happen to her in many ways at those words such a turmoil began taking place in jolyon that he could barely sit still in the cab it was as if he were boxed up with hundreds of thousands of his countrymen boxed up with that something in the national character which had always been to him revolting something which he knew to be extremely natural and yet which seemed to him inexplicable their intense belief in contracts and vested rights their complacent sense of virtue in the exaction of those rights here beside him in the cab was the very embodiment the corporeal sum as it were of the possessive instinct his own kinsman too it was uncanny and intolerable but theres something more in it than that he thought with a sick feeling the dog they say returns to his vomit the sight of her has reawakened something beauty the devils in it as i say said soames i have not made up my mind i shall be obliged if you will kindly leave her quite alone jolyon bit his lips he who had always hated rows almost welcomed the thought of one now i can give you no such promise he said shortly very well said soames then we know where we are ill get down here and stopping the cab he got out without word or sign of farewell jolyon travelled on to his club the first news of the war was being called in the streets but he paid no attention what could he do to help her if only his father were alive he could have done so much but why could he not do all that his father could have done was he not old enough turned fifty and twice married with grownup daughters and a son queer he thought if she were plain i shouldnt be thinking twice about it beauty is the devil when youre sen sitive to it and into the club readingroom he went with a disturbed heart in that very room he and bosinney had talked one summer afternoon he well remembered even now the disguised and secret lecture he had given that young man in the interests of june the diagnosis of the forsytes he had hazarded and how he had wondered what sort of woman it was he was warning him against and now he was almost in want of a warning himself its deuced funny he thought really deuced funny chapter xiv soames discovers what he wants it is so much easier to say then we know where we are than to mean anything particular by the words and in saying them soames did but vent the jealous rankling of his instincts he got out of the cab in a state of wary anger with himself for not having seen irene with jolyon for having seen her and now with his inability to tell exactly what he wanted he had abandoned the cab because he could not bear to remain seated beside his cousin and walking briskly eastwards he thought i wouldnt trust that fellow jolyon a yard once outcast always outcast the chap had a natural sympathy with with laxity he had shied at the word sin because it was too melodramatic for use by a forsyte indecision in desire was to him a new feeling he was like a child between a promised toy and an old one which had been taken away from him and he was astonished at himself only last sunday desire had seemed simple just his freedom and annette ill go and dine there he thought to see her might bring back his singleness of intention calm his exasperation clear his mind the restaurant was fairly full a good many foreigners and folk whom from their appearance he took to be literary or artistic scraps of conversation came his way through the clatter of plates and glasses he distinctly heard the boers sympathised with the british government blamed dont think much of their clientele he thought he went stolidly through his dinner and special coffee without making his presence known and when at last he had finished was careful not to be seen going towards the sanctum of madame lamotte they were as he entered having supper such a much nicerlooking supper than the dinner he had eaten that he felt a kind of grief and they greeted him with a surprise so seemingly genuine that he thought with sudden suspicion i believe they knew i was here all the time he gave annette a look furtive and searching so pretty seemingly so candid could she be angling for him he turned to madame lamotte and said ive been dining here really if she had only known there were dishes she could have recommended what a pity soames was confirmed in his suspicion i must look out what im doing he thought sharply another little cup of very special coffee monsieur a liqueur grand marnier and madame lamotte rose to order these delicacies alone with annette soames said well annette with a defensive little smile about his lips the girl blushed this which last sunday would have set his nerves tingling now gave him much the same feeling a man has when a dog that he owns wriggles and looks at him he had a curious sense of power as if he could have said to her come and kiss me and she would have come and yet it was strange but there seemed another face and form in the room too and the itch in his nerves was it for that or for this he jerked his head towards the restaurant and said you have some queer customers do you like this life annette looked up at him for a moment looked down and played with her fork no she said i do not like it ive got her thought soames if i want her but do i want her she was graceful she was pretty very pretty she was fresh she had taste of a kind his eyes travelled round the little room but the eyes of his mind went another journey a halflight and silvery walls a satinwood piano a woman standing against it reined back as it were from him a woman with white shoulders that he knew and dark eyes that he had sought to know and hair like dull dark amber and as in an artist who strives for the unrealisable and is ever thirsty so there rose in him at that moment the thirst of the old passion he had never satisfied well he said calmly youre young theres everything before you annette shook her head i think sometimes there is nothing before me but hard work i am not so in love with work as mother your mother is a wonder said soames faintly mocking she will never let failure lodge in her house annette sighed it must be wonderful to be rich oh youll be rich some day answered soames still with that faint mockery dont be afraid annette shrugged her shoulders monsieur is very kind and between her pouting lips she put a chocolate yes my dear thought soames theyre very pretty madame lamotte with coffee and liqueur put an end to that colloquy soames did not stay long outside in the streets of soho which always gave him such a feeling of property improperly owned he mused if only irene had given him a son he wouldnt now be squirming after women the thought had jumped out of its little dark sentrybox in his inner consciousness a son something to look forward to something to make the rest of life worth while something to leave himself to some perpetuity of self if i had a son he thought bitterly a proper legal son i could make shift to go on as i used one womans much the same as another after all but as he walked he shook his head no one woman was not the same as another many a time had he tried to think that in the old days of his thwarted married life and he had always failed he was failing now he was trying to think annette the same as that other but she was not she had not the lure of that old passion and irenes my wife he thought my legal wife i have done nothing to put her away from me why shouldnt she come back to me its the right thing the lawful thing it makes no scandal no disturbance if its disagreeable to her but why should it be im not a leper and she shes no longer in love why should he be put to the shifts and the sordid disgraces and the lurking defeats of the divorce court when there she was like an empty house only waiting to be retaken into use and possession by him who legally owned her to one so secretive as soames the thought of reentry into quiet possession of his own property with nothing given away to the world was intensely alluring no he mused im glad i went to see that girl i know now what i want most if only irene will come back ill be as considerate as she wishes she could live her own life but perhaps perhaps she would come round to me there was a lump in his throat and doggedly along by the railings of the green park towards his fathers house he went trying to tread on his shadow walking before him in the brilliant moonlight chapter i part ii chapter i the third generation jolly forsyte was strolling down high street oxford on a november afternoon val dartie was strolling up jolly had just changed out of boating flannels and was on his way to the fryingpan to which he had recently been elected val had just changed out of riding clothes and was on his way to the fire a bookmakers in cornmarket hallo said jolly hallo replied val the cousins had met but twice jolly the secondyear man having invited the freshman to breakfast and last evening they had seen each other again under somewhat exotic circumstances over a tailors in the cornmarket resided one of those privileged young beings called minors whose inheritances are large whose parents are dead whose guardians are remote and whose instincts are vicious at nineteen he had commenced one of those careers attractive and inexplicable to ordinary mortals for whom a single bankruptcy is good as a feast already famous for having the only roulette table then to be found in oxford he was anticipating his expectations at a dazzling rate he outcrummed crum though of a sanguine and rather beefy type which lacked the latters fascinating languor for val it had been in the nature of baptism to be taken there to play roulette in the nature of confirmation to get back into college after hours through a window whose bars were deceptive once during that evening of delight glancing up from the seductive green before him he had caught sight through a cloud of smoke of his cousin standing opposite rouge gagne impair et manque he had not seen him again come in to the fryingpan and have tea said jolly and they went in a stranger seeing them together would have noticed an unseizable resemblance between these second cousins of the third generations of forsytes the same bone formation in face though jollys eyes were darker grey his hair lighter and more wavy tea and buttered buns waiter please said jolly have one of my cigarettes said val i saw you last night how did you do i didnt play i won fifteen quid though desirous of repeating a whimsical comment on gambling he had once heard his father make when youre fleeced youre sick and when you fleece youre sorry jolly contented himself with rotten game i think i was at school with that chap hes an awful fool oh i dont know said val as one might speak in defence of a disparaged god hes a pretty good sport they exchanged whiffs in silence you met my people didnt you said jolly theyre coming up tomorrow val grew a little red really i can give you a rare good tip for the manchester november handicap thanks i only take interest in the classic races you cant make any money over them said val i hate the ring said jolly theres such a row and stink i like the paddock i like to back my judgment answered val jolly smiled his smile was like his fathers i havent got any i always lose money if i bet you have to buy experience of course yes but its all messedup with doing people in the eye of course or theyll do you thats the excitement jolly looked a little scornful what do you do with yourself row no ride and drive about im going to play polo next term if i can get my granddad to stump up thats old uncle james isnt it whats he like older than forty hills said val and always thinking hes going to be ruined i suppose my granddad and he were brothers i dont believe any of that old lot were sportsmen said val they must have worshipped money mine didnt said jolly warmly val flipped the ash off his cigarette moneys only fit to spend he said i wish the deuce i had more jolly gave him that direct upward look of judgment which he had inherited from old jolyon one didnt talk about money and again there was silence while they drank tea and ate the buttered buns where are your people going to stay asked val elaborately casual rainbow what do you think of the war rotten so far the boers arent sports a bit why dont they come out into the open why should they theyve got everything against them except their way of fighting i rather admire them they can ride and shoot admitted val but theyre a lousy lot do you know crum of merton only by sight hes in that fast set too isnt he rather ladida and brummagem val said fixedly hes a friend of mine oh sorry and they sat awkwardly staring past each other having pitched on their pet points of snobbery for jolly was forming himself unconsciously on a set whose motto was we defy you to bore us life isnt half long enough and were going to talk faster and more crisply do more and know more and dwell less on any subject than you can possibly imagine we are the best made of wire and whipcord and val was unconsciously forming himself on a set whose motto was we defy you to interest or excite us we have had every sensation or if we havent we pretend we have we are so exhausted with living that no hours are too small for us we will lose our shirts with equanimity we have flown fast and are past everything all is cigarette smoke bismillah competitive spirit bonedeep in the english was obliging those two young forsytes to have ideals and at the close of a century ideals are mixed the aristocracy had already in the main adopted the jumpingjesus principle though here and there one like crum who was an honourable stood starkly languid for that gamblers nirvana which had been the summum bonum of the old dandies and of the mashers in the eighties and round crum were still gathered a forlorn hope of bluebloods with a plutocratic following but there was between the cousins another far less obvious antipathy coming from the unseizable family resemblance which each perhaps resented or from some halfconsciousness of that old feud persisting still between their branches of the clan formed within them by odd words or halfhints dropped by their elders and jolly tinkling his teaspoon was musing his tiepin and his waistcoat and his drawl and his betting good lord and val finishing his bun was thinking hes rather a young beast i suppose youll be meeting your people he said getting up i wish youd tell them i should like to show them over bnc not that theres anything much there if theyd care to come thanks ill ask them would they lunch ive got rather a decent scout jolly doubted if they would have time youll ask them though very good of you said jolly fully meaning that they should not go but instinctively polite he added youd better come and have dinner with us tomorrow rather what time seventhirty dress no and they parted a subtle antagonism alive within them holly and her father arrived by a midday train it was her first visit to the city of spires and dreams and she was very silent looking almost shyly at the brother who was part of this wonderful place after lunch she wandered examining his household gods with intense curiosity jollys sittingroom was panelled and art represented by a set of bartolozzi prints which had belonged to old jolyon and by college photographs of young men live young men a little heroic and to be compared with her memories of val jolyon also scrutinised with care that evidence of his boys character and tastes jolly was anxious that they should see him rowing so they set forth to the river holly between her brother and her father felt elated when heads were turned and eyes rested on her that they might see him to the best advantage they left him at the barge and crossed the river to the towingpath slight in build for of all the forsytes only old swithin and george were beefy jolly was rowing two in a trial eight he looked very earnest and strenuous with pride jolyon thought him the bestlooking boy of the lot holly as became a sister was more struck by one or two of the others but would not have said so for the world the river was bright that afternoon the meadows lush the trees still beautiful with colour distinguished peace clung around the old city jolyon promised himself a days sketching if the weather held the eight passed a second time spurting home along the barges jollys face was very set so as not to show that he was blown they returned across the river and waited for him oh said jolly in the christ church meadows i had to ask that chap val dartie to dine with us tonight he wanted to give you lunch and show you bnc so i thought id better then you neednt go i dont like him much hollys rather sallow face had become suffused with pink why not oh i dont know he seems to me rather showy and bad form what are his people like dad hes only a second cousin isnt he jolyon took refuge in a smile ask holly he said she saw his uncle i liked val holly answered staring at the ground before her his uncle looked awfully different she stole a glance at jolly from under her lashes did you ever said jolyon with whimsical intention hear our family history my dears its quite a fairy tale the first jolyon forsyte at all events the first we know anything of and that would be your greatgreatgrandfather dwelt in the land of dorset on the edge of the sea being by profession an agriculturalist as your greataunt put it and the son of an agriculturist farmers in fact your grandfather used to call them very small beer he looked at jolly to see how his lordliness was standing it and with the other eye noted hollys malicious pleasure in the slight drop of her brothers face we may suppose him thick and sturdy standing for england as it was before the industrial era began the second jolyon forsyte your greatgrandfather jolly better known as superior dosset forsyte built houses so the chronicle runs begat ten children and migrated to london town it is known that he drank sherry we may suppose him representing the england of napoleons wars and general unrest the eldest of his six sons was the third jolyon your grandfather my dears tea merchant and chairman of companies one of the soundest englishmen who ever lived and to me the dearest jolyons voice had lost its irony and his son and daughter gazed at him solemnly he was just and tenacious tender and young at heart you remember him and i remember him pass to the others your greatuncle james thats young vals grand father had a son called soames whereby hangs a tale of no love lost and i dont think ill tell it you james and the other eight children of superior dosset of whom there are still five alive may be said to have represented victorian england with its principles of trade and individualism at five per cent and your money back if you know what that means at all events theyve turned thirty thousand pounds into a cool million between them in the course of their long lives they never did a wild thing unless it was your greatuncle swithin who i believe was once swindled at thimblerig and was called fourinhand forsyte because he drove a pair their day is passing and their type not altogether for the advantage of the country they were pedestrian but they too were sound i am the fourth jolyon forsyte a poor holder of the name no dad said jolly and holly squeezed his hand yes repeated jolyon a poor specimen representing im afraid nothing but the end of the century unearned income amateurism and individual liberty a different thing from individualism jolly you are the fifth jolyon forsyte old man and you open the ball of the new century as he spoke they turned in through the college gates and holly said its fascinating dad none of them quite knew what she meant jolly was grave the rainbow distinguished as only an oxford hostel can be for lack of modernity provided one small oakpanelled private sitting room in which holly sat to receive whitefrocked shy and alone when the only guest arrived rather as one would touch a moth val took her hand and wouldnt she wear this measly flower it would look ripping in her hair he removed a gardenia from his coat oh no thank you i couldnt but she took it and pinned it at her neck having suddenly remembered that word showy vals buttonhole would give offence and she so much wanted jolly to like him did she realise that val was at his best and quietest in her presence and was that perhaps half the secret of his attraction for her i never said anything about our ride val rather not its just between us by the uneasiness of his hands and the fidgeting of his feet he was giving her a sense of power very delicious a soft feeling too the wish to make him happy do tell me about oxford it must be ever so lovely val admitted that it was frightfully decent to do what you liked the lectures were nothing and there were some very good chaps only he added of course i wish i was in town and could come down and see you holly moved one hand shyly on her knee and her glance dropped you havent forgotten he said suddenly gathering courage that were going madrabbiting together holly smiled oh that was only makebelieve one cant do that sort of thing after ones grown up you know dash it cousins can said val next long vac it begins in june you know and goes on for ever well watch our chance but though the thrill of conspiracy ran through her veins holly shook her head it wont come off she murmured wont it said val fervently whos going to stop it not your father or your brother at this moment jolyon and jolly came in and romance fled into vals patent leather and hollys white satin toes where it itched and tingled during an evening not conspicuous for openheartedness sensitive to atmosphere jolyon soon felt the latent antagonism between the boys and was puzzled by holly so he became un consciously ironical which is fatal to the expansiveness of youth a letter handed to him after dinner reduced him to a silence hardly broken till jolly and val rose to go he went out with them smoking his cigar and walked with his son to the gates of christ church turning back he took out the letter and read it again beneath a lamp dear jolyon soames came again tonight my thirtyseventh birthday you were right i mustnt stay here im going tomorrow to the piedmont hotel but i wont go abroad without seeing you i feel lonely and downhearted yours affectionately irene he folded the letter back into his pocket and walked on astonished at the violence of his feelings what had the fellow said or done he turned into high street down the turf and on among a maze of spires and domes and long college fronts and walls bright or darkshadowed in the strong moonlight in this very heart of englands gentility it was difficult to realise that a lonely woman could be importuned or hunted but what else could her letter mean soames must have been pressing her to go back to him again with public opinion and the law on his side too eighteenninety nine he thought gazing at the broken glass shining on the top of a villa garden wall but when it comes to property were still a heathen people ill go up tomorrow morning i dare say itll be best for her to go abroad yet the thought displeased him why should soames hunt her out of england besides he might follow and out there she would be still more helpless against the attentions of her own husband i must tread warily he thought that fellow could make himself very nasty i didnt like his manner in the cab the other night his thoughts turned to his daughter june could she help once on a time irene had been her greatest friend and now she was a lame duck such as must appeal to junes nature he determined to wire to his daughter to meet him at paddington station retracing his steps towards the rainbow he questioned his own sensations would he be upsetting himself over every woman in like case no he would not the candour of this conclusion discomfited him and finding that holly had gone up to bed he sought his own room but he could not sleep and sat for a long time at his window huddled in an overcoat watching the moonlight on the roofs next door holly too was awake thinking of the lashes above and below vals eyes especially below and of what she could do to make jolly like him better the scent of the gardenia was strong in her little bedroom and pleasant to her and val leaning out of his firstfloor window in bnc was gazing at a moonlit quadrangle without seeing it at all seeing instead holly slim and whitefrocked as she sat beside the fire when he first went in but jolly in his bedroom narrow as a ghost lay with a hand beneath his cheek and dreamed he was with val in one boat rowing a race against him while his father was calling from the towpath two get your hands away there bless you chapter ii soames puts it to the touch of all those radiant firms which emblazon with their windows the west end of london gaves and cortegal were considered by soames the most attractive word just coming into fashion he had never had his uncle swithins taste in precious stones and the abandonment by irene when she left his house in of all the glittering things he had given her had disgusted him with this form of investment but he still knew a diamond when he saw one and during the week before her birthday he had taken occasion on his way into the poultry or his way out therefrom to dally a little before the greater jewellers where one got if not ones moneys worth at least a certain cachet with the goods constant cogitation since his drive with jolyon had convinced him more and more of the supreme importance of this moment in his life the supreme need for taking steps and those not wrong and alongside the dry and reasoned sense that it was now or never with his selfpreservation now or never if he were to range himself and found a family went the secret urge of his senses roused by the sight of her who had once been a passionately desired wife and the conviction that it was a sin against common sense and the decent secrecy of forsytes to waste the wife he had in an opinion on winifreds case dreamer qc he would much have preferred waterbuck but they had made him a judge so late in the day as to rouse the usual suspicion of a political job had advised that they should go forward and obtain restitution of conjugal rights a point which to soames had never been in doubt when they had obtained a decree to that effect they must wait to see if it was obeyed if not it would constitute legal desertion and they should obtain evidence of misconduct and file their petition for divorce all of which soames knew perfectly well they had marked him ten and one this simplicity in his sisters case only made him the more desperate about the difficulty in his own everything in fact was driving him towards the simple solution of irenes return if it were still against the grain with her had he not feelings to subdue injury to forgive pain to forget he at least had never injured her and this was a world of compromise he could offer her so much more than she had now he would be prepared to make a liberal settlement on her which could not be upset he often scrutinised his image in these days he had never been a peacock like that fellow dartie or fancied himself a womans man but he had a certain belief in his own appearance not unjustly for it was wellcoupled and preserved neat healthy pale unblemished by drink or excess of any kind the forsyte jaw and the concentration of his face were in his eyes virtues so far as he could tell there was no feature of him which need inspire dislike thoughts and yearnings with which one lives daily become natural even if farfetched in their inception if he could only give tangible proof enough of his determination to let bygones be bygones and to do all in his power to please her why should she not come back to him he entered gaves and cortegals therefore on the morning of november the th to buy a certain diamond brooch four twentyfive and dirt cheap sir at the money its a ladys brooch there was that in his mood which made him accept without demur and he went on into the poultry with the flat green morocco case in his breast pocket several times that day he opened it to look at the seven soft shining stones in their velvet oval nest if the lady doesnt like it sir happy to exchange it any time but theres no fear of that if only there were not he got through a vast amount of work only soother of the nerves he knew a cablegram came while he was in the office with details from the agent in buenos aires and the name and address of a stewardess who would be prepared to swear to what was necessary it was a timely spur to soames with his rooted distaste for the washing of dirty linen in public and when he set forth by underground to victoria station he received a fresh impetus towards the renewal of his married life from the account in his evening paper of a fashionable divorce suit the homing instinct of all true forsytes in anxiety and trouble the corporate tendency which kept them strong and solid made him choose to dine at park lane he neither could nor would breath a word to his people of his intention too reticent and proud but the thought that at least they would be glad if they knew and wish him luck was heartening james was in lugubrious mood for the fire which the impudence of krugers ultimatum had lit in him had been coldwatered by the poor success of the last month and the exhortations to effort in the times he didnt know where it would end soames sought to cheer him by the continual use of the word buller but james couldnt tell there was colley and he got stuck on that hill and this ladysmith was down in a hollow and altogether it looked to him a pretty kettle of fish he thought they ought to be sending the sailors they were the chaps they did a lot of good in the crimea soames shifted the ground of consolation winifred had heard from val that there had been a rag and a bonfire on guy fawkes day at oxford and that he had escaped detection by blacking his face ah james muttered hes a clever little chap but he shook his head shortly afterwards and remarked that he didnt know what would become of him and looking wistfully at his son murmured on that soames had never had a boy he would have liked a grandson of his own name and now well there it was soames flinched he had not expected such a challenge to disclose the secret in his heart and emily who saw him wince said nonsense james dont talk like that but james not looking anyone in the face muttered on there were roger and nicholas and jolyon they all had grandsons and swithin and timothy had never married he had done his best but he would soon be gone now and as though he had uttered words of profound consolation he was silent eating brains with a fork and a piece of bread and swallowing the bread soames excused himself directly after dinner it was not really cold but he put on his fur coat which served to fortify him against the fits of nervous shivering to which he had been subject all day subconsciously he knew that he looked better thus than in an ordinary black overcoat then feeling the morocco case flat against his heart he sallied forth he was no smoker but he lit a cigarette and smoked it gingerly as he walked along he moved slowly down the row towards knightsbridge timing himself to get to chelsea at ninefifteen what did she do with herself evening after evening in that little hole how mysterious women were one lived alongside and knew nothing of them what could she have seen in that fellow bosinney to send her mad for there was madness after all in what she had done crazy moonstruck madness in which all sense of values had been lost and her life and his life ruined and for a moment he was filled with a sort of exaltation as though he were a man read of in a story who possessed by the christian spirit would restore to her all the prizes of existence forgiving and forgetting and becoming the godfather of her future under a tree opposite knightsbridge barracks where the moonlight struck down clear and white he took out once more the morocco case and let the beams draw colour from those stones yes they were of the first water but at the hard closing snap of the case another cold shiver ran through his nerves and he walked on faster clenching his gloved hands in the pockets of his coat almost hoping she would not be in the thought of how mysterious she was again beset him dining alone there night after night in an evening dress too as if she were making believe to be in society playing the piano to herself not even a dog or cat so far as he had seen and that reminded him suddenly of the mare he kept for station work at mapledurham if ever he went to the stable there she was quite alone half asleep and yet on her home journeys going more freely than on her way out as if longing to be back and lonely in her stable i would treat her well he thought incoherently i would be very careful and all that capacity for home life of which a mocking fate seemed for ever to have deprived him swelled suddenly in soames so that he dreamed dreams opposite south kensington station in the kings road a man came slithering out of a public house playing a concertina soames watched him for a moment dance crazily on the pavement to his own drawling jagged sounds then crossed over to avoid contact with this piece of drunken foolery a night in the lockup what asses people were but the man had noticed his movement of avoidance and streams of genial blasphemy followed him across the street i hope theyll run him in thought soames viciously to have ruffians like that about with women out alone a womans figure in front had induced this thought her walk seemed oddly familiar and when she turned the corner for which he was bound his heart began to beat he hastened on to the corner to make certain yes it was irene he could not mistake her walk in that little drab street she threaded two more turnings and from the last corner he saw her enter her block of flats to make sure of her now he ran those few paces hurried up the stairs and caught her standing at her door he heard the latchkey in the lock and reached her side just as she turned round startled in the open doorway dont be alarmed he said breathless i happened to see you let me come in a minute she had put her hand up to her breast her face was colourless her eyes widened by alarm then seeming to master herself she inclined her head and said very well soames closed the door he too had need to recover and when she had passed into the sittingroom waited a full minute taking deep breaths to still the beating of his heart at this moment so fraught with the future to take out that morocco case seemed crude yet not to take it out left him there before her with no preliminary excuse for coming and in this dilemma he was seized with impatience at all this paraphernalia of excuse and justification this was a scene it could be nothing else and he must face it he heard her voice uncomfortably pathetically soft why have you come again didnt you understand that i would rather you did not he noticed her clothes a dark brown velvet corduroy a sable boa a small round toque of the same they suited her admirably she had money to spare for dress evidently he said abruptly its your birthday i brought you this and he held out to her the green morocco case oh nono soames pressed the clasp the seven stones gleamed out on the pale grey velvet why not he said just as a sign that you dont bear me ill feeling any longer i couldnt soames took it out of the case let me just see how it looks she shrank back he followed thrusting his hand with the brooch in it against the front of her dress she shrank again soames dropped his hand irene he said let bygones be bygones if i can surely you might lets begin again as if nothing had been wont you his voice was wistful and his eyes resting on her face had in them a sort of supplication she who was standing literally with her back against the wall gave a little gulp and that was all her answer soames went on can you really want to live all your days halfdead in this little hole come back to me and ill give you all you want you shall live your own life i swear it he saw her face quiver ironically yes he repeated but i mean it this time ill only ask one thing i just want i just want a son dont look like that i want one its hard his voice had grown hurried so that he hardly knew it for his own and twice he jerked his head back as if struggling for breath it was the sight of her eyes fixed on him dark with a sort of fascinated fright which pulled him together and changed that painful incoherence to anger is it so very unnatural he said between his teeth is it unnatural to want a child from ones own wife you wrecked our life and put this blight on everything we go on only half alive and without any future is it so very unflattering to you that in spite of everything i i still want you for my wife speak for goodness sake do speak irene seemed to try but did not succeed i dont want to frighten you said soames more gently heaven knows i only want you to see that i cant go on like this i want you back i want you irene raised one hand and covered the lower part of her face but her eyes never moved from his as though she trusted in them to keep him at bay and all those years barren and bitter since ah when almost since he had first known her surged up in one great wave of recollection in soames and a spasm that for his life he could not control constricted his face its not too late he said its not if youll only believe it irene uncovered her lips and both her hands made a writhing gesture in front of her breast soames seized them dont she said under her breath but he stood holding on to them trying to stare into her eyes which did not waver then she said quietly i am alone here you wont behave again as you once behaved dropping her hands as though they had been hot irons he turned away was it possible that there could be such relentless unforgiveness could that one act of violent possession be still alive within her did it bar him thus utterly and doggedly he said without looking up i am not going till youve answered me i am offering what few men would bring themselves to offer i want a a reasonable answer and almost with surprise he heard her say you cant have a reasonable answer reason has nothing to do with it you can only have the brutal truth i would rather die soames stared at her oh he said and there intervened in him a sort of paralysis of speech and movement the kind of quivering which comes when a man has received a deadly insult and does not yet know how he is going to take it or rather what it is going to do with him oh he said again as bad as that indeed you would rather die thats pretty i am sorry you wanted me to answer i cant help the truth can i at that queer spiritual appeal soames turned for relief to actuality he snapped the brooch back into its case and put it in his pocket the truth he said theres no such thing with women its nervesnerves he heard the whisper yes nerves dont lie havent you discovered that he was silent obsessed by the thought i will hate this woman i will hate her that was the trouble if only he could he shot a glance at her who stood unmoving against the wall with her head up and her hands clasped for all the world as if she were going to be shot and he said quickly i dont believe a word of it you have a lover if you hadnt you wouldnt be such a such a little idiot he was conscious before the expression in her eyes that he had uttered something of a nonsequitur and dropped back too abruptly into the verbal freedom of his connubial days he turned away to the door but he could not go out something within him that most deep and secret forsyte quality the impossibility of letting go the impossibility of seeing the fantastic and forlorn nature of his own tenacity prevented him he turned about again and there stood with his back against the door as hers was against the wall opposite quite unconscious of anything ridiculous in this separation by the whole width of the room do you ever think of anybody but yourself he said irenes lips quivered then she answered slowly do you ever think that i found out my mistake my hopeless terrible mistake the very first week of our marriage that i went on trying three years you know i went on trying was it for myself soames gritted his teeth god knows what it was ive never understood you i shall never understand you you had everything you wanted and you can have it again and more whats the matter with me i ask you a plain question what is it unconscious of the pathos in that enquiry he went on passionately im not lame im not loathsome im not a boor im not a fool what is it whats the mystery about me her answer was a long sigh he clasped his hands with a gesture that for him was strangely full of expression when i came here tonight i was i hoped i meant everything that i could to do away with the past and start fair again and you meet me with nerves and silence and sighs theres nothing tangible its like its like a spiders web yes that whisper from across the room maddened soames afresh well i dont choose to be in a spiders web ill cut it he walked straight up to her now what he had gone up to her to do he really did not know but when he was close the old familiar scent of her clothes suddenly affected him he put his hands on her shoulders and bent forward to kiss her he kissed not her lips but a little hard line where the lips had been drawn in then his face was pressed away by her hands he heard her say oh no shame compunction sense of futility flooded his whole being he turned on his heel and went straight out chapter iii visit to irene jolyon found june waiting on the platform at paddington she had received his telegram while at breakfast her abode a studio and two bedrooms in a st johns wood garden had been selected by her for the complete independence which it guaranteed unwatched by mrs grundy unhindered by permanent domestics she could receive lame ducks at any hour of day or night and not seldom had a duck without studio of its own made use of junes she enjoyed her freedom and possessed herself with a sort of virginal passion the warmth which she would have lavished on bosinney and of which given her forsyte tenacity he must surely have tired she now expended in championship of the underdogs and budding geniuses of the artistic world she lived in fact to turn ducks into the swans she believed they were the very fervour of her protection warped her judgments but she was loyal and liberal her small eager hand was ever against the oppressions of academic and commercial opinion and though her income was considerable her bank balance was often a minus quantity she had come to paddington station heated in her soul by a visit to eric cobbley a miserable gallery had refused to let that straighthaired genius have his oneman show after all its impudent manager after visiting his studio had expressed the opinion that it would only be a onehorse show from the selling point of view this crowning example of commercial cowardice towards her favourite lame duck and he so hard up with a wife and two children that he had caused her account to be overdrawn was still making the blood glow in her small resolute face and her redgold hair to shine more than ever she gave her father a hug and got into a cab with him having as many fish to fry with him as he with her it became at once a question which would fry them first jolyon had reached the words my dear i want you to come with me when glancing at her face he perceived by her blue eyes moving from side to side like the tail of a preoccupied cat that she was not attending dad is it true that i absolutely cant get at any of my money only the income fortunately my love how perfectly beastly cant it be done somehow there must be a way i know i could buy a small gallery for ten thousand pounds a small gallery murmured jolyon seems a modest desire but your grandfather foresaw it i think cried june vigorously that all this care about money is awful when theres so much genius in the world simply crushed out for want of a little i shall never marry and have children why shouldnt i be able to do some good instead of having it all tied up in case of things which will never come off our name is forsyte my dear replied jolyon in the ironical voice to which his impetuous daughter had never quite grown accustomed and forsytes you know are people who so settle their property that their grandchildren in case they should die before their parents have to make wills leaving the property that will only come to themselves when their parents die do you follow that nor do i but its a fact anyway we live by the principle that so long as there is a possibility of keeping wealth in the family it must not go out if you die unmarried your money goes to jolly and holly and their children if they marry isnt it pleasant to know that whatever you do you can none of you be destitute but cant i borrow the money jolyon shook his head you could rent a gallery no doubt if you could manage it out of your income june uttered a contemptuous sound yes and have no income left to help anybody with my dear child murmured jolyon wouldnt it come to the same thing no said june shrewdly i could buy for ten thousand that would only be four hundred a year but i should have to pay a thousand a year rent and that would only leave me five hundred if i had the gallery dad think what i could do i could make eric cobbleys name in no time and ever so many others names worth making make themselves in time when theyre dead did you ever know anybody living my dear improved by having his name made yes you said june pressing his arm jolyon started i he thought oh ah now shes going to ask me to do something we take it out we forsytes each in our different ways june came closer to him in the cab darling she said you buy the gallery and ill pay you four hundred a year for it then neither of us will be any the worse off besides its a splendid investment jolyon wriggled dont you think he said that for an artist to buy a gallery is a bit dubious besides ten thousand pounds is a lump and im not a commercial character june looked at him with admiring appraisement of course youre not but youre awfully businesslike and im sure we could make it pay itll be a perfect way of scoring off those wretched dealers and people and again she squeezed her fathers arm jolyons face expressed quizzical despair where is this desirable gallery splendidly situated i suppose just off cork street ah thought jolyon i knew it was just off somewhere now for what i want out of her well ill think of it but not just now you remember irene i want you to come with me and see her soames is after her again she might be safer if we could give her asylum somewhere the word asylum which he had used by chance was of all most calculated to rouse junes interest irene i havent seen her since of course id love to help her it was jolyons turn to squeeze her arm in warm admiration for this spirited generoushearted little creature of his begetting irene is proud he said with a sidelong glance in sudden doubt of junes discretion shes difficult to help we must tread gently this is the place i wired her to expect us lets send up our cards i cant bear soames said june as she got out he sneers at everything that isnt successful irene was in what was called the ladies drawingroom of the piedmont hotel nothing if not morally courageous june walked straight up to her former friend kissed her cheek and the two settled down on a sofa never sat on since the hotels foundation jolyon could see that irene was deeply affected by this simple forgiveness so soames has been worrying you he said i had a visit from him last night he wants me to go back to him youre not going of course cried june irene smiled faintly and shook her head but his position is horrible she murmured its his own fault he ought to have divorced you when he could jolyon remembered how fervently in the old days june had hoped that no divorce would smirch her dead and faithless lovers name let us hear what irene is going to do he said irenes lips quivered but she spoke calmly id better give him fresh excuse to get rid of me how horrible cried june what else can i do out of the question said jolyon very quietly sans amour he thought she was going to cry but getting up quickly she half turned her back on them and stood regaining control of herself june said suddenly well i shall go to soames and tell him he must leave you alone what does he want at his age a child its not unnatural a child cried june scornfully of course to leave his money to if he wants one badly enough let him take somebody and have one then you can divorce him and he can marry her jolyon perceived suddenly that he had made a mistake to bring june her violent partizanship was fighting soames battle it would be best for irene to come quietly to us at robin hill and see how things shape of course said june only irene looked full at jolyon in all his many attempts afterwards to analyze that glance he never could succeed no i should only bring trouble on you all i will go abroad he knew from her voice that this was final the irrelevant thought flashed through him well i could see her there but he said dont you think you would be more helpless abroad in case he followed i dont know i can but try june sprang up and paced the room its all horrible she said why should people be tortured and kept miserable and helpless year after year by this disgusting sanctimonious law but someone had come into the room and june came to a standstill jolyon went up to irene do you want money no and would you like me to let your flat yes jolyon please when shall you be going tomorrow you wont go back there in the meantime will you this he said with an anxiety strange to himself no ive got all i want here youll send me your address she put out her hand to him i feel youre a rock built on sand answered jolyon pressing her hand hard but its a pleasure to do anything at any time remember that and if you change your mind come along june say goodbye june came from the window and flung her arms round irene dont think of him she said under her breath enjoy yourself and bless you with a memory of tears in irenes eyes and of a smile on her lips they went away extremely silent passing the lady who had interrupted the interview and was turning over the papers on the table opposite the national gallery june exclaimed of all undignified beasts and horrible laws but jolyon did not respond he had something of his fathers balance and could see things impartially even when his emotions were roused irene was right soames position was as bad or worse than her own as for the law it catered for a human nature of which it took a naturally low view and feeling that if he stayed in his daughters company he would in one way or another commit an indiscretion he told her he must catch his train back to oxford and hailing a cab left her to turners watercolours with the promise that he would think over that gallery but he thought over irene instead pity they said was akin to love if so he was certainly in danger of loving her for he pitied her profoundly to think of her drifting about europe so handicapped and lonely i hope to goodness shell keep her head he thought she might easily grow desperate in fact now that she had cut loose from her poor threads of occupation he couldnt imagine how she would go on so beautiful a creature hopeless and fair game for anyone in his exasperation was more than a little fear and jealousy women did strange things when they were driven into corners i wonder what soames will do now he thought a rotten idiotic state of things and i suppose they would say it was her own fault very preoccupied and sore at heart he got into his train mislaid his ticket and on the platform at oxford took his hat off to a lady whose face he seemed to remember without being able to put a name to her not even when he saw her having tea at the rainbow chapter iv where forsytes fear to tread quivering from the defeat of his hopes with the green morocco case still flat against his heart soames revolved thoughts bitter as death a spiders web walking fast and noting nothing in the moonlight he brooded over the scene he had been through over the memory of her figure rigid in his grasp and the more he brooded the more certain he became that she had a lover her words i would sooner die were ridiculous if she had not even if she had never loved him she had made no fuss until bosinney came on the scene no she was in love again or she would not have made that melodramatic answer to his proposal which in all the circumstances was reasonable very well that simplified matters ill take steps to know where i am he thought ill go to polteeds the first thing tomorrow morning but even in forming that resolution he knew he would have trouble with himself he had employed polteeds agency several times in the routine of his profession even quite lately over darties case but he had never thought it possible to employ them to watch his own wife it was too insulting to himself he slept over that project and his wounded pride or rather kept vigil only while shaving did he suddenly remember that she called herself by her maiden name of heron polteed would not know at first at all events whose wife she was would not look at him obsequiously and leer behind his back she would just be the wife of one of his clients and that would be true for was he not his own solicitor he was literally afraid not to put his design into execution at the first possible moment lest after all he might fail himself and making warmson bring him an early cup of coffee he stole out of the house before the hour of breakfast he walked rapidly to one of those small west end streets where polteeds and other firms ministered to the virtues of the wealthier classes hitherto he had always had polteed to see him in the poultry but he well knew their address and reached it at the opening hour in the outer office a room furnished so cosily that it might have been a moneylenders he was attended by a lady who might have been a schoolmistress i wish to see mr claud polteed he knows me never mind my name to keep everybody from knowing that he soames forsyte was reduced to having his wife spied on was the overpowering consideration mr claud polteed so different from mr lewis polteed was one of those men with dark hair slightly curved noses and quick brown eyes who might be taken for jews but are really phoenicians he received soames in a room hushed by thickness of carpet and curtains it was in fact confidentially furnished without trace of document anywhere to be seen greeting soames deferentially he turned the key in the only door with a certain ostentation if a client sends for me he was in the habit of saying he takes what precaution he likes if he comes here we convince him that we have no leakages i may safely say we lead in security if in nothing elsenow sir what can i do for you soames gorge had risen so that he could hardly speak it was absolutely necessary to hide from this man that he had any but professional interest in the matter and mechanically his face assumed its sideway smile ive come to you early like this because theres not an hour to lose if he lost an hour he might fail himself yet have you a really trustworthy woman free mr polteed unlocked a drawer produced a memorandum ran his eyes over it and locked the drawer up again yes he said the very woman soames had seated himself and crossed his legs nothing but a faint flush which might have been his normal complexion betrayed him send her off at once then to watch a mrs irene heron of flat c truro mansions chelsea till further notice precisely said mr polteed divorce i presume and he blew into a speakingtube mrs blanch in i shall want to speak to her in ten minutes deal with any reports yourself resumed soames and send them to me personally marked confidential sealed and registered my client exacts the utmost secrecy mr polteed smiled as though saying you are teaching your grandmother my dear sir and his eyes slid over soames face for one unprofessional instant make his mind perfectly easy he said do you smoke no said soames understand me nothing may come of this if a name gets out or the watching is suspected it may have very serious consequences mr polteed nodded i can put it into the cipher category under that system a name is never mentioned we work by numbers he unlocked another drawer and took out two slips of paper wrote on them and handed one to soames keep that sir its your key i retain this duplicate the case well call x the party watched will be the watcher the mansions yourself i should say your firm my firm myself in case you should have to mention your client in writing i have called him any person we suspect will be a second person any special hint or instruction while were about it no said soames that is every consideration compatible again mr polteed nodded expense soames shrugged in reason he answered curtly and got up keep it entirely in your own hands entirely said mr polteed appearing suddenly between him and the door i shall be seeing you in that other case before long good morning sir his eyes slid unprofessionally over soames once more and he unlocked the door good morning said soames looking neither to right nor left out in the street he swore deeply quietly to himself a spiders web and to cut it he must use this spidery secret unclean method so utterly repugnant to one who regarded his private life as his most sacred piece of property but the die was cast he could not go back and he went on into the poultry and locked away the green morocco case and the key to that cipher destined to make crystalclear his domestic bankruptcy odd that one whose life was spent in bringing to the public eye all the private coils of property the domestic disagreements of others should dread so utterly the public eye turned on his own and yet not odd for who should know so well as he the whole unfeeling process of legal regulation he worked hard all day winifred was due at four oclock he was to take her down to a conference in the temple with dreamer qc and waiting for her he reread the letter he had caused her to write the day of darties departure requiring him to return dear montague i have received your letter with the news that you have left me for ever and are on your way to buenos aires it has naturally been a great shock i am taking this earliest opportunity of writing to tell you that i am prepared to let bygones be bygones if you will return to me at once i beg you to do so i am very much upset and will not say any more now i am sending this letter registered to the address you left at your club please cable to me your still affectionate wife winifred dartie ugh what bitter humbug he remembered leaning over winifred while she copied what he had pencilled and how she had said laying down her pen suppose he comes soames in such a strange tone of voice as if she did not know her own mind he wont come he had answered till hes spent his money thats why we must act at once annexed to the copy of that letter was the original of darties drunken scrawl from the iseeum club soames could have wished it had not been so manifestly penned in liquor just the sort of thing the court would pitch on he seemed to hear the judges voice say you took this seriously seriously enough to write him as you did do you think he meant it never mind the fact was clear that dartie had sailed and had not returned annexed also was his cabled answer impossible return dartie soames shook his head if the whole thing were not disposed of within the next few months the fellow would turn up again like a bad penny it saved a thousand a year at least to get rid of him besides all the worry to winifred and his father i must stiffen dreamers back he thought we must push it on winifred who had adopted a kind of halfmourning which became her fair hair and tall figure very well arrived in james barouche drawn by james pair soames had not seen it in the city since his father retired from business five years ago and its incongruity gave him a shock times are changing he thought one doesnt know whatll go next top hats even were scarcer he enquired after val val said winifred wrote that he was going to play polo next term she thought he was in a very good set she added with fashionably disguised anxiety will there be much publicity about my affair soames must it be in the papers its so bad for him and the girls with his own calamity all raw within him soames answered the papers are a pushing lot its very difficult to keep things out they pretend to be guarding the publics morals and they corrupt them with their beastly reports but we havent got to that yet were only seeing dreamer today on the restitution question of course he understands that its to lead to a divorce but you must seem genuinely anxious to get dartie back you might practice that attitude today winifred sighed oh what a clown montys been she said soames gave her a sharp look it was clear to him that she could not take her dartie seriously and would go back on the whole thing if given half a chance his own instinct had been firm in this matter from the first to save a little scandal now would only bring on his sister and her children real disgrace and perhaps ruin later on if dartie were allowed to hang on to them going downhill and spending the money james would leave his daughter though it was all tied up that fellow would milk the settlements somehow and make his family pay through the nose to keep him out of bankruptcy or even perhaps gaol they left the shining carriage with the shining horses and the shininghatted servants on the embankment and walked up to dreamer qcs chambers in crown office row mr bellby is here sir said the clerk mr dreamer will be ten minutes mr bellby the junior not as junior as he might have been for soames only employed barristers of established reputation it was indeed something of a mystery to him how barristers ever managed to establish that which made him employ them mr bellby was seated taking a final glance through his papers he had come from court and was in wig and gown which suited a nose jutting out like the handle of a tiny pump his small shrewd blue eyes and rather protruding lower lip no better man to supplement and stiffen dreamer the introduction to winifred accomplished they leaped the weather and spoke of the war soames interrupted suddenly if he doesnt comply we cant bring proceedings for six months i want to get on with the matter bellby mr bellby who had the ghost of an irish brogue smiled at winifred and murmured the laws delays mrs dartie six months repeated soames itll drive it up to june we shant get the suit on till after the long vacation we must put the screw on bellby he would have all his work cut out to keep winifred up to the scratch mr dreamer will see you now sir they filed in mr bellby going first and soames escorting winifred after an interval of one minute by his watch dreamer qc in a gown but divested of wig was standing before the fire as if this conference were in the nature of a treat he had the leathery rather oily complexion which goes with great learning a considerable nose with glasses perched on it and little greyish whiskers he luxuriated in the perpetual cocking of one eye and the concealment of his lower with his upper lip which gave a smothered turn to his speech he had a way too of coming suddenly round the corner on the person he was talking to this with a disconcerting tone of voice and a habit of growling before he began to speak had secured a reputation second in probate and divorce to very few having listened eye cocked to mr bellbys breezy recapitulation of the facts he growled and said i know all that and coming round the corner at winifred smothered the words we want to get him back dont we mrs dartie soames interposed sharply my sisters position of course is intolerable dreamer growled exactly now can we rely on the cabled refusal or must we wait till after christmas to give him a chance to have written thats the point isnt it the sooner soames began what do you say bellby said dreamer coming round his corner mr bellby seemed to sniff the air like a hound we wont be on till the middle of december weve no need to give um more rope than that no said soames why should my sister be incommoded by his choosing to go to jericho said dreamer again coming round his corner quite so people oughtnt to go to jericho ought they mrs dartie and he raised his gown into a sort of fantail i agree we can go forward is there anything more nothing at present said soames meaningly i wanted you to see my sister dreamer growled softly delighted good evening and let fall the protection of his gown they filed out winifred went down the stairs soames lingered in spite of himself he was impressed by dreamer the evidence is all right i think he said to bellby between ourselves if we dont get the thing through quick we never may dyou think he understands that ill make um said bellby good man though good man soames nodded and hastened after his sister he found her in a draught biting her lips behind her veil and at once said the evidence of the stewardess will be very complete winifreds face hardened she drew herself up and they walked to the carriage and all through that silent drive back to green street the souls of both of them revolved a single thought why oh why should i have to expose my misfortune to the public like this why have to employ spies to peer into my private troubles they were not of my making chapter v jolly sits in judgment the possessive instinct which so determinedly balked was animating two members of the forsyte family towards riddance of what they could no longer possess was hardening daily in the british body politic nicholas originally so doubtful concerning a war which must affect property had been heard to say that these boers were a pigheaded lot they were causing a lot of expense and the sooner they had their lesson the better he would send out wolseley seeing always a little further than other people whence the most considerable fortune of all the forsytes he had perceived already that buller was not the man a bull of a chap who just went butting and if they didnt look out ladysmith would fall this was early in december so that when black week came he was enabled to say to everybody i told you so during that week of gloom such as no forsyte could remember very young nicholas attended so many drills in his corps the devils own that young nicholas consulted the family physician about his sons health and was alarmed to find that he was perfectly sound the boy had only just eaten his dinners and been called to the bar at some expense and it was in a way a nightmare to his father and mother that he should be playing with military efficiency at a time when military efficiency in the civilian population might conceivably be wanted his grandfather of course poohpoohed the notion too thoroughly educated in the feeling that no british war could be other than little and professional and profoundly distrustful of imperial commitments by which moreover he stood to lose for he owned de beers now going down fast more than a sufficient sacrifice on the part of his grandson at oxford however rather different sentiments prevailed the inherent effervescence of conglomerate youth had during the two months of the term before black week been gradually crystallising out into vivid oppositions normal adolescence ever in england of a conservative tendency though not taking things too seriously was vehement for a fight to a finish and a good licking for the boers of this larger faction val dartie was naturally a member radical youth on the other hand a small but perhaps more vocal body was for stopping the war and giving the boers autonomy until black week however the groups were amorphous without sharp edges and argument remained but academic jolly was one of those who knew not where he stood a streak of his grandfather old jolyons love of justice prevented him from seeing one side only moreover in his set of the best there was a jumpingjesus of extremely advanced opinions and some personal magnetism jolly wavered his father too seemed doubtful in his views and though as was proper at the age of twenty he kept a sharp eye on his father watchful for defects which might still be remedied still that father had an air which gave a sort of glamour to his creed of ironic tolerance artists of course were notoriously hamletlike and to this extent one must discount for ones father even if one loved him but jolyons original view that to put your nose in where you arent wanted as the uitlanders had done and then work the oracle till you get on top is not being quite the clean potato had whether founded in fact or no a certain attraction for his son who thought a deal about gentility on the other hand jolly could not abide such as his set called cranks and vals set called smugs so that he was still balancing when the clock of black week struck one two three came those ominous repulses at stormberg magersfontein colenso the sturdy english soul reacting after the first cried ah but methuen after the second ah but buller then in inspissated gloom hardened and jolly said to himself no damn it weve got to lick the beggars now i dont care whether were right or wrong and if he had known it his father was thinking the same thought that next sunday last of the term jolly was bidden to wine with one of the best after the second toast buller and damnation to the boers drunk no heel taps in the college burgundy he noticed that val dartie also a guest was looking at him with a grin and saying something to his neighbour he was sure it was disparaging the last boy in the world to make himself conspicuous or cause public disturbance jolly grew rather red and shut his lips the queer hostility he had always felt towards his second cousin was strongly and suddenly reinforced all right he thought you wait my friend more wine than was good for him as the custom was helped him to remember when they all trooped forth to a secluded spot to touch val on the arm what did you say about me in there maynt i say what i like no well i said you were a proboer and so you are youre a liar dyou want a row of course but not here in the garden all right come on they went eyeing each other askance unsteady and unflinching they climbed the garden railings the spikes on the top slightly ripped vals sleeve and occupied his mind jollys mind was occupied by the thought that they were going to fight in the precincts of a college foreign to them both it was not the thing but never mind the young beast they passed over the grass into very nearly darkness and took off their coats youre not screwed are you said jolly suddenly i cant fight you if youre screwed no more than you all right then without shaking hands they put themselves at once into postures of defence they had drunk too much for science and so were especially careful to assume correct attitudes until jolly smote val almost accidentally on the nose after that it was all a dark and ugly scrimmage in the deep shadow of the old trees with no one to call time till battered and blown they unclinched and staggered back from each other as a voice said your names young gentlemen at this bland query spoken from under the lamp at the garden gate like some demand of a god their nerves gave way and snatching up their coats they ran at the railings shinned up them and made for the secluded spot whence they had issued to the fight here in dim light they mopped their faces and without a word walked ten paces apart to the college gate they went out silently val going towards the broad along the brewery jolly down the lane towards the high his head still fumed was busy with regret that he had not displayed more science passing in review the counters and knockout blows which he had not delivered his mind strayed on to an imagined combat infinitely unlike that which he had just been through infinitely gallant with sash and sword with thrust and parry as if he were in the pages of his beloved dumas he fancied himself la mole and aramis bussy chicot and dartagnan rolled into one but he quite failed to envisage val as coconnas brissac or rochefort the fellow was just a confounded cousin who didnt come up to cocker never mind he had given him one or two proboer the word still rankled and thoughts of en listing jostled his aching head of riding over the veldt firing gallantly while the boers rolled over like rabbits and turning up his smarting eyes he saw the stars shining between the house tops of the high and himself lying out on the karoo whatever that was rolled in a blanket with his rifle ready and his gaze fixed on a glittering heaven he had a fearful head next morning which he doctored as became one of the best by soaking it in cold water brewing strong coffee which he could not drink and only sipping a little hock at lunch the legend that some fool had run into him round a corner accounted for a bruise on his cheek he would on no account have mentioned the fight for on second thoughts it fell far short of his standards the next day he went down and travelled through to robin hill nobody was there but june and holly for his father had gone to paris he spent a restless and unsettled vacation quite out of touch with either of his sisters june indeed was occupied with lame ducks whom as a rule jolly could not stand especially that eric cobbley and his family hopeless outsiders who were always littering up the house in the vacation and between holly and himself there was a strange division as if she were beginning to have opinions of her own which was so unnecessary he punched viciously at a ball rode furiously but alone in richmond park making a point of jumping the stiff high hurdles put up to close certain worn avenues of grass keeping his nerve in he called it jolly was more afraid of being afraid than most boys are he bought a rifle too and put a range up in the home field shooting across the pond into the kitchengarden wall to the peril of gardeners with the thought that some day perhaps he would enlist and save south africa for his country in fact now that they were appealing for yeomanry recruits the boy was thoroughly upset ought he to go none of the best so far as he knew and he was in correspondence with several were thinking of joining if they had been making a move he would have gone at once very compet itive and with a strong sense of form he could not bear to be left behind in anything but to do it off his own bat might look like swagger because of course it wasnt really necessary besides he did not want to go for the other side of this young forsyte recoiled from leaping before he looked it was altogether mixed pickles within him hot and sickly pickles and he became quite unlike his serene and rather lordly self and then one day he saw that which moved him to uneasy wrath two riders in a glade of the park close to the ham gate of whom she on the lefthand was most assuredly holly on her silver roan and he on the righthand as assuredly that squirt val dartie his first impulse was to urge on his own horse and demand the meaning of this portent tell the fellow to bunk and take holly home his second to feel that he would look a fool if they refused he reined his horse in behind a tree then perceived that it was equally impossible to spy on them nothing for it but to go home and await her coming sneaking out with that young bounder he could not consult with june because she had gone up that morning in the train of eric cobbley and his lot and his father was still in that rotten paris he felt that this was emphatically one of those moments for which he had trained himself assiduously at school where he and a boy called brent had frequently set fire to newspapers and placed them in the centre of their studies to accustom them to coolness in moments of danger he did not feel at all cool waiting in the stableyard idly stroking the dog balthasar who queasy as an old fat monk and sad in the absence of his master turned up his face panting with gratitude for this attention it was half an hour before holly came flushed and ever so much prettier than she had any right to look he saw her look at him quickly guiltily of course then followed her in and taking her arm conducted her into what had been their grand fathers study the room not much used now was still vaguely haunted for them both by a presence with which they associated tenderness large drooping white moustaches the scent of cigar smoke and laughter here jolly in the prime of his youth before he went to school at all had been wont to wrestle with his grand father who even at eighty had an irresistible habit of crooking his leg here holly perched on the arm of the great leather chair had stroked hair curving silvery over an ear into which she would whisper secrets through that window they had all three sallied times without number to cricket on the lawn and a mysterious game called wopsydoozle not to be understood by outsiders which made old jolyon very hot here once on a warm night holly had appeared in her nighty having had a bad dream to have the clutch of it released and here jolly having begun the day badly by introducing fizzy magnesia into mademoiselle beauces newlaid egg and gone on to worse had been sent down in the absence of his father to the ensuing dialogue now my boy you mustnt go on like this well she boxed my ears gran so i only boxed hers and then she boxed mine again strike a lady thatll never do have you begged her pardon not yet then you must go and do it at once come along but she began it gran and she had two to my one my dear it was an outrageous thing to do well she lost her temper and i didnt lose mine come along you come too then gran well this time only and they had gone hand in hand here where the waverley novels and byrons works and gibbons roman empire and humboldts cosmos and the bronzes on the mantelpiece and that masterpiece of the oily school dutch fishingboats at sunset were fixed as fate and for all sign of change old jolyon might have been sitting there still with legs crossed in the arm chair and domed forehead and deep eyes grave above the times here they came those two grandchildren and jolly said i saw you and that fellow in the park the sight of blood rushing into her cheeks gave him some satisfaction she ought to be ashamed well she said jolly was surprised he had expected more or less do you know he said weightily that he called me a proboer last term and i had to fight him who won jolly wished to answer i should have but it seemed beneath him look here he said whats the meaning of it without telling anybody why should i dad isnt here why shouldnt i ride with him youve got me to ride with i think hes an awful young rotter holly went pale with anger he isnt its your own fault for not liking him and slipping past her brother she went out leaving him staring at the bronze venus sitting on a tortoise which had been shielded from him so far by his sisters dark head under her soft felt riding hat he felt queerly disturbed shaken to his young foundations a lifelong domination lay shattered round his feet he went up to the venus and mechanically inspected the tortoise why didnt he like val dartie he could not tell ignorant of family history barely aware of that vague feud which had started thirteen years before with bosinneys defection from june in favour of soames wife knowing really almost nothing about val he was at sea he just did dislike him the question however was what should he do val dartie it was true was a secondcousin but it was not the thing for holly to go about with him and yet to tell of what he had chanced on was against his creed in this dilemma he went and sat in the old leather chair and crossed his legs it grew dark while he sat there staring out through the long window at the old oaktree ample yet bare of leaves becoming slowly just a shape of deeper dark printed on the dusk grandfather he thought without sequence and took out his watch he could not see the hands but he set the repeater going five oclock his grandfathers first gold hunter watch buttersmooth with age all the milling worn from it and dented with the mark of many a fall the chime was like a little voice from out of that golden age when they first came from st johns wood london to this house came driving with grandfather in his carriage and almost instantly took to the trees trees to climb and grand father watering the geraniumbeds below what was to be done tell dad he must come home confide in june only she was so so sudden do nothing and trust to luck after all the vac would soon be over go up and see val and warn him off but how get his address holly wouldnt give it him a maze of paths a cloud of possibilities he lit a cigarette when he had smoked it halfway through his brow relaxed almost as if some thin old hand had been passed gently over it and in his ear something seemed to whisper do nothing be nice to holly be nice to her my dear and jolly heaved a sigh of contentment blowing smoke through his nostrils but up in her room divested of her habit holly was still frowning he is not he is not were the words which kept forming on her lips chapter vi jolyon in two minds a little private hotel over a wellknown restaurant near the gare st lazare was jolyons haunt in paris he hated his fellow forsytes abroad vapid as fish out of water in their welltrodden runs the opera rue de rivoli and moulin rouge their air of having come because they wanted to be somewhere else as soon as possible annoyed him but no other forsyte came near this haunt where he had a wood fire in his bedroom and the coffee was excel lent paris was always to him more attractive in winter the acrid savour from woodsmoke and chestnutroasting braziers the sharpness of the wintry sunshine on bright rays the open cafes defying keenaired winter the selfcontained brisk boulevard crowds all informed him that in winter paris possessed a soul which like a migrant bird in high summer flew away he spoke french well had some friends knew little places where pleasant dishes could be met with queer types observed he felt philosophic in paris the edge of irony sharpened life took on a subtle purposeless meaning became a bunch of flavours tasted a darkness shot with shifting gleams of light when in the first week of december he decided to go to paris he was far from admitting that irenes presence was influencing him he had not been there two days before he owned that the wish to see her had been more than half the reason in england one did not admit what was natural he had thought it might be well to speak to her about the letting of her flat and other matters but in paris he at once knew better there was a glamour over the city on the third day he wrote to her and received an answer which procured him a pleasurable shiver of the nerves my dear jolyon it will be a happiness for me to see you irene he took his way to her hotel on a bright day with a feeling such as he had often had going to visit an adored picture no woman so far as he remembered had ever inspired in him this special sen suous and yet impersonal sensation he was going to sit and feast his eyes and come away knowing her no better but ready to go and feast his eyes again tomorrow such was his feeling when in the tarnished and ornate little lounge of a quiet hotel near the river she came to him preceded by a small pageboy who uttered the word madame and vanished her face her smile the poise of her figure were just as he had pictured and the expression of her face said plainly a friend well he said what news poor exile none nothing from soames nothing i have let the flat for you and like a good steward i bring you some money how do you like paris while he put her through this catechism it seemed to him that he had never seen lips so fine and sensitive the lower lip curving just a little upwards the upper touched at one corner by the least conceivable dimple it was like discovering a woman in what had hitherto been a sort of soft and breathedon statue almost impersonally admired she owned that to be alone in paris was a little difficult and yet paris was so full of its own life that it was often she confessed as innocuous as a desert besides the english were not liked just now that will hardly be your case said jolyon you should appeal to the french it has its disadvantages jolyon nodded well you must let me take you about while im here well start tomorrow come and dine at my pet restaurant and well go to the operacomique it was the beginning of daily meetings jolyon soon found that for those who desired a static condition of the affections paris was at once the first and last place in which to be friendly with a pretty woman revelation was alighting like a bird in his heart singing elle est ton reve elle est ton reve sometimes this seemed natural sometimes ludicrous a bad case of elderly rapture having once been ostracised by society he had never since had any real regard for conventional morality but the idea of a love which she could never return and how could she at his age hardly mounted beyond his subconscious mind he was full too of resentment at the waste and loneliness of her life aware of being some comfort to her and of the pleasure she clearly took in their many little outings he was amiably desirous of doing and saying nothing to destroy that pleasure it was like watching a starved plant draw up water to see her drink in his companionship so far as they could tell no one knew her address except himself she was unknown in paris and he but little known so that discretion seemed unnecessary in those walks talks visits to concerts picturegalleries theatres little dinners expeditions to versailles st cloud even fontainebleau and time fled one of those full months without past to it or future what in his youth would certainly have been headlong passion was now perhaps as deep a feeling but far gentler tempered to protective companionship by admiration hopelessness and a sense of chivalry arrested in his veins at least so long as she was there smiling and happy in their friendship and always to him more beautiful and spiritually responsive for her philosophy of life seemed to march in admirable step with his own conditioned by emotion more than by reason ironically mistrustful susceptible to beauty almost passionately humane and tolerant yet subject to instinctive rigidities of which as a mere man he was less capable and during all this companionable month he never quite lost that feeling with which he had set out on the first day as if to visit an adored work of art a wellnigh impersonal desire the future inexorable pendant to the present he took care not to face for fear of breaking up his untroubled manner but he made plans to renew this time in places still more delightful where the sun was hot and there were strange things to see and paint the end came swiftly on the th of january with a telegram have enlisted in imperial yeomanry jolly jolyon received it just as he was setting out to meet her at the louvre it brought him up with a round turn while he was lotus eating here his boy whose philosopher and guide he ought to be had taken this great step towards danger hardship perhaps even death he felt disturbed to the soul realising suddenly how irene had twined herself round the roots of his being thus threatened with severance the tie between them for it had become a kind of tie no longer had impersonal quality the tranquil enjoyment of things in common jolyon perceived was gone for ever he saw his feeling as it was in the nature of an infatuation ridiculous perhaps but so real that sooner or later it must disclose itself and now as it seemed to him he could not must not make any such disclosure the news of jolly stood inexorably in the way he was proud of this enlistment proud of his boy for going off to fight for the country for on jolyons proboerism too black week had left its mark and so the end was reached before the beginning well luckily he had never made a sign when he came into the gallery she was standing before the virgin of the rocks graceful absorbed smiling and unconscious have i to give up seeing that he thought its unnatural so long as shes willing that i should see her he stood unnoticed watching her storing up the image of her figure envying the picture on which she was bending that long scrutiny twice she turned her head towards the entrance and he thought thats for me at last he went forward look he said she read the telegram and he heard her sigh that sigh too was for him his position was really cruel to be loyal to his son he must just shake her hand and go to be loyal to the feeling in his heart he must at least tell her what that feeling was could she would she understand the silence in which he was gazing at that picture im afraid i must go home at once he said at last i shall miss all this awfully so shall i but of course you must go well said jolyon holding out his hand meeting her eyes a flood of feeling nearly mastered him such is life he said take care of yourself my dear he had a stumbling sensation in his legs and feet as if his brain refused to steer him away from her from the doorway he saw her lift her hand and touch its fingers with her lips he raised his hat solemnly and did not look back again chapter vii dartie versus dartie the suit dartie versus dartie for restitution of those conjugal rights concerning which winifred was at heart so deeply undecided followed the laws of subtraction towards day of judgment this was not reached before the courts rose for christmas but the case was third on the list when they sat again winifred spent the christmas holidays a thought more fashionably than usual with the matter locked up in her lowcut bosom james was particularly liberal to her that christmas expressing thereby his sympathy and relief at the approaching dissolution of her marriage with that precious rascal which his old heart felt but his old lips could not utter the disappearance of dartie made the fall in consols a comparatively small matter and as to the scandal the real animus he felt against that fellow and the increasing lead which property was attaining over reputation in a true forsyte about to leave this world served to drug a mind from which all allusions to the matter except his own were studiously kept what worried him as a lawyer and a parent was the fear that dartie might suddenly turn up and obey the order of the court when made that would be a pretty howdedo the fear preyed on him in fact so much that in presenting winifred with a large christmas cheque he said its chiefly for that chap out there to keep him from coming back it was of course to pitch away good money but all in the nature of insurance against that bankruptcy which would no longer hang over him if only the divorce went through and he questioned winifred rigorously until she could assure him that the money had been sent poor woman it cost her many a pang to send what must find its way into the vanitybag of that creature soames hearing of it shook his head they were not dealing with a forsyte reasonably tenacious of his purpose it was very risky without knowing how the land lay out there still it would look well with the court and he would see that dreamer brought it out i wonder he said suddenly where that ballet goes after the argentine never omitting a chance of reminder for he knew that winifred still had a weakness if not for dartie at least for not laundering him in public though not good at showing admiration he admitted that she was behaving extremely well with all her children at home gaping like young birds for news of their father imogen just on the point of coming out and val very restive about the whole thing he felt that val was the real heart of the matter to winifred who certainly loved him beyond her other children the boy could spoke the wheel of this divorce yet if he set his mind to it and soames was very careful to keep the proximity of the preliminary proceedings from his nephews ears he did more he asked him to dine at the remove and over vals cigar introduced the subject which he knew to be nearest to his heart i hear he said that you want to play polo up at oxford val became less recumbent in his chair rather he said well continued soames thats a very expensive business your grandfather isnt likely to consent to it unless he can make sure that hes not got any other drain on him and he paused to see whether the boy understood his meaning vals thick dark lashes concealed his eyes but a slight grimace appeared on his wide mouth and he muttered i suppose you mean my dad yes said soames im afraid it depends on whether he continues to be a drag or not and said no more letting the boy dream it over but val was also dreaming in those days of a silverroan palfrey and a girl riding it though crum was in town and an introduction to cynthia dark to be had for the asking val did not ask indeed he shunned crum and lived a life strange even to himself except in so far as accounts with tailor and livery stable were concerned to his mother his sisters his young brother he seemed to spend this vacation in seeing fellows and his evenings sleepily at home they could not propose anything in daylight that did not meet with the one response sorry ive got to see a fellow and he was put to extraordinary shifts to get in and out of the house unobserved in riding clothes until being made a member of the goats club he was able to transport them there where he could change unregarded and slip off on his hack to richmond park he kept his growing sentiment religiously to himself not for a world would he breathe to the fellows whom he was not seeing anything so ridiculous from the point of view of their creed and his but he could not help its destroying his other appetites it was coming between him and the legitimate pleasures of youth at last on its own in a way which must he knew make him a milksop in the eyes of crum all he cared for was to dress in his last created riding togs and steal away to the robin hill gate where presently the silver roan would come demurely sidling with its slim and darkhaired rider and in the glades bare of leaves they would go off side by side not talking very much riding races sometimes and sometimes holding hands more than once of an evening in a moment of expansion he had been tempted to tell his mother how this shy sweet cousin had stolen in upon him and wrecked his life but bitter experience that all persons above thirtyfive were spoilsports prevented him after all he supposed he would have to go through with college and she would have to come out before they could be married so why complicate things so long as he could see her sisters were teasing and unsympathetic beings a brother worse so there was no one to confide in ah and this beastly divorce business what a misfortune to have a name which other people hadnt if only he had been called gordon or scott or howard or something fairly common but dartie there wasnt another in the directory one might as well have been named morkin for all the covert it afforded so matters went on till one day in the middle of january the silverroan palfrey and its rider were missing at the tryst lingering in the cold he debated whether he should ride on to the house but jolly might be there and the memory of their dark encounter was still fresh within him one could not be always fighting with her brother so he returned dismally to town and spent an evening plunged in gloom at breakfast next day he noticed that his mother had on an unfamiliar dress and was wearing her hat the dress was black with a glimpse of peacock blue the hat black and large she looked exceptionally well but when after breakfast she said to him come in here val and led the way to the drawingroom he was at once beset by qualms winifred carefully shut the door and passed her handkerchief over her lips inhaling the violette de parme with which it had been soaked val thought has she found out about holly her voice interrupted are you going to be nice to me dear boy val grinned doubtfully will you come with me this morning ive got to see began val but something in her face stopped him i say he said you dont mean yes i have to go to the court this morning already that d d business which he had almost succeeded in forgetting since nobody ever mentioned it in selfcommiseration he stood picking little bits of skin off his fingers then noticing that his mothers lips were all awry he said impulsively all right mother ill come the brutes what brutes he did not know but the expression exactly summed up their joint feeling and restored a measure of equanimity i suppose id better change into a shooter he muttered escaping to his room he put on the shooter a higher collar a pearl pin and his neatest grey spats to a somewhat blasphemous accompaniment looking at himself in the glass he said well im damned if im going to show anything and went down he found his grandfathers carriage at the door and his mother in furs with the appearance of one going to a mansion house assembly they seated themselves side by side in the closed barouche and all the way to the courts of justice val made but one allusion to the business in hand therell be nothing about those pearls will there the little tufted white tails of winifreds muff began to shiver oh no she said itll be quite harmless today your grandmother wanted to come too but i wouldnt let her i thought you could take care of me you look so nice val just pull your coat collar up a little more at the back thats right if they bully you began val oh they wont i shall be very cool its the only way they wont want me to give evidence or anything no dear its all arranged and she patted his hand the determined front she was putting on it stayed the turmoil in vals chest and he busied himself in drawing his gloves off and on he had taken what he now saw was the wrong pair to go with his spats they should have been grey but were deerskin of a dark tan whether to keep them on or not he could not decide they arrived soon after ten it was his first visit to the law courts and the building struck him at once by jove he said as they passed into the hall thisd make four or five jolly good racket courts soames was awaiting them at the foot of some stairs here you are he said without shaking hands as if the event had made them too familiar for such formalities its happerly browne court i we shall be on first a sensation such as he had known when going in to bat was playing now in the top of vals chest but he followed his mother and uncle doggedly looking at no more than he could help and thinking that the place smelled fuggy people seemed to be lurking everywhere and he plucked soames by the sleeve i say uncle youre not going to let those beastly papers in are you soames gave him the sideway look which had reduced many to silence in its time in here he said you neednt take off your furs winifred val entered behind them nettled and with his head up in this confounded hole everybody and there were a good many of them seemed sitting on everybody elses knee though really divided from each other by pews and val had a feeling that they might all slip down together into the well this however was but a momentary vision of mahogany and black gowns and white blobs of wigs and faces and papers all rather secret and whispery before he was sitting next his mother in the front row with his back to it all glad of her violette de parme and taking off his gloves for the last time his mother was looking at him he was suddenly conscious that she had really wanted him there next to her and that he counted for something in this business all right he would show them squaring his shoulders he crossed his legs and gazed inscrutably at his spats but just then an old johnny in a gown and long wig looking awfully like a funny raddled woman came through a door into the high pew opposite and he had to uncross his legs hastily and stand up with everybody else dartie versus dartie it seemed to val unspeakably disgusting to have ones name called out like this in public and suddenly conscious that someone nearly behind him had begun talking about his family he screwed his face round to see an old bewigged buffer who spoke as if he were eating his own words queerlooking old cuss the sort of man he had seen once or twice dining at park lane and punishing the port he knew now where they dug them up all the same he found the old buffer quite fascinating and would have continued to stare if his mother had not touched his arm reduced to gazing before him he fixed his eyes on the judges face instead why should that old sportsman with his sarcastic mouth and his quickmoving eyes have the power to meddle with their private affairs hadnt he affairs of his own just as many and probably just as nasty and there moved in val like an illness all the deepseated individualism of his breed the voice behind him droned along differences about money matters extravagance of the respondent what a word was that his father strained situation frequent absences on the part of mr dartie my client very rightly your ludship will agree was anxious to check a course but lead to ruin remonstrated gambling at cards and on the racecourse thats right thought val pile it on crisis early in october when the respondent wrote her this letter from his club val sat up and his ears burned i propose to read it with the emendations necessary to the epistle of a gentleman who has been shall we say dining me lud old brute thought val flushing deeper youre not paid to make jokes you will not get the chance to insult me again in my own house i am leaving the country tomorrow its played out an expression your ludship not unknown in the mouths of those who have not met with conspicuous success sniggering owls thought val and his flush deepened i am tired of being insulted by you my client will tell your ludship that these socalled insults consisted in her calling him the limit a very mild expression i venture to suggest in all the circumstances val glanced sideways at his mothers impassive face it had a hunted look in the eyes poor mother he thought and touched her arm with his own the voice behind droned on i am going to live a new life m d and next day me lud the respondent left by the steamship tuscarora for buenos aires since then we have nothing from him but a cabled refusal in answer to the letter which my client wrote the following day in great distress begging him to return to her with your ludships permission i shall now put mrs dartie in the box when his mother rose val had a tremendous impulse to rise too and say look here im going to see you jolly well treat her decently he subdued it however heard her saying the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and looked up she made a rich figure of it in her furs and large hat with a slight flush on her cheekbones calm matteroffact and he felt proud of her thus confronting all these confounded lawyers the examination began knowing that this was only the preliminary to divorce val followed with a certain glee the questions framed so as to give the impression that she really wanted his father back it seemed to him that they were foxing old bagwigs finely and he received a most unpleasant jar when the judge said suddenly now why did your husband leave you not because you called him the limit you know val saw his uncle lift his eyes to the witness box without moving his face heard a shuffle of papers behind him and instinct told him that the issue was in peril had uncle soames and the old buffer behind made a mess of it his mother was speaking with a slight drawl no my lord but it had gone on a long time what had gone on our differences about money but you supplied the money do you suggest that he left you to better his position the brute the old brute and nothing but the brute thought val suddenly he smells a rat hes trying to get at the pastry and his heart stood still if if he did then of course he would know that his mother didnt really want his father back his mother spoke again a thought more fashionably no my lord but you see i had refused to give him any more money it took him a long time to believe that but he did at last and when he did i see you had refused but youve sent him some since my lord i wanted him back and you thought that would bring him i dont know my lord i acted on my fathers advice something in the judges face in the sound of the papers behind him in the sudden crossing of his uncles legs told val that she had made just the right answer crafty he thought by jove what humbug it all is the judge was speaking just one more question mrs dartie are you still fond of your husband vals hands slack behind him became fists what business had that judge to make things human suddenly to make his mother speak out of her heart and say what perhaps she didnt know herself before all these people it wasnt decent his mother answered rather low yes my lord val saw the judge nod wish i could take a cockshy at your head he thought irreverently as his mother came back to her seat beside him witnesses to his fathers departure and continued absence followed one of their own maids even which struck val as particularly beastly there was more talking all humbug and then the judge pronounced the decree for restitution and they got up to go val walked out behind his mother chin squared eyelids drooped doing his level best to despise everybody his mothers voice in the corridor roused him from an angry trance you behaved beautifully dear it was such a comfort to have you your uncle and i are going to lunch all right said val i shall have time to go and see that fellow and parting from them abruptly he ran down the stairs and out into the air he bolted into a hansom and drove to the goats club his thoughts were on holly and what he must do before her brother showed her this thing in tomorrows paper when val had left them soames and winifred made their way to the cheshire cheese he had suggested it as a meeting place with mr bellby at that early hour of noon they would have it to themselves and winifred had thought it would be amusing to see this farfamed hostelry having ordered a light repast to the consternation of the waiter they awaited its arrival together with that of mr bellby in silent reaction after the hour and a halfs suspense on the tenterhooks of publicity mr bellby entered presently preceded by his nose as cheerful as they were glum well they had got the decree of restitution and what was the matter with that quite said soames in a suitably low voice but we shall have to begin again to get evidence hell probably try the divorce it will look fishy if it comes out that we knew of misconduct from the start his questions showed well enough that he doesnt like this restitution dodge pho said mr bellby cheerily hell forget why man hell have tried a hundred cases between now and then besides hes bound by precedent to give ye your divorce if the evidence is satisfactory we wont let um know that mrs dartie had knowledge of the facts dreamer did it very nicely hes got a fatherly touch about um soames nodded and i compliment ye mrs dartie went on mr bellby yeve a natural gift for giving evidence steady as a rock here the waiter arrived with three plates balanced on one arm and the remark i urried up the pudden sir youll find plenty o lark in it today mr bellby applauded his forethought with a dip of his nose but soames and winifred looked with dismay at their light lunch of gravified brown masses touching them gingerly with their forks in the hope of distinguishing the bodies of the tasty little song givers having begun however they found they were hungrier than they thought and finished the lot with a glass of port apiece conversation turned on the war soames thought ladysmith would fall and it might last a year bellby thought it would be over by the summer both agreed that they wanted more men there was nothing for it but complete victory since it was now a question of prestige winifred brought things back to more solid ground by saying that she did not want the divorce suit to come on till after the summer holidays had begun at oxford then the boys would have forgotten about it before val had to go up again the london season too would be over the lawyers reassured her an interval of six months was necessary after that the earlier the better people were now beginning to come in and they parted soames to the city bellby to his chambers winifred in a hansom to park lane to let her mother know how she had fared the issue had been so satisfactory on the whole that it was considered advisable to tell james who never failed to say day after day that he didnt know about winifreds affair he couldnt tell as his sands ran out the importance of mundane matters became increasingly grave to him as if he were feeling i must make the most of it and worry well i shall soon have nothing to worry about he received the report grudgingly it was a newfangled way of going about things and he didnt know but he gave winifred a cheque saying i expect youll have a lot of expense thats a new hat youve got on why doesnt val come and see us winifred promised to bring him to dinner soon and going home she sought her bedroom where she could be alone now that her husband had been ordered back into her custody with a view to putting him away from her for ever she would try once more to find out from her sore and lonely heart what she really wanted chapter viii the challenge the morning had been misty verging on frost but the sun came out while val was jogging towards the roehampton gate whence he would canter on to the usual tryst his spirits were rising rapidly there had been nothing so very terrible in the mornings proceedings beyond the general disgrace of violated privacy if we were engaged he thought what happens wouldnt matter he felt indeed like human society which kicks and clamours at the results of matrimony and hastens to get married and he galloped over the winterdried grass of richmond park fearing to be late but again he was alone at the trysting spot and this second defection on the part of holly upset him dreadfully he could not go back without seeing her today emerging from the park he proceeded towards robin hill he could not make up his mind for whom to ask suppose her father were back or her sister or brother were in he decided to gamble and ask for them all first so that if he were in luck and they were not there it would be quite natural in the end to ask for holly while if any of them were in an excuse for a ride must be his saving grace only miss holly is in sir oh thanks might i take my horse round to the stables and would you say her cousin mr val dartie when he returned she was in the hall very flushed and shy she led him to the far end and they sat down on a wide windowseat ive been awfully anxious said val in a low voice whats the matter jolly knows about our riding is he in no but i expect he will be soon then cried val and diving forward he seized her hand she tried to withdraw it failed gave up the attempt and looked at him wistfully first of all he said i want to tell you something about my family my dad you know isnt altogether i mean hes left my mother and theyre trying to divorce him so theyve ordered him to come back you see youll see that in the paper tomorrow her eyes deepened in colour and fearful interest her hand squeezed his but the gambler in val was roused now and he hurried on of course theres nothing very much at present but there will be i expect before its over divorce suits are beastly you know i wanted to tell you because because you ought to know if and he began to stammer gazing at her troubled eyes if if youre going to be a darling and love me holly i love you ever so and i want to be engaged he had done it in a manner so inadequate that he could have punched his own head and dropping on his knees he tried to get nearer to that soft troubled face you do love me dont you if you dont i there was a moment of silence and suspense so awful that he could hear the sound of a mowing machine far out on the lawn pretending there was grass to cut then she swayed forward her free hand touched his hair and he gasped oh holly her answer was very soft oh val he had dreamed of this moment but always in an imperative mood as the masterful young lover and now he felt humble touched trembly he was afraid to stir off his knees lest he should break the spell lest if he did she should shrink and deny her own surrender so tremulous was she in his grasp with her eyelids closed and his lips nearing them her eyes opened seemed to swim a little he pressed his lips to hers suddenly he sprang up there had been footsteps a sort of startled grunt he looked round no one but the long curtains which barred off the outer hall were quivering my god who was that holly too was on her feet jolly i expect she whispered val clenched fists and resolution all right he said i dont care a bit now were engaged and striding towards the curtains he drew them aside there at the fireplace in the hall stood jolly with his back elaborately turned val went forward jolly faced round on him i beg your pardon for hearing he said with the best intentions in the world val could not help admiring him at that moment his face was clear his voice quiet he looked somehow distinguished as if acting up to principle well val said abruptly its nothing to you oh said jolly you come this way and he crossed the hall val followed at the study door he felt a touch on his arm hollys voice said im coming too no said jolly yes said holly jolly opened the door and they all three went in once in the little room they stood in a sort of triangle on three corners of the worn turkey carpet awkwardly upright not looking at each other quite incapable of seeing any humour in the situation val broke the silence holly and i are engaged jolly stepped back and leaned against the lintel of the window this is our house he said im not going to insult you in it but my fathers away im in charge of my sister youve taken advantage of me i didnt mean to said val hotly i think you did said jolly if you hadnt meant to youd have spoken to me or waited for my father to come back there were reasons said val what reasons about my family ive just told her i wanted her to know before things happen jolly suddenly became less distinguished youre kids he said and you know you are i am not a kid said val you are youre not twenty well what are you i am twenty said jolly only just anyway im as good a man as you jollys face crimsoned then clouded some struggle was evidently taking place in him and val and holly stared at him so clearly was that struggle marked they could even hear him breathing then his face cleared up and became oddly resolute well see that he said i dare you to do what im going to do dare me jolly smiled yes he said dare you and i know very well you wont a stab of misgiving shot through val this was riding very blind i havent forgotten that youre a fireeater said jolly slowly and i think thats about all you are or that you called me a proboer val heard a gasp above the sound of his own hard breathing and saw hollys face poked a little forward very pale with big eyes yes went on jolly with a sort of smile we shall soon see im going to join the imperial yeomanry and i dare you to do the same mr val dartie vals head jerked on its stem it was like a blow between the eyes so utterly unthought of so extreme and ugly in the midst of his dreaming and he looked at holly with eyes grown suddenly touchingly haggard sit down said jolly take your time think it over well and he himself sat down on the arm of his grandfathers chair val did not sit down he stood with hands thrust deep into his breeches pocketshands clenched and quivering the full awfulness of this decision one way or the other knocked at his mind with double knocks as of an angry postman if he did not take that dare he was disgraced in hollys eyes and in the eyes of that young enemy her brute of a brother yet if he took it ah then all would vanish her face her eyes her hair her kisses just begun take your time said jolly again i dont want to be unfair and they both looked at holly she had recoiled against the bookshelves reaching to the ceiling her dark head leaned against gibbons roman empire her eyes in a sort of soft grey agony were fixed on val and he who had not much gift of insight had suddenly a gleam of vision she would be proud of her brother that enemy she would be ashamed of him his hands came out of his pockets as if lifted by a spring all right he said done hollys face oh it was queer he saw her flush start forward he had done the right thing her face was shining with wistful admiration jolly stood up and made a little bow as who should say youve passed tomorrow then he said well go together recovering from the impetus which had carried him to that decision val looked at him maliciously from under his lashes all right he thought one to you i shall have to join but ill get back on you somehow and he said with dignity i shall be ready well meet at the main recruiting office then said jolly at twelve oclock and opening the window he went out on to the terrace conforming to the creed which had made him retire when he surprised them in the hall the confusion in the mind of val thus left alone with her for whom he had paid this sudden price was extreme the mood of showing off was still however uppermost one must do the wretched thing with an air we shall get plenty of riding and shooting anyway he said thats one comfort and it gave him a sort of grim pleasure to hear the sigh which seemed to come from the bottom of her heart oh the warll soon be over he said perhaps we shant even have to go out i dont care except for you he would be out of the way of that beastly divorce it was an illwind he felt her warm hand slip into his jolly thought he had stopped their loving each other did he he held her tightly round the waist looking at her softly through his lashes smiling to cheer her up promising to come down and see her soon feeling somehow six inches taller and much more in command of her than he had ever dared feel before many times he kissed her before he mounted and rode back to town so swiftly on the least provocation does the possessive instinct flourish and grow chapter ix dinner at james dinner parties were not now given at james in park lane to every house the moment comes when master or mistress is no longer up to it no more can nine courses be served to twenty mouths above twenty fine white expanses nor does the household cat any longer wonder why she is suddenly shut up so with something like excitement emily who at seventy would still have liked a little feast and fashion now and then ordered dinner for six instead of two herself wrote a number of foreign words on cards and arranged the flowers mimosa from the riviera and white roman hyacinths not from rome there would only be of course james and herself soames winifred val and imogen but she liked to pretend a little and dally in imagination with the glory of the past she so dressed herself that james remarked what are you putting on that thing for youll catch cold but emily knew that the necks of women are protected by love of shining unto fourscore years and she only answered let me put you on one of those dickies i got you james then youll only have to change your trousers and put on your velvet coat and there youll be val likes you to look nice dicky said james youre always wasting your money on something but he suffered the change to be made till his neck also shone murmuring vaguely hes an extravagant chap im afraid a little brighter in the eye with rather more colour than usual in his cheeks he took his seat in the drawingroom to wait for the sound of the frontdoor bell ive made it a proper dinner party emily said comfortably i thought it would be good practice for imogen she must get used to it now shes coming out james uttered an indeterminate sound thinking of imogen as she used to climb about his knee or pull christmas crackers with him shell be pretty he muttered i shouldnt wonder she is pretty said emily she ought to make a good match there you go murmured james shed much better stay at home and look after her mother a second dartie carrying off his pretty granddaughter would finish him he had never quite forgiven emily for having been as much taken in by montague dartie as he himself had been wheres warmson he said suddenly i should like a glass of madeira tonight theres champagne james james shook his head no body he said i cant get any good out of it emily reached forward on her side of the fire and rang the bell your master would like a bottle of madeira opened warmson no no said james the tips of his ears quivering with vehemence and his eyes fixed on an object seen by him alone look here warmson you go to the inner cellar and on the middle shelf of the end bin on the left youll see seven bottles take the one in the centre and dont shake it its the last of the madeira i had from mr jolyon when we came in here never been moved it ought to be in prime condition still but i dont know i cant tell very good sir responded the withdrawing warmson i was keeping it for our golden wedding said james suddenly but i shant live three years at my age nonsense james said emily dont talk like that i ought to have got it up myself murmured james hell shake it as likely as not and he sank into silent recollection of long moments among the open gasjets the cobwebs and the good smell of winesoaked corks which had been appetiser to so many feasts in the wine from that cellar was written the history of the forty odd years since he had come to the park lane house with his young bride and of the many generations of friends and acquaintances who had passed into the unknown its depleted bins preserved the record of family festivity all the marriages births deaths of his kith and kin and when he was gone there it would be and he didnt know what would become of it itd be drunk or spoiled he shouldnt wonder from that deep reverie the entrance of his son dragged him followed very soon by that of winifred and her two eldest they went down arminarm james with imogen the debutante because his pretty grandchild cheered him soames with winifred emily with val whose eyes lighting on the oysters brightened this was to be a proper full blowout with fizz and port and he felt in need of it after what he had done that day as yet undivulged after the first glass or two it became pleasant to have this bombshell up his sleeve this piece of sensational patriotism or example rather of personal daring to display for his pleasure in what he had done for his queen and country was so far entirely personal he was now a blood indissolubly connected with guns and horses he had a right to swagger not of course that he was going to he should just announce it quietly when there was a pause and glancing down the menu he determined on bombe aux fraises as the proper moment there would be a certain solemnity while they were eating that once or twice before they reached that rosy summit of the dinner he was attacked by remembrance that his grandfather was never told anything still the old boy was drinking madeira and looking jolly fit besides he ought to be pleased at this setoff to the disgrace of the divorce the sight of his uncle opposite too was a sharp incentive he was so far from being a sportsman that it would be worth a lot to see his face besides better to tell his mother in this way than privately which might upset them both he was sorry for her but after all one couldnt be expected to feel much for others when one had to part from holly his grandfathers voice travelled to him thinly val try a little of the madeira with your ice you wont get that up at college val watched the slow liquid filling his glass the essential oil of the old wine glazing the surface inhaled its aroma and thought now for it it was a rich moment he sipped and a gentle glow spread in his veins already heated with a rapid look round he said i joined the imperial yeomanry today granny and emptied his glass as though drinking the health of his own act what it was his mothers desolate little word young jolly forsyte and i went down there together you didnt sign from uncle soames rather we go into camp on monday i say cried imogen all looked at james he was leaning forward with his hand behind his ear whats that he said whats he saying i cant hear emily reached forward to pat vals hand its only that val has joined the yeomanry james its very nice for him hell look his best in uniform joined the rubbish came from james tremulously loud you cant see two yards before your nose he hell have to go out there why hell be fighting before he knows where he is val saw imogens eyes admiring him and his mother still and fashionable with her handkerchief before her lips suddenly his uncle spoke youre under age i thought of that smiled val i gave my age as twentyone he heard his grandmothers admiring well val that was plucky of you was conscious of warmson deferentially filling his champagne glass and of his grandfathers voice moaning i dont know whatll become of you if you go on like this imogen was patting his shoulder his uncle looking at him sidelong only his mother sat unmoving till affected by her stillness val said its all right you know we shall soon have them on the run i only hope i shall come in for something he felt elated sorry tremendously important all at once this would show uncle soames and all the forsytes how to be sportsmen he had certainly done something heroic and exceptional in giving his age as twentyone emilys voice brought him back to earth you mustnt have a second glass james warmson wont they be astonished at timothys burst out imogen id give anything to see their faces do you have a sword val or only a popgun what made you his uncles voice produced a slight chill in the pit of vals stomach made him how answer that he was grateful for his grandmothers comfortable well i think its very plucky of val im sure hell make a splendid soldier hes just the figure for it we shall all be proud of him what had young jolly forsyte to do with it why did you go together pursued soames uncannily relentless i thought you werent friendly with him im not mumbled val but i wasnt going to be beaten by him he saw his uncle look at him quite differently as if approving his grandfather was nodding too his grandmother tossing her head they all approved of his not being beaten by that cousin of his there must be a reason val was dimly conscious of some disturbing point outside his range of vision as it might be the unlocated centre of a cyclone and staring at his uncles face he had a quite unaccountable vision of a woman with dark eyes gold hair and a white neck who smelt nice and had pretty silken clothes which he had liked feeling when he was quite small by jove yes aunt irene she used to kiss him and he had bitten her arm once playfully because he liked it so soft his grandfather was speaking whats his father doing hes away in paris val said staring at the very queer expression on his uncles face like like that of a snarling dog artists said james the word coming from the very bottom of his soul broke up the dinner opposite his mother in the cab going home val tasted the after fruits of heroism like medlars overripe she only said indeed that he must go to his tailors at once and have his uniform properly made and not just put up with what they gave him but he could feel that she was very much upset it was on his lips to console her with the spoken thought that he would be out of the way of that beastly divorce but the presence of imogen and the knowledge that his mother would not be out of the way restrained him he felt aggrieved that she did not seem more proud of him when imogen had gone to bed he risked the emotional im awfully sorry to have to leave you mother well i must make the best of it we must try and get you a commission as soon as we can then you wont have to rough it so do you know any drill val not a scrap i hope they wont worry you much i must take you about to get the things tomorrow goodnight kiss me with that kiss soft and hot between his eyes and those words i hope they wont worry you much in his ears he sat down to a cigarette before a dying fire the heat was out of him the glow of cutting a dash it was all a damned heartaching bore ill be even with that chap jolly he thought trailing up the stairs past the room where his mother was biting her pillow to smother a sense of desolation which was trying to make her sob and soon only one of the diners at james was awake soames in his bedroom above his fathers so that fellow jolyon was in paris what was he doing there hanging round irene the last report from polteed had hinted that there might be something soon could it be this that fellow with his beard and his cursed amused way of speaking son of the old man who had given him the nickname man of property and bought the fatal house from him soames had ever resented having had to sell the house at robin hill never forgiven his uncle for having bought it or his cousin for living in it reckless of the cold he threw his window up and gazed out across the park bleak and dark the january night little sound of traffic a frost coming bare trees a star or two ill see polteed tomorrow he thought by god im mad i think to want her still that fellow if um no chapter x death of the dog balthasar jolyon who had crossed from calais by night arrived at robin hill on sunday morning he had sent no word beforehand so walked up from the station entering his domain by the coppice gate coming to the log seat fashioned out of an old fallen trunk he sat down first laying his overcoat on it lumbago he thought thats what love ends in at my time of life and suddenly irene seemed very near just as she had been that day of rambling at fontainebleau when they had sat on a log to eat their lunch hauntingly near odour drawn out of fallen leaves by the palefiltering sunlight soaked his nostrils im glad it isnt spring he thought with the scent of sap and the song of birds and the bursting of the blossoms it would have been unbearable i hope i shall be over it by then old fool that i am and picking up his coat he walked on into the field he passed the pond and mounted the hill slowly near the top a hoarse barking greeted him up on the lawn above the fernery he could see his old dog balthasar the animal whose dim eyes took his master for a stranger was warning the world against him jolyon gave his special whistle even at that distance of a hundred yards and more he could see the dawning recognition in the obese brownwhite body the old dog got off his haunches and his tail closecurled over his back began a feeble excited fluttering he came waddling forward gathered momentum and disappeared over the edge of the fernery jolyon expected to meet him at the wicket gate but balthasar was not there and rather alarmed he turned into the fernery on his fat side looking up with eyes already glazing the old dog lay what is it my poor old man cried jolyon balthasars curled and fluffy tail just moved his filming eyes seemed saying i cant get up master but im glad to see you jolyon knelt down his eyes very dimmed could hardly see the slowly ceasing heave of the dogs side he raised the head a little very heavy what is it dear man where are you hurt the tail fluttered once the eyes lost the look of life jolyon passed his hands all over the inert warm bulk there was nothing the heart had simply failed in that obese body from the emotion of his masters return jolyon could feel the muzzle where a few whitish bristles grew cooling already against his lips he stayed for some minutes kneeling with his hand beneath the stiffening head the body was very heavy when he bore it to the top of the field leaves had drifted there and he strewed it with a covering of them there was no wind and they would keep him from curious eyes until the afternoon ill bury him myself he thought eighteen years had gone since he first went into the st johns wood house with that tiny puppy in his pocket strange that the old dog should die just now was it an omen he turned at the gate to look back at that russet mound then went slowly towards the house very choky in the throat june was at home she had come down hotfoot on hearing the news of jollys enlistment his patriotism had conquered her feeling for the boers the atmosphere of his house was strange and pocketty when jolyon came in and told them of the dog balthasars death the news had a unifying effect a link with the past had snapped the dog balthasar two of them could remember nothing before his day to june he represented the last years of her grandfather to jolyon that life of domestic stress and aesthetic struggle before he came again into the kingdom of his fathers love and wealth and he was gone in the afternoon he and jolly took picks and spades and went out to the field they chose a spot close to the russet mound so that they need not carry him far and carefully cutting off the surface turf began to dig they dug in silence for ten minutes and then rested well old man said jolyon so you thought you ought yes answered jolly i dont want to a bit of course how exactly those words represented jolyons own state of mind i admire you for it old boy i dont believe i should have done it at your age too much of a forsyte im afraid but i suppose the type gets thinner with each generation your son if you have one may be a pure altruist who knows he wont be like me then dad im beastly selfish no my dear that you clearly are not jolly shook his head and they dug again strange life a dogs said jolyon suddenly the only fourfooter with rudiments of altruism and a sense of god jolly looked at his father do you believe in god dad ive never known at so searching a question from one to whom it was impossible to make a light reply jolyon stood for a moment feeling his back tried by the digging what do you mean by god he said there are two irreconcilable ideas of god theres the unknowable creative principle one believes in that and theres the sum of altruism in man naturally one believes in that i see that leaves out christ doesnt it jolyon stared christ the link between those two ideas out of the mouth of babes here was orthodoxy scientifically explained at last the sublime poem of the christ life was mans attempt to join those two irreconcilable conceptions of god and since the sum of human altruism was as much a part of the unknowable creative principle as anything else in nature and the universe a worse link might have been chosen after all funny how one went through life without seeing it in that sort of way what do you think old man he said jolly frowned of course my first year we talked a good bit about that sort of thing but in the second year one gives it up i dont know why its awfully interesting jolyon remembered that he also had talked a good deal about it his first year at cambridge and given it up in his second i suppose said jolly its the second god you mean that old balthasar had a sense of yes or he would never have burst his poor old heart because of something outside himself but wasnt that just selfish emotion really jolyon shook his head no dogs are not pure forsytes they love something outside themselves jolly smiled well i think im one he said you know i only enlisted because i dared val dartie to but why we bar each other said jolly shortly ah muttered jolyon so the feud went on unto the third generation this modern feud which had no overt expression shall i tell the boy about it he thought but to what end if he had to stop short of his own part and jolly thought its for holly to let him know about that chap if she doesnt it means she doesnt want him told and i should be sneaking anyway ive stopped it id better leave well alone so they dug on in silence till jolyon said now old man i think its big enough and resting on their spades they gazed down into the hole where a few leaves had drifted already on a sunset wind i cant bear this part of it said jolyon suddenly let me do it dad he never cared much for me jolyon shook his head well lift him very gently leaves and all id rather not see him again ill take his head now with extreme care they raised the old dogs body whose faded tan and white showed here and there under the leaves stirred by the wind they laid it heavy cold and unresponsive in the grave and jolly spread more leaves over it while jolyon deeply afraid to show emotion before his son began quickly shovelling the earth on to that still shape there went the past if only there were a joyful future to look forward to it was like stamping down earth on ones own life they replaced the turf carefully on the smooth little mound and grateful that they had spared each others feelings returned to the house arminarm chapter xi timothy stays the rot on forsyte change news of the enlistment spread fast together with the report that june not to be outdone was going to become a red cross nurse these events were so extreme so subversive of pure forsyteism as to have a binding effect upon the family and timothys was thronged next sunday afternoon by members trying to find out what they thought about it all and exchange with each other a sense of family credit giles and jesse hayman would no longer defend the coast but go to south africa quite soon jolly and val would be following in april as to june well you never knew what she would really do the retirement from spion kop and the absence of any good news from the seat of war imparted an air of reality to all this clinched in startling fashion by timothy the youngest of the old forsytes scarcely eighty in fact popularly supposed to resemble their father superior dosset even in his bestknown characteristic of drinking sherry had been invisible for so many years that he was almost mythical a long generation had elapsed since the risks of a publishers business had worked on his nerves at the age of forty so that he had got out with a mere thirtyfive thousand pounds in the world and started to make his living by careful investment putting by every year at compound interest he had doubled his capital in forty years without having once known what it was like to shake in his shoes over money matters he was now putting aside some two thousand a year and with the care he was taking of himself expected so aunt hester said to double his capital again before he died what he would do with it then with his sisters dead and himself dead was often mockingly queried by free spirits such as francie euphemia or young nicholas second christopher whose spirit was so free that he had actually said he was going on the stage all admitted however that this was best known to timothy himself and possibly to soames who never divulged a secret those few forsytes who had seen him reported a man of thick and robust appearance not very tall with a brownred complexion grey hair and little of the refinement of feature with which most of the forsytes had been endowed by superior dossets wife a woman of some beauty and a gentle temperament it was known that he had taken surprising interest in the war sticking flags into a map ever since it began and there was uneasiness as to what would happen if the english were driven into the sea when it would be almost impossible for him to put the flags in the right places as to his knowledge of family movements or his views about them little was known save that aunt hester was always declaring that he was very upset it was then in the nature of a portent when forsytes arriving on the sunday after the evacuation of spion kop became conscious one after the other of a presence seated in the only really comfortable armchair back to the light concealing the lower part of his face with a large hand and were greeted by the awed voice of aunt hester your uncle timothy my dear timothys greeting to them all was somewhat identical and rather as it were passed over by him than expressed how de do how de do xcuse me gettin up francie was present and eustace had come in his car winifred had brought imogen breaking the ice of the restitution proceedings with the warmth of family appreciation at vals enlistment and marian tweetyman with the last news of giles and jesse these with aunt juley and hester young nicholas euphemia and of all people george who had come with eustace in the car constituted an assembly worthy of the familys palmiest days there was not one chair vacant in the whole of the little drawingroom and anxiety was felt lest someone else should arrive the constraint caused by timothys presence having worn off a little conversation took a military turn george asked aunt juley when she was going out with the red cross almost reducing her to a state of gaiety whereon he turned to nicholas and said young nicks a warrior bold isnt he whens he going to don the wild khaki young nicholas smiling with a sort of sweet deprecation intimated that of course his mother was very anxious the dromios are off i hear said george turning to marian tweetyman we shall all be there soon en avant the forsytes roll bowl or pitch whos for a cooler aunt juley gurgled george was so droll should hester get timothys map then he could show them all where they were at a sound from timothy interpreted as assent aunt hester left the room george pursued his image of the forsyte advance addressing timothy as field marshal and imogen whom he had noted at once for a pretty filly as vivandiere and holding his top hat between his knees he began to beat it with imaginary drumsticks the reception accorded to his fantasy was mixed all laughed george was licensed but all felt that the family was being rotted and this seemed to them unnatural now that it was going to give five of its members to the service of the queen george might go too far and there was relief when he got up offered his arm to aunt juley marched up to timothy saluted him kissed his aunt with mock passion said oh what a treat dear papa come on eustace and walked out followed by the grave and fastidious eustace who had never smiled aunt juleys bewildered fancy not waiting for the map you mustnt mind him timothy hes so droll broke the hush and timothy removed the hand from his mouth i dont know what things are comin to he was heard to say whats all this about goin out there thats not the way to beat those boers francie alone had the hardihood to observe what is then uncle timothy all this newfangled volunteerin and expense lettin money out of the country just then aunt hester brought in the map handling it like a baby with eruptions with the assistance of euphemia it was laid on the piano a small colwood grand last played on it was believed the summer before aunt ann died thirteen years ago timothy rose he walked over to the piano and stood looking at his map while they all gathered round there you are he said thats the position up to date and very poor it is hm yes said francie greatly daring but how are you going to alter it uncle timothy without more men men said timothy you dont want men wastin the countrys money you want a napoleon hed settle it in a month but if you havent got him uncle timothy thats their business replied timothy what have we kept the army up for to eat their heads off in time of peace they ought to be ashamed of themselves comin on the country to help them like this let every man stick to his business and we shall get on and looking round him he added almost angrily volunteerin indeed throwin good money after bad we must save conserve energy thats the only way and with a prolonged sound not quite a sniff and not quite a snort he trod on euphemias toe and went out leaving a sensation and a faint scent of barleysugar behind him the effect of something said with conviction by one who has evidently made a sacrifice to say it is ever considerable and the eight forsytes left behind all women except young nicholas were silent for a moment round the map then francie said really i think hes right you know after all what is the army for they ought to have known its only encouraging them my dear cried aunt juley but theyve been so progressive think of their giving up their scarlet they were always so proud of it and now they all look like convicts hester and i were saying only yesterday we were sure they must feel it very much fancy what the iron duke would have said the new colours very smart said winifred val looks quite nice in his aunt juley sighed i do so wonder what jolyons boy is like to think weve never seen him his father must be so proud of him his fathers in paris said winifred aunt hesters shoulder was seen to mount suddenly as if to ward off her sisters next remark for juleys crumpled cheeks had gushed we had dear little mrs macander here yesterday just back from paris and whom dyou think she saw there in the street youll never guess we shant try auntie said euphemia irene imagine after all this time walking with a fair beard auntie youll kill me a fair beard i was going to say said aunt juley severely a fairbearded gentleman and not a day older she was always so pretty she added with a sort of lingering apology oh tell us about her auntie cried imogen i can just remember her shes the skeleton in the family cupboard isnt she and theyre such fun aunt hester sat down really juley had done it now she wasnt much of a skeleton as i remember her murmured euphemia extremely wellcovered my dear said aunt juley what a peculiar way of putting it not very nice no but what was she like persisted imogen ill tell you my child said francie a kind of modern venus very welldressed euphemia said sharply venus was never dressed and she had blue eyes of melting sapphire at this juncture nicholas took his leave mrs nick is awfully strict said francie with a laugh she has six children said aunt juley its very proper she should be careful was uncle soames awfully fond of her pursued the inexorable imogen moving her dark luscious eyes from face to face aunt hester made a gesture of despair just as aunt juley answered yes your uncle soames was very much attached to her i suppose she ran off with someone no certainly not that is not precisely what did she do then auntie come along imogen said winifred we must be getting back but aunt juley interjected resolutely she she didnt behave at all well oh bother cried imogen thats as far as i ever get well my dear said francie she had a love affair which ended with the young mans death and then she left your uncle i always rather liked her she used to give me chocolates murmured imogen and smell nice of course remarked euphemia not of course at all replied francie who used a particularly expensive essence of gillyflower herself i cant think what we are about said aunt juley raising her hands talking of such things was she divorced asked imogen from the door certainly not cried aunt juley that is certainly not a sound was heard over by the far door timothy had reentered the back drawingroom ive come for my map he said whos been divorced no one uncle replied francie with perfect truth timothy took his map off the piano dont lets have anything of that sort in the family he said all this enlistins bad enough the countrys breakin up i dont know what were comin to he shook a thick finger at the room too many women nowadays and they dont know what they want so saying he grasped the map firmly with both hands and went out as if afraid of being answered the seven women whom he had addressed broke into a subdued murmur out of which emerged francies really the forsytes and aunt juleys he must have his feet in mustard and hot water tonight hester will you tell jane the blood has gone to his head again im afraid that evening when she and hester were sitting alone after dinner she dropped a stitch in her crochet and looked up hester i cant think where ive heard that dear soames wants irene to come back to him again who was it told us that george had made a funny drawing of him with the words he wont be happy till he gets it eustace answered aunt hester from behind the times he had it in his pocket but he wouldnt show it us aunt juley was silent ruminating the clock ticked the times crackled the fire sent forth its rustling purr aunt juley dropped another stitch hester she said i have had such a dreadful thought then dont tell me said aunt hester quickly oh but i must you cant think how dreadful her voice sank to a whisper jolyon jolyon they say has a has a fair beard now chapter xii progress of the chase two days after the dinner at james mr polteed provided soames with food for thought a gentleman he said consulting the key concealed in his left hand as we say has been paying marked attention to during the last month in paris but at present there seems to have been nothing very conclusive the meetings have all been in public places without concealment restaurants the opera the comique the louvre luxembourg gardens lounge of the hotel and so forth she has not yet been traced to his rooms nor vice versa they went to fontainebleau but nothing of value in short the situation is promising but requires patience and looking up suddenly he added one rather curious point has the same name as er the fellow knows im her husband thought soames christian name an odd one jolyon continued mr polteed we know his address in paris and his residence here we dont wish of course to be running a wrong hare go on with it but be careful said soames doggedly instinctive certainty that this detective fellow had fathomed his secret made him all the more reticent excuse me said mr polteed ill just see if theres anything fresh in he returned with some letters relocking the door he glanced at the envelopes yes heres a personal one from to myself well said soames um said mr polteed she says left for england today address on his baggage robin hill parted from in louvre gallery at nothing very striking thought it best to stay and continue observation of you will deal with in england if you think desirable no doubt and mr polteed lifted an unprofessional glance on soames as though he might be storing material for a book on human nature after he had gone out of business very intelligent woman and a wonderful makeup not cheap but earns her money well theres no suspicion of being shadowed so far but after a time as you know sensitive people are liable to get the feeling of it without anything definite to go on i should rather advise lettingup on and keeping an eye on we cant get at correspondence without great risk i hardly advise that at this stage but you can tell your client that its looking up very well and again his narrowed eyes gleamed at his taciturn customer no said soames suddenly i prefer that you should keep the watch going discreetly in paris and not concern yourself with this end very well replied mr polteed we can do it what what is the manner between them ill read you what she says said mr polteed unlocking a bureau drawer and taking out a file of papers she sums it up somewhere confidentially yes here it is very attractive conclude longer in the tooth slang for age you know distinctly gone waiting his time perhaps holding off for terms impossible to say without knowing more but inclined to think on the whole doesnt know her mind likely to act on impulse some day both have style what does that mean said soames between close lips well murmured mr polteed with a smile showing many white teeth an expression we use in other words its not likely to be a weekend business theyll come together seriously or not at all hm muttered soames thats all is it yes said mr polteed but quite promising spider thought soames goodday he walked into the green park that he might cross to victoria station and take the underground into the city for so late in january it was warm sunlight through the haze sparkled on the frosty grass an illumined cobweb of a day little spiders and great spiders and the greatest spinner of all his own tenacity for ever wrapping its cocoon of threads round any clear way out what was that fellow hanging round irene for was it really as polteed suggested or was jolyon but taking compassion on her loneliness as he would call it sentimental radical chap that he had always been if it were indeed as polteed hinted soames stood still it could not be the fellow was seven years older than himself no better looking no richer what attraction had he besides hes come back he thought that doesnt look ill go and see him and taking out a card he wrote if you can spare half an hour some afternoon this week i shall be at the connoisseurs any day between and or i could come to the hotch potch if you prefer it i want to see you s f he walked up st jamess street and confided it to the porter at the hotch potch give mr jolyon forsyte this as soon as he comes in he said and took one of the new motor cabs into the city jolyon received that card the same afternoon and turned his face towards the connoisseurs what did soames want now had he got wind of paris and stepping across st jamess street he determined to make no secret of his visit but it wont do he thought to let him know shes there unless he knows already in this complicated state of mind he was conducted to where soames was drinking tea in a small baywindow no tea thanks said jolyon but ill go on smoking if i may the curtains were not yet drawn though the lamps outside were lighted the two cousins sat waiting on each other youve been in paris i hear said soames at last yes just back young val told me he and your boy are going off then jolyon nodded you didnt happen to see irene i suppose it appears shes abroad somewhere jolyon wreathed himself in smoke before he answered yes i saw her how was she very well there was another silence then soames roused himself in his chair when i saw you last he said i was in two minds we talked and you expressed your opinion i dont wish to reopen that discussion i only wanted to say this my position with her is extremely difficult i dont want you to go using your influence against me what happened is a very long time ago im going to ask her to let bygones be bygones you have asked her you know murmured jolyon the idea was new to her then it came as a shock but the more she thinks of it the more she must see that its the only way out for both of us thats not my impression of her state of mind said jolyon with particular calm and forgive my saying you misconceive the matter if you think reason comes into it at all he saw his cousins pale face grow paler he had used without knowing it irenes own words thanks muttered soames but i see things perhaps more plainly than you think i only want to be sure that you wont try to influence her against me i dont know what makes you think i have any influence said jolyon but if i have im bound to use it in the direction of what i think is her happiness i am what they call a feminist i believe feminist repeated soames as if seeking to gain time does that mean that youre against me bluntly said jolyon im against any woman living with any man whom she definitely dislikes it appears to me rotten and i suppose each time you see her you put your opinions into her mind i am not likely to be seeing her not going back to paris not so far as i know said jolyon conscious of the intent watchfulness in soames face well thats all i had to say anyone who comes between man and wife you know incurs heavy responsibility jolyon rose and made him a slight bow goodbye he said and without offering to shake hands moved away leaving soames staring after him we forsytes thought jolyon hailing a cab are very civilised with simpler folk that might have come to a row if it werent for my boy going to the war the war a gust of his old doubt swept over him a precious war domination of peoples or of women attempts to master and possess those who did not want you the negation of gentle decency possession vested rights and anyone agin em outcast thank heaven he thought i always felt agin em anyway yes even before his first disastrous marriage he could remember fuming over the bludgeoning of ireland or the matrimonial suits of women trying to be free of men they loathed parsons would have it that freedom of soul and body were quite different things pernicious doctrine body and soul could not thus be separated free will was the strength of any tie and not its weakness i ought to have told soames he thought that i think him comic ah but hes tragic too was there anything indeed more tragic in the world than a man enslaved by his own possessive instinct who couldnt see the sky for it or even enter fully into what another person felt i must write and warn her he thought hes going to have another try and all the way home to robin hill he rebelled at the strength of that duty to his son which prevented him from posting back to paris but soames sat long in his chair the prey of a no less gnawing ache a jealous ache as if it had been revealed to him that this fellow held precedence of himself and had spun fresh threads of resistance to his way out does that mean that youre against me he had got nothing out of that disingenuous question feminist phrasey fellow i mustnt rush things he thought i have some breathing space hes not going back to paris unless he was lying ill let the spring come though how the spring could serve him save by adding to his ache he could not tell and gazing down into the street where figures were passing from pool to pool of the light from the high lamps he thought nothing seems any good nothing seems worth while im loney thats the trouble he closed his eyes and at once he seemed to see irene in a dark street below a church passing turning her neck so that he caught the gleam of her eyes and her white forehead under a little dark hat which had gold spangles on it and a veil hanging down behind he opened his eyes so vividly he had seen her a woman was passing below but not she oh no there was nothing there chapter xiii here we are again imogens frocks for her first season exercised the judgment of her mother and the purse of her grandfather all through the month of march with forsyte tenacity winifred quested for perfection it took her mind off the slowly approaching rite which would give her a freedom but doubtfully desired took her mind too off her boy and his fast approaching departure for a war from which the news remained disquieting like bees busy on summer flowers or bright gadflies hovering and darting over spiky autumn blossoms she and her little daughter tall nearly as herself and with a bust measurement not far inferior hovered in the shops of regent street the establishments of hanover square and of bond street lost in consideration and the feel of fabrics dozens of young women of striking deportment and peculiar gait paraded before winifred and imogen draped in creations the models very new modom quite the latest thing which those two reluctantly turned down would have filled a museum the models which they were obliged to have nearly emptied james bank it was no good doing things by halves winifred felt in view of the need for making this first and sole untarnished season a conspicuous success their patience in trying the patience of those impersonal creatures who swam about before them could alone have been displayed by such as were moved by faith it was for winifred a long prostration before her dear goddess fashion fervent as a catholic might make before the virgin for imogen an experience by no means too unpleasant she often looked so nice and flattery was implicit everywhere in a word it was amusing on the afternoon of the th of march having as it were gutted skywards they had sought refreshment over the way at caramel and bakers and stored with chocolate frothed at the top with cream turned homewards through berkeley square of an evening touched with spring opening the door freshly painted a light olivegreen nothing neglected that year to give imogen a good sendoff winifred passed towards the silver basket to see if anyone had called and suddenly her nostrils twitched what was that scent imogen had taken up a novel sent from the library and stood absorbed rather sharply because of the queer feeling in her breast winifred said take that up dear and have a rest before dinner imogen still reading passed up the stairs winifred heard the door of her room slammed to and drew a long savouring breath was it spring tickling her senses whipping up nostalgia for her clown against all wisdom and outraged virtue a male scent a faint reek of cigars and lavenderwater not smelt since that early autumn night six months ago when she had called him the limit whence came it or was it ghost of scent sheer emanation from memory she looked round her nothing not a thing no tiniest disturbance of her hall nor of the diningroom a little daydream of a scent illusory saddening silly in the silver basket were new cards two with mr and mrs polegate thom and one with mr polegate thom thereon she sniffed them but they smelled severe i must be tired she thought ill go and lie down upstairs the drawingroom was darkened waiting for some hand to give it evening light and she passed on up to her bedroom this too was halfcurtained and dim for it was six oclock winifred threw off her coat that scent again then stood as if shot transfixed against the bedrail something dark had risen from the sofa in the far corner a word of horror in her family escaped her god its i monty said a voice clutching the bedrail winifred reached up and turned the switch of the light hanging above her dressingtable he appeared just on the rim of the lights circumference emblazoned from the absence of his watchchain down to boots neat and sooty brown but yes split at the toecap his chest and face were shadowy surely he was thin or was it a trick of the light he advanced lighted now from toecap to the top of his dark head surely a little grizzled his complexion had darkened sallowed his black moustache had lost boldness become sardonic there were lines which she did not know about his face there was no pin in his tie his suit ah she knew that but how unpressed unglossy she stared again at the toecap of his boot something big and relentless had been at him had turned and twisted raked and scraped him and she stayed not speaking motionless staring at that crack across the toe well he said i got the order im back winifreds bosom began to heave the nostalgia for her husband which had rushed up with that scent was struggling with a deeper jealousy than any she had felt yet there he was a dark and as if harried shadow of his sleek and brazen self what force had done this to him squeezed him like an orange to its dry rind that woman im back he said again ive had a beastly time by god i came steerage ive got nothing but what i stand up in and that bag and who has the rest cried winifred suddenly alive how dared you come you knew it was just for divorce that you got that order to come back dont touch me they held each to the rail of the big bed where they had spent so many years of nights together many times yes many times she had wanted him back but now that he had come she was filled with this cold and deadly resentment he put his hand up to his moustache but did not frizz and twist it in the old familiar way he just pulled it downwards gad he said if you knew the time ive had im glad i dont are the kids all right winifred nodded how did you get in with my key then the maids dont know you cant stay here monty he uttered a little sardonic laugh where then anywhere well look at me that that damned if you mention her cried winifred i go straight out to park lane and i dont come back suddenly he did a simple thing but so uncharacteristic that it moved her he shut his eyes it was as if he had said all right im dead to the world you can have a room for the night she said your things are still here only imogen is at home he leaned back against the bedrail well its in your hands and his own made a writhing movement ive been through it you neednt hit too hard it isnt worth while ive been frightened ive been frightened freddie that old pet name disused for years and years sent a shiver through winifred what am i to do with him she thought what in gods name am i to do with him got a cigarette she gave him one from a little box she kept up there for when she couldnt sleep at night and lighted it with that action the matteroffact side of her nature came to life again go and have a hot bath ill put some clothes out for you in the dressingroom we can talk later he nodded and fixed his eyes on her they looked halfdead or was it that the folds in the lids had become heavier hes not the same she thought he would never be quite the same again but what would he be all right he said and went towards the door he even moved differently like a man who has lost illusion and doubts whether it is worth while to move at all when he was gone and she heard the water in the bath running she put out a complete set of garments on the bed in his dressingroom then went downstairs and fetched up the biscuit box and whisky putting on her coat again and listening a moment at the bathroom door she went down and out in the street she hesitated past seven oclock would soames be at his club or at park lane she turned towards the latter back soames had always feared it she had sometimes hoped it back so like him clown that he was with this here we are again to make fools of them all of the law of soames of herself yet to have done with the law not to have that murky cloud hanging over her and the children what a relief ah but how to accept his return that woman had ravaged him taken from him passion such as he had never bestowed on herself such as she had not thought him capable of there was the sting that selfish blatant clown of hers whom she herself had never really stirred had been swept and ungarnished by another woman insulting too insulting not right not decent to take him back and yet she had asked for him the law perhaps would make her now he was as much her husband as ever she had put herself out of court and all he wanted no doubt was money to keep him in cigars and lavenderwater that scent after all im not old she thought not old yet but that woman who had reduced him to those words ive been through it ive been frightened frightened freddie she neared her fathers house driven this way and that while all the time the forsyte undertow was drawing her to deep conclusion that after all he was her property to be held against a robbing world and so she came to james mr soames in his room ill go up dont say im here her brother was dressing she found him before a mirror tying a black bow with an air of despising its ends hullo he said contemplating her in the glass whats wrong monty said winifred stonily soames spun round what back hoist muttered soames with our own petard why the deuce didnt you let me try cruelty i always knew it was too much risk this way oh dont talk about that what shall i do soames answered with a deep deep sound well said winifred impatiently what has he to say for himself nothing one of his boots is split across the toe soames stared at her ah he said of course on his beam ends so it begins again thisll about finish father cant we keep it from him impossible he has an uncanny flair for anything thats worrying and he brooded with fingers hooked into his blue silk braces there ought to be some way in law he muttered to make him safe no cried winifred i wont be made a fool of again id sooner put up with him the two stared at each other their hearts were full of feeling but they could give it no expression forsytes that they were where did you leave him in the bath and winifred gave a little bitter laugh the only thing hes brought back is lavenderwater steady said soames youre thoroughly upset ill go back with you whats the use we ought to make terms with him terms itll always be the same when he recovers cards and betting drink and she was silent remembering the look on her husbands face the burnt child the burnt child perhaps recovers replied soames is he ill no burnt out thats all soames took his waistcoat from a chair and put it on he took his coat and got into it he scented his handkerchief with eaude cologne threaded his watchchain and said we havent any luck and in the midst of her own trouble winifred was sorry for him as if in that little saying he had revealed deep trouble of his own id like to see mother she said shell be with father in their room come down quietly to the study ill get her winifred stole down to the little dark study chiefly remarkable for a canaletto too doubtful to be placed elsewhere and a fine collection of law reports unopened for many years here she stood with her back to marooncoloured curtains closedrawn staring at the empty grate till her mother came in followed by soames oh my poor dear said emily how miserable you look in here this is too bad of him really as a family they had so guarded themselves from the expression of all unfashionable emotion that it was impossible to go up and give her daughter a good hug but there was comfort in her cushioned voice and her still dimpled shoulders under some rare black lace summoning pride and the desire not to distress her mother winifred said in her most offhand voice its all right mother no good fussing i dont see said emily looking at soames why winifred shouldnt tell him that shell prosecute him if he doesnt keep off the premises he took her pearls and if hes not brought them back thats quite enough winifred smiled they would all plunge about with suggestions of this and that but she knew already what she would be doing and that was nothing the feeling that after all she had won a sort of victory retained her property was every moment gaining ground in her no if she wanted to punish him she could do it at home without the world knowing well said emily come into the diningroom comfortably you must stay and have dinner with us leave it to me to tell your father and as winifred moved towards the door she turned out the light not till then did they see the disaster in the corridor there attracted by light from a room never lighted james was standing with his duncoloured camelhair shawl folded about him so that his arms were not free and his silvered head looked cut off from his fashionably trousered legs as if by an expanse of desert he stood inimitably storklike with an expression as if he saw before him a frog too large to swallow whats all this he said tell your father you never tell me anything the moment found emily without reply it was winifred who went up to him and laying one hand on each of his swathed helpless arms said montys not gone bankrupt father hes only come back they all three expected something serious to happen and were glad she had kept that grip of his arms but they did not know the depth of root in that shadowy old forsyte something wry occurred about his shaven mouth and chin something scratchy between those long silvery whiskers then he said with a sort of dignity hell be the death of me i knew how it would be you mustnt worry father said winifred calmly i mean to make him behave ah said james here take this thing off im hot they unwound the shawl he turned and walked firmly to the dining room i dont want any soup he said to warmson and sat down in his chair they all sat down too winifred still in her hat while warmson laid the fourth place when he left the room james said whats he brought back nothing father james concentrated his eyes on his own image in a tablespoon divorce he muttered rubbish what was i about i ought to have paid him an allowance to stay out of england soames you go and propose it to him it seemed so right and simple a suggestion that even winifred was surprised when she said no ill keep him now hes back he must just behave thats all they all looked at her it had always been known that winifred had pluck out there said james elliptically who knows what cutthroats you look for his revolver dont go to bed without you ought to have warmson to sleep in the house ill see him myself tomorrow they were touched by this declaration and emily said comfortably thats right james we wont have any nonsense ah muttered james darkly i cant tell the advent of warmson with fish diverted conversation when directly after dinner winifred went over to kiss her father goodnight he looked up with eyes so full of question and distress that she put all the comfort she could into her voice its all right daddy dear dont worry i shant need anyone hes quite bland i shall only be upset if you worry goodnight bless you james repeated the words bless you as if he did not quite know what they meant and his eyes followed her to the door she reached home before nine and went straight upstairs dartie was lying on the bed in his dressingroom fully redressed in a blue serge suit and pumps his arms were crossed behind his head and an extinct cigarette drooped from his mouth winifred remembered ridiculously the flowers in her windowboxes after a blazing summer day the way they lay or rather stood parched yet rested by the suns retreat it was as if a little dew had come already on her burntup husband he said apathetically i suppose youve been to park lane hows the old man winifred could not help the bitter answer not dead he winced actually he winced understand monty she said i will not have him worried if you arent going to behave yourself you may go back you may go anywhere have you had dinner no would you like some he shrugged his shoulders imogen offered me some i didnt want any imogen in the plenitude of emotion winifred had forgotten her so youve seen her what did she say she gave me a kiss with mortification winifred saw his dark sardonic face relaxed yes she thought he cares for her not for me a bit darties eyes were moving from side to side does she know about me he said it flashed through winifred that here was the weapon she needed he minded their knowing no val knows the others dont they only know you went away she heard him sigh with relief but they shall know she said firmly if you give me cause all right he muttered hit me im down winifred went up to the bed look here monty i dont want to hit you i dont want to hurt you i shant allude to anything im not going to worry whats the use she was silent a moment i cant stand any more though and i wont youd better know youve made me suffer but i used to be fond of you for the sake of that she met the heavylidded gaze of his brown eyes with the downward stare of her greengrey eyes touched his hand suddenly turned her back and went into her room she sat there a long time before her glass fingering her rings thinking of this subdued dark man almost a stranger to her on the bed in the other room resolutely not worrying but gnawed by jealousy of what he had been through and now and again just visited by pity chapter xiv outlandish night soames doggedly let the spring come no easy task for one conscious that time was flying his birds in the bush no nearer the hand no issue from the web anywhere visible mr polteed reported nothing except that his watch went on costing a lot of money val and his cousin were gone to the war whence came news more favourable dartie was behaving himself so far james had retained his health business prospered almost terribly there was nothing to worry soames except that he was held up could make no step in any direction he did not exactly avoid soho for he could not afford to let them think that he had piped off as james would have put it he might want to pipe on again at any minute but he had to be so restrained and cautious that he would often pass the door of the restaurant bretagne without going in and wander out of the purlieus of that region which always gave him the feeling of having been possessively irregular he wandered thus one may night into regent street and the most amazing crowd he had ever seen a shrieking whistling dancing jostling grotesque and formidably jovial crowd with false noses and mouthorgans penny whistles and long feathers every appanage of idiocy as it seemed to him mafeking of course it had been relieved good but was that an excuse who were these people what were they where had they come from into the west end his face was tickled his ears whistled into girls cried keep your hair on stucco a youth so knocked off his tophat that he recovered it with difficulty crackers were exploding beneath his nose between his feet he was bewildered exasperated offended this stream of people came from every quarter as if impulse had unlocked floodgates let flow waters of whose existence he had heard perhaps but believed in never this then was the populace the innumerable living negation of gentility and forsyteism this was egad democracy it stank yelled was hideous in the east end or even soho perhaps but here in regent street in piccadilly what were the police about in soames with his forsyte thousands had never seen the cauldron with the lid off and now looking into it could hardly believe his scorching eyes the whole thing was unspeakable these people had no restraint they seemed to think him funny such swarms of them rude coarse laughing and what laughter nothing sacred to them he shouldnt be surprised if they began to break windows in pall mall past those august dwellings to enter which people paid sixty pounds this shrieking whistling dancing dervish of a crowd was swarming from the club windows his own kind were looking out on them with regulated amusement they didnt realise why this was serious might come to anything the crowd was cheerful but some day they would come in different mood he remembered there had been a mob in the late eighties when he was at brighton they had smashed things and made speeches but more than dread he felt a deep surprise they were hysterical it wasnt english and all about the relief of a little town as big as watford six thousand miles away restraint reserve those qualities to him more dear almost than life those indispensable attributes of property and culture where were they it wasnt english no it wasnt english so soames brooded threading his way on it was as if he had suddenly caught sight of someone cutting the covenant for quiet possession out of his legal documents or of a monster lurking and stalking out in the future casting its shadow before their want of stolidity their want of reverence it was like discovering that ninetenths of the people of england were foreigners and if that were so then anything might happen at hyde park corner he ran into george forsyte very sunburnt from racing holding a false nose in his hand hallo soames he said have a nose soames responded with a pale smile got this from one of these sportsmen went on george who had evidently been dining had to lay him out for trying to bash my hat i say one of these days we shall have to fight these chaps theyre getting so damned cheeky all radicals and socialists they want our goods you tell uncle james that itll make him sleep in vino veritas thought soames but he only nodded and passed on up hamilton place there was but a trickle of roysterers in park lane not very noisy and looking up at the houses he thought after all were the backbone of the country they wont upset us easily possessions nine points of the law but as he closed the door of his fathers house behind him all that queer outlandish nightmare in the streets passed out of his mind almost as completely as if having dreamed it he had awakened in the warm clean morning comfort of his springmattressed bed walking into the centre of the great empty drawingroom he stood still a wife somebody to talk things over with one had a right damn it one had a right chapter i part iii chapter i soames in paris soames had travelled little aged nineteen he had made the petty tour with his father mother and winifred brussels the rhine switzerland and home by way of paris aged twentyseven just when he began to take interest in pictures he had spent five hot weeks in italy looking into the renaissance not so much in it as he had been led to expect and a fortnight in paris on his way back looking into himself as became a forsyte surrounded by people so strongly selfcentred and foreign as the french his knowledge of their language being derived from his public school he did not understand them when they spoke silence he had found better for all parties one did not make a fool of oneself he had disliked the look of the mens clothes the closedin cabs the theatres which looked like beehives the galleries which smelled of beeswax he was too cautious and too shy to explore that side of paris supposed by forsytes to constitute its attraction under the rose and as for a collectors bargain not one to be had as nicholas might have put it they were a grasping lot he had come back uneasy saying paris was overrated when therefore in june of he went to paris it was but his third attempt on the centre of civilisation this time however the mountain was going to mahomet for he felt by now more deeply civilised than paris and perhaps he really was moreover he had a definite objective this was no mere genuflexion to a shrine of taste and immorality but the prosecution of his own legitimate affairs he went indeed because things were getting past a joke the watch went on and on and nothing nothing jolyon had never returned to paris and no one else was suspect busy with new and very confidential matters soames was realising more than ever how essential reputation is to a solicitor but at night and in his leisure moments he was ravaged by the thought that time was always flying and money flowing in and his own future as much in irons as ever since mafeking night he had become aware that a young fool of a doctor was hanging round annette twice he had come across him a cheerful young fool not more than thirty nothing annoyed soames so much as cheerfulness an indecent extravagant sort of quality which had no relation to facts the mixture of his desires and hopes was in a word becoming torture and lately the thought had come to him that perhaps irene knew she was being shadowed it was this which finally decided him to go and see for himself to go and once more try to break down her repugnance her refusal to make her own and his path comparatively smooth once more if he failed again well he would see what she did with herself anyway he went to an hotel in the rue caumartin highly recommended to forsytes where practically nobody spoke french he had formed no plan he did not want to startle her yet must contrive that she had no chance to evade him by flight and next morning he set out in bright weather paris had an air of gaiety a sparkle over its starshape which almost annoyed soames he stepped gravely his nose lifted a little sideways in real curiosity he desired now to understand things french was not annette french there was much to be got out of his visit if he could only get it in this laudable mood and the place de la concorde he was nearly run down three times he came on the cours la reine where irenes hotel was situated almost too suddenly for he had not yet fixed on his procedure crossing over to the river side he noted the building white and cheerfullooking with green sunblinds seen through a screen of planetree leaves and conscious that it would be far better to meet her casually in some open place than to risk a call he sat down on a bench whence he could watch the entrance it was not quite eleven oclock and improbable that she had yet gone out some pigeons were strutting and preening their feathers in the pools of sunlight between the shadows of the planetrees a workman in a blue blouse passed and threw them crumbs from the paper which contained his dinner a bonne coiffed with ribbon shepherded two little girls with pigtails and frilled drawers a cab meandered by whose cocher wore a blue coat and a blackglazed hat to soames a kind of affectation seemed to cling about it all a sort of picturesqueness which was out of date a theatrical people the french he lit one of his rare cigarettes with a sense of injury that fate should be casting his life into out landish waters he shouldnt wonder if irene quite enjoyed this foreign life she had never been properly english even to look at and he began considering which of those windows could be hers under the green sunblinds how could he word what he had come to say so that it might pierce the defence of her proud obstinacy he threw the fagend of his cigarette at a pigeon with the thought i cant stay here for ever twiddling my thumbs better give it up and call on her in the late afternoon but he still sat on heard twelve strike and then halfpast ill wait till one he thought while im about it but just then he started up and shrinkingly sat down again a woman had come out in a cream coloured frock and was moving away under a fawncoloured parasol irene herself he waited till she was too far away to recognise him then set out after her she was strolling as though she had no particular objective moving if he remembered rightly toward the bois de boulogne for half an hour at least he kept his distance on the far side of the way till she had passed into the bois itself was she going to meet someone after all some confounded frenchman one of those bel ami chaps perhaps who had nothing to do but hang about women for he had read that book with difficulty and a sort of disgusted fascination he followed doggedly along a shady alley losing sight of her now and then when the path curved and it came back to him how long ago one night in hyde park he had slid and sneaked from tree to tree from seat to seat hunting blindly ridiculously in burning jealousy for her and young bosinney the path bent sharply and hurrying he came on her sitting in front of a small fountain a little greenbronze niobe veiled in hair to her slender hips gazing at the pool she had wept he came on her so suddenly that he was past before he could turn and take off his hat she did not start up she had always had great selfcommand it was one of the things he most admired in her one of his greatest grievances against her because he had never been able to tell what she was thinking had she realised that he was following her selfpossession made him angry and disdaining to explain his presence he pointed to the mournful little niobe and said thats rather a good thing he could see then that she was struggling to preserve her composure i didnt want to startle you is this one of your haunts yes a little lonely as he spoke a lady strolling by paused to look at the fountain and passed on irenes eyes followed her no she said prodding the ground with her parasol never lonely one has always ones shadow soames understood and looking at her hard he exclaimed well its your own fault you can be free of it at any moment irene come back to me and be free irene laughed dont cried soames stamping his foot its inhuman listen is there any condition i can make which will bring you back to me if i promise you a separate house and just a visit now and then irene rose something wild suddenly in her face and figure none none none you may hunt me to the grave i will not come outraged and on edge soames recoiled dont make a scene he said sharply and they both stood motionless staring at the little niobe whose greenish flesh the sunlight was burnishing thats your last word then muttered soames clenching his hands you condemn us both irene bent her head i cant come back goodbye a feeling of monstrous injustice flared up in soames stop he said and listen to me a moment you gave me a sacred vow you came to me without a penny you had all i could give you you broke that vow without cause you made me a byword you refused me a child youve left me in prison you you still move me so that i want you i want you well what do you think of yourself irene turned her face was deadly pale her eyes burning dark god made me as i am she said wicked if you like but not so wicked that ill give myself again to a man i hate the sunlight gleamed on her hair as she moved away and seemed to lay a caress all down her clinging creamcoloured frock soames could neither speak nor move that word hate so extreme so primitive made all the forsyte in him tremble with a deep imprecation he strode away from where she had vanished and ran almost into the arms of the lady sauntering back the fool the shadowing fool he was soon dripping with perspiration in the depths of the bois well he thought i need have no consideration for her now she has not a grain of it for me ill show her this very day that shes my wife still but on the way home to his hotel he was forced to the conclusion that he did not know what he meant one could not make scenes in public and short of scenes in public what was there he could do he almost cursed his own thinskinnedness she might deserve no consideration but he alas deserved some at his own hands and sitting lunchless in the hall of his hotel with tourists passing every moment baedeker in hand he was visited by black dejection in irons his whole life with every natural instinct and every decent yearning gagged and fettered and all because fate had driven him seventeen years ago to set his heart upon this woman so utterly that even now he had no real heart to set on any other cursed was the day he had met her and his eyes for seeing in her anything but the cruel venus she was and yet still seeing her with the sunlight on the clinging china crepe of her gown he uttered a little groan so that a tourist who was passing thought man in pain lets see what did i have for lunch later in front of a cafe near the opera over a glass of cold tea with lemon and a straw in it he took the malicious resolution to go and dine at her hotel if she were there he would speak to her if she were not he would leave a note he dressed carefully and wrote as follows your idyll with that fellow jolyon forsyte is known to me at all events if you pursue it understand that i will leave no stone unturned to make things unbearable for him s f he sealed this note but did not address it refusing to write the maiden name which she had impudently resumed or to put the word forsyte on the envelope lest she should tear it up unread then he went out and made his way through the glowing streets abandoned to evening pleasureseekers entering her hotel he took his seat in a far corner of the diningroom whence he could see all entrances and exits she was not there he ate little quickly watchfully she did not come he lingered in the lounge over his coffee drank two liqueurs of brandy but still she did not come he went over to the keyboard and examined the names number twelve on the first floor and he determined to take the note up himself he mounted redcarpeted stairs past a little salon eighttentwelve should he knock push the note under or he looked furtively round and turned the handle the door opened but into a little space leading to another door he knocked on that no answer the door was locked it fitted very closely to the floor the note would not go under he thrust it back into his pocket and stood a moment listening he felt somehow certain that she was not there and suddenly he came away passing the little salon down the stairs he stopped at the bureau and said will you kindly see that mrs heron has this note madame heron left today monsieur suddenly about three oclock there was illness in her family soames compressed his lips oh he said do you know her address non monsieur england i think soames put the note back into his pocket and went out he hailed an open horsecab which was passing drive me anywhere the man who obviously did not understand smiled and waved his whip and soames was borne along in that little yellowwheeled victoria all over starshaped paris with here and there a pause and the question cest par ici monsieur no go on till the man gave it up in despair and the yellowwheeled chariot continued to roll between the tall flatfronted shuttered houses and plane tree avenues a little flying dutchman of a cab like my life thought soames without object on and on chapter ii in the web soames returned to england the following day and on the third morning received a visit from mr polteed who wore a flower and carried a brown billycock hat soames motioned him to a seat the news from the war is not so bad is it said mr polteed i hope i see you well sir thanks quite mr polteed leaned forward smiled opened his hand looked into it and said softly i think weve done your business for you at last what ejaculated soames nineteen reports quite suddenly what i think we shall be justified in calling conclusive evidence and mr polteed paused well on the th instant after witnessing an interview between and a party earlier in the day can swear to having seen him coming out of her bedroom in the hotel about ten oclock in the evening with a little care in the giving of the evidence that will be enough especially as has left paris no doubt with the party in question in fact they both slipped off and we havent got on to them again yet but we shall we shall shes worked hard under very difficult circumstances and im glad shes brought it off at last mr polteed took out a cigarette tapped its end against the table looked at soames and put it back the expression on his clients face was not encouraging who is this new person said soames abruptly that we dont know shell swear to the fact and shes got his appearance pat mr polteed took out a letter and began reading middleaged medium height blue dittoes in afternoon evening dress at night pale dark hair small dark moustache flat cheeks good chin grey eyes small feet guilty look soames rose and went to the window he stood there in sardonic fury congenital idiot spidery congenital idiot seven months at fifteen pounds a week to be tracked down as his own wifes lover guilty look he threw the window open its hot he said and came back to his seat crossing his knees he bent a supercilious glance on mr polteed i doubt if thats quite good enough he said drawling the words with no name or address i think you may let that lady have a rest and take up our friend at this end whether polteed had spotted him he could not tell but he had a mental vision of him in the midst of his cronies dissolved in inextinguishable laughter guilty look damnation mr polteed said in a tone of urgency almost of pathos i assure you we have put it through sometimes on less than that its paris you know attractive woman living alone why not risk it sir we might screw it up a peg soames had sudden insight the fellows professional zeal was stirred greatest triumph of my career got a man his divorce through a visit to his own wifes bedroom something to talk of there when i retire and for one wild moment he thought why not after all hundreds of men of medium height had small feet and a guilty look im not authorised to take any risk he said shortly mr polteed looked up pity he said quite a pity that other affair seemed very costive soames rose never mind that please watch and take care not to find a mares nest goodmorning mr polteeds eye glinted at the words mares nest very good you shall be kept informed and soames was alone again the spidery dirty ridiculous business laying his arms on the table he leaned his forehead on them full ten minutes he rested thus till a managing clerk roused him with the draft prospectus of a new issue of shares very desirable in manifold and toppings that afternoon he left work early and made his way to the restaurant bretagne only madame lamotte was in would monsieur have tea with her soames bowed when they were seated at right angles to each other in the little room he said abruptly i want a talk with you madame the quick lift of her clear brown eyes told him that she had long expected such words i have to ask you something first that young doctor whats his name is there anything between him and annette her whole personality had become as it were like jet clearcut black hard shining annette is young she said so is monsieur le docteur between young people things move quickly but annette is a good daughter ah what a jewel of a nature the least little smile twisted soames lips nothing definite then but definite no indeed the young man is veree nice but what would you there is no money at present she raised her willowpatterned teacup soames did the same their eyes met i am a married man he said living apart from my wife for many years i am seeking to divorce her madame lamotte put down her cup indeed what tragic things there were the entire absence of sentiment in her inspired a queer species of contempt in soames i am a rich man he added fully conscious that the remark was not in good taste it is useless to say more at present but i think you understand madames eyes so open that the whites showed above them looked at him very straight ah ca mais nous avons le temps was all she said another little cup soames refused and taking his leave walked westward he had got that off his mind she would not let annette commit herself with that cheerful young ass until but what chance of his ever being able to say im free what chance the future had lost all semblance of reality he felt like a fly entangled in cobweb filaments watching the desirable freedom of the air with pitiful eyes he was short of exercise and wandered on to kensington gardens and down queens gate towards chelsea perhaps she had gone back to her flat that at all events he could find out for since that last and most ignominious repulse his wounded selfrespect had taken refuge again in the feeling that she must have a lover he arrived before the little mansions at the dinnerhour no need to enquire a greyhaired lady was watering the flowerboxes in her window it was evidently let and he walked slowly past again along the river an evening of clear quiet beauty all harmony and comfort except within his heart chapter iii richmond park on the afternoon that soames crossed to france a cablegram was received by jolyon at robin hill your son down with enteric no immediate danger will cable again it reached a household already agitated by the imminent departure of june whose berth was booked for the following day she was indeed in the act of confiding eric cobbley and his family to her fathers care when the message arrived the resolution to become a red cross nurse taken under stimulus of jollys enlistment had been loyally fulfilled with the irritation and regret which all forsytes feel at what curtails their individual liberties enthusiastic at first about the wonderfulness of the work she had begun after a month to feel that she could train herself so much better than others could train her and if holly had not insisted on following her example and being trained too she must inevitably have cried off the departure of jolly and val with their troop in april had further stiffened her failing resolve but now on the point of departure the thought of leaving eric cobbley with a wife and two children adrift in the cold waters of an unappreciative world weighed on her so that she was still in danger of backing out the reading of that cablegram with its disquieting reality clinched the matter she saw herself already nursing jolly for of course they would let her nurse her own brother jolyon ever wide and doubtful had no such hope poor june could any forsyte of her generation grasp how rude and brutal life was ever since he knew of his boys arrival at cape town the thought of him had been a kind of recurrent sickness in jolyon he could not get reconciled to the feeling that jolly was in danger all the time the cablegram grave though it was was almost a relief he was now safe from bullets anyway and yet this enteric was a virulent disease the times was full of deaths therefrom why could he not be lying out there in that upcountry hospital and his boy safe at home the unforsytean selfsacrifice of his three children indeed had quite bewildered jolyon he would eagerly change places with jolly because he loved his boy but no such personal motive was influencing them he could only think that it marked the decline of the forsyte type late that afternoon holly came out to him under the old oaktree she had grown up very much during these last months of hospital training away from home and seeing her approach he thought she has more sense than june child though she is more wisdom thank god she isnt going out she had seated herself in the swing very silent and still she feels this thought jolyon as much as i and seeing her eyes fixed on him he said dont take it to heart too much my child if he werent ill he might be in much greater danger holly got out of the swing i want to tell you something dad it was through me that jolly enlisted and went out hows that when you were away in paris val dartie and i fell in love we used to ride in richmond park we got engaged jolly found it out and thought he ought to stop it so he dared val to enlist it was all my fault dad and i want to go out too because if anything happens to either of them i should feel awful besides im just as much trained as june jolyon gazed at her in a stupefaction that was tinged with irony so this was the answer to the riddle he had been asking himself and his three children were forsytes after all surely holly might have told him all this before but he smothered the sarcastic sayings on his lips tenderness to the young was perhaps the most sacred article of his belief he had got no doubt what he deserved engaged so this was why he had so lost touch with her and to young val dartie nephew of soames in the other camp it was all terribly distasteful he closed his easel and set his drawing against the tree have you told june yes she says shell get me into her cabin somehow its a single cabin but one of us could sleep on the floor if you consent shell go up now and get permission consent thought jolyon rather late in the day to ask for that but again he checked himself youre too young my dear they wont let you june knows some people that she helped to go to cape town if they wont let me nurse yet i could stay with them and go on training there let me go dad jolyon smiled because he could have cried i never stop anyone from doing anything he said holly flung her arms round his neck oh dad you are the best in the world that means the worst thought jolyon if he had ever doubted his creed of tolerance he did so then im not friendly with vals family he said and i dont know val but jolly didnt like him holly looked at the distance and said i love him that settles it said jolyon dryly then catching the expression on her face he kissed her with the thought is anything more pathetic than the faith of the young unless he actually forbade her going it was obvious that he must make the best of it so he went up to town with june whether due to her persistence or the fact that the official they saw was an old school friend of jolyons they obtained permission for holly to share the single cabin he took them to surbiton station the following evening and they duly slid away from him provided with money invalid foods and those letters of credit without which forsytes do not travel he drove back to robin hill under a brilliant sky to his late dinner served with an added care by servants trying to show him that they sympathised eaten with an added scrupulousness to show them that he appreciated their sympathy but it was a real relief to get to his cigar on the terrace of flagstones cunningly chosen by young bosinney for shape and colour with night closing in around him so beautiful a night hardly whispering in the trees and smelling so sweet that it made him ache the grass was drenched with dew and he kept to those flagstones up and down till presently it began to seem to him that he was one of three not wheeling but turning right about at each end so that his father was always nearest to the house and his son always nearest to the terrace edge each had an arm lightly within his arm he dared not lift his hand to his cigar lest he should disturb them and it burned away dripping ash on him till it dropped from his lips at last which were getting hot they left him then and his arms felt chilly three jolyons in one jolyon they had walked he stood still counting the sounds a carriage passing on the highroad a distant train the dog at gages farm the whispering trees the groom playing on his penny whistle a multitude of stars up there bright and silent so far off no moon as yet just enough light to show him the dark flags and swords of the iris flowers along the terrace edge his favourite flower that had the nights own colour on its curving crumpled petals he turned round to the house big unlighted not a soul beside himself to live in all that part of it stark loneliness he could not go on living here alone and yet so long as there was beauty why should a man feel lonely the answer as to some idiots riddle was because he did the greater the beauty the greater the loneliness for at the back of beauty was harmony and at the back of harmony was union beauty could not comfort if the soul were out of it the night maddeningly lovely with bloom of grapes on it in starshine and the breath of grass and honey coming from it he could not enjoy while she who was to him the life of beauty its embodiment and essence was cut off from him utterly cut off now he felt by honourable decency he made a poor fist of sleeping striving too hard after that resignation which forsytes find difficult to reach bred to their own way and left so comfortably off by their fathers but after dawn he dozed off and soon was dreaming a strange dream he was on a stage with immensely high rich curtains high as the very stars stretching in a semicircle from footlights to footlights he himself was very small a little black restless figure roaming up and down and the odd thing was that he was not altogether himself but soames as well so that he was not only experiencing but watching this figure of himself and soames was trying to find a way out through the curtains which heavy and dark kept him in several times he had crossed in front of them before he saw with delight a sudden narrow rift a tall chink of beauty the colour of iris flowers like a glimpse of paradise remote ineffable stepping quickly forward to pass into it he found the curtains closing before him bitterly disappointed he or was it soames moved on and there was the chink again through the parted curtains which again closed too soon this went on and on and he never got through till he woke with the word irene on his lips the dream disturbed him badly especially that identification of himself with soames next morning finding it impossible to work he spent hours riding jollys horse in search of fatigue and on the second day he made up his mind to move to london and see if he could not get permission to follow his daughters to south africa he had just begun to pack the following morning when he received this letter green hotel june richmond my dear jolyon you will be surprised to see how near i am to you paris became impossible and i have come here to be within reach of your advice i would so love to see you again since you left paris i dont think i have met anyone i could really talk to is all well with you and with your boy no one knows i think that i am here at present always your friend irene irene within three miles of him and again in flight he stood with a very queer smile on his lips this was more than he had bargained for about noon he set out on foot across richmond park and as he went along he thought richmond park by jove it suits us forsytes not that forsytes lived there nobody lived there save royalty rangers and the deer but in richmond park nature was allowed to go so far and no further putting up a brave show of being natural seeming to say look at my instincts they are almost passions very nearly out of hand but not quite of course the very hub of possession is to possess oneself yes richmond park possessed itself even on that bright day of june with arrowy cuckoos shifting the treepoints of their calls and the wood doves announcing high summer the green hotel which jolyon entered at one oclock stood nearly opposite that more famous hostelry the crown and sceptre it was modest highly respectable never out of cold beef gooseberry tart and a dowager or two so that a carriage and pair was almost always standing before the door in a room draped in chintz so slippery as to forbid all emotion irene was sitting on a piano stool covered with crewel work playing hansel and gretel out of an old score above her on a wall not yet morrispapered was a print of the queen on a pony amongst deerhounds scotch caps and slain stags beside her in a pot on the windowsill was a white and rosy fuchsia the victorianism of the room almost talked and in her clinging frock irene seemed to jolyon like venus emerging from the shell of the past century if the proprietor had eyes he said he would show you the door you have broken through his decorations thus lightly he smothered up an emotional moment having eaten cold beef pickled walnut gooseberry tart and drunk stonebottle gingerbeer they walked into the park and light talk was succeeded by the silence jolyon had dreaded you havent told me about paris he said at last no ive been shadowed for a long time one gets used to that but then soames came by the little niobe the same story would i go back to him incredible she had spoken without raising her eyes but she looked up now those dark eyes clinging to his said as no words could have i have come to an end if you want me here i am for sheer emotional intensity had he ever old as he was passed through such a moment the words irene i adore you almost escaped him then with a clearness of which he would not have believed mental vision capable he saw jolly lying with a white face turned to a white wall my boy is very ill out there he said quietly irene slipped her arm through his lets walk on i understand no miserable explanation to attempt she had understood and they walked on among the bracken kneehigh already between the rabbitholes and the oaktrees talking of jolly he left her two hours later at the richmond hill gate and turned towards home she knows of my feeling for her then he thought of course one could not keep knowledge of that from such a woman chapter iv over the river jolly was tired to death of dreams they had left him now too wan and weak to dream again left him to lie torpid faintly remembering faroff things just able to turn his eyes and gaze through the window near his cot at the trickle of river running by in the sands at the straggling milkbush of the karoo beyond he knew what the karoo was now even if he had not seen a boer roll over like a rabbit or heard the whine of flying bullets this pestilence had sneaked on him before he had smelled powder a thirsty day and a rash drink or perhaps a tainted fruit who knew not he who had not even strength left to grudge the evil thing its victory just enough to know that there were many lying here with him that he was sore with frenzied dreaming just enough to watch that thread of river and be able to remember faintly those faraway things the sun was nearly down it would be cooler soon he would have liked to know the time to feel his old watch so buttersmooth to hear the repeater strike it would have been friendly homelike he had not even strength to remember that the old watch was last wound the day he began to lie here the pulse of his brain beat so feebly that faces which came and went nurses doctors orderlys were indistinguishable just one indifferent face and the words spoken about him meant all the same thing and that almost nothing those things he used to do though far and faint were more distinct walking past the foot of the old steps at harrow bill here sir here sir wrapping boots in the westminster gazette greenish paper shining boots grandfather coming from somewhere dark a smell of earth the mushroom house robin hill burying poor old balthasar in the leaves dad home consciousness came again with noticing that the river had no water in it someone was speaking too want anything no what could one want too weak to want only to hear his watch strike holly she wouldnt bowl properly oh pitch them up not sneaks back her two and bow he was two consciousness came once more with a sense of the violet dusk outside and a rising bloodred crescent moon his eyes rested on it fascinated in the long minutes of brainnothingness it went moving up and up hes going doctor not pack boots again never mind your form two dont cry go quietly over the river sleep dark if somebody would strike his watch chapter v soames acts a sealed letter in the handwriting of mr polteed remained unopened in soames pocket throughout two hours of sustained attention to the affairs of the new colliery company which declining almost from the moment of old jolyons retirement from the chairmanship had lately run down so fast that there was now nothing for it but a windingup he took the letter out to lunch at his city club sacred to him for the meals he had eaten there with his father in the early seventies when james used to like him to come and see for himself the nature of his future life here in a remote corner before a plate of roast mutton and mashed potato he read dear sir in accordance with your suggestion we have duly taken the matter up at the other end with gratifying results observation of has enabled us to locate at the green hotel richmond the two have been observed to meet daily during the past week in richmond park nothing absolutely crucial has so far been notified but in conjunction with what we had from paris at the beginning of the year i am confident we could now satisfy the court we shall of course continue to watch the matter until we hear from you very faithfully yours claud polteed soames read it through twice and beckoned to the waiter take this away its cold shall i bring you some more sir no get me some coffee in the other room and paying for what he had not eaten he went out passing two acquaintances without sign of recognition satisfy the court he thought sitting at a little round marble table with the coffee before him that fellow jolyon he poured out his coffee sweetened and drank it he would disgrace him in the eyes of his own children and rising with that resolution hot within him he found for the first time the inconvenience of being his own solicitor he could not treat this scandalous matter in his own office he must commit the soul of his private dignity to a stranger some other professional dealer in family dishonour who was there he could go to linkman and laver in budge row perhaps reliable not too conspicuous only nodding acquaintances but before he saw them he must see polteed again but at this thought soames had a moment of sheer weakness to part with his secret how find the words how subject himself to contempt and secret laughter yet after all the fellow knew already oh yes he knew and feeling that he must finish with it now he took a cab into the west end in this hot weather the window of mr polteeds room was positively open and the only precaution was a wire gauze preventing the intrusion of flies two or three had tried to come in and been caught so that they seemed to be clinging there with the intention of being devoured presently mr polteed following the direction of his clients eye rose apologetically and closed the window posing ass thought soames like all who fundamentally believe in themselves he was rising to the occasion and with his little sideway smile he said ive had your letter im going to act i suppose you know who the lady youve been watching really is mr polteeds expression at that moment was a masterpiece it so clearly said well what do you think but mere professional knowledge i assure you pray forgive it he made a little half airy movement with his hand as who should say such things such things will happen to us all very well then said soames moistening his lips theres no need to say more im instructing linkman and laver of budge row to act for me i dont want to hear your evidence but kindly make your report to them at five oclock and continue to observe the utmost secrecy mr polteed half closed his eyes as if to comply at once my dear sir he said are you convinced asked soames with sudden energy that there is enough the faintest movement occurred to mr polteeds shoulders you can risk it he murmured with what we have and human nature you can risk it soames rose you will ask for mr linkman thanks dont get up he could not bear mr polteed to slide as usual between him and the door in the sunlight of piccadilly he wiped his forehead this had been the worst of it he could stand the strangers better and he went back into the city to do what still lay before him that evening in park lane watching his father dine he was overwhelmed by his old longing for a son a son to watch him eat as he went down the years to be taken on his knee as james on a time had been wont to take him a son of his own begetting who could understand him because he was the same flesh and blood understand and comfort him and become more rich and cultured than himself because he would start even better off to get old like that thin grey wiryfrail figure sitting there and be quite alone with possessions heaping up around him to take no interest in anything because it had no future and must pass away from him to hands and mouths and eyes for whom he cared no jot no he would force it through now and be free to marry and have a son to care for him before he grew to be like the old old man his father wistfully watching now his sweetbread now his son in that mood he went up to bed but lying warm between those fine linen sheets of emilys providing he was visited by memories and torture visions of irene almost the solid feeling of her body beset him why had he ever been fool enough to see her again and let this flood back on him so that it was pain to think of her with that fellow that stealing fellow chapter vi a summer day his boy was seldom absent from jolyons mind in the days which followed the first walk with irene in richmond park no further news had come enquiries at the war office elicited nothing nor could he expect to hear from june and holly for three weeks at least in these days he felt how insufficient were his memories of jolly and what an amateur of a father he had been there was not a single memory in which anger played a part not one reconciliation because there had never been a rupture nor one hearttoheart confidence not even when jollys mother died nothing but halfironical affection he had been too afraid of committing himself in any direction for fear of losing his liberty or interfering with that of his boy only in irenes presence had he relief highly complicated by the evergrowing perception of how divided he was between her and his son with jolly was bound up all that sense of continuity and social creed of which he had drunk deeply in his youth and again during his boys public school and varsity life all that sense of not going back on what father and son expected of each other with irene was bound up all his delight in beauty and in nature and he seemed to know less and less which was the stronger within him from such sentimental paralysis he was rudely awakened however one afternoon just as he was starting off to richmond by a young man with a bicycle and a face oddly familiar who came forward faintly smiling mr jolyon forsyte thank you placing an envelope in jolyons hand he wheeled off the path and rode away bewildered jolyon opened it admiralty probate and divorce forsyte v forsyte and forsyte a sensation of shame and disgust was followed by the instant reaction why heres the very thing you want and you dont like it but she must have had one too and he must go to her at once he turned things over as he went along it was an ironical busi ness for whatever the scriptures said about the heart it took more than mere longings to satisfy the law they could perfectly well defend this suit or at least in good faith try to but the idea of doing so revolted jolyon if not her lover in deed he was in desire and he knew that she was ready to come to him her face had told him so not that he exaggerated her feeling for him she had had her grand passion and he could not expect another from her at his age but she had trust in him affection for him and must feel that he would be a refuge surely she would not ask him to defend the suit knowing that he adored her thank heaven she had not that maddening british conscientiousness which refused happiness for the sake of refusing she must rejoice at this chance of being free after seventeen years of death in life as to publicity the fat was in the fire to defend the suit would not take away the slur jolyon had all the proper feeling of a forsyte whose privacy is threatened if he was to be hung by the law by all means let it be for a sheep moreover the notion of standing in a witness box and swearing to the truth that no gesture not even a word of love had passed between them seemed to him more degrading than to take the tacit stigma of being an adulterer more truly degrading considering the feeling in his heart and just as bad and painful for his children the thought of explaining away if he could before a judge and twelve average englishmen their meetings in paris and the walks in richmond park horrified him the brutality and hypocritical censoriousness of the whole process the probability that they would not be believed the mere vision of her whom he looked on as the embodiment of nature and of beauty standing there before all those suspicious gloating eyes was hideous to him no no to defend a suit only made a london holiday and sold the newspapers a thousand times better accept what soames and the gods had sent besides he thought honestly who knows whether even for my boys sake i could have stood this state of things much longer anyway her neck will be out of chancery at last thus absorbed he was hardly conscious of the heavy heat the sky had become overcast purplish with little streaks of white a heavy heatdrop plashed a little star pattern in the dust of the road as he entered the park phew he thought thunder i hope shes not come to meet me theres a ducking up there but at that very minute he saw irene coming towards the gate we must scuttle back to robin hill he thought the storm had passed over the poultry at four oclock bringing welcome distraction to the clerks in every office soames was drinking a cup of tea when a note was brought in to him dear sir forsyte v forsyte and forsyte in accordance with your instructions we beg to inform you that we personally served the respondent and corespondent in this suit today at richmond and robin hill respectively faithfully yours linkman and laver for some minutes soames stared at that note ever since he had given those instructions he had been tempted to annul them it was so scandalous such a general disgrace the evidence too what he had heard of it had never seemed to him conclusive somehow he believed less and less that those two had gone all lengths but this of course would drive them to it and he suffered from the thought that fellow to have her love where he had failed was it too late now that they had been brought up sharp by service of this petition had he not a lever with which he could force them apart but if i dont act at once he thought it will be too late now theyve had this thing ill go and see him ill go down and sick with nervous anxiety he sent out for one of the newfangled motorcabs it might take a long time to run that fellow to ground and goodness knew what decision they might come to after such a shock if i were a theatrical ass he thought i suppose i should be taking a horsewhip or a pistol or something he took instead a bundle of papers in the case of magentie versus wake intending to read them on the way down he did not even open them but sat quite still jolted and jarred unconscious of the draught down the back of his neck or the smell of petrol he must be guided by the fellows attitude the great thing was to keep his head london had already begun to disgorge its workers as he neared putney bridge the antheap was on the move outwards what a lot of ants all with a living to get holding on by their eyelids in the great scramble perhaps for the first time in his life soames thought i could let go if i liked nothing could touch me i could snap my fingers live as i wished enjoy myself no one could not live as he had and just drop it all settle down in capua to spend the money and reputation he had made a mans life was what he possessed and sought to possess only fools thought otherwise fools and socialists and libertines the cab was passing villas now going a great pace fifteen miles an hour i should think he mused thisll take people out of town to live and he thought of its bearing on the portions of london owned by his father he himself had never taken to that form of investment the gambler in him having all the outlet needed in his pictures and the cab sped on down the hill past wimbledon common this interview surely a man of fiftytwo with grownup children and hung on the line would not be reckless he wont want to disgrace the family he thought he was as fond of his father as i am of mine and they were brothers that woman brings destruction what is it in her ive never known the cab branched off along the side of a wood and he heard a late cuckoo calling almost the first he had heard that year he was now almost opposite the site he had originally chosen for his house and which had been so unceremoniously rejected by bosinney in favour of his own choice he began passing his handkerchief over his face and hands taking deep breaths to give him steadiness keep ones head he thought keep ones head the cab turned in at the drive which might have been his own and the sound of music met him he had forgotten the fellows daughters i may be out again directly he said to the driver or i may be kept some time and he rang the bell following the maid through the curtains into the inner hall he felt relieved that the impact of this meeting would be broken by june or holly whichever was playing in there so that with complete surprise he saw irene at the piano and jolyon sitting in an armchair listening they both stood up blood surged into soames brain and all his resolution to be guided by this or that left him utterly the look of his farmer forbears dogged forsytes down by the sea from superior dosset back grinned out of his face very pretty he said he heard the fellow murmur this is hardly the place well go to the study if you dont mind and they both passed him through the curtain opening in the little room to which he followed them irene stood by the open window and the fellow close to her by a big chair soames pulled the door to behind him with a slam the sound carried him back all those years to the day when he had shut out jolyon shut him out for meddling with his affairs well he said what have you to say for yourselves the fellow had the effrontery to smile what we have received today has taken away your right to ask i should imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of chancery oh said soames you think so i came to tell you that ill divorce her with every circumstance of disgrace to you both unless you swear to keep clear of each other from now on he was astonished at his fluency because his mind was stammering and his hands twitching neither of them answered but their faces seemed to him as if contemptuous well he said you irene her lips moved but jolyon laid his hand on her arm let her alone said soames furiously irene will you swear it no oh and you still less so then youre guilty are you yes guilty it was irene speaking in that serene voice with that unreached air which had maddened him so often and carried beyond himself he cried you are a devil go out leave this house or ill do you an injury that fellow to talk of injuries did he know how near his throat was to being scragged a trustee he said embezzling trust property a thief stealing his cousins wife call me what you like you have chosen your part we have chosen ours go out if he had brought a weapon soames might have used it at that moment ill make you pay he said i shall be very happy at that deadly turning of the meaning of his speech by the son of him who had nicknamed him the man of property soames stood glaring it was ridiculous there they were kept from violence by some secret force no blow possible no words to meet the case but he could not did not know how to turn and go away his eyes fastened on irenes face the last time he would ever see that fatal face the last time no doubt you he said suddenly i hope youll treat him as you treated me thats all he saw her wince and with a sensation not quite triumph not quite relief he wrenched open the door passed out through the hall and got into his cab he lolled against the cushion with his eyes shut never in his life had he been so near to murderous violence never so thrown away the restraint which was his second nature he had a stripped and naked feeling as if all virtue had gone out of him life meaningless mindstriking work sunlight streamed in on him but he felt cold the scene he had passed through had gone from him already what was before him would not materialise he could catch on to nothing and he felt frightened as if he had been hanging over the edge of a precipice as if with another turn of the screw sanity would have failed him im not fit for it he thought i mustnt im not fit for it the cab sped on and in mechanical procession trees houses people passed but had no significance i feel very queer he thought ill take a turkish bath ive been very near to something it wont do the cab whirred its way back over the bridge up the fulham road along the park to the hammam said soames curious that on so warm a summer day heat should be so comforting crossing into the hot room he met george forsyte coming out red and glistening hallo said george what are you training for youve not got much superfluous buffoon soames passed him with his sideway smile lying back rubbing his skin uneasily for the first signs of perspiration he thought let them laugh i wont feel anything i cant stand violence its not good for me chapter vii a summer night soames left dead silence in the little study thank you for that good lie said jolyon suddenly come out the air in here is not what it was in front of a long high southerly wall on which were trained peachtrees the two walked up and down in silence old jolyon had planted some cupressustrees at intervals between this grassy terrace and the dipping meadow full of buttercups and oxeyed daisies for twelve years they had flourished till their dark spiral shapes had quite a look of italy birds fluttered softly in the wet shrubbery the swallows swooped past with a steelblue sheen on their swift little bodies the grass felt springy beneath the feet its green refreshed butterflies chased each other after that painful scene the quiet of nature was wonderfully poignant under the sunsoaked wall ran a narrow strip of gardenbed full of mignonette and pansies and from the bees came a low hum in which all other sounds were set the mooing of a cow deprived of her calf the calling of a cuckoo from an elmtree at the bottom of the meadow who would have thought that behind them within ten miles london began that london of the forsytes with its wealth its misery its dirt and noise its jumbled stone isles of beauty its grey sea of hideous brick and stucco that london which had seen irenes early tragedy and jolyons own hard days that web that princely workhouse of the possessive instinct and while they walked jolyon pondered those words i hope youll treat him as you treated me that would depend on himself could he trust himself did nature permit a forsyte not to make a slave of what he adored could beauty be confided to him or should she not be just a visitor coming when she would possessed for moments which passed to return only at her own choosing we are a breed of spoilers thought jolyon close and greedy the bloom of life is not safe with us let her come to me as she will when she will not at all if she will not let me be just her standby her perchingplace nevernever her cage she was the chink of beauty in his dream was he to pass through the curtains now and reach her was the rich stuff of many possessions the close encircling fabric of the possessive instinct walling in that little black figure of himself and soames was it to be rent so that he could pass through into his vision find there something not of the senses only let me he thought ah let me only know how not to grasp and destroy but at dinner there were plans to be made tonight she would go back to the hotel but tomorrow he would take her up to london he must instruct his solicitor jack herring not a finger must be raised to hinder the process of the law damages exemplary judicial strictures costs what they liked let it go through at the first moment so that her neck might be out of chancery at last tomorrow he would see herring they would go and see him together and then abroad leaving no doubt no difficulty about evidence making the lie she had told into the truth he looked round at her and it seemed to his adoring eyes that more than a woman was sitting there the spirit of universal beauty deep mysterious which the old painters titian giorgione botticelli had known how to capture and transfer to the faces of their women this flying beauty seemed to him imprinted on her brow her hair her lips and in her eyes and this is to be mine he thought it frightens me after dinner they went out on to the terrace to have coffee they sat there long the evening was so lovely watching the summer night come very slowly on it was still warm and the air smelled of lime blossom early this summer two bats were flighting with the faint mysterious little noise they make he had placed the chairs in front of the study window and moths flew past to visit the discreet light in there there was no wind and not a whisper in the old oaktree twenty yards away the moon rose from behind the copse nearly full and the two lights struggled till moonlight conquered changing the colour and quality of all the garden stealing along the flagstones reaching their feet climbing up changing their faces well said jolyon at last youll be tired dear wed better start the maid will show you hollys room and he rang the study bell the maid who came handed him a telegram watching her take irene away he thought this must have come an hour or more ago and she didnt bring it out to us that shows well well be hung for a sheep soon and opening the telegram he read jolyon forsyte robin hill your son passed painlessly away on june th deep sympathy some name unknown to him he dropped it spun round stood motionless the moon shone in on him a moth flew in his face the first day of all that he had not thought almost ceaselessly of jolly he went blindly towards the window struck against the old armchair his fathers and sank down on to the arm of it he sat there huddled forward staring into the night gone out like a candle flame far from home from love all by himself in the dark his boy from a little chap always so good to him so friendly twenty years old and cut down like grass to have no life at all i didnt really know him he thought and he didnt know me but we loved each other its only love that matters to die out there lonely wanting them wanting home this seemed to his forsyte heart more painful more pitiful than death itself no shelter no protection no love at the last and all the deeply rooted clanship in him the family feeling and essential clinging to his own flesh and blood which had been so strong in old jolyon was so strong in all the forsytes felt outraged cut and torn by his boys lonely passing better far if he had died in battle without time to long for them to come to him to call out for them perhaps in his delirium the moon had passed behind the oaktree now endowing it with uncanny life so that it seemed watching him the oaktree his boy had been so fond of climbing out of which he had once fallen and hurt himself and hadnt cried the door creaked he saw irene come in pick up the telegram and read it he heard the faint rustle of her dress she sank on her knees close to him and he forced himself to smile at her she stretched up her arms and drew his head down on her shoulder the perfume and warmth of her encircled him her presence gained slowly his whole being chapter viii james in waiting sweated to serenity soames dined at the remove and turned his face toward park lane his father had been unwell lately this would have to be kept from him never till that moment had he realised how much the dread of bringing james grey hairs down with sorrow to the grave had counted with him how intimately it was bound up with his own shrinking from scandal his affection for his father always deep had increased of late years with the knowledge that james looked on him as the real prop of his decline it seemed pitiful that one who had been so careful all his life and done so much for the family name so that it was almost a byword for solid wealthy respectability should at his last gasp have to see it in all the newspapers this was like lending a hand to death that final enemy of forsytes i must tell mother he thought and when it comes on we must keep the papers from him somehow he sees hardly anyone letting himself in with his latchkey he was beginning to ascend he stairs when he became conscious of commotion on the secondfloor landing his mothers voice was saying now james youll catch cold why cant you wait quietly his fathers answering wait im always waiting why doesnt he come in you can speak to him tomorrow morning instead of making a guy of yourself on the landing hell go up to bed i shouldnt wonder i shant sleep now come back to bed james um i might die before tomorrow morning for all you can tell you shant have to wait till tomorrow morning ill go down and bring him up dont fuss there you go always so cockahoop he maynt come in at all well if he doesnt come in you wont catch him by standing out here in your dressinggown soames rounded the last bend and came in sight of his fathers tall figure wrapped in a brown silk quilted gown stooping over the balustrade above light fell on his silvery hair and whiskers investing his head with a sort of halo here he is he heard him say in a voice which sounded injured and his mothers comfortable answer from the bedroom door thats all right come in and ill brush your hair james extended a thin crooked finger oddly like the beckoning of a skeleton and passed through the doorway of his bedroom what is it thought soames what has he got hold of now his father was sitting before the dressingtable sideways to the mirror while emily slowly passed two silverbacked brushes through and through his hair she would do this several times a day for it had on him something of the effect produced on a cat by scratching between its ears there you are he said ive been waiting soames stroked his shoulder and taking up a silver buttonhook examined the mark on it well he said youre looking better james shook his head i want to say something your mother hasnt heard he announced emilys ignorance of what he hadnt told her as if it were a grievance your fathers been in a great state all the evening im sure i dont know what about the faint whiskwhisk of the brushes continued the soothing of her voice no you know nothing said james soames can tell me and fixing his grey eyes in which there was a look of strain uncomfortable to watch on his son he muttered im getting on soames at my age i cant tell i might die any time therell be a lot of money theres rachel and cicely got no children and vals out there that chap his father will get hold of all he can and somebodyll pick up imogen i shouldnt wonder soames listened vaguely he had heard all this before whish whish went the brushes if thats all said emily all cried james its nothing im coming to that and again his eyes strained pitifully at soames its you my boy he said suddenly you ought to get a divorce that word from those of all lips was almost too much for soames composure his eyes reconcentrated themselves quickly on the buttonhook and as if in apology james hurried on i dont know whats become of her they say shes abroad your uncle swithin used to admire her he was a funny fellow so he always alluded to his dead twinthe stout and the lean of it they had been called she wouldnt be alone i should say and with that summingup of the effect of beauty on human nature he was silent watching his son with eyes doubting as a birds soames too was silent whishwhish went the brushes come james soames knows best its his business ah said james and the word came from deep down but theres all my money and theres his whos it to go to and when he dies the name goes out soames replaced the buttonhook on the lace and pink silk of the dressingtable coverlet the name said emily there are all the other forsytes as if that helped me muttered james i shall be in my grave and therell be nobody unless he marries again youre quite right said soames quietly im getting a divorce james eyes almost started from his head what he cried there nobody tells me anything well said emily who would have imagined you wanted it my dear boy that is a surprise after all these years itll be a scandal muttered james as if to himself but i cant help that dont brush so hard whenll it come on before the long vacation its not defended james lips moved in secret calculation i shant live to see my grandson he muttered emily ceased brushing of course you will james soames will be as quick as he can there was a long silence till james reached out his arm here lets have the eaudecologne and putting it to his nose he moved his forehead in the direction of his son soames bent over and kissed that brow just where the hair began a relaxing quiver passed over james face as though the wheels of anxiety within were running down ill get to bed he said i shant want to see the papers when that comes theyre a morbid lot i cant pay attention to them im too old queerly affected soames went to the door he heard his father say here im tired ill say a prayer in bed and his mother answering thats right james itll be ever so much more comfy chapter ix out of the web on forsyte change the announcement of jollys death among a batch of troopers caused mixed sensation strange to read that jolyon forsyte fifth of the name in direct descent had died of disease in the service of his country and not be able to feel it personally it revived the old grudge against his father for having estranged himself for such was still the prestige of old jolyon that the other forsytes could never quite feel as might have been expected that it was they who had cut off his descendants for irregularity the news increased of course the interest and anxiety about val but then vals name was dartie and even if he were killed in battle or got the victoria cross it would not be at all the same as if his name were forsyte not even casualty or glory to the haymans would be really satisfactory family pride felt defrauded how the rumour arose then that something very dreadful my dear was pending no one least of all soames could tell secret as he kept everything possibly some eye had seen forsyte v forsyte and forsyte in the cause list and had added it to irene in paris with a fair beard possibly some wall at park lane had ears the fact remained that it was known whispered among the old discussed among the young that family pride must soon receive a blow soames paying one of his sunday visits to timothys paying it with the feeling that after the suit came on he would be paying no more felt knowledge in the air as he came in nobody of course dared speak of it before him but each of the four other forsytes present held their breath aware that nothing could prevent aunt juley from making them all uncomfortable she looked so piteously at soames she checked herself on the point of speech so often that aunt hester excused herself and said she must go and bathe timothys eye he had a sty coming soames impassive slightly supercilious did not stay long he went out with a curse stifled behind his pale just smiling lips fortunately for the peace of his mind cruelly tortured by the coming scandal he was kept busy day and night with plans for his retirement for he had come to that grim conclusion to go on seeing all those people who had known him as a longheaded chap an astute adviser after that no the fastidiousness and pride which was so strangely so inextricably blended in him with possessive obtuseness revolted against the thought he would retire live privately go on buying pictures make a great name as a collector after all his heart was more in that than it had ever been in law in pursuance of this now fixed resolve he had to get ready to amalgamate his business with another firm without letting people know for that would excite curiosity and make humiliation cast its shadow before he had pitched on the firm of cuthcott holliday and kingson two of whom were dead the full name after the amalgamation would therefore be cuthcott holliday kingson forsyte bustard and forsyte but after debate as to which of the dead still had any influence with the living it was decided to reduce the title to cuthcott kingson and forsyte of whom kingson would be the active and soames the sleeping partner for leaving his name prestige and clients behind him soames would receive considerable value one night as befitted a man who had arrived at so important a stage of his career he made a calculation of what he was worth and after writing off liberally for depreciation by the war found his value to be some hundred and thirty thousand pounds at his fathers death which could not alas be delayed much longer he must come into at least another fifty thousand and his yearly expenditure at present just reached two standing among his pictures he saw before him a future full of bargains earned by the trained faculty of knowing better than other people selling what was about to decline keeping what was still going up and exercising judicious insight into future taste he would make a unique collection which at his death would pass to the nation under the title forsyte bequest if the divorce went through he had determined on his line with madame lamotte she had he knew but one real ambition to live on her renter in paris near her grandchildren he would buy the goodwill of the restaurant bretagne at a fancy price madame would live like a queenmother in paris on the interest invested as she would know how incidentally soames meant to put a capable manager in her place and make the restaurant pay good interest on his money there were great possibilities in soho on annette he would promise to settle fifteen thousand pounds whether designedly or not precisely the sum old jolyon had settled on that woman a letter from jolyons solicitor to his own had disclosed the fact that those two were in italy and an opportunity had been duly given for noting that they had first stayed at an hotel in london the matter was clear as daylight and would be disposed of in half an hour or so but during that halfhour he soames would go down to hell and after that halfhour all bearers of the forsyte name would feel the bloom was off the rose he had no illusions like shakespeare that roses by any other name would smell as sweet the name was a possession a concrete unstained piece of property the value of which would be reduced some twenty per cent at least unless it were roger who had once refused to stand for parliament and oh irony jolyon hung on the line there had never been a distinguished forsyte but that very lack of distinction was the names greatest asset it was a private name intensely individual and his own property it had never been exploited for good or evil by intrusive report he and each member of his family owned it wholly sanely secretly without any more interference from the public than had been necessitated by their births their marriages their deaths and during these weeks of waiting and preparing to drop the law he conceived for that law a bitter distaste so deeply did he resent its coming violation of his name forced on him by the need he felt to perpetuate that name in a lawful manner the monstrous injustice of the whole thing excited in him a perpetual suppressed fury he had asked no better than to live in spotless domesticity and now he must go into the witness box after all these futile barren years and proclaim his failure to keep his wife incur the pity the amusement the contempt of his kind it was all upside down she and that fellow ought to be the sufferers and they were in italy in these weeks the law he had served so faithfully looked on so reverently as the guardian of all property seemed to him quite pitiful what could be more insane than to tell a man that he owned his wife and punish him when someone unlawfully took her away from him did the law not know that a mans name was to him the apple of his eye that it was far harder to be regarded as cuckold than as seducer he actually envied jolyon the reputation of succeeding where he soames had failed the question of damages worried him too he wanted to make that fellow suffer but he remembered his cousins words i shall be very happy with the uneasy feeling that to claim damages would make not jolyon but himself suffer he felt uncannily that jolyon would rather like to pay them the chap was so loose besides to claim damages was not the thing to do the claim indeed had been made almost mechanically and as the hour drew near soames saw in it just another dodge of this insensitive and topsyturvy law to make him ridiculous so that people might sneer and say oh yes he got quite a good price for her and he gave instructions that his counsel should state that the money would be given to a home for fallen women he was a long time hitting off exactly the right charity but having pitched on it he used to wake up in the night and think it wont do too lurid itll draw attention something quieter better taste he did not care for dogs or he would have named them and it was in desperation at last for his knowledge of charities was limited that he decided on the blind that could not be inappropriate and it would make the jury assess the damages high a good many suits were dropping out of the list which happened to be exceptionally thin that summer so that his case would be reached before august as the day grew nearer winifred was his only comfort she showed the fellowfeeling of one who had been through the mill and was the femmesole in whom he confided well knowing that she would not let dartie into her confidence that ruffian would be only too rejoiced at the end of july on the afternoon before the case he went in to see her they had not yet been able to leave town because dartie had already spent their summer holiday and winifred dared not go to her father for more money while he was waiting not to be told anything about this affair of soames soames found her with a letter in her hand that from val he asked gloomily what does he say he says hes married said winifred whom to for goodness sake winifred looked up at him to holly forsyte jolyons daughter what he got leave and did it i didnt even know he knew her awkward isnt it soames uttered a short laugh at that characteristic minimisation awkward well i dont suppose theyll hear about this till they come back theyd better stay out there that fellow will give her money but i want val back said winifred almost piteously i miss him he helps me to get on i know murmured soames hows dartie behaving now it might be worse but its always money would you like me to come down to the court tomorrow soames soames stretched out his hand for hers the gesture so betrayed the loneliness in him that she pressed it between her two never mind old boy youll feel ever so much better when its all over i dont know what ive done said soames huskily i never have its all upside down i was fond of her ive always been winifred saw a drop of blood ooze out of his lip and the sight stirred her profoundly of course she said its been too bad of her all along but what shall i do about this marriage of vals soames i dont know how to write to him with this coming on youve seen that child is she pretty yes shes pretty said soames dark ladylike enough that doesnt sound so bad thought winifred jolyon had style it is a coil she said what will father say mustnt be told said soames the warll soon be over now youd better let val take to farming out there it was tantamount to saying that his nephew was lost i havent told monty winifred murmured desolately the case was reached before noon next day and was over in little more than half an hour soames pale spruce sadeyed in the witnessbox had suffered so much beforehand that he took it all like one dead the moment the decree nisi was pronounced he left the courts of justice four hours until he became public property solicitors divorce suit a surly dogged anger replaced that dead feeling within him damn them all he thought i wont run away ill act as if nothing had happened and in the sweltering heat of fleet street and ludgate hill he walked all the way to his city club lunched and went back to his office he worked there stolidly throughout the afternoon on his way out he saw that his clerks knew and answered their involuntary glances with a look so sardonic that they were immediately withdrawn in front of st pauls he stopped to buy the most gentlemanly of the evening papers yes there he was wellknown solicitors divorce cousin corespondent damages given to the blind so they had got that in at every other face he thought i wonder if you know and suddenly he felt queer as if something were racing round in his head what was this he was letting it get hold of him he mustnt he would be ill he mustnt think he would get down to the river and row about and fish im not going to be laid up he thought it flashed across him that he had something of importance to do before he went out of town madame lamotte he must explain the law another six months before he was really free only he did not want to see annette and he passed his hand over the top of his head it was very hot he branched off through covent garden on this sultry day of late july the garbagetainted air of the old market offended him and soho seemed more than ever the disenchanted home of rapscallionism alone the restaurant bretagne neat daintily painted with its blue tubs and the dwarf trees therein retained an aloof and frenchified selfrespect it was the slack hour and pale trim waitresses were preparing the little tables for dinner soames went through into the private part to his discomfiture annette answered his knock she too looked pale and dragged down by the heat you are quite a stranger she said languidly soames smiled i havent wished to be ive been busy wheres your mother annette ive got some news for her mother is not in it seemed to soames that she looked at him in a queer way what did she know how much had her mother told her the worry of trying to make that out gave him an alarming feeling in the head he gripped the edge of the table and dizzily saw annette come forward her eyes clear with surprise he shut his own and said its all right ive had a touch of the sun i think the sun what he had was a touch of darkness annettes voice french and composed said sit down it will pass then her hand pressed his shoulder and soames sank into a chair when the dark feeling dispersed and he opened his eyes she was looking down at him what an inscrutable and odd expression for a girl of twenty do you feel better its nothing said soames instinct told him that to be feeble before her was not helping him age was enough handicap without that willpower was his fortune with annette he had lost ground these latter months from indecision he could not afford to lose any more he got up and said ill write to your mother im going down to my river house for a long holiday i want you both to come there presently and stay its just at its best you will wont you it will be veree nice a pretty little roll of that r but no enthusiasm and rather sadly he added youre feeling the heat too arent you annette itll do you good to be on the river goodnight annette swayed forward there was a sort of compunction in the movement are you fit to go shall i give you some coffee no said soames firmly give me your hand she held out her hand and soames raised it to his lips when he looked up her face wore again that strange expression i cant tell he thought as he went out but i mustnt think i mustnt worry but worry he did walking toward pall mall english not of her religion middleaged scarred as it were by domestic tragedy what had he to give her only wealth social position leisure admiration it was much but was it enough for a beautiful girl of twenty he felt so ignorant about annette he had too a curious fear of the french nature of her mother and herself they knew so well what they wanted they were almost forsytes they would never grasp a shadow and miss a substance the tremendous effort it was to write a simple note to madame lamotte when he reached his club warned him still further that he was at the end of his tether my dear madame he said you will see by the enclosed newspaper cutting that i obtained my decree of divorce today by the english law i shall not however be free to marry again till the decree is confirmed six months hence in the meanwhile i have the honor to ask to be considered a formal suitor for the hand of your daughter i shall write again in a few days and beg you both to come and stay at my river house i am dear madame sincerely yours soames forsyte having sealed and posted this letter he went into the diningroom three mouthfuls of soup convinced him that he could not eat and causing a cab to be summoned he drove to paddington station and took the first train to reading he reached his house just as the sun went down and wandered out on to the lawn the air was drenched with the scent of pinks and picotees in his flower borders a stealing coolness came off the river restpeace let a poor fellow rest let not worry and shame and anger chase like evil nightbirds in his head like those doves perched halfsleeping on their dovecot like the furry creatures in the woods on the far side and the simple folk in their cottages like the trees and the river itself whitening fast in twilight like the darkening cornflowerblue sky where stars were coming up let him cease from himself and rest chapter x passing of an age the marriage of soames with annette took place in paris on the last day of january with such privacy that not even emily was told until it was accomplished the day after the wedding he brought her to one of those quiet hotels in london where greater expense can be incurred for less result than anywhere else under heaven her beauty in the best parisian frocks was giving him more satisfaction than if he had collected a perfect bit of china or a jewel of a picture he looked forward to the moment when he would exhibit her in park lane in green street and at timothys if some one had asked him in those days in confidence are you in love with this girl he would have replied in love what is love if you mean do i feel to her as i did towards irene in those old days when i first met her and she would not have me when i sighed and starved after her and couldnt rest a minute until she yielded no if you mean do i admire her youth and prettiness do my senses ache a little when i see her moving about yes do i think she will keep me straight make me a creditable wife and a good mother for my children again yes what more do i need and what more do threequarters of the women who are married get from the men who marry them and if the enquirer had pursued his query and do you think it was fair to have tempted this girl to give herself to you for life unless you have really touched her heart he would have answered the french see these things differently from us they look at marriage from the point of view of establishments and children and from my own experience i am not at all sure that theirs is not the sensible view i shall not expect this time more than i can get or she can give years hence i shouldnt be surprised if i have trouble with her but i shall be getting old i shall have children by then i shall shut my eyes i have had my great passion hers is perhaps to come i dont suppose it will be for me i offer her a great deal and i dont expect much in return except children or at least a son but one thing i am sure of she has very good sense and if insatiate the enquirer had gone on you do not look then for spiritual union in this marriage soames would have lifted his sideway smile and rejoined thats as it may be if i get satisfaction for my senses perpetuation of myself good taste and good humour in the house it is all i can expect at my age i am not likely to be going out of my way towards any farfetched sentimentalism whereon the enquirer must in good taste have ceased enquiry the queen was dead and the air of the greatest city upon earth grey with unshed tears furcoated and tophatted with annette beside him in dark furs soames crossed park lane on the morning of the funeral procession to the rails in hyde park little moved though he ever was by public matters this event supremely symbolical this summingup of a long rich period impressed his fancy in when she came to the throne superior dosset was still building houses to make london hideous and james a stripling of twentysix just laying the foundations of his practice in the law coaches still ran men wore stocks shaved their upper lips ate oysters out of barrels tigers swung behind cabriolets women said la and owned no property there were manners in the land and pigsties for the poor unhappy devils were hanged for little crimes and dickens had but just begun to write wellnigh two generations had slipped by of steamboats railways telegraphs bicycles electric light telephones and now these motorcars of such accumulated wealth that eight per cent had become three and forsytes were numbered by the thousand morals had changed manners had changed men had become monkeys twice removed god had become mammon mammon so respectable as to deceive himself sixtyfour years that favoured property and had made the upper middle class buttressed chiselled polished it till it was almost indistinguishable in manners morals speech appearance habit and soul from the nobility an epoch which had gilded individual liberty so that if a man had money he was free in law and fact and if he had not money he was free in law and not in fact an era which had canonised hypocrisy so that to seem to be respectable was to be a great age whose transmuting influence nothing had escaped save the nature of man and the nature of the universe and to witness the passing of this age london its pet and fancy was pouring forth her citizens through every gate into hyde park hub of victorianism happy huntingground of forsytes under the grey heavens whose drizzle just kept off the dark concourse gathered to see the show the good old queen full of years and virtue had emerged from her seclusion for the last time to make a london holiday from houndsditch acton ealing hampstead islington and bethnal green from hackney hornsey leytonstone battersea and fulham and from those green pastures where forsytes flourish mayfair and kensington st james and belgravia bayswater and chelsea and the regents park the people swarmed down on to the roads where death would presently pass with dusky pomp and pageantry never again would a queen reign so long or people have a chance to see so much history buried for their money a pity the war dragged on and that the wreath of victory could not be laid upon her coffin all else would be there to follow and commemorate soldiers sailors foreign princes halfmasted bunting tolling bells and above all the surging great darkcoated crowd with perhaps a simple sadness here and there deep in hearts beneath black clothes put on by regulation after all more than a queen was going to her rest a woman who had braved sorrow lived well and wisely according to her lights out in the crowd against the railings with his arm hooked in annettes soames waited yes the age was passing what with this trade unionism and labour fellows in the house of commons with continental fiction and something in the general feel of everything not to be expressed in words things were very different he recalled the crowd on mafeking night and george forsyte saying theyre all socialists they want our goods like james soames didnt know he couldnt tell with edward on the throne things would never be as safe again as under good old viccy convulsively he pressed his young wifes arm there at any rate was something substantially his own domestically certain again at last something which made property worth while a real thing once more pressed close against her and trying to ward others off soames was content the crowd swayed round them ate sandwiches and dropped crumbs boys who had climbed the planetrees chattered above like monkeys threw twigs and orangepeel it was past time they should be coming soon and suddenly a little behind them to the left he saw a tallish man with a soft hat and short grizzling beard and a tallish woman in a little round fur cap and veil jolyon and irene talking smiling at each other close together like annette and himself they had not seen him and stealthily with a very queer feeling in his heart soames watched those two they looked happy what had they come here for inherently illicit creatures rebels from the victorian ideal what business had they in this crowd each of them twice exiled by morality making a boast as it were of love and laxity he watched them fascinated admitting grudgingly even with his arm thrust through annettes that that she irene no he would not admit it and he turned his eyes away he would not see them and let the old bitterness the old longing rise up within him and then annette turned to him and said those two people soames they know you i am sure who are they soames nosed sideways what people there you see them just turning away they know you no soames answered a mistake my dear a lovely face and how she walk elle est tres distinguee soames looked then into his life out of his life she had walked like that swaying and erect remote unseizable ever eluding the contact of his soul he turned abruptly from that receding vision of the past youd better attend he said theyre coming now but while he stood grasping her arm seemingly intent on the head of the procession he was quivering with the sense of always missing something with instinctive regret that he had not got them both slow came the music and the march till in silence the long line wound in through the park gate he heard annette whisper how sad it is and beautiful felt the clutch of her hand as she stood up on tiptoe and the crowds emotion gripped him there it was the bier of the queen coffin of the age slow passing and as it went by there came a murmuring groan from all the long line of those who watched a sound such as soames had never heard so unconscious primitive deep and wild that neither he nor any knew whether they had joined in uttering it strange sound indeed tribute of an age to its own death ah ah the hold on life had slipped that which had seemed eternal was gone the queen god bless her it moved on with the bier that travelling groan as a fire moves on over grass in a thin line it kept step and marched alongside down the dense crowds mile after mile it was a human sound and yet inhuman pushed out by animal subconsciousness by intimate knowledge of universal death and change none of us none of us can hold on for ever it left silence for a little a very little time till tongues began eager to retrieve interest in the show soames lingered just long enough to gratify annette then took her out of the park to lunch at his fathers in park lane james had spent the morning gazing out of his bedroom window the last show he would see last of so many so she was gone well she was getting an old woman swithin and he had seen her crowned slim slip of a girl not so old as imogen she had got very stout of late jolyon and he had seen her married to that german chap her husband he had turned out all right before he died and left her with that son of his and he remembered the many evenings he and his brothers and their cronies had wagged their heads over their wine and walnuts and that fellow in his salad days and now he had come to the throne they said he had steadied down he didnt know couldnt tell hed make the money fly still he shouldnt wonder what a lot of people out there it didnt seem so very long since he and swithin stood in the crowd outside westminster abbey when she was crowned and swithin had taken him to cremorne afterwards racketty chap swithin no it didnt seem much longer ago than jubilee year when he had joined with roger in renting a balcony in piccadilly jolyon swithin roger all gone and he would be ninety in august and there was soames married again to a french girl the french were a queer lot but they made good mothers he had heard things changed they said this german emperor was here for the funeral his telegram to old kruger had been in shocking taste he should not be surprised if that chap made trouble some day change hm well they must look after themselves when he was gone he didnt know where hed be and now emily had asked dartie to lunch with winifred and imogen to meet soames wife she was always doing something and there was irene living with that fellow jolyon they said hed marry her now he supposed my brother jolyon he thought what would he have said to it all and somehow the utter impossibility of knowing what his elder brother once so looked up to would have said so worried james that he got up from his chair by the window and began slowly feebly to pace the room she was a pretty thing too he thought i was fond of her perhaps soames didnt suit her i dont know i cant tell we never had any trouble with our wives women had changed everything had changed and now the queen was dead well there it was a movement in the crowd brought him to a standstill at the window his nose touching the pane and whitening from the chill of it they had got her as far as hyde park corner they were passing now why didnt emily come up here where she could see instead of fussing about lunch he missed her at that moment missed her through the bare branches of the planetrees he could just see the procession could see the hats coming off the peoples heads a lot of them would catch colds he shouldnt wonder a voice behind him said youve got a capital view here james there you are muttered james why didnt you come before you might have missed it and he was silent staring with all his might whats the noise he asked suddenly theres no noise returned emily what are you thinking of they wouldnt cheer i can hear it nonsense james no sound came through those double panes what james heard was the groaning in his own heart at sight of his age passing dont you ever tell me where im buried he said suddenly i shant want to know and he turned from the window there she went the old queen shed had a lot of anxiety shed be glad to be out of it he should think emily took up the hairbrushes therell be just time to brush your head she said before they come you must look your best james ah muttered james they say shes pretty the meeting with his new daughterinlaw took place in the diningroom james was seated by the fire when she was brought in he placed his hands on the arms of the chair and slowly raised himself stooping and immaculate in his frockcoat thin as a line in euclid he received annettes hand in his and the anxious eyes of his furrowed face which had lost its colour now doubted above her a little warmth came into them and into his cheeks refracted from her bloom how are you he said youve been to see the queen i suppose did you have a good crossing in this way he greeted her from whom he hoped for a grandson of his name gazing at him so old thin white and spotless annette murmured something in french which james did not understand yes yes he said you want your lunch i expect soames ring the bell we wont wait for that chap dartie but just then they arrived dartie had refused to go out of his way to see the old girl with an early cocktail beside him he had taken a squint from the smokingroom of the iseeum so that winifred and imogen had been obliged to come back from the park to fetch him thence his brown eyes rested on annette with a stare of almost startled satisfaction the second beauty that fellow soames had picked up what women could see in him well she would play him the same trick as the other no doubt but in the meantime he was a lucky devil and he brushed up his moustache having in nine months of green street domesticity regained almost all his flesh and his assurance despite the comfortable efforts of emily winifreds composure imogens enquiring friendliness darties showingoff and james solicitude about her food it was not soames felt a successful lunch for his bride he took her away very soon that monsieur dartie said annette in the cab je naime pas ce typela no by george said soames your sister is veree amiable and the girl is pretty your father is veree old i think your mother has trouble with him i should not like to be her soames nodded at the shrewdness the clear hard judgment in his young wife but it disquieted him a little the thought may have just flashed through him too when im eighty shell be fiftyfive having trouble with me theres just one other house of my relations i must take you to he said youll find it funny but we must get it over and then well dine and go to the theatre in this way he prepared her for timothys but timothys was different they were delighted to see dear soames after this long long time and so this was annette you are so pretty my dear almost too young and pretty for dear soames arent you but hes very attentive and careful such a good hush aunt juley checked herself and placed her lips just under each of annettes eyes she afterwards described them to francie who dropped in as cornflowerblue so pretty i quite wanted to kiss them i must say dear soames is a perfect connoisseur in her french way and not so very french either i think shes as pretty though not so distinguished not so alluring as irene because she was alluring wasnt she with that white skin and those dark eyes and that hair couleur de what was it i always forget feuille morte francie prompted of course dead leaves so strange i remember when i was a girl before we came to london we had a foxhound puppy to walk it was called then it had a tan top to its head and a white chest and beautiful dark brown eyes and it was a lady yes auntie said francie but i dont see the connection oh replied aunt juley rather flustered it was so alluring and her eyes and hair you know she was silent as if surprised in some indelicacy feuille morte she added suddenly hester do remember that considerable debate took place between the two sisters whether timothy should or should not be summoned to see annette oh dont bother said soames but its no trouble only of course annettes being french might upset him a little he was so scared about fashoda i think perhaps we had better not run the risk hester its nice to have her all to ourselves isnt it and how are you soames have you quite got over your hester interposed hurriedly what do you think of london annette soames disquieted awaited the reply it came sensible composed oh i know london i have visited before he had never ventured to speak to her on the subject of the restaurant the french had different notions about gentility and to shrink from connection with it might seem to her ridiculous he had waited to be married before mentioning it and now he wished he hadnt and what part do you know best said aunt juley soho said annette simply soames snapped his jaw soho repeated aunt juley soho thatll go round the family thought soames its very french and interesting he said yes murmured aunt juley your uncle roger had some houses there once he was always having to turn the tenants out i remember soames changed the subject to mapledurham of course said aunt juley you will be going down there soon to settle in we are all so looking forward to the time when annette has a dear little juley cried aunt hester desperately ring tea soames dared not wait for tea and took annette away i shouldnt mention soho if i were you he said in the cab its rather a shady part of london and youre altogether above that restaurant business now i mean he added i want you to know nice people and the english are fearful snobs annettes clear eyes opened a little smile came on her lips yes she said hm thought soames thats meant for me and he looked at her hard shes got good business instincts he thought i must make her grasp it once for all look here annette its very simple only it wants understanding our professional and leisured classes still think themselves a cut above our business classes except of course the very rich it may be stupid but there it is you see it isnt advisable in england to let people know that you ran a restaurant or kept a shop or were in any kind of trade it may have been extremely creditable but it puts a sort of label on you you dont have such a good time or meet such nice people thats all i see said annette it is the same in france oh murmured soames at once relieved and taken aback of course class is everything really yes said annette comme vous etes sage thats all right thought soames watching her lips only shes pretty cynical his knowledge of french was not yet such as to make him grieve that she had not said tu he slipped his arm round her and murmured with an effort et vous etes ma belle femme annette went off into a little fit of laughter oh non she said oh non ne parlez pas francais soames what is that old lady your aunt looking forward to soames bit his lip god knows he said shes always saying something but he knew better than god chapter xi suspended animation the war dragged on nicholas had been heard to say that it would cost three hundred millions if it cost a penny before theyd done with it the incometax was seriously threatened still there would be south africa for their money once for all and though the possessive instinct felt badly shaken at three oclock in the morning it recovered by breakfasttime with the recollection that one gets nothing in this world without paying for it so on the whole people went about their business much as if there were no war no concentration camps no slippery de wet no feeling on the continent no anything unpleasant indeed the attitude of the nation was typified by timothys map whose animation was suspended for timothy no longer moved the flags and they could not move themselves not even backwards and forwards as they should have done suspended animation went further it invaded forsyte change and produced a general uncertainty as to what was going to happen next the announcement in the marriage column of the times jolyon forsyte to irene only daughter of the late professor heron had occasioned doubt whether irene had been justly described and yet on the whole relief was felt that she had not been entered as irene late the wife or the divorced wife of soames forsyte altogether there had been a kind of sublimity from the first about the way the family had taken that affair as james had phrased it there it was no use to fuss nothing to be had out of admitting that it had been a nasty jar in the phraseology of the day but what would happen now that both soames and jolyon were married again that was very intriguing george was known to have laid eustace six to four on a little jolyon before a little soames george was so droll it was rumoured too that he and dartie had a bet as to whether james would attain the age of ninety though which of them had backed james no one knew early in may winifred came round to say that val had been wounded in the leg by a spent bullet and was to be discharged his wife was nursing him he would have a little limp nothing to speak of he wanted his grandfather to buy him a farm out there where he could breed horses her father was giving holly eight hundred a year so they could be quite comfortable because his grandfather would give val five he had said but as to the farm he didnt know couldnt tell he didnt want val to go throwing away his money but you know said winifred he must do something aunt hester thought that perhaps his dear grandfather was wise because if he didnt buy a farm it couldnt turn out badly but val loves horses said winifred itd be such an occupation for him aunt juley thought that horses were very uncertain had not montague found them so vals different said winifred he takes after me aunt juley was sure that dear val was very clever i always remember she added how he gave his bad penny to a beggar his dear grandfather was so pleased he thought it showed such presence of mind i remember his saying that he ought to go into the navy aunt hester chimed in did not winifred think that it was much better for the young people to be secure and not run any risk at their age well said winifred if they were in london perhaps in london its amusing to do nothing but out there of course hell simply get bored to death aunt hester thought that it would be nice for him to work if he were quite sure not to lose by it it was not as if they had no money timothy of course had done so well by retiring aunt juley wanted to know what montague had said winifred did not tell her for montague had merely remarked wait till the old man dies at this moment francie was announced her eyes were brimming with a smile well she said what do you think of it of what dear in the times this morning we havent seen it we always read it after dinner timothy has it till then francie rolled her eyes do you think you ought to tell us said aunt juley what was it irenes had a son at robin hill aunt juley drew in her breath but she said they were only married in march yes auntie isnt it interesting well said winifred im glad i was sorry for jolyon losing his boy it might have been val aunt juley seemed to go into a sort of dream i wonder she murmured what dear soames will think he has so wanted to have a son himself a little bird has always told me that well said winifred hes going to bar accidents gladness trickled out of aunt juleys eyes how delightful she said when november such a lucky month but she did wish it could be sooner it was a long time for james to wait at his age to wait they dreaded it for james but they were used to it themselves indeed it was their great distraction to wait for the times to read for one or other of their nieces or nephews to come in and cheer them up for news of nicholas health for that decision of christophers about going on the stage for information concerning the mine of mrs macanders nephew for the doctor to come about hesters inclination to wake up early in the morning for books from the library which were always out for timothy to have a cold for a nice quiet warm day not too hot when they could take a turn in kensington gardens to wait one on each side of the hearth in the drawingroom for the clock between them to strike their thin veined knuckled hands plying knittingneedles and crochethooks their hair ordered to stop like canutes waves from any further advance in colour to wait in their black silks or satins for the court to say that hester might wear her dark green and juley her darker maroon to wait slowly turning over and over in their old minds the little joys and sorrows events and expectancies of their little family world as cows chew patient cuds in a familiar field and this new event was so well worth waiting for soames had always been their pet with his tendency to give them pictures and his almost weekly visits which they missed so much and his need for their sympathy evoked by the wreck of his first marriage this new event the birth of an heir to soames was so important for him and for his dear father too that james might not have to die without some certainty about things james did so dislike uncertainty and with montague of course he could not feel really satisfied to leave no grand children but the young darties after all ones own name did count and as james ninetieth birthday neared they wondered what precautions he was taking he would be the first of the forsytes to reach that age and set as it were a new standard in holding on to life that was so important they felt at their ages eighty seven and eightyfive though they did not want to think of themselves when they had timothy who was not yet eightytwo to think of there was of course a better world in my fathers house are many mansions was one of aunt juleys favourite sayings it always comforted her with its suggestion of house property which had made the fortune of dear roger the bible was indeed a great resource and on very fine sundays there was church in the morning and sometimes juley would steal into timothys study when she was sure he was out and just put an open new testament casually among the books on his little table he was a great reader of course having been a publisher but she had noticed that timothy was always cross at dinner afterwards and smither had told her more than once that she had picked books off the floor in doing the room still with all that they did feel that heaven could not be quite so cosy as the rooms in which they and timothy had been waiting so long aunt hester especially could not bear the thought of the exertion any change or rather the thought of a change for there never was any always upset her very much aunt juley who had more spirit sometimes thought it would be quite exciting she had so enjoyed that visit to brighton the year dear susan died but then brighton one knew was nice and it was so difficult to tell what heaven would be like so on the whole she was more than content to wait on the morning of james birthday august the th they felt extraordinary animation and little notes passed between them by the hand of smither while they were having breakfast in their beds smither must go round and take their love and little presents and find out how mr james was and whether he had passed a good night with all the excitement and on the way back would smither call in at green street it was a little out of her way but she could take the bus up bond street afterwards it would be a nice little change for her and ask dear mrs dartie to be sure and look in before she went out of town all this smither did an undeniable servant trained many years ago under aunt ann to a perfection not now procurable mr james so mrs james said had passed an excellent night he sent his love mrs james had said he was very funny and had complained that he didnt know what all the fuss was about oh and mrs dartie sent her love and she would come to tea aunts juley and hester rather hurt that their presents had not received special mention they forgot every year that james could not bear to receive presents throwing away their money on him as he always called it were delighted it showed that james was in good spirits and that was so important for him and they began to wait for winifred she came at four bringing imogen and maud just back from school and getting such a pretty girl too so that it was extremely difficult to ask for news about annette aunt juley however summoned courage to enquire whether winifred had heard anything and if soames was anxious uncle soames is always anxious auntie interrupted imogen he cant be happy now hes got it the words struck familiarly on aunt juleys ears ah yes that funny drawing of georges which had not been shown them but what did imogen mean that her uncle always wanted more than he could have it was not at all nice to think like that imogens voice rose clear and clipped imagine annettes only two years older than me it must be awful for her married to uncle soames aunt juley lifted her hands in horror my dear she said you dont know what youre talking about your uncle soames is a match for anybody hes a very clever man and goodlooking and wealthy and most considerate and careful and not at all old considering everything imogen turning her luscious glance from one to the other of the old dears only smiled i hope said aunt juley quite severely that you will marry as good a man i shant marry a good man auntie murmured imogen theyre dull if you go on like this replied aunt juley still very much upset you wont marry anybody wed better not pursue the subject and turning to winifred she said how is montague that evening while they were waiting for dinner she murmured ive told smither to get up half a bottle of the sweet champagne hester i think we ought to drink dear james health and and the health of soames wife only lets keep that quite secret ill just say like this and you know hester and then well drink it might upset timothy its more likely to upset us said aunt nester but we must i suppose for such an occasion yes said aunt juley rapturously it is an occasion only fancy if he has a dear little boy to carry the family on i do feel it so important now that irene has had a son winifred says george is calling jolyon the threedecker because of his three families you know george is droll and fancy irene is living after all in the house soames had built for them both it does seem hard on dear soames and hes always been so regular that night in bed excited and a little flushed still by her glass of wine and the secrecy of the second toast she lay with her prayerbook opened flat and her eyes fixed on a ceiling yellowed by the light from her readinglamp young things it was so nice for them all and she would be so happy if she could see dear soames happy but of course he must be now in spite of what imogen had said he would have all that he wanted property and wife and children and he would live to a green old age like his dear father and forget all about irene and that dreadful case if only she herself could be here to buy his children their first rockinghorse smither should choose it for her at the stores nice and dappled ah how roger used to rock her until she fell off oh dear that was a long time ago it was in my fathers house are many mansions a little scrattling noise caught her ear but no mice she thought mechanically the noise increased there it was a mouse how naughty of smither to say there wasnt it would be eating through the wainscot before they knew where they were and they would have to have the builders in they were such destructive things and she lay with her eyes just moving following in her mind that little scrattling sound and waiting for sleep to release her from it chapter xii birth of a forsyte soames walked out of the garden door crossed the lawn stood on the path above the river turned round and walked back to the garden door without having realised that he had moved the sound of wheels crunching the drive convinced him that time had passed and the doctor gone what exactly had he said this is the position mr forsyte i can make pretty certain of her life if i operate but the baby will be born dead if i dont operate the baby will most probably be born alive but its a great risk for the mother a great risk in either case i dont think she can ever have another child in her state she obviously cant decide for herself and we cant wait for her mother its for you to make the decision while im getting whats necessary i shall be back within the hour the decision what a decision no time to get a specialist down no time for anything the sound of wheels died away but soames still stood intent then suddenly covering his ears he walked back to the river to come before its time like this with no chance to foresee anything not even to get her mother here it was for her mother to make that decision and she couldnt arrive from paris till tonight if only he could have understood the doctors jargon the medical niceties so as to be sure he was weighing the chances properly but they were greek to him like a legal problem to a layman and yet he must decide he brought his hand away from his brow wet though the air was chilly these sounds which came from her room to go back there would only make it more difficult he must be calm clear on the one hand life nearly certain of his young wife death quite certain of his child and no more children afterwards on the other death perhaps of his wife nearly certain life for the child and no more children afterwards which to choose it had rained this last fortnight the river was very full and in the water collected round the little houseboat moored by his landingstage were many leaves from the woods above brought off by a frost leaves fell lives drifted down death to decide about death and no one to give him a hand life lost was lost for good let nothing go that you could keep for if it went you couldnt get it back it left you bare like those trees when they lost their leaves barer and barer until you too withered and came down and by a queer somersault of thought he seemed to see not annette lying up there behind that windowpane on which the sun was shining but irene lying in their bedroom in montpellier square as it might conceivably have been her fate to lie sixteen years ago would he have hesitated then not a moment operate operate make certain of her life no decision a mere instinctive cry for help in spite of his know ledge even then that she did not love him but this ah there was nothing overmastering in his feeling for annette many times these last months especially since she had been growing fright ened he had wondered she had a will of her own was selfish in her french way and yet so pretty what would she wish to take the risk i know she wants the child he thought if its born dead and no more chance afterwards itll upset her terribly no more chance all for nothing married life with her for years and years without a child nothing to steady her shes too young nothing to look forward to for her for me for me he struck his hands against his chest why couldnt he think without bringing himself in get out of himself and see what he ought to do the thought hurt him then lost edge as if it had come in contact with a breastplate out of oneself impossible out into soundless scentless touchless sightless space the very idea was ghastly futile and touching there the bedrock of reality the bottom of his forsyte spirit soames rested for a moment when one ceased all ceased it might go on but thered be nothing in it he looked at his watch in half an hour the doctor would be back he must decide if against the operation and she died how face her mother and the doctor afterwards how face his own conscience it was his child that she was having if for the operation then he condemned them both to childlessness and for what else had he married her but to have a lawful heir and his father at deaths door waiting for the news its cruel he thought i ought never to have such a thing to settle its cruel he turned towards the house some deep simple way of deciding he took out a coin and put it back if he spun it he knew he would not abide by what came up he went into the diningroom furthest away from that room whence the sounds issued the doctor had said there was a chance in here that chance seemed greater the river did not flow nor the leaves fall a fire was burning soames unlocked the tantalus he hardly ever touched spirits but now he poured himself out some whisky and drank it neat craving a faster flow of blood that fellow jolyon he thought he had children already he has the woman i really loved and now a son by her and i im asked to destroy my only child annette cant die its not possible shes strong he was still standing sullenly at the sideboard when he heard the doctors carriage and went out to him he had to wait for him to come downstairs well doctor the situations the same have you decided yes said soames dont operate not you understand the risks great in soames set face nothing moved but the lips you said there was a chance a chance yes not much of one you say the baby must be born dead if you do yes do you still think that in any case she cant have another one cant be absolutely sure but its most unlikely shes strong said soames well take the risk the doctor looked at him very gravely its on your shoulders he said with my own wife i couldnt soames chin jerked up as if someone had hit him am i of any use up there he asked no keep away i shall be in my picturegallery then you know where the doctor nodded and went upstairs soames continued to stand listening by this time tomorrow he thought i may have her death on my hands no it was unfair monstrous to put it that way sullenness dropped on him again and he went up to the gallery he stood at the window the wind was in the north it was cold clear very blue sky heavy ragged white clouds chasing across the river blue too through the screen of goldening trees the woods all rich with colour glowing burnishedan early autumn if it were his own life would he be taking that risk but shed take the risk of losing me he thought sooner than lose her child she doesnt really love me what could one expect a girl and french the one thing really vital to them both vital to their marriage and their futures was a child ive been through a lot for this he thought ill hold on hold on theres a chance of keeping both a chance one kept till things were taken one naturally kept he began walking round the gallery he had made one purchase lately which he knew was a fortune in itself and he halted before it a girl with dull gold hair which looked like filaments of metal gazing at a little golden monster she was holding in her hand even at this tortured moment he could just feel the extraordinary nature of the bargain he had made admire the quality of the table the floor the chair the girls figure the absorbed expression on her face the dull gold filaments of her hair the bright gold of the little monster collecting pictures growing richer richer what use if he turned his back abruptly on the picture and went to the window some of his doves had flown up from their perches round the dovecot and were stretching their wings in the wind in the clear sharp sunlight their whiteness almost flashed they flew far making a flungup hieroglyphic against the sky annette fed the doves it was pretty to see her they took it out of her hand they knew she was matteroffact a choking sensation came into his throat she would not could nod die she was too too sensible and she was strong really strong like her mother in spite of her fair prettiness it was already growing dark when at last he opened the door and stood listening not a sound a milky twilight crept about the stairway and the landings below he had turned back when a sound caught his ear peering down he saw a black shape moving and his heart stood still what was it death the shape of death coming from her door no only a maid without cap or apron she came to the foot of his flight of stairs and said breathlessly the doctor wants to see you sir he ran down she stood flat against the wall to let him pass and said oh sir its over over said soames with a sort of menace what dyou mean its born sir he dashed up the four steps in front of him and came suddenly on the doctor in the dim passage the man was wiping his brow well he said quick both living its all right i think soames stood quite still covering his eyes i congratulate you he heard the doctor say it was touch and go soames let fall the hand which was covering his face thanks he said thanks very much what is it daughter luckily a son would have killed her the head a daughter the utmost care of both he hearts the doctor say and we shall do when does the mother come tonight between nine and ten i hope ill stay till then do you want to see them not now said soames before you go ill have dinner sent up to you and he went downstairs relief unspeakable and yet a daughter it seemed to him unfair to have taken that risk to have been through this agony and what agony for a daughter he stood before the blazing fire of wood logs in the hall touching it with his toe and trying to readjust himself my father he thought a bitter disappointment no disguising it one never got all one wanted in this life and there was no other at least if there was it was no use while he was standing there a telegram was brought him come up at once your father sinking fast mother he read it with a choking sensation one would have thought he couldnt feel anything after these last hours but he felt this halfpast seven a train from reading at nine and madames train if she had caught it came in at eightforty he would meet that and go on he ordered the carriage ate some dinner mechanically and went upstairs the doctor came out to him theyre sleeping i wont go in said soames with relief my fathers dying i have to go up is it all right the doctors face expressed a kind of doubting admiration if they were all as unemotional he might have been saying yes i think you may go with an easy mind youll be down soon tomorrow said soames heres the address the doctor seemed to hover on the verge of sympathy goodnight said soames abruptly and turned away he put on his fur coat death it was a chilly business he smoked a cigarette in the carriage one of his rare cigarettes the night was windy and flew on black wings the carriage lights had to search out the way his father that old old man a comfortless night to die the london train came in just as he reached the station and madame lamotte substantial darkclothed very yellow in the lamplight came towards the exit with a dressingbag this all you have asked soames but yes i had not the time how is my little one doing well both a girl a girl what joy i had a frightful crossing her black bulk solid unreduced by the frightful crossing climbed into the brougham and you mon cher my fathers dying said soames between his teeth im going up give my love to annette tiens murmured madame lamotte quel malheur soames took his hat off and moved towards his train the french he thought chapter xiii james is told a simple cold caught in the room with double windows where the air and the people who saw him were filtered as it were the room he had not left since the middle of september and james was in deep waters a little cold passing his little strength and flying quickly to his lungs he mustnt catch cold the doctor had declared and he had gone and caught it when he first felt it in his throat he had said to his nurse for he had one now there i knew how it would be airing the room like that for a whole day he was highly nervous about himself and went in advance of all precautions and remedies drawing every breath with extreme care and having his temperature taken every hour emily was not alarmed but next morning when she went in the nurse whispered he wont have his temperature taken emily crossed to the side of the bed where he was lying and said softly how do you feel james holding the thermometer to his lips james looked up at her whats the good of that he murmured huskily i dont want to know then she was alarmed he breathed with difficulty he looked terribly frail white with faint red discolorations she had had trouble with him goodness knew but he was james had been james for nearly fifty years she couldnt remember or imagine life without james james behind all his fussiness his pessimism his crusty shell deeply affectionate really kind and generous to them all all that day and the next he hardly uttered a word but there was in his eyes a noticing of everything done for him a look on his face which told her he was fighting and she did not lose hope his very stillness the way he conserved every little scrap of energy showed the tenacity with which he was fighting it touched her deeply and though her face was composed and comfortable in the sickroom tears ran down her cheeks when she was out of it about teatime on the third day she had just changed her dress keeping her appearance so as not to alarm him because he noticed everything she saw a difference its no use im tired was written plainly across that white face and when she went up to him he muttered send for soames yes james she said comfortably all right at once and she kissed his forehead a tear dropped there and as she wiped it off she saw that his eyes looked grateful much upset and without hope now she sent soames the telegram when he entered out of the black windy night the big house was still as a grave warmsons broad face looked almost narrow he took the fur coat with a sort of added care saying will you have a glass of wine sir soames shook his head and his eyebrows made enquiry warmsons lips twitched hes asking for you sir and suddenly he blew his nose its a long time sir he said that ive been with mr forsyte a long time soames left him folding the coat and began to mount the stairs this house where he had been born and sheltered had never seemed to him so warm and rich and cosy as during this last pilgrimage to his fathers room it was not his taste but in its own sub stantial lincrusta way it was the acme of comfort and security and the night was so dark and windy the grave so cold and lonely he paused outside the door no sound came from within he turned the handle softly and was in the room before he was perceived the light was shaded his mother and winifred were sitting on the far side of the bed the nurse was moving away from the near side where was an empty chair for me thought soames as he moved from the door his mother and sister rose but he signed with his hand and they sat down again he went up to the chair and stood looking at his father james breathing was as if strangled his eyes were closed and in soames looking on his father so worn and white and wasted listening to his strangled breathing there rose a passionate vehemence of anger against nature cruel inexorable nature kneeling on the chest of that wisp of a body slowly pressing out the breath pressing out the life of the being who was dearest to him in the world his father of all men had lived a careful life moderate abstemious and this was his reward to have life slowly painfully squeezed out of him and without knowing that he spoke he said its cruel he saw his mother cover her eyes and winifred bow her face towards the bed women they put up with things so much better than men he took a step nearer to his father for three days james had not been shaved and his lips and chin were covered with hair hardly more snowy than his forehead it softened his face gave it a queer look already not of this world his eyes opened soames went quite close and bent over the lips moved here i am father um what what news they never tell the voice died and a flood of emotion made soames face work so that he could not speak tell him yes but what he made a great effort got his lips together and said good news dear good annette a son ah it was the queerest sound ugly relieved pitiful triumphant like the noise a baby makes getting what it wants the eyes closed and that strangled sound of breathing began again soames recoiled to the chair and stonily sat down the lie he had told based as it were on some deep temperamental instinct that after death james would not know the truth had taken away all power of feeling for the moment his arm brushed against something it was his fathers naked foot in the struggle to breathe he had pushed it out from under the clothes soames took it in his hand a cold foot light and thin white very cold what use to put it back to wrap up that which must be colder soon he warmed it mechanically with his hand listening to his fathers laboured breathing while the power of feeling rose again within him a little sob quickly smothered came from winifred but his mother sat unmoving with her eyes fixed on james soames signed to the nurse wheres the doctor he whispered hes been sent for cant you do anything to ease his breathing only an injection and he cant stand it the doctor said while he was fighting hes not fighting whispered soames hes being slowly smothered its awful james stirred uneasily as if he knew what they were saying soames rose and bent over him james feebly moved his two hands and soames took them he wants to be pulled up whispered the nurse soames pulled he thought he pulled gently but a look almost of anger passed over james face the nurse plumped the pillows soames laid the hands down and bending over kissed his fathers forehead as he was raising himself again james eyes bent on him a look which seemed to come from the very depths of what was left within im done my boy it seemed to say take care of them take care of yourself take care i leave it all to you yes yes soames whispered yes yes behind him the nurse did he knew not what for his father made a tiny movement of repulsion as if resenting that interference and almost at once his breathing eased away became quiet he lay very still the strained expression on his face passed a curious white tranquillity took its place his eyelids quivered rested the whole face rested at ease only by the faint puffing of his lips could they tell that he was breathing soames sank back on his chair and fell to cherishing the foot again he heard the nurse quietly crying over there by the fire curious that she a stranger should be the only one of them who cried he heard the quiet lick and flutter of the fire flames one more old forsyte going to his long rest wonderful they were wonderful how he had held on his mother and winifred were leaning forward hanging on the sight of james lips but soames bent sideways over the feet warming them both they gave him comfort colder and colder though they grew suddenly he started up a sound a dreadful sound such as he had never heard was coming from his fathers lips as if an outraged heart had broken with a long moan what a strong heart to have uttered that farewell it ceased soaines looked into the face no motion no breath dead he kissed the brow turned round and went out of the room he ran upstairs to the bedroom his old bedroom still kept for him flung himself face down on the bed and broke into sobs which he stilled with the pillow a little later he went downstairs and passed into the room james lay alone wonderfully calm free from shadow and anxiety with the gravity on his ravaged face which underlies great age the worn fine gravity of old coins soames looked steadily at that face at the fire at all the room with windows thrown open to the london night goodbye he whispered and went out chapter xiv his he had much to see to that night and all next day a telegram at breakfast reassured him about annette and he only caught the last train back to reading with emilys kiss on his forehead and in his ears her words i dont know what i should have done without you my dear boy he reached his house at midnight the weather had changed was mild again as though having finished its work and sent a forsyte to his last account it could relax a second telegram received at dinnertime had confirmed the good news of annette and instead of going in soames passed down through the garden in the moonlight to his houseboat he could sleep there quite well bitterly tired he lay down on the sofa in his fur coat and fell asleep he woke soon after dawn and went on deck he stood against the rail looking west where the river swept round in a wide curve under the woods in soames appreciation of natural beauty was curiously like that of his farmer ancestors a sense of grievance if it wasnt there sharpened no doubt and civilised by his researches among landscape painting but dawn has power to fertilise the most matteroffact vision and he was stirred it was another world from the river he knew under that remote cool light a world into which man had not entered an unreal world like some strange shore sighted by discovery its colour was not the colour of convention was hardly colour at all its shapes were brooding yet distinct its silence stunning it had no scent why it should move him he could not tell unless it were that he felt so alone in it bare of all relationship and all possessions into such a world his father might be voyaging for all resemblance it had to the world he had left and soames took refuge from it in wondering what painter could have done it justice the whitegrey water was like like the belly of a fish was it possible that this world on which he looked was all private property except the water and even that was tapped no tree no shrub not a blade of grass not a bird or beast not even a fish that was not owned and once on a time all this was jungle and marsh and water and weird creatures roamed and sported without human cognizance to give them names rotting luxuriance had rioted where those tall care fully planted woods came down to the water and marshmisted reeds on that far side had covered all the pasture well they had got it under kennelled it all up labelled it and stowed it in lawyers offices and a good thing too but once in a way as now the ghost of the past came out to haunt and brood and whisper to any human who chanced to be awake out of my unowned loneliness you all came into it some day you will all return and soames who felt the chill and the eeriness of that worldnew to him and so very old the world unowned visiting the scene of its past went down and made himself tea on a spiritlamp when he had drunk it he took out writing materials and wrote two paragraphs on the th instant at his residence in park lane james forsyte in his ninetyfirst year funeral at noon on the th at highgate no flowers by request on the th instant at the shelter mapledurham annette wife of soames forsyte of a daughter and underneath on the blottingpaper he traced the word son it was eight oclock in an ordinary autumn world when he went across to the house bushes across the river stood round and brightcoloured out of a milky haze the woodsmoke went up blue and straight and his doves cooed preening their feathers in the sunlight he stole up to his dressingroom bathed shaved put on fresh linen and dark clothes madame lamotte was beginning her breakfast when he went down she looked at his clothes said dont tell me and pressed his hand annette is prettee well but the doctor say she can never have no more children you knew that soames nodded its a pity mais la petite est adorable du cafe soames got away from her as soon as he could she offended him solid matteroffact quick clear french he could not bear her vowels her rs he resented the way she had looked at him as if it were his fault that annette could never bear him a son his fault he even resented her cheap adoration of the daughter he had not yet seen curious how he jibbed away from sight of his wife and child one would have thought he must have rushed up at the first moment on the contrary he had a sort of physical shrinking from it fastidious possessor that he was he was afraid of what annette was thinking of him author of her agonies afraid of the look of the baby afraid of showing his disappointment with the present and the future he spent an hour walking up and down the drawingroom before he could screw his courage up to mount the stairs and knock on the door of their room madame lamotte opened it ah at last you come elle vous attend she passed him and soames went in with his noiseless step his jaw firmly set his eyes furtive annette was very pale and very pretty lying there the baby was hidden away somewhere he could not see it he went up to the bed and with sudden emotion bent and kissed her forehead here you are then soames she said i am not so bad now but i suffered terribly terribly i am glad i cannot have any more oh how i suffered soames stood silent stroking her hand words of endearment of sympathy absolutely would not come the thought passed through him an english girl wouldnt have said that at this moment he knew with certainty that he would never be near to her in spirit and in truth nor she to him he had collected her that was all and jolyons words came rushing into his mind i should imagine you will be glad to have your neck out of chancery well he had got it out had he got it in again we must feed you up he said youll soon be strong dont you want to see baby soames she is asleep of course said soames very much he passed round the foot of the bed to the other side and stood staring for the first moment what he saw was much what he had expected to see a baby but as he stared and the baby breathed and made little sleeping movements with its tiny features it seemed to assume an individual shape grew to be like a picture a thing he would know again not repulsive strangely budlike and touching it had dark hair he touched it with his finger he wanted to see its eyes they opened they were dark whether blue or brown he could not tell the eyes winked stared they had a sort of sleepy depth in them and suddenly his heart felt queer warm as if elated ma petite fleur annette said softly fleur repeated soames fleur well call her that the sense of triumph and renewed possession swelled within him by god this this thing was his
