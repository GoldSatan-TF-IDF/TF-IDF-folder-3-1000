j d robb immortal in death chapter one getting married was murder eve wasnt sure how it had happened in the first place she was a cop for gods sake throughout her ten years on the force shed firmly believed cops should stay single unencumbered and focused utterly on the job it was insane to believe one person could split time energy and emotion between law with all its rights and wrongs and family with all its demands and personalities both careers and from what shed observed marriage was a job had impossible demands and hellish hours it might have been an enlightened time of technological advancement but marriage was still marriage to eve it translated to terror yet here she was on a fine day in high summer one of her rare and precious days off preparing to go shopping she couldnt stop the shudder not just shopping she reminded herself as her stomach clutched shopping for a wedding dress obviously shed lost her mind it was roarkes doing of course hed caught her at a weak moment both of them bleeding and bruised and lucky to be alive when a man is clever enough and knows his quarry well enough to choose such a time and place to propose marriage well a woman was a goner at least a woman like eve dallas you look like youre about to take on a gang of chemithugs barehanded eve tugged on a shoe flicked her gaze up and over he was entirely too attractive she thought criminally so the strong face poets mouth killer blue eyes the wizards mane of thick black hair if you managed to get past the face to the body it was equally impressive then you added that faint wisp of ireland in the voice and well you had one hell of a package what im about to take on is worse than any chemihead hearing the whine in her own voice eve scowled she never whined but the truth was shed have preferred fighting hand to hand with a soupedup addict than discussing hemlines hemlines for sweet christs sake she bit back an oath watching him narrowly as he crossed the spacious bedroom he had a way of making her feel foolish at odd times like now as he sat beside her on the high wide bed they shared he caught her chin in his hand im hopelessly in love with you there he was this man with the sinfully blue eyes the strong gorgeous somehow raphaelite looks of a doomed angel loved her roarke she struggled to hold back a sigh she could and had faced an armed laser in the hands of a mad mutant mercenary with less fear than she faced such unswerving emotion im going through with it i said i would his brow quirked dark and wry he wondered how she remained so unaware of her own appeal as she sat there fretting her poorly cut fawncolored hair standing up in tufts and spikes aroused by her restless hands thin lines of annoyance and doubt running between her big whiskeycolored eyes darling eve he kissed her lightly once on the frowning lips then again in the gentle dip in her chin i never doubted it though he had constantly ive several things i have to see to today you were late last night i never had a chance to ask if you had plans the stakeout on the bines case went to after oh three hundred did you get him walked right into my arms blissed on dreamers and a marathon vr session she smiled but it was the hunters smile dark and feral murdering little bastard came along like my personal droid well then he patted her shoulder before rising he stepped down from the platform into the dressing area where he pondered a selection of jackets and today reports to file im off today oh distracted he turned back a gorgeous silk jacket in deep charcoal in his hand i can reschedule some of my afternoon if you like which would be eve mused a bit like a general rescheduling battles in roarkes world business was a complicated and profitable war im already booked the scowl snuck back on her before she could stop it shopping she muttered wedding dress now he smiled quickly easily from her such plans were a declaration of love no wonder youre so cranky i told you id see to it ill pick out my own wedding dress and ill buy it myself im not marrying you for your damn money smooth and elegant as the jacket he slipped on he continued to smile why are you marrying me lieutenant her scowl deepened but he was above all a patient man want a multiple choice because you never take no for an answer she stood shoving her hands into the front pockets of her jeans you only get a half point for that try again because ive lost my mind that wont win you the trip for two to tropic world on star a reluctant smile tugged at her lips maybe i love you maybe you do content with that he crossed back to her and laid his hands on her strong shoulders how bad can it be you can pop a few shopping programs into the computer look at dozens of suitable dresses order in what appeals to you that was my idea she rolled her eyes mavis ditched it mavis he paled a bit eve tell me youre not going shopping with mavis his reaction brightened her mood a little she has this friend hes a designer dear christ she says hes mag just needs a break to make a name for himself he has a little workshop in soho lets elope now you look fine her grin flashed scared terrified good now were even delighted to be on level footing she leaned in and kissed him now you can worry about what ill be wearing on the big day for the next few weeks gotta go she patted his cheek im meeting her in twenty minutes eve roarke grabbed for her hand you wouldnt do something ridiculous she tugged her way free im getting married arent i what could be more ridiculous o o she hoped he stewed over it all day the idea of marriage was daunting enough but a wedding clothes flowers music people it was horrifying she zipped downtown on lex braking hard and muttering curses at a sidewalk vendor who encroached on the lane with his smoking glide cart the traffic violation was bad enough but the scent of overcooked soydogs hit her nervous stomach like lead the rapid cab behind her broke the intercity noise pollution code by blasting his horn and shouting curses through his speaker a group obviously tourists loaded down with palm cams compumaps and binoks gaped stupidly at the whizzing traffic eve shook her head as a quickfingered street thief elbowed through them when they got back to their hotel they were going to find themselves several credits poorer if shed had the time and a place to pull over she might have given the thief a chase but he was lost in the crowd and a block across town on his air skates before she could blink that was new york she thought with a faint smile take it at your own risk she loved the crowds the noise the constant frantic rush of it you were rarely alone but never intimate thats why shed come here so many years ago no she wasnt a social animal but too much space and too much solitude made her nervous shed come to new york to be a cop because she believed in order needed it to survive her miserable and abusive childhood with all its blank spaces and dark corners couldnt be changed but she had changed she had taken control had made herself into the person some anonymous social worker had named eve dallas now she was changing again in a few weeks she wouldnt just be eve dallas lieutenant homicide shed be roarkes wife how she would manage to be both was more of a mystery to her than any case that had ever come across her desk neither of them knew what it was to be family to have family to make a family they knew cruelty abuse abandonment she wondered if that was why they had come together they both understood what it was to have nothing to be nothing to know fear and hunger and despair and both had remade themselves was it just mutual need that attracted them need for sex for love and the melding of the two that she had never thought was possible before roarke a question for dr mira she mused thinking of the police psychiatrist she often consulted but for now eve determined that she wasnt going to think about the future or the past the moment was complicated enough three blocks from greene street she seized her chance and squeezed into a parking space after searching through her pockets she found the credit tokens the aging meter demanded in its moronic and static jumbled tones and plugged in enough for two hours if it took any more than that shed be ready for a tranq room and a parking citation wouldnt bother her in the least taking a deep breath she scanned the area she wasnt called this far downtown often murders happened everywhere but soho was an arty bastion for the young and struggling who more often debated their disagreements over tiny glasses of cheap wine or cups of cafe noir just now soho was full of summer flower vendors burst with roses the classic reds and pinks vying with the hybrid stripes traffic droned and chugged on the street rumbled overhead puffed a bit on the rickety passovers pedestrians stuck mostly with the scenic sidewalks though the people glides were busy the flowing robes currently hot from europe were much in evidence with arty sandals headdresses and shiny ropes swinging from earlobes to shoulder blades oil watercolor and compu artists hawked their wares on corners and in storefronts competing with food vendors who promised hybrid fruits iced yogurts or vegetable purees uncontaminated by preservatives members of the pure sect a soho staple glided in their snowy streetdusting gowns their eyes glowing and their heads shaved eve gave one particularly devoutlooking supplicant a few tokens and was rewarded with a beatific smile and a glossy pebble pure love the devotee offered her pure joy yeah right eve murmured and sidestepped she had to backtrack to find leonardos the upandcoming designer had a thirdfloor loft the window that faced the street was crammed with fashions blots and flows of color and form that had eve swallowing nervously her taste leaned toward the plain the drab according to mavis it didnt appear as she took the people glide up to get a closer look that leonardo leaned toward either the clutching in her stomach came back with a vengeance as she stared at the window display with its feathers and beads and dyed rubber unisuits however much pleasure she would get from making roarke wince she wasnt getting married in neon rubber there was more a great deal more it seemed leonardo believed in advertising in a big way his centerpiece a ghostly white faceless model was draped in a collection of transparent scarves that shimmered so dramatically that the material seemed alive eve could all but feel it crawling over her skin uhuh she thought no way in heaven or hell she turned thinking only of escape and rapped straight into mavis his stuff is so frigid mavis slipped a friendly restraining arm around eves waist and gazed dreamily into the window look mavis and hes incredibly creative ive watched him come up with stuff on screen its wild yeah wild im thinking he really understands the inner soul mavis hurried on she understood eves inner soul and knew her friend was ready to bolt mavis freestone slim as a fairy in her white and gold rompers and threeinch air platforms tossed back her curling mane of whitestreaked black hair judged her opponent and grinned hes going to make you the most rocking bride in new york mavis eve narrowed her eyes to forestall another interruption i just want something that wont make me feel like an idiot mavis beamed the new winged heart tattoo on her biceps fluttering as she lifted a hand to her breast dallas trust me no eve said even as mavis pulled her back to the glide i mean it mavis ill just order something off screen over my dead body mavis muttered clumping her way down to the street entrance dragging eve behind her the least you can do is look talk to him give the guy a chance she thrust out her bottom lip a formidable weapon when painted magenta dont be such a squash dallas shit im here anyway rushed with success mavis bounced to the whining security camera mavis freestone and eve dallas for leonardo the outer door opened with a grinding clunk mavis made a beeline for the old wirescreened elevator this place is really into retro i think leonardo might even stay here after he hits you know eccentric artist and all that right eve closed her eyes and prayed as the elevator bumped its way upward she was taking the stairs down absolutely now keep an open mind mavis ordered and let leonardo take care of you darling she positively flowed out of the dinky elevator and into a cluttered colorful space eve had to admire her mavis my dove then eve was struck dumb the man with the artists name was sixfive if he was an inch and built like a maxibus huge rippling biceps mountained out of a sleeveless robe in the eyesearing colors of a martian sunset his face was wide as the moon its coppertoned skin stretched tight as a drumhead over razoredged cheekbones he had a small glinting stone winking beside his flashing grin and eyes like gold coins he swirled mavis into his arms off her feet and around in one fast and graceful circle and he kissed her long hard and in a fashion that warned eve the two of them had a great deal more going on than a mutual love of fashion and art leonardo beaming like a fool mavis ran her goldtipped fingers through his tight shoulderlength curls babydoll eve managed not to gag as they cooed at each other but she did roll her eyes she was stuck now without a doubt mavis was in love again the hair its wonderful leonardo ran loving fingers the size of soydogs through maviss streaked mop i hoped youd like it this there was a dramatic pause as though she were about to introduce her awardwinning schnauzer is dallas ah yes the bride lovely to meet you lieutenant dallas he kept one arm around mavis and shot the other out to take eves hand mavis has told me so much about you yeah eve slanted a look toward her friend shes been a little light on details on you he laughed a booming sound that made eves ears ring even as her lips twitched in response my turtledove can be secretive refreshments he stated then whirled off in a cloud of color and unexpected grace hes wonderful isnt he mavis whispered eyes dancing with love youre sleeping with him you wouldnt believe how inventive he is how mavis blew out a breath patted her breast the man is a sexual artist i dont want to hear about it absolutely dont want to hear about it drawing her brows together eve scanned the room it was wide high ceilinged and crowded with flows and streams of material fuchsia rainbows ebony waterfalls chartreuse pools dripped from the ceiling along the walls over tabletops and arms of chairs jesus was all she could manage bowls and trays of glittering ribbons tapes and buttons were piled everywhere sashes belts hats and veils crowded with halffinished outfits of shimmering materials and studded bodices the place smelled like an incense farm married to a flower shop she was terrified a little pale eve turned back mavis i love you maybe i havent told you that before but i do now im leaving dallas with a quick giggle mavis grabbed her arm for a small woman mavis was amazingly strong relax take a breath i guarantee leonardos going to fix you up thats what im afraid of mavis deeply afraid lemon tea iced leonardo announced with a musical lilt as he came back through a curtain of draping simulated silk with a tray and glasses please please sit first well relax get to know each other with her eye on the door eve edged toward a chair look leonardo mavis might not have explained things exactly see im youre a homicide detective ive read about you leonardo said smoothly snuggling on a curvesided settee with mavis all but in his lap your last case generated a great deal of media i must confess i was fascinated you work with puzzles lieutenant as i do eve sampled the tea nearly blinked when she discovered it was fullbodied rich and wonderful you work with puzzles naturally i see a woman i imagine how i would like to see her dressed then i must discover who she is what she is how does she live her life what are her hopes her fantasies her vision of herself then i must take all of that piece each part of her together to create the look the image at first she is a mystery and im compelled to solve her unashamed mavis sighed lustily isnt he mag dallas leonardo chuckled nuzzled maviss ear your friend is worried my dove she think ill wrap her in electric pink and spangles it sounds wonderful for you he beamed back at eve so youre going to marry the elusive and powerful roarke it looks that way eve muttered you met him on a case the deblass case correct and intrigued him with your tawny eyes and serious smile i wouldnt say i you wouldnt leonardo continued because you dont see yourself as he does or as i do strong valiant troubled dependable are you a designer or an analyst eve demanded you cant be one without the other tell me lieutenant how did roarke win you im not a prize she snapped it then set her glass aside wonderful he clasped his hands together and almost wept heat and independence and just a little fear youll make a magnificent bride now to work he rose come with me she stood up listen theres no point in wasting your time or mine im just going to come with me he repeated and took her hand give it a chance eve for mavis she allowed leonardo to lead her under and around falls of material and into an equally cluttered workstation on the far side of the loft the computer made her feel a little better those she understood but the drawings it had generated which were pinned and tacked to every available space made her heart sink fuchsia and spangles would have been a relief the models with their long exaggerated bodies looked like mutants some were sporting feathers others stones a few were wearing what could have been clothes but in such outrageous styles pointed collars skirts the size of washcloths unisuits snug as skin they looked like participants in a halloween parade examples for my first show high fashion is a twist on reality you see the bold the unique the impossible i love them eve curled her lip at mavis and folded her arms its going to be a small simple ceremony at home um leonardo was already at his computer using the keyboard with impressive skill now this he brought up an image that made eves blood chill the dress was the color of fresh urine ringed with flounces of mud brown from its scalloped neck to its knifepoint hem that dripped with stones the size of a childs fist the sleeves were so snug eve was certain anyone wearing it would loose all feeling in their fingers as the image turned she was treated to a view of the back dipping past the waist and trimmed in floaty feathers is not at all for you leonardo finished and indulged in a deep belly laugh at eves blanched skin i apologize i couldnt resist for you just a sketch you understand slim long simple only a column not too delicate he continued to speak as he worked on the screen lines and shapes began to form sticking her hands in her pockets eve watched it looked so easy eve mused long lines the most subtle of accents at the bodice sleeves that came to soft rounded points just at the back of the hand still uneasy she waited for him to start to add the gingerbread well fuss with it a bit he said absently and again turned the image to show a back as sleek and elegant as the front with a slit to the knees you wouldnt want a train a train no he only smiled flicking a glance up at her you wouldnt a headdress your hair used to derogatory comments eve ran her fingers through it i can cover it up if i have to no no no it suits you her hand dropped in shock it does indeed you need a bit of shaping i know someone he flicked that aside but the color all those tones of brown and gold and the short not quite tamed style is very good on you a couple of snips eyes narrowed he studied her no no headdress no veil your face is enough now color and material it must be silk of a good weight he grimaced a little mavis tells me roarke will not be paying eves back went up its my dress shes dug in on this one mavis commented like roarke would notice a few thousand credits thats not the point no indeed not leonardo smiled again well well manage color i dont think white too stark for your skin tone pursing his lips he went to his palette key and experimented fascinated despite herself eve watched the sketch turn from snowy white to cream to pale blue to vivid green and a rainbow between though mavis oohed and ahed over several choices he only shook his head he settled on bronze this yes oh yes your skin your eyes your hair youll be radiant majestic a goddess with it youll need a necklace at least thirtyinch length better yet two lengths twentyfour and thirty inches copper i think with colored stones rubies citrine onyx yes yes and carnelian perhaps some tourmaline youll speak to roarke about the accessories clothes never meant a damn to her but eve caught herself yearning its beautiful she said cautiously and began to calculate her credit situation im just not sure you know silk its a little out of my range youll have the dress at my cost and for a promise he enjoyed watching the wariness come into her eyes that i will be allowed to design maviss dress as your attendant and you will use my designs for your trousseau i havent thought about a trousseau ive got clothes lieutenant dallas has clothes he corrected roarkes partner in marriage will need others maybe we can make a deal she wanted that damn dress she realized she could feel it on her wonderful take off your clothes she snapped back like a spring okay asshole for the measurements leonardo said quickly the look in her eye had him rising stepping back he was a man who adored women and understood their wrath in other words he feared them you must consider me as you would your health provider i cant design the dress properly until i know your body im an artist and a gentleman he said with dignity but mavis can stay if you feel uneasy eve tilted her head i can handle you pal if you get out of line even think about it youll find out for yourself im sure of it cautiously he picked up a device my scanner he explained it will measure you very accurately but you have to be naked for a true reading stop snickering mavis go get us some more of that tea sure ive already seen you naked anyway blowing kisses to leonardo she headed off i have other ideas about clothes leonardo said when eve narrowed her eyes the underfoundation for the dress of course evening and day wear the formal the casual your honeymoon is where i dont know i havent thought about it resigned she took off her shoes unhitched her jeans roarke will surprise you then computer create file dallas first doc measurements coloring height and weight after shed tossed her shirt aside he stepped forward with the scanner feet together please height five foot nine inches weight one hundred and twenty how long have you been sleeping with mavis he rattled off more data about two weeks shes very dear to me waist twentysix point two inches did you start sleeping with her before or after she told you her best friend was marrying roarke he stopped cold and his brilliant gold eyes glittered with temper i am not using mavis for a commission and you insult her by thinking it just checking shes very dear to me too if were going to deal on this i want to make sure all the cards are faceup thats all so the interruption came in fast and came in furious a woman in skintight unadorned black burst in like a comet perfect teeth bared lethal red nails curled into talons you twotiming backstabbing motherfucking son of a bitch she made her leap rather like a gorgeous mortar locked on target and with a speed and grace brought on by pure fear leonardo evaded pandora i can explain explain this turning her wrath on eve she swiped out barely missing scooping eves eyes out of their sockets there was only one thing to do eve decked her oh jesus oh jesus leonardo hunched his huge shoulders and wrung his hamsize hands chapter two did you have to hit her eve watched the womans eyes roll back then roll forward yeah leonardo set down his scanner and sighed shes going to make my life a living hell my face my face as she teetered back into full consciousness pandora scrambled up patting her jaw is it bruised does it show ive got a session in an hour eve shrugged tough luck jumping from mood to mood like a crazed gazelle pandora hissed through her teeth ill ruin you bitch youll never work on screen on disc and you sure as hell wont get a runway job do you know who i am being naked under the circumstances just added to eves mood do you think i care whats going on damn it dallas hes just trying to fit you oh hurrying in with glasses in both hands mavis stopped dead pandora you obviously pandoras supply of venom wasnt running low she sprang at mavis sending glasses crashing tea flying in seconds the two women were wrestling on the floor and tearing at each others hair oh for christs sake if shed had a stunner on her eve would have used it on the pair of them break it up goddamn it leonardo give me a hand here before they kill each other eve dived in pulling at arms and legs she gave pandora an extra elbow jab to the ribs for her own enjoyment ill haul you into a cage i swear to god for lack of anything else she sat on pandora and tugged over her jeans to get her badge out of the pocket take a good look you idiot im a cop so far youve got two counts of assault want to go for three get your bony naked ass off me it wasnt the order but the relative calm with which it was delivered that had eve shifting pandora rose brushed her hands meticulously down her black skin suit sniffed tossed her luxurious mane of flamecolored hair then aimed a frigid glare with heavily lashed emerald eyes so one at a times not enough for you anymore leonardo you scum sculpted chin lifted she cast a scornful look at eve then at mavis your appetite might be increasing darling but your taste is deteriorating pandora shaken still wary of attack leonardo moistened his lips i said i can explain lieutenant dallas is a client she spit like a cobra is that what youre calling them now you think you can just toss me aside like yesterdays news leonardo i say when its over limping a little mavis walked to leonardo slipped an arm around his waist he doesnt need you or want you i dont give a damn what he wants but need her full lips curved into a nasty smile hell have to tell you the facts of life little girl without me there wont be any show next month for his secondrate clothes and without a show hes not going to make any sales and without sales he wont be able to pay for all that material all that inventory and that nice fat loan he took from the leg breakers she took a deep breath and studied the nails shed chipped fury seemed to fit her as cleanly as her black skin suit this is going to cost you big time leonardo ive got a busy calendar for the next couple of days but im going to find a way to squeeze in some time to have a chat with your backers what do you think theyll say when i tell them i simply cant lower my standards to walking the runway in your designs inferior as they are you cant do that pandora panic was in every word a panic eve was sure was for the glowing redhead like a fix for an addict itll ruin me ive put everything into this show time money isnt it a shame you didnt think of that before you picked up this little piece of navel lint pandoras eyes narrowed into sharp slits i think i can manage to have lunch with a few of the money men by the end of the week youve got a couple of days darling to decide how you want to play it get rid of the new toy or pay the consequences you know where to reach me she went out with the exaggerated glide of a model and punctuated the exit by slamming the door oh shit leonardo sank into a chair and covered his face with his hands her timing is perfect as always dont dont let her do this to you to us near tears mavis crouched down in front of him you cant let her run your life anymore or blackmail you inspired mavis sprang up its blackmail isnt it dallas go arrest her eve finished buttoning the shirt shed pulled on honey i cant arrest her for saying shes not going to wear his clothes i can go haul her in for assault but shed be out almost before i closed the door on her but it is blackmail everything leonardos got is tied up in the show hell lose everything without it im sorry really its just not a police or security matter she dragged her hands through her hair look she was hot and pissed off hopped on something from the look of her eyes odds are shell calm down no leonardo sat back in the chair shell want to make me pay you must have understood we were lovers things were cooling off between us shes been off planet for a few weeks and i considered our personal relationship over then i met mavis his hand found hers gripped and i knew it was over i spoke with pandora briefly told her or tried to since dallas cant help theres only one thing to do maviss chin quivered you have to go back to her its the only way she added before leonardo could speak we wont see each other at least not until after your show maybe then we can pick up the pieces you cant let her go to your backers and ditch your designs do you think i could do that be with her touch her after this after you he rose mavis i love you oh her eyes filled spilled over oh leonardo not now i love you too much to watch her ruin you im going away to save you she dashed out leaving leonardo staring after her im trapped the vindictive bitch she can take everything from me the woman i love my work everything i could kill her for putting that look in maviss eyes he drew a deep breath looked at his hands a man can be pulled in by beauty and not see beneath it does what she says to these people matter so much they wouldnt have put money behind you if they hadnt believed in your work pandora is one of the top models on the planet she has power prestige connections a few words from her into the right ear can make or break a man in my position he lifted a hand to a fantasy of net and stones hanging beside him if she goes public claiming my designs are inferior the projected sales will drop away she knows exactly how to accomplish that ive worked all my life for this show she knows it and she knows how to take it from me and it wont end there his hand fell back to his side mavis doesnt understand that not yet pandora can hold that laser beam above my neck for the rest of my professional life or hers ill never be free of her lieutenant until she decides shes finished with me o o by the time eve got home she was exhausted an added session of tears and recriminations with mavis had sapped her energy for now at least mavis was comforted with a quart of ice cream and several hours of videos in eves old apartment wanting to forget emotional upheavals and fashion eve went straight to the bedroom and fell facedown on the bed the cat galahad leaped up beside her purring manically after a few head butts brought no reaction he settled down to sleep when roarke found her she hadnt moved a muscle so how was your day off i hate shopping you just havent developed the knack for it who wants to curious she rolled over studied him you like it you really like to just buy things sure roarke stretched out beside her stroking the cat when it pawed its way onto his chest its nearly as satisfying as having things being poor lieutenant quite simply sucks she thought it over as shed been poor once had managed to lever herself up to struggling she couldnt disagree anyway i think i got the worst of it over with that was quick and the speed worried him a little you know eve you dont have to settle for something actually i think leonardo and i reached an understanding staring up and through the sky window where the sky was the color of old bleach she frowned mavis is in love with him umhmm eyes half closed roarke continued to stroke the cat and thought about switching the gesture to eve no im talking the big one she let out a long breath the day didnt go exactly smoothly he had the figures for three major deals running through his head shuttling them aside he shifted closer to her tell me about it leonardo hes this massive and oddly attractive i dont know event heavy on the native american blood at a guess he has the bone structure and coloring of an na biceps like astro torpedoes and a voice that has a hint of magnolia im not much of a judge but when he settled down to sketch he seemed very focused and talented anyway i was standing there naked were you roarke said mildly and nudging the cat away he rolled on top of her for measurements she said with a sneer do go on okay mavis was getting some tea convenient and this woman bursts in all but drooling at the mouth a jaw dropper close to six foot thin as a laser beam about a yard of red hair and a face well ill use magnolias again shes screaming at him and this big bull of a guy cowers back so she jumps at me i had to flatten her you hit her well yeah before she sliced my face with those knifepoint nails of hers darling eve he kissed her cheek then the other then the dent in her chin what is it about you that draws the beast out of people just lucky i guess so this pandora pandora his head came up eyes narrowing the model yeah shes supposed to be pretty hot shit he started to laugh just a chuckle at first that grew and swelled until he had to roll over on his back again you punched precious pandora in her billiondollar face did you knock her on her pretty ass as a matter of fact understanding bloomed and with it a surprising and unexpected twinge of jealousy you know her you could say that well he cocked a brow not so much warily as with amusement she was sitting up now and scowling down at him for the first time in their relationship he sensed a hint of green in the look there was a time briefly he scratched his chin its all very vague bull it could come back to me but you were saying is there any exceptionally beautiful woman you havent slept with ill make you a list so you knocked her down yeah eve regretted now pulling her punch shes squealing and whining then mavis comes in and pandora goes for her the two of them are pulling hair and scratching leonardos wringing his hands roarke tugged her down on top of him you lead such an interesting life the upshot is pandora threatens leonardo he ditches mavis for her or shes going to wreck this fashion show hes counting on apparently hes sunk everything into it borrowed from spine crackers too she blackballs the show hes ruined sounds just like her after pandora leaves mavis were you still naked i was getting dressed mavis decides to make the supreme sacrifice it was all pretty dramatic stuff leonardo declares his love she starts crying and runs out jesus roarke i felt like some pervert with surveillance goggles i got mavis settled in my old apartment at least for the night she doesnt have to be in to the club until tomorrow stay tuned he murmured and smiled at her blank look the old daytime dramas always end on a cliffhanger what is our hero going to do some hero eve muttered damn it i like him even if he is a pussy what hed like to do is bash pandoras head in but hell probably cave which is why i thought we could put mavis up here for a few days if she needs it sure really it is as youve often pointed out a big house im fond of mavis i know she gave him one of her quick rare smiles thanks so how was your day i bought a small planet im joking he said when her mouth fell open i did however complete negotiations for a farming commune on taurus five farming people have to eat with a bit of restructuring the commune should be able to provide grain to the manufacturing colonies of mars where i have a sizable investment so one hand washes the other i guess now about pandora he rolled her over and tugged the shirt hed already unbuttoned off her shoulders youre not distracting me she told him just how brief is brief in this case he gave what passed for a shrug and nibbled his way from her mouth to her throat is it like a night a week her body flashed hot when he closed his mouth over her breast a month okay now youre distracting me i can do better he promised and did o o visiting the morgue was a lousy way to start the day eve strode down the silent white tiled halls trying not to be annoyed that shed been called in to view a body at six a m worse it was a floater she paused at a doorway holding her badge up for the security camera and waited for her id number to be accessed and approved inside a single technician waited near a wall of refrigerated holding drawers most would be occupied she thought summer was always a hot time for dying lieutenant dallas right you got one for me just came in with the careless cheer of his profession he moved to a drawer coded for view locks and refrigeration blipped off and the drawer with its occupant slid out with a small burst of icy fog uniform on scene thought she recognized him as one of yours yep in defense eve drew breath in and out of her mouth seeing death violent death was nothing new she wasnt sure she could have explained that it was easier less personal somehow to study a body where it had fallen here in the pristine almost virginal surroundings of the morgue it was all more obscene johannsen carter aka boomer last known address the flop on beacon petty thief professional weasel occasional dealer in illegals and pitiful excuse for a humanoid she sighed as she studied what was left of him well hell boomer what did they do to you blunt instrument the tech said taking her question seriously possibly a pipe or a thin bat well have to finish testing a lot of strength behind the blows only spent a couple hours at most in the river the contusions and lacerations are evident eve tuned him out let him ramble on importantly she could see well enough for herself hed never been a looker but theyd left behind very little of his face hed been severely beaten the nose crushed the mouth all but obscured with blows and bloating bruising at the throat indicated strangulation as did the vivid broken blood vessels that polkadotted what remained of his face his torso was purpled and from the way his body lay she guessed his arm had been shattered the missing finger of his left hand was an old war wound one she recalled hed been rather proud of somebody strong angry and determined had gotten to poor pathetic boomer and so in that short floating time had the fish the uniform ran the partial prints he had left for id you confirm with visual yeah send me a copy of the post mortem she turned and started out who was the uniform who connected me the tech pulled out his notebook tapped keys peabody delia peabody for the first time eve smiled a little she gets around anybody asks for or about him i want to know about it on the way to cop central eve contacted peabody the uniforms calm serious face floated on screen dallas yes lieutenant you hauled in johannsen sir im completing my report right now i can send you a copy appreciate it how did you tag him i had a portaident in my field kit sir i ran his prints the fingers were severely damaged so i only managed a partial but the indication was johannsen id heard he was one of your weasels yeah he was good work peabody thank you sir peabody you interested in assisting the primary in this case control slipped for an instant just long enough to show the glint in peabodys eyes yes sir are you the primary he was mine eve said simply ill clear it my office peabody one hour yes sir thank you sir dallas eve muttered just dallas but peabody had already broken transmission o o eve scowled at the time snarled at the traffic and detoured three blocks to a drivethrough cafe the coffee was slightly less disgusting there than at cop central fueled with that and with what had probably been intended as a sweet roll she stowed her vehicle and prepared to report to her commander as she rode up in the stifling excuse for an elevator she could feel her back stiffening telling herself it was petty that it should have been over didnt seem to matter resentment and hurt left over from a previous case wouldnt completely fade she walked into the administration lobby with its busy consoles dark walls and threadbare carpeting she announced herself at commander whitneys reception station and was asked to wait by the bored voice of an office drone she remained where she was rather than wandering over to look out of the window or to while away time with one of the aging magazine discs the allnews station on screen behind her had been turned to mute and didnt interest her in any case a few weeks before she had more than her fill of the media at least she thought someone as low on the food chain as boomer wouldnt generate much publicity the death of a weasel didnt earn rating points commander whitney will see you now dallas lieutenant eve she was buzzed through the security doors and turned left into whitneys office lieutenant commander thank you for seeing me have a seat no thank you i wont keep you long i just identified a john doe floater at the morgue he was carter johannsen one of my weasels an imposing man with a hard face and tired eyes whitney leaned back in his chair boomer he used to wire explosives for street thieves blew off his right index finger left eve corrected sir left whitney folded his hands on the desk and studied her hed made a mistake with eve a mistake in a case that had affected him personally he understood she had yet to set it aside he had her obedience and her respect but the nebulous friendship that could have existed between them was gone i take it this was homicide i havent gotten the post mortem but it appears the victim was beaten and strangled before entering the river id like to pursue the matter were you working with him on any ongoing investigation nothing ongoing no sir he occasionally fed the illegals with data i need to find out who he worked with in that department whitney nodded your caseload at the moment lieutenant manageable which means youre overloaded he lifted his fingers curled them down again dallas people like johannsen court disaster and they usually find it you and i both know the murder rate rises in this kind of heat i cant waste one of my top investigators on this kind of case eve set her jaw he was mine whatever else he was commander he was mine loyalty he mused was one of the values that made her one of his best you can shuffle it to the top for twentyfour hours he told her keep it open in your files for seventytwo after that ill have to transfer the case to a junior investigator it was no more than she expected id like to have officer peabody with me on it he stared at her balefully you want me to approve an aide for a case like this i want peabody eve returned without flinching shes proven herself excellent in the field shes aiming for detective i believe shell get it quick with some handson training you can have her for three days if something more vital comes through youre both off yes sir dallas he began when she turned to leave he bit down on his pride eve i havent had the chance to offer my best wishes personally for your upcoming marriage surprise flickered in her eyes before she controlled it thank you i hope youll be happy so do i a bit unsettled she made her way through the maze of cop central to her office she had another favor to call in wanting privacy she closed her door before engaging her telelink feeney captain ryan electronic detective division she was relieved when his rumpled face filled her screen youre in early feeney shit didnt even have time for breakfast he spoke mournfully and through a mouthful of danish one of the terminals springs a leak and nobody can fix it but me being indispensables tough work can you fit in a search for me unofficial my favorite kind shoot somebody whacked boomer sorry to hear it he took another bite of danish he was a shit but he usually came through when im not sure he was fished out of the east river early this morning i know he sometimes fed somebody over in illegals can you find out for me linking weasels and their trainers is dicey work dallas you got to be real security conscious about that stuff yes or no feeney i can do it i can do it he muttered but dont bring this back on me cops hate to have their files searched tell me about it i appreciate it feeney whoever did him worked him over hard if he knew something worth killing him over i dont think it was one of my ongoings so maybe it was somebody elses ill get back to you she leaned back from the blank screen and tried to clear her mind into it floated boomers battered face a pipe or a bat maybe she mused but fists too she knew what hard bare knuckles could do to a face she knew what they felt like her father had had big hands it was one of the things she tried to pretend she didnt remember but she knew how theyd felt how the blow would shock even before the brain registered the pain what had been worse the beatings or the rapes one was so mixed with the other in her mind in her rears that odd angle of boomers arm broken she mused and dislocated she had a vague hideous memory of the brittle sound of a bone snapping the nausea that went above the agony the highpitched whine that substituted for a scream when a hand was clamped over your mouth the cold sweat and the bowelloosening terror of knowing those fists would come back and come back until you were dead until you wished to god almighty that you were the knock at her door had her jolting had her swallowing a yelp through the glass she saw peabody uniform pressed shoulders straight eve ran a hand over her mouth to steady herself it was time to go to work chapter three boomers flop was better than some the building had once been a lowrent hourly motel that had catered to hookers on a budget before prostitution had been licensed and legalized it was four stories and no one had ever bothered to put in an elevator or glide but it did boast a dingy lobby and the dubious security of a surlyfaced droid from the smell the health department had recently ordered insect and rodent extermination the droid had a tick in her right eye from a faulty chip but she focused her good one on eves badge were up to code she claimed standing behind cloudy safety glass we have no trouble here johannsen eve tucked her shield away anyone visit him lately the droids dinky eye hitched and rolled im not programmed to monitor visitors only to collect rents and maintain order i can confiscate your memory discs and play them back for myself the droid said nothing but a faint hum indicated she was running her own disc johannsen room c has not returned in eight hours twentyeight minutes he left alone he had no visitors in the last two weeks communications he does not use our communication system he has his own were going to have a look at his room third floor second door left dont alarm other tenants we have no trouble here yeah its a paradise eve headed up the steps noting the crumbling wood well gnawed by rodents record peabody yes sir dutifully peabody clipped her recorder to her shirt if he was here about eight hours ago he didnt last long after he left probably no more than a couple hours long enough to get the shit beat out of him idly eve scanned the walls several illegal invitations and anatomically doubtful suggestions were inscribed one of the authors had a spelling deficiency and consistently left the c out of fuck still the message was clear enough homey little place huh reminds me of my grannys house at the door of c eve glanced back why peabody i think you made a joke while eve chuckled and took out her master code peabody flushed scarlet she had herself back in line by the time the locks disengaged bolted himself in didnt he eve muttered as the last of the three kelighs opened and didnt go for cheap these babies cost about a week of my pay each for all the good they did him she let out a breath dallas lieutenant eve entering victims residence she pushed the door open damn boomer you were a pig the heat was enormous temperature control in the flop consisted of closing the window or opening it boomer had opted for closed and had trapped stifling summer inside the room smelled of bad food gone over stale clothes and spilled whiskey leaving peabody to do the initial scan eve walked into the center of what was little more than a box and shook her head the sheets on the narrow bed were stained with substances she wasnt keen to analyze boxes of takeout food were piled beside it from the small mountain of dirty clothes heaped in corners she assumed laundry hadnt been high on boomers list of household chores her feet stuck to the floor and made little sucking sounds as she wandered the room in selfdefense she fought the single window open the sounds of air and street traffic poured in like a flood jesus what a place he made decent money weaseling no way he had to live like this he must have wanted to yep wrinkling her nose eve eased open a door and studied the bathroom there was a stainless steel toilet and sink a shower stall built for the height disadvantaged the stench roiled her stomach worse then a threeday corpse she breathed through her mouth turned back theres where he put his money in agreement peabody joined eve at a sturdy counter on it was a pricey data and communication center attached to the wall above was a viewing screen and a shelf overflowing with discs eve chose one at random read the label boomer was into culture i see bodacious boobs of bimbo bitches that took the oscar last year eve snorted and tossed the disc back good one peabody you want to keep that sense of humor going cause were going to have to run all this shit box up the discs record number and labels well scan them back at cop central eve engaged the link and searched through for any calls boomer had saved she zipped through food orders a session with a video prostitute that had cost him five thousand there were two calls from a suspected dealer of illegals but the men had merely chatted about sports heavy on baseball and arena bash with some curiosity she noted that her office number was logged twice in the last thirty hours but hed left no message he was trying to get in touch with me she murmured he disengaged without leaving a message thats not like him she pulled out the disc and handed it to peabody to put in evidence theres nothing to indicate he was afraid or worried lieutenant no he was a true weasel if hed thought someone was going to pin him hed have camped on my doorstep okay peabody i hope your immunizations are up to date lets start going through this mess o o by the time they were finished they were filthy sweaty and disgusted at eves direct order peabody had loosened the stiff collar of her uniform and rolled up the sleeves still sweat rained down her face and had her hair curling madly i thought my brothers were pigs eve toed aside dirty underwear how many you got two and a sister four of you my parents are freeagers sir peabody explained with twin notes of apology and embarrassment in her voice theyre really into rural living and propagation you continue to surprise me peabody a tough urbanite like you springing from freeagers how come youre not growing alfalfa weaving mats and raising a brood i like to kick ass sir good reason eve had left what she considered the worst for last with unconcealed revulsion she studied the bed the thought of body parasites scrambled through her head weve got to deal with the mattress peabody swallowed hard yes sir i dont know about you peabody but im heading straight for a decontamination chamber when were done here ill be right behind you lieutenant okay lets do it the sheets came first there was nothing but smells and stains eve would leave them for the sweepers to analyze but shed already ruled out any possibility that boomer had been killed in his own flop still she was thorough shaking out the pillow manipulating the foam at her signal peabody hefted one end of the mattress and she the other it was heavy as a rock and with a grunt they flipped it maybe there is a god eve murmured affixed to the bottom of the mattress were two small packs one was filled with pale blue powder the other a sealed disc she tugged both free clamping down on the urge to break open the powder she studied the disc it wasnt labeled but unlike the others it had been carefully encased to keep it free of dust ordinarily she would have run it immediately in boomers unit she could stand the stench the sweat even the dirt but she didnt think she could maintain another minute wondering what microcosmic parasites were crawling over her skin lets get the hell out of here she waited until peabody carried the evidence box out into the hall with one last glance at the way her man had lived eve shut the door sealed it and left the red police security light beaming o o decontamination wasnt painful but it wasnt particularly pleasant it had the single virtue of being fairly short eve sat with peabody both of them stripped to the skin in a twoseated chamber with curved white walls reflecting the hot white light but its a dry heat peabody stated and had eve laughing i always figured this is what hells like she closed her eyes willed herself to relax she didnt consider herself phobic but closedin spaces made her itchy you know peabody i used boomer about five years now he wasnt exactly the gq type but i wouldnt have pegged him living like that she still had the smell in her nostrils he was clean tell me what you saw in the bathroom filth mold scum towels that hadnt been washed two bars of soap one unopened a half tube of shampoo tooth gel an ultrasound brush and shaver one hair comb broken grooming tools he kept himself in shape peabody even liked to consider himself a ladys man my guess is the sweepers are going to tell me the food the clothes the grunge is all about two maybe three weeks old what does that tell you that he was holed up worried scared or involved enough to let things go exactly not desperate enough to come in and unload to me but worried enough to hide a couple of things under his mattress where no one would ever think of looking for them peabody said dryly he wasnt terribly bright about some things you got a guess on the substance an illegal ive never seen an illegal that color something new eve mused the light dimmed to gray and a beeper sounded looks like were clean lets dig up some fresh clothes and go run that disc o o what the hell is this eve scowled at her monitor unconsciously she began to toy with the weighty diamond she wore around her neck a formula i can figure that out peabody yes sir chastised peabody eased back shit i hate science with hope eve glanced over her shoulder you any good at it no sir im not even competent eve studied the mix of numbers figures and symbols and crossed her eyes my units not programmed for this crap itll have to go to the lab for analysis impatient she drummed her fingers on the desk my hunch would be its the formula for that powder we found but how the hell would a second rater like boomer get his hands on it and who was his other trainer you knew he was one of mine peabody how struggling with embarrassment peabody stared over eves shoulder at the figures on the screen you listed him in several intradepartmental reports on closed cases lieutenant you make a habit of reading intradepartmental reports officer yours sir why because sir youre the best are you sucking up peabody or bucking for my job therell be room when youre promoted to captain sir what makes you think i want a captaincy youd be stupid if you didnt and youre not stupid sir okay well let that rest do you scan any other reports now and then do you have any clue as to who boomers trainer would be in illegals no sir ive never seen his name attached to any other cop most weasels only have one trainer boomer liked to diversify lets hit the streets well scope a few of his usual joints see what we turn up weve only got a couple of days on this peabody if youve got anyone warming the home fires for you let him know youll be busy im unattached sir i dont have a problem with putting in extra time good eve rose then saddle up and peabody weve been naked together drop all the sirs will you make it dallas yes sir lieutenant o o it was after three a m when she stumbled through the front door tripped over the cat who had decided to guard the entrance hall swore and turned blindly for the stairs in her mind were dozens of impressions dim bars strip clubs the steamy streets where lowlevel licensed companions plied their trade all of them ebbed and flowed together in the unappetizing stew that had been boomer johannsens life no one knew anything of course no one had seen anything the single corroborative statement shed gleaned from her crawl through the seamier side of the city was that no one had heard from or laid eyes on boomer in over a week possibly longer but someone had laid a great deal more than eyes on him her time was running low to find out who and why the bedroom lights were on dim shed already stripped off her shirt and tossed it aside when she noted the bed was empty there was an instant flare of disappointment a faint uncomfortable tug of panic hed had to leave she thought he was right now heading toward any possible spot in the colonized universe he could be gone for days staring miserably at the bed she toed off her shoes and tugged off her slacks groping in a drawer she pulled out a cotton undershirt and yanked it over her head god she was pitiful mooning because roarke had to take care of business because he wasnt mere for her to snuggle up against because he wasnt there to ward off the nightmares that seemed to plague her with more intensity and frequency as her memories of the past grew to crowd her she was too tired to dream she told herself too busy to brood and strong enough not to remember anything she didnt care to remember she turned intending to go to her upstairs office to sleep when the door slid open relief flushed through her like shame i thought youd had to leave i was working roarke crossed to her in the dim light his black shirt was a stark contrast to the white of hers he tipped up her chin and looked into her eyes lieutenant why do you always run until you fall down i have a deadline on this one perhaps she was overtired or perhaps love was beginning to be easier but she lifted both hands to his face im awfully glad youre here when he lifted her up and carried her toward the bed she smiled thats not what i meant im tucking you in and youre going to sleep it was hard to argue when her eyes were already closing did you get my message the elaborate one that said ill be late yes he kissed her forehead turn yourself off in a minute she fought back the edges of sleep i only had a couple minutes to contact mavis she wants to stay where she is for a couple days she isnt going in to the blue squirrel either she called in and found out leonardos been by there a half a dozen times looking for her the course of true love mmm im going to try to take an hour personal time tomorrow and swing by to see her but i may not make it until the day after shell be all right i can go by if you like thanks but she wouldnt talk to you about it ill take care of it as soon as i figure out what boomer was up to i know damn well he couldnt read that disc of course not roarke soothed hoping to lull her to sleep not that he wasnt good with figures money figures but scientific formulas she bolted straight up nearly bashing roarkes nose with her head your unitll do it it will i got the runaround from the lab theyre backed up this is low priority no priority she added scrambling back out of bed i need an edge youve got scientific analysis abilities on your unlicensed unit right of course he sighed and rose now i suppose we can access the data from my office unit grabbing his hand she tugged him toward the faux panel that concealed the elevator it wont take us long she filled him in on the basics as they traveled up by the time hed coded them in to the private room she was wide awake and revved the equipment was elaborate unlicensed and of course illegal like roarke she used the handplate for access then moved behind the ushaped console you can pull the data faster than i can she told him its under code two yellow johannsen my access numbers please if he was going to play cop at three a m he wasnt going to be insulted roarke sat at the controls and manipulated a few dials manually into cop central he said and smiled when she frowned so much for security anything else youd like before i focus on your unit no she said it firmly moving behind him manipulating a keyboard with one hand roarke drew one of hers over his shoulder to his lips to nibble on her knuckles showoff it would hardly be any fun if you just plugged me in with your code in your unit he murmured and switched to auto file code two yellow johannsen across the room one of the wall screens flashed waiting evidence number j view and copy eve requested when the formula scrolled on eve shook her head see that it might as well be ancient hieroglyphics chemical formula roarke mused how do you know i manufacture a few legal ones this is some sort of analgesic but not entirely hallucinogenic properties he clucked his tongue shook his head ive never seen anything quite like it not a standard computer analyze and identify you say its a drug eve began and the computer went to work most certainly that fits with my theory but what was boomer doing with the formula and why would someone kill him for it that would depend on how marketable it is id think how profitable he frowned up at the screen as the analysis began to form the molecular reproduction circled on the screen in colorful dots and spirals okay you have an organic stimulant a standard chemical hallucinogenic both in fairly low and nearly legal amounts ah theres the properties for thr street name zeus nasty stuff hmm still its low wattage but thats an interesting mix theres mint to make it more palatable id say it could also be manufactured with some alterations in liquid form blend it with brinock thats a sexual stimulant and enhancer in the right measures it can be used to cure impotency i know what it is we had a guy who odd on it killed himself after what appeared to be the worlds record in masturbation jumped out of a window in sexual frustration his dick was swollen like a pork sausage about the same color and still hard as iron thank you for sharing that whats this puzzled roarke went back to the keyboard the computer merely continued to flash the same message substance unknown probable cell regenerator unable to identify how is that possible he mused i have an automatic update on this theres nothing out there it cant identify an unknown substance well well that might be worth killing for what will it give us without it identify with known data roarke ordered formula equals stimulant with hallucinogenic properties organic base will enter bloodstream quickly to affect nervous system results incomplete data hell probable results with known data will cause feelings of euphoria paranoia sexual appetite delusions of physical and mental powers dosage of mg into average human of pounds will last four to six hours dosage of more than mg will cause death in percent of users substance similar to thr aka zeus with addition of stimulant to enhance sexual ability and cell regeneration its not that different eve murmured its not that important weve already got chemiheads mixing zeus with erotica its a nasty combination accounts for most of the rapes in the city but its not secret or particularly profitable not when any average junkie can mix it up in a portalab except for the unknown cell regeneration his brow quirked the fabled fountain of youth anybody with enough credits can get youth treatments but theyre temporary roarke pointed out you have to go back at regular intervals bio peels and antiaging injections are expensive timeconsuming and often uncomfortable and standard treatments dont have all the extra punches of this whatever the unknown is it makes the whole works bigger or deadlier or as you said more marketable youve got the powder roarke pointed out yeah and this might get the lab to shag their butts a bit its still going to take more time than i have can you get me a sample of it he swiveled in his chair and smiled up at her not to denigrate your police labs lieutenant but mine might prove a shade more sophisticated its evidence his brow lifted roarke do you know how far ive already crossed the line getting you to do this she blew out a breath remembered boomers face his arm hell with it ill try good disengage the computer shut down silently now will you go to sleep for a couple hours she allowed the fatigue to seep back linked her arms around his neck you going to tuck me in again all right he hitched up her hips so that her legs wrapped around him but this time you stay where i tuck you you know roarke my heart just flutters when you get masterful wait till i get you back in bed its going to flutter plenty she laughed nuzzled her head on his shoulder and was asleep before the elevator finished its descent chapter four it was dead dark when the link beside eves head beeped the cop in her surfaced first smacked the engage and reared up dallas dallas oh god dallas i need help the woman in her caught up with the cop in a snap and stared at maviss image on screen lights she ordered and the room brightened so that she could see clearly the white face a blackening bruise just under the eye raw bleeding scrapes on the cheek wild disheveled hair mavis what is it where are you youve got to come her breath hitched and snarled her eyes were too glazed with shock to allow tears hurry hurry please i think shes dead and i dont know what to do eve didnt ask for location again but punched in an order to trace transmission recognizing leonardos address when it blipped on under maviss face she kept her voice calm and firm stay where you are dont touch anything you understand me dont touch anything and dont let anyone in but me mavis yes yes i will i wont hurry its so awful im on my way when she turned roarke was already up and pulling on his trousers ill go with you she didnt argue in five minutes flat they were on the road and speeding through the deepest slice of night empty streets gave way to the constant swarm of tourists in midtown the flash of video billboards offering every pleasure and purchase known to man then to the trendy insomniacs of the village who loitered over minuscule cups of flavored coffee and lofty discussions in outdoor cafes and finally to the sleepy habitats of the artists other than to find out their destination roarke didnt ask questions and she was grateful for it she could see maviss face in her mind white and terrified worse much worse she saw maviss hand trembling and the smear that had darkened it had been blood a high wind that hinted of a brewing storm whipped through the city canyons it slapped at eve as she leaped from roarkes car before hed stopped completely at the curb she took the thirty yards of sidewalk in a dead run smacked the security camera mavis its dallas mavis damn it such was her state of mind that it took her ten frustrated seconds to realize the unit was smashed roarke went through the unsecured door and into the elevator beside her when it opened she knew it was as bad as shed feared on her earlier visit leonardos loft had been cheerfully cluttered colorfully disorganized now it was viciously tumbled long trails of material shredded tables overturned with their contents strewn and broken there was blood a great deal of it splattered on walls and silks like a badtempered childs angry fingerpaints dont touch anything she snapped at roarke out of reflex mavis she took two steps forward then stopped as one of the billowing curtains of shimmery cloth rippled mavis moved passed it stood swaying dallas dallas thank god okay its okay the minute eve caught her close the relief poured the blood wasnt maviss though it was spotted on her clothes on her hands youre hurt how bad im dizzy sick my head let her sit down eve taking maviss arm roarke led her to a chair come on darling sit down thats the way shes in shock eve get her a blanket put your head back mavis thats a girl close your eyes and just breathe for a while its cold i know he reached down flipped up a ragged piece of glistening satin and draped it over her deep breaths mavis slow deep breaths he flicked a glance up at eve she needs attention i cant call the mts before i know what the situation is do what you can for her all too aware of what she was likely to find eve moved past the curtain shed died badly it was the hair that confirmed to eve who the woman had once been the glorious curling flame of it her face with its stunning almost eerie perfection was all but gone mashed and mangled under cruel repeated blows the weapon was still there carelessly tossed aside eve supposed it was intended to be some sort of fancy cane or walking stick a fashionable affectation under the blood and gore it was a glossy silver perhaps an inch thick with an ornate handle in the shape of a grinning wolf shed seen it tipped into a corner of leonardos work space only two days before it was not necessary to check pandoras pulse but eve did so then she stepped back carefully so as not to contaminate the scene any further christ roarke murmured from behind her then laid both hands on her shoulders what are you going to do whatever i have to mavis wouldnt have done this he turned her to face him you dont have to tell me that she needs you eve she needs a friend and shes going to need a good cop i know its not going to be easy on you being both id better get started she walked back to where mavis sat her face was like softened wax the bruise and the scratches livid against the bonewhite skin eve crouched down and took maviss icy hands in hers i need you to tell me everything take your time but tell it all she wasnt moving there was all the blood and the way her face looked and and she wasnt moving mavis eve gave the hands one quick hard squeeze look at me tell me exactly what happened from the time you got here i came i wanted i thought i should talk to leonardo she shivered plucked at the scrap of material covering her with hands still stained with blood he was upset when he went to the club the last time looking for me he even threatened the bouncer and thats not like him i didnt want him to ruin his career so i thought i could talk to him i came and someone had broken the security unit so i just came on up the door wasnt locked sometimes he forgets she murmured and trailed off mavis was leonardo here leonardo dulled with shock her eyes scanned the room no i dont think so i called out because i saw there was such a mess nobody answered and there there was blood i saw blood so much blood i was afraid dallas afraid that maybe hed killed himself or something crazy and so i ran back into back i saw her i think i went over i think i did because i was kneeling beside her and i was trying to scream i couldnt scream it was all in my head that i was screaming and i couldnt stop and then i think something hit me i think vaguely she touched her fingers to the back of her head it hurts but everything was the same when i woke up she was still there and the blood was still there and i called you okay did you touch her mavis did you touch anything i dont remember i dont think so who did that to your face pandora a quick spurt of fear honey you told me she was dead when you got here it was before earlier tonight i went to her house eve took a careful breath to counteract the twisting in her stomach you went to her house tonight when i dont know exactly about eleven maybe i wanted to tell her id stay away from leonardo to make her promise not to ruin everything for him you fought with her she was jazzed up on something there were some people there like a small party she was nasty said things i said things back we got into it a little she smacked me scratched me mavis tugged back her hair to reveal other wounds along her neck a couple of the people there broke it up and i left where did you go a couple of bars she smiled weakly a lot of bars i think feeling sorry for myself just hanging then i got the idea to talk to leonardo when did you get here do you know what time no late real late three four oclock do you know where leonardo is no he wasnt here i wanted him to be here but she whats going to happen im going to take care of it i have to call this in mavis if i dont do it soon its going to look bad im going to have to put all of this on record and im going to have to take you into interview into into you dont think i of course i dont it was important to keep her voice brisk to disguise her own fears but were going to clear it all up as quick as we can as clean as we can let me do the worrying right now okay i cant feel much of anything you just sit here while i start things rolling i want you to try to remember details who you talked to tonight where you were what you saw everything you can remember well go over it all again in a little while dallas with a little shudder mavis sat back leonardo hed never do that to anyone let me do the worrying eve repeated she glanced at roarke and understanding the signal he moved over to sit with mavis eve pulled out her communicator and turned away dallas i have a homicide o o eves life had never been easy in her career as a cop she had seen and done too many nightmarish things to count them all but nothing had ever been more difficult for her than taking mavis into interview are you feeling okay you dont have to do this now no the mts gave me a local mavis reached up touched the lump on the back of her head numbed it good they fiddled around with some other stuff kind of snapped me back into focus eve took a long study of maviss eyes her color everything looked normal but it didnt ease her dread listen it wouldnt hurt for you to check in to health center for a day or two youre just putting it off id rather get it over with leonardo she swallowed hard has anyone found leonardo not yet mavis you can have an attorney or representative here i dont have anything to hide i didnt kill her dallas eve flicked a glance at the recorder it could wait just another minute mavis i have to do this by the ropes exactly they can bump me off the case if i dont if im not primary i cant be as much help to you mavis licked her lips her tongue quick and thirsty its going to be hard it could be really really hard youre going to have to handle it mavis tried for a smile nearly managed it hey nothing can be worse than walking in and finding pandora nothing oh yes it could eve thought but she nodded she engaged the recorder recited her name id and officially gave mavis her rights carefully she took mavis over the same ground she had covered on the scene pinning down times as much as possible when you went to the victims home to talk to her other people were present a few it looked like a small party justin young was there you know the actor jerry fitzgerald the model and another guy i didnt recognize looked like a suit you know an exec the victim attacked you she popped me one mavis said ruefully fingering the bruise on her cheek she started out just being bitchy the way her eyes were wheeling around in her head i figured she was pumped you believe she was using illegals big time i mean her eyes were like crystal wheels and that punch i tangled with her before you saw it mavis went on while eve winced she didnt have that kind of power before you hit her back i think i got one in at least one she scratched me those damn nails of hers i went for her hair i think it was justin young and the suit that pulled us apart and then i guess we spit at each other for a couple of minutes then i left went bar crawling where did you go how long did you stay i went a couple of places i think i hit the zigzag first the joint over on sixtyfirst and lex did you speak to anyone i didnt want to talk to anyone my face hurt and i was feeling lousy i ordered a triple zombie and sulked howd you pay for it i think yeah i think i just entered my credit account on screen good thered be a record time place from there where did you go i walked around bumped into another couple of dives i was pretty blitzed were you still ordering drinks i must have been i was pretty drunk when i thought about going over to leonardos howd you get downtown i walked i needed to sober up a little so i walked took a glide a couple of times but mostly hoofed hoping to spark some memory eve repeated all the information mavis had just given when you left the zigzag which direction did you walk id just had two triple zombies i wasnt walking i was stumbling i dont know which way dallas i dont know the name of the other joints i went into what else i drank its all a blur music people laughing a table dancer male or female a guy hung with a tattoo i think could have been paint pretty sure it was a snake maybe a lizard what did he look like the table dancer shit dallas i never looked above the waist did you talk to him mavis put her head in her hands and struggled to bring it back holding onto the memory was like trying to hold a fistful of water i just dont know i was seriously impaired i remember walking and walking getting to leonardos thinking it was the last time i was going to see him i didnt want to be drunk when i did so i took some sober up before i went in then i found her and it was a lot worse than being drunk what was the first thing you saw when you walked in blood lots of blood things knocked over ripped more blood i was so afraid that leonardo had hurt himself and i ran back to his work area and saw her this was a memory she could bring back with perfect clarity i saw her i recognized her because of the hair and because she was wearing the same outfit as shed had on earlier but her face it really wasnt even there at all i couldnt scream i knelt down beside her i dont know what i thought i could do but i had to do something then something hit me and when i woke up i called you did you see anyone as you were going into the building on the street outside no it was late tell me about the security camera it was broken sometimes street punks get a charge out of bashing them i didnt think anything of it how did you get into the apartment the door wasnt locked i just walked in and pandora was dead when you got there you didnt speak with her argue no i told you she was lying there youd fought with her earlier twice did you fight with her tonight in leonardos apartment no she was dead dallas why did you fight with her on the previous occasions she threatened to ruin leonardos career emotions flickered over maviss bruised face hurt fear grief she wouldnt let him go we were in love but she wouldnt let him go you saw the way she was dallas leonardo and his career are very important to you i love him mavis said quietly youd do anything to protect him to see that he wasnt harmed personally or professionally id decided to get out of his life mavis stated with a dignity that warmed eve shed have hurt him otherwise and i couldnt let that happen she couldnt hurt him or you if she was dead i didnt kill her you went to her home argued she hit you and you fought you left and got drunk you made your way to leonardos apartment found her there maybe you argued again maybe she attacked you again you defended yourself and things got out of hand maviss big tired eyes registered puzzlement first then hurt why are you saying that you know its not true eyes flat eve leaned forward she was making your life hell threatening the man you love she hurt you physically she was stronger than you when she saw you come into leonardos she went for you again she knocked you down you hit your head then you were afraid you grabbed the closest thing at hand to protect yourself you hit her with it to protect yourself maybe she kept coming at you so you hit her again to protect yourself then you lost control and kept hitting her and kept hitting her until you realized she was dead maviss breath sobbed through her lips she shook her head kept shaking it while her body trembled violently i didnt i didnt kill her she was already dead for gods sake dallas how can you think i could do that to anybody maybe you didnt push eve ordered herself as her heart bled push hard for the record maybe leonardo did and youre protecting him did you see him lose control mavis did he pick up the walking stick and hit her no no no or did you get there after he had done it after he was standing over her body panicked you wanted to help him cover it up so you got him out called it in no it wasnt like that she lunged up from her chair cheeks white eyes wild he wasnt even there i didnt see anyone he could never do that why arent you listening to me i am listening to you mavis sit down sit down eve repeated more gently were almost done here is there anything you wish to add to your statement or any change you wish to make in its content at this time no mavis murmured and stared blindly over eves shoulder this concludes interview one mavis freestone homicide file pandora dallas lieutenant eve she noted the date and time disengaged the recorder took a leveling breath im sorry mavis im so sorry how could you do that how could you say those things to me i have to say those things to you i have to ask those questions and you have to answer them she put a firm hand over maviss i may have to ask them again and youll have to answer them again look at me mavis she waited until mavis shifted her gaze i dont know what the sweepers will pull in what the lab reports will say but if we dont get real lucky youre going to need a lawyer the color faded from maviss face even her lips until she resembled a corpse with hurting eyes youre going to arrest me i dont know if its going to come to that but i want you to be prepared now i want you to go home with roarke and get some sleep i want you to try hard real hard to remember times and places and people if you remember anything youre going to record it for me what are you going to do im going to do my job im damn good at my job mavis you remember that too and trust me to clear this up clear this up mavis repeated bitterness in her voice clear me you mean i thought it was innocent until proven guilty thats just one of the bigger lies we live by standing eve ushered mavis into the corridor ill do my best to close the case quickly thats all i can tell you you could tell me you believe me i can tell you that too she just couldnt let it get in the way o o there was always paperwork and procedure within an hour she had mavis signed out and under voluntary holding at roarkes officially mavis freestone was listed as a witness unofficially eve knew she was the prime suspect intending to begin amending that immediately she walked into her office okay whats this shit about mavis whacking some fancyfaced model feeney eve could have kissed every rumpled inch of him he sat at her desk his ubiquitous bag of sugared nuts in his lap and a scowl on his wrinkled face word travels it was the first thing i heard when i made my stop at the eatery one of our top cops pals gets collared it makes a buzz she hasnt been collared shes a witness for now medias picked it up already they dont have maviss name yet but theyve got the victims face splashed all over the screen the wife dragged me out of the shower to hear about it pandora was a bfd big fucking deal alive or dead weary eve eased a hip onto the corner of her desk want a rundown of maviss statement what do you think im here for the ambience she gave it to him in the cop shorthand they both understood and left him frowning damn dallas it doesnt look good for her you saw them going at it yourself alive and in person why the hell she got it into her mind to confront pandora again rising she paced the room it makes it worse im hoping the lab comes back with something anything but i cant count on it whats your caseload like feeney dont ask he waved that away what do you need i need a run on her credit account the first place she remembers going into is zigzag if we can place her there or at one of the other joints at time of death shes clear i can handle that for you but we got somebody hanging around the murder scene bopping mavis on the head chances are there wont be much of a time lag i know ive got to cover all the bases im going to track down the people mavis recognized at the victims house get statements ive got to find a table dancer with a big dick and a tattoo the fun never ends she nearly smiled i need to find people who can testify she was really ripped even with a dose of sober up she couldnt have been clean enough to have taken out pandora if shed been drinking her way downtown she claims pandora was using something else i have to check out then theres the elusive leonardo where the fuck was he and where is he now chapter five leonardo was sprawled in the middle of maviss living room floor where he had fallen hours before in a drunken stupor brought on by a full bottle of synthetic whiskey and a boatload of selfpity he was surfacing groggily and feared hed lost half of his face sometime during the miserable night when he lifted a cautious hand to it he was relieved to find his entire face in the usual place only numbed from being mashed into maviss floor he couldnt remember much it was one of the reasons he rarely drank and never permitted himself to overindulge he was prone to blackouts and blank spaces whenever he chugged down a few too many he thought he remembered staggering into maviss apartment building using the key code shed given him when they realized they were not just lovers but in love but she hadnt been there he was almost sure of that he had a vague picture of himself lurching across town glugging from the bottle hed bought stolen hell blearily he tried to sit up and pry his pasty eyes open all he knew for certain was that hed had the damn bottle in his hand and the whiskey in his gut he must have passed out which disgusted him how could he expect to make mavis see reason if he came weaving into her apartment babbling drunk he could only be grateful she hadnt been there now of course he had a raging hangover that made him want to curl into a ball and weep for mercy but she might come back and he didnt want her to see him in such a mortifying state he made himself get up hunted down some painkillers before programming her autochef for coffee strong and black then he noticed the blood it was dried streaking down his arm onto his hand there was a gash on his forearm long fairly deep that had crusted over blood he thought again stomach jittery as he noted that it stained his shirt his pants breathing shallowly he backed away from the counter staring down at himself had he been in a fight had he hurt anyone nausea rose in his throat as his mind skipped over huge voids and blurry memories oh sweet jesus had he killed someone o o eve was staring grimly at the medical examiners preliminary report as she heard a quick sharp rap on the door of her office it opened before she acknowledged it lieutenant dallas the man had the look of a sunbleached cowboy from his shiteating grin to his wornheeled boots goddamn its good to see the legend in the flesh seen your picture but youre a long sight prettier im all aflutter eyes narrowing she leaned back he was plenty pretty himself with wheatcolored hair curling around a tan livedin face that creased appealingly around bottlegreen eyes a long straight nose the quick wink of a sly dimple at the corner of a grinning mouth and a body that well looked like it could ride the range just fine who the hell are you casto jake t he tugged a shield from the snug front pocket of his faded levis illegals heard you were tracking me eve scanned the badge did you did you hear why i might have been tracking you lieutenant casto jake t our mutual weasel he stepped all the way in and planted a hip companionably on her desk that brought him close enough for her to catch the scent of his skin soap and leather goddamn shame about old boomer harmless little prick if you knew boomer was mine whats taken you so long to come see me ive been tied up on something else and to tell the truth i didnt think there was much to say or do then i heard feeney from hdd was poking around those eyes smiled again with just a touch of sarcasm feeneys pretty much yours too isnt he feeneys his own what were you working boomer on usual casto picked up an amethyst egg from her desk admired the inclusions passed it from hand to hand information on illegals small shit boomer liked to think he was big time but it was always little bits and pieces little bits and pieces can build the big picture thats why i used him honey he was pretty reliable for a bust here and there couple of times i tagged a middle level dealer on his data he grinned again somebodys gotta do it yeah so who beat him into putty the grin faded casto set the egg back down and shook his head cant say as i have a clue boomer wasnt your lovable sort but i dont know anybody who hated him enough or was pissed enough to whack him that way eve studied her man he looked solid and there had been a tone in his voice when hed spoken of boomer that reminded her of her own cautious affection still she believed in holding her cards close was he working on anything in particular something different something bigger castos sandy brow lifted such as im asking you illegals arent my game there wasnt anything i knew of last i talked to him hell maybe two weeks before he went floating he talked about sniffing out something outrageous you know how he talked eve yeah i know how he talked it was time to lay one of her cards down i also know i copped some unidentified substance hidden in his apartment its in the lab now and theyre analyzing so far all they tell me is its a new blend and its more potent than anything currently on the street new blend castos brow creased why the hell didnt he tip me to that if he tried to play both sides casto hissed a breath between his teeth you think he got whacked over it thats my best theory yeah dumb shit probably tried to shake down the maker or the distributor listen ill talk to the lab and ill see if theres any buzz on the street about something new coming in appreciate it itll be a pleasure working with you he shifted let his gaze linger on her mouth for a beat with a kind of talent that missed insulting by miles and bullseyed on flattering maybe youd like to catch a bite to eat discuss strategy or whatever comes to mind no thanks is that no because youre not hungry or because youre getting married both well then he rose and being human she had to appreciate the way the denim snugged over long lanky legs if you change your mind about either you know where to find me now ill be in touch he sauntered toward the door paused and turned you know eve youve got eyes like good aged whiskey sure brings out a powerful thirst in a man she frowned at the door he closed behind him annoyed at the fact that her pulse was a little quick a little unsteady shaking it off she dragged both hands through her hair and looked back at the report on her screen she hadnt needed to be told how pandora had died but it was interesting to see that the me believed the first three head blows had been fatal anything after that had just been indulgence on the killers part shed put up a fight before the head blows eve noted lacerations and abrasions on other parts of the body were concordant with a struggle the time of death was listed at oh two fifty and stomach contents indicated the victim had enjoyed an elegant last meal at about twentyone hundred of lobster escarole bavarian cream and vintage champagne there had also been heavy traces of chemicals in her bloodstream which had yet to be analyzed so mavis had probably been right it looked as though pandora was jazzed on something possibly on the illegals list in the grand scheme of things that might or might not make a difference but the traces of skin under the victims nails were going to make a difference eve was terrifyingly sure when the lab finished its work it was going to prove to be maviss skin just as the strands of hair the sweepers had bagged near the body were going to be maviss hair and most damning she was afraid the prints on the murder weapon could be maviss as a setup eve thought and let her eyes close it was perfect mavis comes in wrong time wrong place and the killer sees a tailormade scapegoat had he or she known the history between mavis and the victim or had that just been one more stroke of luck in any case he knocks mavis out plants some evidence even adds the master stroke of scraping the dead womans nails over maviss face easy enough to press her fingers onto the weapon then slip out and away with the satisfaction of a job well done it wouldnt take a genius she mused but it would take a cold practical mind and how did that jibe with the rage and the insanity of the attack on pandora she would have to make it jibe eve told herself and she would have to find a way to clear mavis and find the kind of killer who could batter a womans face into nothing then tidy up after himself even as she started to rise her door burst open wildeyed leonardo lurched inside i killed her i killed pandora god help me with that his wild eyes rolled back and all two hundred and sixty pounds of him thudded to the floor in a dead faint jesus jesus christ rather than try to catch him eve nipped back out of the way of his falling body it was like watching a redwood go down now he was stretched feet on her threshold his head nearly brushing the opposite wall she crouched down put her back into it and managed to roll him over she tried a couple of sharp light slaps then waited muttering to herself she put her back into that as well as rapped his cheeks hard he moaned and his bloodshot eyes fluttered open what where shut up leonardo eve snapped out the order as she rose went to the doorway and kicked his feet inside with the door firmly shut she looked down at him im going to read you your rights my rights he looked dazed but managed to heave himself up until he was sitting on the floor instead of lying on it you listen up she gave him the standard revised miranda then held up a hand before he could speak you understand your rights and your options yeah weary he rubbed his hands over his face i know whats going on you wish to make a statement ive already told you eyes flat she held up a hand again yes or no just yes or no yes yes i want to make a statement get up off the floor im going to record this she turned to her desk she could have hauled him down to interview probably should have but it could wait you understand whatever you say now is going on record yes he got to his feet then dropped into a chair that groaned under his weight dallas she shook her head to cut him off after engaging her recorder she noted the necessary information then gave him his miranda again for the record leonardo you understand these rights and options and at this time have waived counsel and are prepared to make a statement i just want to get it over with yes or no yes yes damn it you were acquainted with pandora of course i was you had a relationship with her i did he covered his face again but could still see the image that had flashed on maviss viewing screen when hed decided to flip on the news the long black bag being carried out of his own apartment building i cant believe this has happened what was the nature of your relationship with the victim it was so coldhe thought the way she said it the victim leonardo dropped his hands into his lap and stared at eve you know we were lovers you know i was trying to break it off because you were no longer intimate eve interrupted at the time of her death no we hadnt been together for weeks shed been off planet things had cooled between us even before she left and then i met mavis and everything changed for me dallas where is mavis where is she im not at liberty to give you ms freestones whereabouts at this time just tell me shes all right his eyes filled swam just tell me shes all right shes being taken care of was all eve would say could say leonardo is it true that pandora was threatening to ruin you professionally that she demanded you continue your relationship with her and that if you refused she would pull out of the showing of your fashion designs a show that you had invested with a great deal of time and money you were there you heard her she didnt give a rats damn about me but she wouldnt tolerate me being the one to pull back unless i stopped seeing mavis unless i was her lapdog again she would have seen to it that the show was a failure if it ran at all you didnt want to stop seeing ms freestone i love mavis he said with great dignity shes the most important thing in my life and yet if you didnt accede to pandoras demands you would in all probability be left with enormous debts and a stain on your professional reputation that would have been intolerable is this correct yes i put everything i had into the show i borrowed a great deal of money more i put my heart into it my soul she could have wiped that all out oh yes his lips curled she would have enjoyed it did you ask her to come to your apartment last night no i never wanted to see her again what time did she come to your apartment last night i dont know how did she get in did you let her in i dont think so i dont know she would have had my key code i never thought to get it back from her or to change it everythings been so crazy you argued with her his eyes glazed over went blank i dont know i dont remember but i must have i would have recently pandora came into your apartment uninvited threatened you attacked your current companion physically yes yes she did he could remember that it was a relief to be able to remember that what was pandoras state of mind when she came to your apartment this time she must have been angry i would have told her i wasnt giving mavis up that would have infuriated her dallas his eyes focused again and desperation shone in them i just dont remember any of it when i woke up this morning i was in maviss apartment i think i remember using my key code to get in id been drinking walking and drinking i rarely drink because i tend to lose time black holes in my mind when i woke up i saw the blood he held out his arm where the wound had been poorly bandaged there was blood on my hands on my clothes dried blood i must have fought with her i must have killed her where are the clothes you were wearing last night i left them at maviss i showered and i changed i didnt want her to come home and find me looking like that i was waiting for her trying to figure out what to do and i turned on the news i heard i saw and i knew youre saying that you dont remember seeing pandora last night you dont remember having an altercation with her you dont remember killing her but i must have he insisted she died in my apartment what time did you leave your apartment last night im not sure id been drinking before a lot i was upset and i was angry did you see anyone speak with anyone i bought another bottle from a street hawker i think did you see ms freestone last night no im sure of that if id seen her if i could have talked to her everything would have been all right what if i tell you mavis was in your apartment last night mavis came to see me his face brightened she came back to me but that cant be right i couldnt have forgotten that was mavis there when you fought with pandora when you killed pandora no no did she come in after pandora was dead after youd killed her you were panicked then werent you terrified there was panic in his eyes now mavis couldnt have been there but she was she called me from your apartment after she found the body mavis saw beneath the copper tone his skin went pasty oh god no someone struck mavis knocked her unconscious was it you leonardo someone hit her shes hurt he was up out of the chair dragging his hands through his hair where is she was it you he held out his arms id cut my hands off before id hurt mavis for christs pity dallas tell me where she is let me see if shes all right how did you kill pandora i the reporter said i beat her to death and he shuddered how did you beat her what did you use i my hands again he held them out eve noted there was no sign of bruising no tears or abrasions on the knuckles they were perfect as if theyd been carved from rich glossy wood she was a strong woman she must have fought back the cut on my arm id like the cut to be examined as well as the clothes you say you left at maviss are you going to arrest me now you are not being charged at this time you will however be held until the results of the tests are complete she took him over the same ground again pushing for times for places for his movements again and again she bumped up against the wall blocking his memory far from satisfied she concluded the interview took him to holding then made arrangements for the tests her next stop was commander whitney ignoring his offer of a chair she stood facing him as he sat behind his desk briskly she gave him the results of her initial interviews whitney folded his hands and watched her he had good eyes cops eyes and recognized nerves you have a man who has confessed to the murder a man with motive and opportunity a man who doesnt remember seeing the victim on the night in question much less bludgeoning her to death it wouldnt be the first time a perp confessed in such a way to make himself seem innocent no sir but i dont believe hes our killer the tests may prove me wrong but his personality type doesnt fit the crime i was a witness to another altercation where the victim attacked mavis rather than attempting to stop the fight or showing any signs of violence he stood back and wrung his hands by his own statement he was under the influence on the night of the murder drink can and does induce personality changes yes sir it was reasonable in her heart she wanted to pin it on him to take his confession at face value and run with it mavis would be miserable but shed be safe shed be cleared its not him she said flatly i recommend holding him for the maximum amount of time reinterviewing to try to jog his memory but we cant charge him for thinking he committed murder ill go along with your recommendation dallas the other lab reports should be in shortly well hope the results will clear everything up you understand they may further incriminate mavis freestone yes sir i understand that you have a longstanding friendship with her it would be no blot on your record to withdraw as primary on this case it would in fact be better for you and certainly more rational if you were to do so no sir i will not withdraw as primary if you pull me i will take leave and pursue the case on personal time if necessary i will resign for a moment he rubbed his joined hands against his brow your resignation would not be accepted sit down lieutenant damn it dallas he erupted when she remained standing sit ill make it a fucking order yes commander he sighed reined in his temper i hurt you not long ago with a personal attack that was neither appropriate nor deserved because of that i damaged something between us i understand that you no longer feel comfortable under my command you are the best commander ive ever served under i have no problem with you as my superior but no longer friends not even remotely he nodded accepting her silence however because of my behavior during your investigation of a case that was very personal to me you should be aware that i fully understand what youre going through on this one i know what it is to be torn between loyalties dallas while you may be unable to discuss your feelings in this case with me i strongly suggest that you do so with someone you can trust my mistake in the other investigation was in not sharing the burden dont make the same one with this mavis didnt kill anyone no amount of evidence will convince me otherwise ill do my job commander and in doing it ill find the real killer i have no doubt youll do your job lieutenant or that youll suffer for it you have my support whether you choose to use it or not thank you sir i have a request to make on another case which is the johannsen matter this time he sighed long and deep youre like a damn terrier dallas you never let go she couldnt argue the point you have my report on what was found at boomers flop the illegal substance has not been fully identified ive done some research of my own on the formula we discovered she took a disc out of her bag its a new blend highly potent its effects would probably be fairly long term as compared to whats found on the street four to six hours for an average dose too much more at one time would be in eightyeight percent fatal lips pursed whitney turned the disc over in his hands personal research dallas i had a connection i used it the lab is still working but they have identified several of the ingredients and their ratios my point is this substance would be enormously profitable as it takes only a small amount to produce results its highly addictive and produces feelings of strength delusions of power and a kind of euphoria not tranquillity but a sense of control over self and others it also contains some sort of cell regenerator ive calculated the results of longterm addiction daily use for a period of five years will in ninetysix point eight percent result in a complete and sudden shutdown of the nervous system and death christ jesus its poison ultimately yes the manufacturers certainly know this which makes them guilty not only of distributing illegals but of premeditated murder she let him chew over that a moment knew the headache it would cause if and when the media dug its claws into the data boomer may or may not have known about this aspect but he knew enough to be killed for it i want to pursue the case and as im aware im distracted by other matters so i request that officer peabody be assigned as my aide until the matter is resolved peabody has little experience in illegals or homicide lieutenant she makes up for it with brains and sweat id like her to assist in my coordinating with lieutenant casto of illegals who also used boomer as a weasel ill see to it as to the pandora homicide use feeney he lifted a brow you already are i see lets pretend ive just ordered it and make it official youll have to deal with the media im getting used to it nadine furst is back from leave ill feed her what seems best she and channel owe me a few she rose i have some people to talk to ill contact feeney and take him along lets see if we can get things cleared up before your honeymoon her face was such a study of contradictions embarrassment pleasure and fear he roared out a laugh youll live through it dallas i can guarantee it sure when the guy whos designing my wedding dress is in holding she muttered thank you commander he watched her walk out she might not have been aware that shed dropped the barrier between them but he was o o the wifes going to love this more than content to let dallas handle the driving feeney leaned back in the passenger seat street traffic was light as they headed toward park avenue south feeney a native new yorker had long since tuned out the bellows and echoes of the tourist blimps and sky buses that crowded overhead they told me they were going to fix it those fuckers hear that feeney do you hear that goddamn buzzing obligingly he focused on the sound coming from her control panel sounds like a swarm of those killer bees three days she fumed three days in repair and listen to it its worse than it was dallas he laid a hand on her arm you may have to face it finally learn to deal with the simple fact that your vehicle is a piece of garbage requisition a new one i dont want a new one using the heel of her hand she rapped the control panel i want this one without the sound effects she got caught at a light tapped her fingers on the wheel the way the controls sounded she wouldnt be able to trust automatic where the hell is central park south her controls continued to buzz so she slapped them again i said where the hell is central park south just ask nice feeney suggested computer please display map and locate central park south when the display screen popped up the holographic map highlighting the route eve only snarled i dont baby my tools which may be why theyre always breaking down on you as i was saying he continued before eve could snap at him the wifes going to love this justin young he used to play this stud on night falls isnt that a soap she shot him a glance what are you doing watching soaps hey i tune in the soap channel for a little relaxation like everybody anyway the wife was nuts about him he does the movie thing now she hardly goes a week without programming one of his movies on screen guys good too then theres jerry fitzgerald feeney smiled dreamily keep your little fantasies to yourself pal i tell you that girls built not like some of the models who have their bodies honed down to bone he made a sound like a man anticipating a large bowl of ice cream you know one of the best things about working with you recently dallas my charming ways and rapier wit oh sure he rolled his eyes its being able to go home and tell the wife who i interrogated today a billionaire a senator italian aristocrats film stars i tell you its done wonders for my prestige glad i could help she squeezed her battered police issue between a mini rolls and a vintage mercedes just try to control your awe while we do the third degree on the actor im a professional but he was grinning as he climbed out just look at this place howd you like to own a place in here then he chuckled and shifted his eyes away from the glossy faux marble facade of the lofty building oh i was forgetting this is slumming for you now kiss ass feeney come on kid loosen up he slung an arm around her shoulder as they headed toward the doors falling for the richest man in the known world isnt something to be ashamed of im not ashamed of it i just dont like to dwell on it the building was choice enough to have a live doorman as well as electronic security both eve and feeney flashed their badges and were admitted into a marble and gilt lobby accented with leafy ferns and exotic flowers in huge china pots ostentatious eve muttered see how jaded youre getting feeney moved out of range and approached the inner security screen lieutenant dallas and captain feeney for justin young one moment please the creamy computer voice paused while their identification was verified thank you for waiting mr young is expecting you please proceed to elevator three request your party enjoy your day chapter six so how do you want to play it feeney pursed his lips studied the tiny camera in the corner of the elevator on the way up the standard good cop bad cop funny how it always works civilians are easy marks lets start with the sorry to bother you appreciate your cooperation sort of thing if we get a sense hes playing games we can shift gears if we do i want to be the bad cop youre a lousy bad cop feeney face it he gave her a mournful look i outrank you dallas im primary and im better at bad cop live with it i always have to be the good cop he muttered as they stepped into a welllighted hallway with more marble more gilt justin young opened the opposing door with perfect timing and eve thought hed dressed for the part of the welltodo yet cooperative witness in casual expensive buff linen slacks and a drapey silk shirt of the same tone on his feet were trendy sandals with thick soles and intricate beading over the instep lieutenant dallas captain feeney his beautifully sculpted face was in serious lines the killer black eyes sober and a dramatic contrast to a wavy mane of hair the same color as the gilt in the hallway he offered a hand adorned with a wide ring studded with onyx please come in thank you for agreeing to see us so quickly mr young perhaps her eye had become jaded but eves initial scan of the room left her thinking overdone overwrought and overexpensive its such a tragedy such a horror he gestured them in toward a huge lshaped sofa jammed with pillows in wild colors and slick fabrics across the room a meditation screen was programmed to a tropical beach at sunset its almost impossible to believe she could be dead much less that she died in such a sudden and violent way were sorry to intrude feeney began prepping for his good cop role while he struggled not to gape at all the tassels and stained glass this must be a difficult time for you it is pandora and i were friends can i offer you something he sat elegant and slim in a wing chair that could have swallowed a small child no thank you eve tried to wiggle her way back among the mountain of cushions i will if you dont mind ive been living on little more than nerves since i heard the news leaning forward he pressed a small button on the table between them coffee please one settling back he smiled a little youll want to know where i was when she died ive done a number of police vehicles in my career played the cop the suspect even the victim in my early days with my image ive always been innocent he flicked a glance up as a domestic droid dressed eve noted with horrified amusement in the classic french maids uniform carried in a glass tray topped with a single cup and saucer justin took the cup from it used both hands to bring it to his lips the media hasnt stated exactly when pandora was killed but i believe i can give you my movements for the entire evening i was with her at a small party at her home until about midnight jerry and i jerry fitzgerald left together and went to have a drink at a nearby private club ennui its very in right now and it pays for both of us to be seen i imagine it was one or so when we left we considered doing a bit of club hopping but i confess wed both had enough to drink and enough socializing we came here stayed here together until about ten the next morning jerry had an assignment it wasnt until shed left and i was having my first cup of coffee that i turned on the news and heard about pandora that certainly covers the evening eve said hed recited it all she thought as though it was a wellstaged play well need to speak to ms fitzgerald to verify certainly would you like to do so now shes in the relaxation room pandoras death has left her a bit rattled lets let her relax a bit longer eve suggested you said you and pandora were friends were you lovers now and again nothing serious it was more that we ran in the same circles and to be brutally honest at such a time pandora preferred men who were easily dominated intimidated he flashed a smile as if to show he was neither she preferred affairs with those who were striving rather than those who had attained success she rarely enjoyed sharing the spotlight feeney picked up the rhythm who was she involved with romantically at the time of her death there were a few i believe someone i think shed met on starlight station an entrepreneur she called him but with a sarcastic tone this upandcoming designer jerry tells me is brilliant michelangelo puccini leonardo something of the kind paul redford the video producer who joined us that night he took a sip of his coffee then blinked leonardo yes it was leonardo there was some sort of tiff there a woman came by the house while we were there they fought over him an oldfashioned catfight it would have been amusing if it hadnt been so embarrassing for everyone involved he spread his elegant fingers looked mildly amused despite his statement well done eve thought well rehearsed good timing lines professionally punched it took paul and i both to separate them the woman came to pandoras home and attacked her physically eve asked in carefully neutral tones oh no not at all the poor thing was devastated pleading pandora called her a few vile names and hit her justin demonstrated by making a fist jerking it really socked her the woman was small but she was game scrambled right up and plowed in after that it was wrestling and hair pulling scratching the woman was bleeding some when she left pandora had lethal nails pandora scratched the womans face no though im sure she was going to have quite a bruise it was her neck as i recall four long nasty scratches on the side of the neck where pandora raked her the woman im afraid i dont know her name pandora just called her bitch and varieties of the same she was trying not to cry when she left and told pandora quite dramatically that pandora would be sorry for what shed done then im afraid she ruined her exit by sniffling and claiming that love conquers all it sounded just like mavis eve thought and after she left how did pandora behave she was furious overexcitable thats why jerry and i left early and paul redford he stayed i cant say how long with a sigh that signaled regret justin set his coffee aside its unfair to say anything negative about pandora when she cant defend herself but she was hard very often abrasive cross her and you paid and did you ever cross her mr young i was careful not to he smiled charmingly i enjoy my career and my looks lieutenant pandora was no threat to the first but id seen and heard of her doing some damage to faces when annoyed believe me she didnt wear her manicure like knives just for fashion she had enemies plenty of them most of whom were terrified of her i cant imagine who might have finally snapped and struck back at her and from the news reports ive heard i cant believe even pandora deserved to die so brutally we appreciate your candor mr young if its convenient wed like to speak with ms fitzgerald now alone he lifted a slim elegant brow yes of course no coordinating stories eve only smiled youve had plenty of time to do that already but wed like to speak to her alone she had the pleasure of seeing his smooth facade shaken a bit by her statement still he rose and walked toward a connecting corridor what do you think feeney muttered i think it was a hell of a performance were on wavelength there still if he and fitzgerald were ripping up the sheets all night it keeps him in the clear they alibi each other it keeps them both in the clear well get the security discs from building management check what time they came in see if they went out again i never trust those not since the deblass case if they diddled with the discs youll see it she glanced up at the sound of feeney sucking in his breath his hangdog face had gone terrier bright his eyes were glazed after a glimpse at jerry fitzgeralds entrance eve wondered why feeneys tongue wasnt hanging out she was built all right eve mused her lush breasts were barely covered with ivory silk that dipped nipple low clung then halted briefly a few millimeters below crotch level one long shapely leg was decorated beside the knee with a red rose in full bloom jerry fitzgerald was definitely blooming then there was the face soft and slumberous as though shed just climbed out of sex ebony hair was razor straight and curved to perfection framing a round feminine chin her mouth was full and wet and red her eyes dazzling blue and edged with spiky goldtipped lashes as she glided to a chair like some sort of pagan sex goddess eve patted feeneys leg in support and restraint ms fitzgerald eve began yes she said in a voice like sacrificial smoke those killer eyes barely flickered on eve before they latched like limpets on feeneys homely and dazed face captain its just so awful ive tried the isolation tank the mood elevator even programmed the hologram for meadow walks as that always relaxes me but nothing i do gets all of this out of my mind she fluttered lifted both hands to her unbelievable face i must look like a hag you look beautiful feeney babbled stunning you look get a grip eve muttered and jabbed him with an elbow we appreciate how upset you are ms fitzgerald pandora was a friend of yours jerry opened her mouth closed it smiled slyly i could tell you she was but youd find out quickly enough we werent friendly we tolerated each other as we were in the same business but frankly we couldnt stand one another she invited you into her home thats because she wanted justin to be there and were very close right now and pandora and i did socialize we even did a few projects together she rose either to show off the body or because she preferred to serve herself from a cabinet in the corner she took out a decanter in the shape of a swan and poured its sapphire blue contents into a glass let me say first that i am sincerely upset about the way she died its terrifying to think that anyone could hate so much i am in the same profession and as much in the public eye a kind of image as pandora was if it happened to her she broke off drank deeply it could happen to me one of the reasons im staying here with justin until its all resolved take me through your movements on the night she was killed jerrys eyes widened am i a suspect thats almost flattering she came back to the chair drink in hand after she sat she folded up her exquisite legs in a way that made feeney vibrate beside eve i never had the guts to do more than give her a few verbal shots half the time she didnt even know i was zinging her pandora wasnt exactly a mental giant and never understood subtlety all right then she sat back closed her eyes and told basically the same story as justin had though she had apparently tuned in more closely on the altercation between pandora and mavis i have to admit i was cheering her on the little one not pandora she had a style to her jerry mused odd memorable somewhere between a waif and an amazon she was trying to hold her own but pandora would have mopped the floor with her if justin and paul hadnt stopped it pandora was really strong she was always in the health club working on muscle tone i once saw her literally throw a fashion consultant across the room because the poor sap had mislabeled her accessories before a showing anyway she waved that off opened a drawer on the brass table beside her and located an enameled box she took out a glossy red cigarette lighted it blew out perfumed smoke anyway the woman started off trying to reason with pandora make some sort of a deal with her over leonardo hes a designer my take was leonardo and the waif were an item and pandora wasnt ready to cut him loose hes got a show coming up she smiled that cats smile again with pandora gone ill have to throw him my support you werent involved in the show before pandora was headlining i said pandora and i had done a few projects together a couple of videos her problem was she had looks even presence but when she had to read someone elses lines or try for charming on screen she was an oak wooden just awful but im good she paused to let more smoke stream through her lips really good and im concentrating on my acting work but stepping in on this show with this designer will be a nice boost for me mediawise that sounds callous sorry she shrugged its life her death comes at an opportune moment for you when i see an opportunity i take it i dont kill for it she moved her shoulders again that was more pandoras style now she leaned forward and her bodice gaped carelessly look lets not play games im clear i was with justin all night didnt see her after about midnight i can be honest tell you i couldnt stand her that she was certainly a professional rival and that i knew that shed have liked to lure justin away from me just for spite and maybe she could have done it i dont kill over men either she warmed feeney with a glance there are so many charming ones out there and the simple fact is you couldnt fit all the people who detested her into this apartment im just one of the crowd what was her mood on the night she died razzed and jazzed in a quick change of mood jerry threw back her head and laughed lustily i dont know what shed been knocking back but it sure as hell put a glint in her eye she was on fast forward ms fitzgerald feeney began in slow apologetic tones you believed pandora had ingested an illegal she hesitated a moment then moved her alabaster shoulders nothing legal makes you feel that good honey or that mean and she was feeling good and mean whatever it was she was chasing it with champagne by the bucketload were you and the other guests offered illegal substances while you were there eve asked she didnt invite me to share but then she knew i didnt use my bodys a temple she smiled as eves glance focused on her glass protein drink lieutenant pure protein and this she waved her slim cigarette veggie with a lace of perfectly legal calmer for my nerves ive watched a lot of the mighty fall taking a short fast trip im in for the long haul i allow myself three herbal smokes a day an occasional glass of wine no chemical stimulants no happy pills on the other hand she set her drink aside pandora was a champion user shed gulp down anything do you know the name of her supplier never thought to ask her just wasnt interested but at a guess id say this was something new ive never seen her so powered up and though it pains me to say it she looked better younger skin tone and texture she had well a glow on if i didnt know better id say shed had a full treatment but we both use paradise i know she wasnt in the salon that day because i was anyway i asked her and she just smiled and said shed found a new beauty secret and she was going to make a pile on it o o interesting feeney commented when he plopped back down in eves car we talked to two of the three people who last socialized with the victim neither of them could stand her they could have done it together eve mused fitzgerald knew leonardo wanted to work with him simplest thing in the world to alibi each other feeney tapped his pocket where hed slipped the security discs from the building well run these see what we find still seems to me were missing motive whoever took her out didnt just want to kill her they wanted to erase her weve got a powerful kind of rage here didnt seem to me either one of those two would work up a sweat push the right buttons everybody sweats i want to swing by zigzag see if we can start pinning down maviss moves and we need to contact the producer set up an interview can you put one of your drones on the car companies feeney i cant see our heroine taking the subway or a bus downtown to leonardos sure he took out his communicator if she took a cab or a private transpo service we should be able to nail it down in a couple hours good and lets see if she made the trip alone or if she had company o o zigzag didnt do much hopping in the middle of the day it lived for night the sunlight crowd were mostly tourists or the harried urban professionals who didnt much care if the decor looked tawdry and the service was surly the club was like a carnival that glittered at night and showed its age and its flaws in the harsh light of day still it maintained that underlying mystique that drew crowds of dreamers there was a steady drone of music which would be cranked up to earsplitting once the sun set the open twolevel structure was dominated by five bars and twin revolving dance floors that would begin their circuit at nine p m now they were still stacked one over the other the clear floors scarred from the beatings of nightly feet the lunch offerings ran to sandwiches and salads all named after dead rockers todays special was peanut butter and banana on white with a side of vidalia onions and jalapenos the elvis and joplin combo eve settled with feeney at the first bar ordered black coffee and sized up the bartender she was human rather than the usual droid in fact eve hadnt noticed any droids employed in the club you ever work the night shift eve asked her nope im a day worker the bartender set eves coffee on the bar she was the perky kind one who looked more like the front woman for a health food chain than a drink swiller at a club whos on the ten to three who notices people remembers them nobody around here notices people if they can help it eve took out her badge laid it on the bar would this clear somebodys memory couldnt say unconcerned she shrugged look this is a clean joint ive got a kid at home which is why i work days and why i was fussy about where i took a job i checked this place out through and through before i hooked up dennis he runs a friendly club which is why youve got servers with pulses instead of chips it might get a little wild but he keeps the lid on who is dennis and where do i find him his office is up the twisty stairs to your right behind the first bar he owns the place hey dallas we could take a minute for some eats feeney complained as he walked behind her the mick jagger sounded worth a try get him to go the bar wasnt open on this level but obviously dennis had been alerted a mirrored panel slid aside and he stood there a slight aestheticfaced man with a pointed red beard and a monks circle of raven black hair officers welcome to zigzag his voice was whisper quiet is there a problem wed like your help and cooperation mr dennis just dennis too many names are unwieldy he ushered them inside the carnival atmosphere ended at the threshold the office was spartan streamlined and quiet as a church my sanctuary he said well aware of the contrast one cant enjoy nor can one appreciate the pleasures of noise and crowds and tangling humanity unless one experiences its opposite please sit eve took a chance on a sternlooking straightbacked chair while feeney eased himself into its mate were trying to verify the movements of one of your customers last night for official reasons i see dennis sat behind a slab of highgloss plastic that served as his desk and the time after eleven before one open screen at his order a section of the wall slid open to reveal a viewer replay security scan five begin eleven p m the screen and the room erupted with sound and color and movement for an instant it dazzled the eye then eve focused it was an overview of the club in full swing a rather lordly view she mused as if the watcher soared quietly over the heads of the celebrants it suited dennis down to the ground he smiled judging her reaction delete audio abruptly silence descended now the movement seemed unworldly dancers gyrated on the circling floors lights flashed over their faces catching expressions intense joyful feral a couple at a corner table snarled at each other body action clearly demonstrating an argument in progress at another a mating ritual with soulful looks and intimate touches then she spotted mavis alone can you enhance eve rose jabbed a finger to the center left of the screen of course frowning eve watched mavis brought closer clearer it was according to the time display twentythree fortyfive there was a bruise already darkening under maviss eye and when she turned her head to brush off an advance the signs of raw scratches on her neck but not her face eve noted with a sinking heart the bright blue drape she wore was torn a bit at the shoulder but it was still attached she watched mavis flick off a couple of other men then a woman she downed her drink set the glass down beside a matching pair of empty ones on her table she listed a bit as she rose balanced herself then with the exaggerated dignity of the greatly impaired mavis elbowed her way through the crowd the time was twentyfour eighteen is that what you were looking for more or less disengage video dennis smiled the woman in question comes in the club from time to time she is usually more sociable enjoys dancing occasionally she will sing i find her a different sort of talent and certainly a crowd pleaser do you need her name i know who she is well then he rose i hope miss freestone isnt in any trouble she looked unhappy i can get a warrant for a copy of that disc or you can give me one dennis lifted a bright red eyebrow ill be happy to give you one computer copy disc and label is there anything else i can do for you no not at this time eve accepted the disc and slipped it into her bag thanks for your cooperation cooperation is the glue of life he said as the panel slid shut behind them weirdo feeney decided an efficient one you know mavis could have gotten into a tussle while she was club hopping she could have gotten her face scratched her clothes torn yeah determined to eat feeney stopped at an order table and requested a jagger to go you ought to put something in your system dallas besides worry and work im fine im not much on the club scene but if she had it in the back of her mind to go see leonardo shed have walked south and east from here lets check out what her most likely stop would have been fine just hold on he made her wait until his takeout slid through the serving slot he had the clear wrap off and the first bite in by the time they got to the car damn good stuff always did like jagger hell of a way to live forever she started to request a map when her car link beeped signaling incoming transmission lab report she murmured and focused on the screen oh goddamn it hell dallas this is a mess appetite gone feeney stuffed the sandwich in his pocket both of them fell into silence the report was very clear it was maviss skin and only maviss under the victims nails maviss prints and only maviss on the murder weapon and it was her blood and only hers mixed with the victims on scene the link beeped again and this time a face appeared on screen prosecuting attorney jonathan heartly lieutenant dallas acknowledged were issuing an arrest warrant for freestone mavis charge of murder second degree please hold for transmission didnt waste any time feeney grumbled chapter seven she wanted to do it alone had to do it alone she could count on feeney to work on ferreting out any details that might weaken the case against mavis but the job had to be done and she had to do it herself still she was glad when roarke opened the door i can see it in your face and he took her face in his hands im sorry eve i have a warrant i have to take her in book her theres nothing else i can do i know come here he gathered her close held her as she burrowed her face in his shoulder well find the piece of this that clears her eve nothing ive found nothing roarke helps her everything makes it worse the evidence its all there the motives there the timing she drew back if i didnt know her i wouldnt have a doubt but you do know her shes going to be scared frightened herself eve looked up the stairs toward where mavis would be waiting the pas office told me they wouldnt block bail but still shes going to need roarke i hate to ask you you dont have to ive already contacted the best criminal defense team in the country i cant pay you back for that eve i dont mean the money she took a shuddering breath and gripped both of his hands you dont really know her but you believe in her because i do thats what i cant pay you back for i have to go get her you want to do it alone he understood and had already convinced himself not to argue the point ill alert her lawyers what are the charges murder two ill have to deal with the media its certainly going to leak that mavis and i have history she pulled her hands through her disordered hair that may bleed over onto you do you think that worries me she nearly smiled no i guess not this may take awhile ill bring her back as soon as i can eve he murmured as she started up the stairs she believes in you too theres good reason for it i hope youre right bracing herself she continued up walked slowly down the corridor to maviss room and knocked come on in summerset i told you id come down for the cake oh surprised mavis leaned back from the computer where shed been struggling to write a new song to cheer herself up shed worn a skin suit of bright sapphire and had dyed her hair to match i thought it was summerset and cake yeah he buzzed in and told me the cook had baked a triple chocolate fudge cake summerset knows ive got this weakness i know the two of you dont get along but hes really sweet to me thats because he keeps imagining you naked whatever works she began to tap her tricolored nails on the console in a quick nervous tattoo anyway hes been great i guess if he thought i had my eye on roarke itd be different hes like totally devoted youd think roarke was his first and only born or something instead of his boss thats the only reason he gives you grief well and you being a cop doesnt help i think summerset has this block about cops she broke off trembled visibly im sorry dallas im babbling im so scared you found leonardo didnt you somethings really really wrong hes hurt isnt he hes dead no hes not hurt eve crossed the room and sat on the foot of the bed he came into the cop shop this morning he had a cut on his arm thats all the two of you had pretty much the same idea last night he got tanked and headed for your place ended up cutting his arm on an empty bottle he dropped before he keeled he was drunk mavis sprang up at that he hardly ever drinks he knows he cant he told me how he does things he cant remember if he drinks too much it scares him and to my place she said eyes softening thats so sweet then he came to see you because he couldnt find me he came to see me to confess to the murder of pandora mavis reared back as if eve had struck her thats impossible leonardo wouldnt hurt anyone hes just not capable of it he was just trying to protect me he didnt know anything about your involvement at that time he believes he must have argued with pandora fought with her then killed her well thats absolutely wrong so the evidence indicates eve rubbed her weary eyes kept her fingers pressed there for a moment the cut on his arm came from a piece of the broken bottle none of his blood was found at the scene none of pandoras was on the clothes hed been wearing we havent pinned down his movements precisely as yet but we dont have anything on him mavis missed a beat caught up oh then its all right you didnt believe him i havent decided that but the evidence at this point keeps him clear thank god mavis slid down onto the bed beside eve when can i see him dallas leonardo and i have to work things out between us that may take a little time eve squeezed her eyes shut opened them again made herself look at mavis i have to ask you for a favor the biggest anyones ever asked you is it going to hurt yeah eve watched maviss attempt at a smile fade away i have to ask you to trust me to take care of you to believe that im so good at my job that nothing however small will get past me i have to ask you to remember youre my closest friend and that i love you maviss breath started to jerk her eyes stayed dry burning dry the saliva evaporated from her mouth youre going to arrest me the lab reports came in she caught maviss hands held them hard in hers they werent a surprise because i knew someone had set things up i was expecting this mavis i hoped i could find something anything before it did but i havent been able to feeneys working on it too hes the best mavis trust me here and roarkes already lined up the top defense lawyers known to man its just procedure you have to arrest me for murder its murder two thats a small break i know it doesnt sound like one but the pas office isnt going to try to block bail ill have you back here eating cake in a few hours but her mind was replaying one segment over and over its murder two its murder two you have to put me in a cage eves lungs were burning and the sensation was rapidly moving toward her heart not for long i swear it feeneys working right now to get the preliminary hearing up and running hes got plenty of markers he can pull in by the time weve got you through booking youll have the hearing the judge will set bail and youll be back here wearing an ident alarm to track her movements eve thought trapped in the house to avoid the stalking media the cage would be plush and friendly but it would still be a cage you make it sound easy its not going to be easy but itll be easier if you remember youve got a couple of top cops on your side dont waive any of your rights okay any of them and once we start this you wait for your lawyers dont say anything to me you dont have to say dont say anything to anyone understand me all right mavis drew her hands away rose lets get it over with o o hours later when it was done eve stepped back into the house the lights were low she hoped mavis had taken the tranq eve had recommended and gone to sleep eve already knew she wouldnt do the same she knew feeney would have followed her request to pass mavis personally over to roarke there had been other work to do the press conference had been particularly hideous as expected questions about her friendship with mavis had been brought up conflict of interest hinted at she owed the commander a great deal for the appearance hed put in and his statement of absolute faith in his primary investigator the one on one with nadine furst had been a little easier all you had to do eve thought glumly as she climbed the stairs was save a persons life and they were happy to take your side the blood lust for the story might have been in nadines heart but so was a sense of debt mavis would get fair treatment from channel then eve had done something she had never believed she would do she had voluntarily called the police psychiatrist and made an appointment to talk with dr mira could still cancel it she reminded herself and rubbed her gritty eyes probably will cancel it youre quite late lieutenant after an eventful day she dropped her hands and saw summerset step silently out of a room to her right he was as usual dressed in his stiff black his stern face set in disapproving lines hating her seemed to be something he did with almost as much seamless skill as he ran the household dont hassle me summerset he stepped directly into her path i had believed though you have countless flaws you were at least a competent investigator i see now you are not any more than you are a competent friend to one who depended on you you really think after what ive been through tonight that you can say anything to touch me i dont believe anything touches you lieutenant youre without loyalty and that makes you nothing less than nothing maybe youve got a suggestion of how i could have handled it maybe i should have had roarke fire up one of his jetstars and shoot mavis off planet to some remote little hideaway then she could be on the run for the rest of her life at least then she might not have wept herself to sleep the arrow pierced directly under the heart where it had been aimed pain shimmered through fatigue get out of my way you bastard and keep out of my way she shoved by him but stopped herself from running she walked into the master bedroom just as roarke was replaying her press conference on screen you did well here he said and rose under tremendous pressure yeah im a real pro she walked into the bathroom then stood staring at herself in the mirror she saw a woman pale face dark shadowed eyes grim mouth and she saw beyond it to helplessness youre doing everything you can roarke said quietly from behind her you got her good lawyers ordering water cold she leaned down splashed it liberally over her face they juggled me through interview i was tough gotta be tough but theyve got some moves on them next time ive got to grill a friend ill be sure to sign them up he watched her bury her face in a towel whens the last time youve eaten she merely shook her head the question had no relevance the reporters were out for blood someone like mes very juicy game couple of highprofile cases i come out on top some of them would just love to see me take it between the eyes think of the ratings mavis doesnt blame you eve i blame me she exploded heaving the towel aside i blame me goddamn it i told her to trust me i told her id take care of things how did i take care of it roarke i arrested her i booked her prints mug shots voice ident all of it on file now i put her through a horrible twohour interview i locked her in a cell until the lawyers you hired for her got her out on bail you posted i hate myself she broke simply broke covering her face with her hands she began to sob its about time you let go briskly he scooped her into his arms and carried her up to the bed youll feel better for it he kept her cradled in his arms stroked her hair whenever she cried he thought it was a storm a passionate tumult rarely were there a few easy quiet tears for eve rarely was anything easy for eve this isnt helping she managed yes it is youll purge some of that misplaced guilt and some of the grief youre entitled to youll think more clearly tomorrow she was down to shuddering breaths and a raging headache i have to work tonight im going to run some names and scenarios for probability no he thought quite calmly she wont take a minute get something to eat before she could protest he was shifting her aside and moving to the autochef even your admirable system needs fuel and theres a story i want to tell you i cant waste time it wont be wasted fifteen minutes she thought as the scent of something glonous wafted toward her lets make it a quick meal and a short story okay she rubbed at her eyes not sure if she was ashamed or relieved to have let the cork pop and spew out the tears sorry i blubbered on you im always available for blubbering he came toward her with a steaming omelette and a cup he sat down stared into her swollen exhausted eyes i adore you she flushed it seemed he was the only one who could bring embarrassed color to her cheeks youre trying to distract me she took the plate and a fork that kind of stuff always does and i can never get my tongue around what i should say back she sampled the eggs maybe something like youre the best thing that ever happened to me thatll do she lifted the cup started to sip then scowled this isnt coffee its tea for a change a soothing blend i imagine youre overloaded on caffeine maybe because the eggs were fabulous and she didnt have the energy to argue she took a sip its nice okay whats the story youve wondered why i keep summerset even when hes less than solicitous to you she snorted you mean even though he hates my fucking guts your business our business he corrected anyway i dont want to hear about him right now its actually more about me and an incident that you might find correlates with what youre feeling right now he watched her drink again calculated he had just enough time to tell the tale when i was very young and still in dublin on the street i hooked up with a man and his daughter the little girl was well an angel gold and rose with the sweetest smile on either side of heaven they ran confidence games superbly short cons for the most part bilking foolish marks and making a reasonable living at that time i was doing somewhat the same myself but i liked variety and enjoyed picking pockets and organizing floating games my father was still alive when i met summerset though he didnt go by that name then and his daughter marlena so he was a con she said between bites i knew there was something shifty about him he was quite brilliant i learned a lot from him and i like to think he from me in any case after one particularly enthusiastic beating from my dear old da he happened to find me unconscious in an alley he took me in he took care of me there was no money for a doctor and i didnt have a medical card what i did have was a few broken ribs a concussion and a fractured shoulder im sorry the image brought back others ones that dried up the spit in her mouth life sucks it did summerset was a man of many talents he had some medical training he often used an mt disguise in his work i wouldnt go so far as to say he saved my life i was young and strong and used to it but he certainly kept me from suffering needlessly you owe him eve set the empty plate aside i understand its all right no thats not it i owed him i paid him back there were times he owed me after my father met his unmourned end we became partners again i wouldnt say he raised me i took care of myself but he gave me what might be considered a family i loved marlena the daughter she had to shake her head to clear it id forgotten hard to picture that dried up old fart as a father where is she shes dead she was fourteen i was sixteen wed been together more or less for about six years one of my gambling projects was turning a tidy profit and it came to the attention and the disapproval of a small particularly violent syndicate they felt i was cutting into their territory i felt i was carving out my own they threatened i was arrogant enough to ignore them once or twice they tried to get their hands on me to teach me respect i imagine but i was difficult to catch and i was gaining power even prestige i was certainly making money enough that between us we were able to buy a small very decent flat and somewhere along the way marlena fell in love with me he paused looking down at his own hands remembering regretting i cared for her a great deal but not as a lover she was beautiful and unbelievably innocent despite the life we led i didnt think of her romantically but as a man because i was a man already might think of a perfect piece of art romantically never sexually she had different ideas and one night she came into my room and rather sweetly and terrifyingly offered herself to me i was appalled furious and scared to the bones because i was a man and therefore tempted his lifted his gaze to eves again and there was storm in them i was cruel to her eve and sent her away shattered she was a child and i devastated her ive never forgotten the look on her face she trusted me believed in me and i by doing what was right betrayed her the way i betrayed mavis the way youre thinking you did but theres more she left the house that night summerset and i didnt know she was gone until the next day the next morning when the men who wanted me sent word that they had her they sent back the clothes shed been wearing and there was blood on them for the first time in my life and the last i saw summerset unable to function i would have given them anything they demanded done anything i would have traded myself for her without hesitation just as you if you could would trade places with mavis now yes eve set the empty cup aside woozily id do anything sometimes anything comes too late i contacted them told them we would negotiate begged them not to hurt her but they had already hurt her they had raped her and tortured her this delightful fourteenyearold girl who had found so much joy in life and who was just beginning to feel what women feel within hours of that first contact her body was dumped on my doorstep they had used her as no more than a means to an end to make a point to a competitor an upstart she wasnt even human to them and there was nothing i could do to go back and change what had happened it wasnt your fault she reached out and took his hands im sorry so sorry but it wasnt your fault no it wasnt it took me years to believe that to understand and accept that summerset never blamed me eve he could have she was his life and she had suffered and died because of me but he never once blamed me she sighed closed her eyes she knew what he was telling her by repeating a tale that had to be a nightmare for him to relive neither was she to blame you couldnt stop what happened you could only control what happened after the way i can only do everything i can to find the answers wearily she opened her eyes again what did happen after roarke i hunted down the men who had done it and i killed them in as slow and as painful a method as i could devise he smiled we each have our own way of finding solutions and justice eve vigilantism isnt justice not for you but youll find the solution and justice for mavis no one doubts it i cant let her stand trial her head lolled she snapped it back i have to find i need to go she couldnt even lift her weighted arm to her head damn it roarke damn it that was a tranq go to sleep he murmured and gently unhooked her weapon harness and set it aside lie back inducing chemicals on unknowing people is a violation of she slipped deeper barely felt him unbutton her shirt arrest me in the morning he suggested he undressed her then himself before slipping into bed beside her just sleep now she slept but even there dreams chased her chapter eight she did not wake up cheerful she did wake alone which was probably a wise move on roarkes part but she didnt surface with a smile there were no aftereffects from the tranq which made him a very lucky man she woke alert refreshed and pissed the electronic memo beeping its red light on the nightstand didnt improve the mood nor did roarkes smooth voice when she engaged it good morning lieutenant hope you slept well if youre up before eight youll find me in the breakfast nook i didnt want to disturb you by ordering up you looked so peaceful not for long she said between gritted teeth she managed to shower dress and strap on her weapon in ten minutes flat the breakfast nook as he charmingly called it was a huge sunny atrium off the kitchen not only was roarke there but so was mavis both of them beamed blindingly as eve strode in were going to get a couple things straight here roarke your colors back pleased with himself he rose and nipped a kiss onto the tip of her nose that gray cast to your skin didnt suit you then he grunted as her fist jammed into his stomach he cleared his throat manfully your energy levels obviously up too want coffee i want you to know that if you ever pull a stunt like that again ill she trailed off narrowed her eyes at mavis what are you grinning at its fun to watch you two are so tipped over each other so tipped hes going to end up on his back checking out the ceiling if he doesnt watch out but she continued to study mavis baffled you look fine she decided i am i had a good cry a big bag of swiss chocolates and then i stopped feeling sorry for myself ive got the numberone cop in the city working on my side the best team of lawyers a billionaire can buy and a guy who loves me see i figured out that when this is all over and its going to work out ill be able to look back on it as kind of an adventure and with all the media attention my careers going to soar reaching up she took eves hand and tugged her down on the padded bench im not scared anymore not willing to take the words to heart eve looked hard and long into maviss eyes youre really not youre really okay i can see it im fine now i thought about it and thought about it when it all shakes down its pretty simple i didnt kill her youll find out who did and when you do itll all be over until then i get to live in this incredible house eat incredible food she forked up a last bite of a paperthin crepe and have my name and face splashed all over the media thats one way of looking at it uneasy eve rose to program coffee for herself mavis i dont want you to worry or be upset but this isnt going to be a glide through the park im not stupid dallas i didnt mean youre thinking im not aware of the worst that could happen i am but i just dont believe the worst is going to happen from now on im thinking positive and im giving you that favor you asked me to give you yesterday okay weve got a lot of work to do i want you to concentrate try to remember details any detail no matter how small or insignificant whats this she demanded as roarke set a bowl in front of her your breakfast its oatmeal exactly she frowned at it why cant i have one of those crepes you can after you eat your oatmeal eyes hot she shoveled in a mouthful were really going to talk you guys are great together im really glad ive had this chance to see it up close and personal not that i didnt think it was great all along but mostly i was just jazzed that dallas had landed a rich one mavis beamed at roarke thats what friends are for yeah but its so mag the way you keep her in line nobody ever could before shut up mavis you think and think hard but you dont tell me anything until youve cleared it with your lawyers they already advised me of that i figure its going to work just like it does when im trying to remember a name or where i put something you stop thinking about it start doing other stuff then zip it pops into your head so im doing other stuff and the big one is the wedding leonardo said you need to do your first fitting very soon leonardo eve all but lunged out of the chair youve been talking to leonardo the lawyers cleared it they think its a good thing for us to resume our relationship it adds a sympathy and romance factor in the public awareness mavis leaned an elbow on the table and began to toy with the trio of earrings shed hung in her left lobe you know they only ditched the truth detection test and hypnosis because they cant be sure what ill remember they mostly believe me but they cant take chances but they said seeing leonardo is cool so we need to set up that fitting i dont have time to think about fittings christ jesus mavis you think im going to fuss with designs and flowers now im not getting married until this is cleared up roarke understands that roarke took out a cigarette studied it no he doesnt now listen no you listen mavis stood up her bright blue hair glinting in the sunlight im not letting this mess screw up something this important to me pandora did her best to fuck with my life and leonardos and she did worse by dying she is not going to fuck with this these plans are not on hold dallas and you just better make time in your schedule for the fitting she couldnt argue not with the sheen of tears in maviss eyes okay fine great ill deal with the stupid dress its not a stupid dress its going to be a sensational dress thats what i meant better she sniffed sat when can i tell him well get together for it ah listen its better for your case and your fancy lawyers would back me up if you and i arent seen running around together primary investigator and defendant it doesnt look good you mean i cant mavis shut her mouth regrouped all right then we wont go running around together leonardo can work here roarke wont mind will you on the contrary he took a satisfied drag on his cigarette i think its a perfect solution one big happy family eve mumbled the primary the defendant and the tenant of the murder scene who also happens to be the victims former lover and the defendants current are you all insane whos to know roarke has excellent security and if theres even the smallest chance that things could go wrong i want to spend whatever time i can with leonardo mavis set her mouth in a stubborn pout so thats what im going to do ill have summerset arrange for a work space thanks we appreciate it while you people orchestrate your mad tea party ive got a murder to solve roarke winked at mavis and called after eve as she stormed away what about your crepe stuff it shes crazy about you mavis commented its almost embarrassing the way she fawns want another crepe mavis patted her stomach why the hell not o o a downed circuit at ninth and fiftysixth played hell with street traffic both pedestrians and drivers ignored the noise pollution laws and honked shouted and buzzed out their frustrations eve would have rolled up her windows to cut the din but her temperature controls were on the fritz again to add to the fun mother nature had decided to body slam new york with a humature of a hundred and ten to pass the time eve watched the heat waves dance up from the concrete at this rate more than a few computer chips were going to fry by noon she considered taking to the air though her control panel seemed to have developed a mind of its own but several other harried drivers had already done so the traffic overhead was in a nasty snarl a couple of oneman traffic copters were trying to deal with it and instead added to the mess with the bee swarm buzz of their blades and the irritating drone of voices she caught herself snarling at the i love new york hologram sticker on the bumper jammed in front of hers the sanest idea she decided was to get some work done in her car peabody she ordered the link and after a few frustrating hisses of static it engaged peabody homicide dallas here im going to pick you up in front of the cop shop west side eta fifteen minutes yes sir bring all files pertinent to the johannsen case and the pandora case and be she trailed off and squinted at the screen why is it so quiet in there peabody arent you in the bull pen only a couple of us made it in this morning theres a bad traffic snag on ninth eve scanned the sea of traffic is that a fact it pays to listen to the traffic network in the morning she added i took an alternate route shut up peabody eve muttered and broke transmission she spent the next couple of minutes retrieving messages from her desk link then set up a morning appointment at paul redfords office in midtown for an interview she called the lab to harass them for the toxicology report on pandora got the runaround and left them with a creative threat she was debating whether to call feeney and nag him when she saw a narrow break in the wall of cars she jogged forward cut left squeezed through ignoring the rude blast of horns and spearing middle fingers praying her vehicle would cooperate she punched vertical rather than spring up she wavered but she did rise the minimum ten feet she swerved right nipped by a jammed people glide where she caught the blur of miserable sweaty faces and rattled over to seventh while her control panel warned of overload after five blocks the car was wheezing but shed cleared the worst of the jam she set down with a teethrattling thud and swung toward the west entrance of cop central the dependable peabody was waiting how the woman managed to look cool and unperturbed in her sweltering blues eve didnt want to know your vehicle sounds a little rough lieutenant peabody commented when she climbed in really i didnt notice you sound a little rough yourself sir when eve merely bared her teeth and started to cut across town to fifth peabody dug into her kit took out a small portafan and clipped it to the dash the blast of cool air nearly made eve whimper thanks the temperature control on this model isnt dependable peabodys face remained smooth and bland but you probably havent noticed youve got a clever mouth peabody i like that about you give me a rundown on johannsen the labs still having trouble with all the elements in the powder we found theyre stalling if theyve completely analyzed the formula theyre not saying the buzz i get from a contact i have is illegals is demanding priority so theres some politicking going on second search found no trace of chemicals illegal or otherwise in the victims body so he wasnt using eve mused boomer tended to sample but he had himself a big fat bag of shit and didnt take a taste what does that tell you peabody from the state of his flop and the statement of the lobby droid we know he had the time and opportunity to use it he had a history of chronic if mild abuse therefore my deduction would be he knew or suspected something about the substance that put him off that would be my guess what do you get from casto he claims to be in the dark on this one hes been cooperative if not overly forthcoming with information and theories something in the tone had eve glancing over he coming on to you peabody peabody kept her eyes straight forward narrowed slightly under the bowlcut fringe of bangs he hasnt exhibited any inappropriate behavior cut the drill pal thats not what i asked color snuck up under the collar of the standardissue blues into her cheeks hes indicated a certain personal interest jesus you sound like a cop is this certain personal interest reciprocated it might be considered if i didnt suspect the subject had a much more personal interest in my immediate superior peabody slid her gaze to eves hes got a thing for you well hell have to keep his thing to himself but she couldnt make herself completely displeased to hear it my certain personal interests lie elsewhere hes a powerful looking sonofabitch isnt he my tongue gets all swelled up in my mouth when he looks at me hmm eve ran her own around her teeth experimentally so go for it im not prepared to become involved in a romantic relationship at this point hell who said anything about relationship screw each other blind a couple times i prefer affection and companionship in sexual encounters peabody said stiffly sir yeah it does make a difference eve sighed it was almost a painful effort to keep her mind from leapfrogging back to mavis but she tried to focus i was just ragging on you peabody i know what its like when youre standing there trying to do your job and some guy hits you between the eyes im sorry if youre uncomfortable working with him but i need you its not a problem loosening up peabody smiled and its not exactly a sacrifice to look at him she glanced up as eve swung toward the underground parking beneath a spearing white tower on fifth isnt this one of roarkes buildings most of them are the electronic attendant scanned her vehicle and passed it through this is his main office its also the new york base of redford productions ive got an interview with him re the pandora homicide eve slipped into the vip spot roarke had arranged for her shut down her car youre not officially attached to this case but youre officially attached to me feeneys up to his ass in data and i want another set of eyes and ears objections none come to mind lieutenant dallas eve reminded her as they stepped from the car the safety barrier blinked on surrounding the car to protect it from dings scratches and theft as if eve thought sourly it didnt already have so many dings and scratches a thief would insult himself by looking twice she strode up to the private executive elevator entered her code and tried not to be embarrassed saves time she muttered peabodys eyes widened as they stepped onto thick carpeting the car was large enough for a party of six and boasted a lush arrangement of fragrant hibiscus im all for saving time thirtyfifth floor eve requested redford productions executive offices floor threefive the computer acknowledged east quadrant executive level pandora had a small party on the night she died eve began redford might be the last person to have seen her alive jerry fitzgerald and justin young also attended but left early after mavis freestone and pandora fought they alibi each other for the rest of the night redford remained with pandora for a time if fitzgerald and young are telling the truth theyre in the clear i know mavis is telling the truth she waited a beat but peabody made no comment so we see what we can shake out of the producer the elevator smoothly shifted to horizontal gliding east the doors opened and noise poured in obviously redfords employees liked music with their daily grind it rocked out of recessed speakers filled the air with energy two men and a woman worked at a wide circular console chatting cheerfully into links beaming at computer screens there appeared to be a small party in progress in the waiting area to the right several people milled around drinking from small cups or nibbling on tiny pastries the sound of tinkling laughter and cocktail hour conversation underscored the lively music its like a scene from one of his movies peabody said hooray for hollywood eve approached the console and took out her badge she chose the least obsessively pert of the three receptionists lieutenant dallas i have an appointment with mr redford yes lieutenant the man or he might have been a god with his perfectly chiseled golden looks smiled brilliantly ill tell him youre here please help yourself to some refreshments want to chow down peabody those pastries look pretty good we could cop some on the way out our minds are in tune mr redford would love to see you now lieutenant the modernday apollo lifted a section of the console slipped through just let me take you to him he led them through smoked glass doors where the noise switched to clashing voices on either side of the corridor doors were open and men and women sat at desks paced or reclined on sofas wheeling and dealing how many times have i heard that plot line jt its so first millennium we need a fresh face garboesque with little bo peep innocence people dont want depth honeypot give em a choice between the ocean and a puddle theyre going to splash in the puddle were all children they approached a pair of double doors in sparkling silver the guide opened them both with a dramatic sweep your guests mr redford thank you caesar caesar eve muttered i was so close lieutenant dallas paul redford rose from behind a ushaped workstation in the same glittery silver as his doors the floor he crossed was smooth as glass and decorated with swirls of color behind him was the expected spectacular view of the city his hand clasped eves with easy practiced warmth thank you so much for agreeing to come here im juggling meetings all day and its so much more convenient for me than coming to you its not a problem my aide officer peabody the smile as smooth and practiced as the handshake encompassed them both please sit down what can i offer you just information eve glanced at the seating arrangement blinked they were all animals chairs stools sofas all fashioned to resemble tigers hounds or giraffes my first wife was a decorator he explained after the divorce i decided to keep them theyre the best memory of that time in my life he chose a basset hound for himself propped his feet up on a cushion shaped like a curled cat you want to talk about pandora yes if theyd been lovers as reported eve decided hed gotten over his grief quickly a police interview apparently didnt affect him either he was composed the genial host in a fivethousanddollar linen suit and meltedbutter italian loafers he was eve mused undoubtedly as screen friendly as any of the actors he worked with a strong bony face the color of fresh honey was accented with a welltrimmed glossy moustache his dark hair was slicked back and twisted into a complicated queue that dangled to his shoulder blades he looked eve decided like what he was a successful producer who enjoyed his power and wealth id like to record this mr redford id prefer that lieutenant he leaned back into the embrace of the sadeyed hound and folded his hands on his stomach i heard youve made an arrest in this matter we have but the investigation is ongoing you were acquainted with the deceased known as pandora well acquainted i was considering a project with her certainly had socialized with her on a number of occasions over the years and when it was convenient had sex with her were you and the victim lovers at the time of her death we were never lovers lieutenant we had sex we did not make love in fact i doubt there was a man alive who ever made love to her or attempted to if he did he was a fool im not a fool you didnt like her like her redford laughed god no she was the singularly most dislikable human being ive ever known but she did have talent not as much as she believed and none at all in certain areas and yet he lifted his elegant hands rings sparkled dark stones in heavy gold beauty is easy lieutenant some are born with it others buy it an attractive physical shell is moronically simple to come by today its still desired pleasing looks never fade from fashion but in order to make a living from those looks a person has to have talent and pandoras was an aura a power an elemental even animalistic ability to exude sex sex has always will always sell eve inclined her head only now we license it amused redford flashed her a smile the government needs its revenue but i wasnt referring to the selling of sex but of using it to sell and we do everything from soft drinks to kitchen appliances and fashion he added always fashion and that was pandoras particular specialty you could drape her in kitchen curtains point her toward a runway and reasonably intelligent people would open their credit accounts wide to have that look she was a saleswoman there was nothing she couldnt peddle she wanted to act which was unfortunate she could never be anyone but herself but pandora but you were working on a project with her i was considering one where she would essentially play herself nothing more nothing less it may have worked and the merchandizing from it well thats where the profits would have poured in it was still in the planning stages you were at her home the night she died yes she wanted company and i suspect wanted to rub jerrys nose in the idea of starring in one of my films and how did ms fitzgerald take it she was surprised irritated i imagine i was irritated myself as we were far from ready to go public we might have had an interesting scene over it but we were interrupted the young woman the fascinating young woman who arrived on the doorstep the one youve arrested he said with a gleam in his eye the media claim youre very close friends why dont you just tell me what happened when ms freestone arrived melodrama action violence picture this he said and moved his hands to form the ageold sign for a screen the young brave beauty comes to plead her case shes been weeping her face is pale her eyes desperate she will step aside give up the man both of them want to protect him to do whats best for his career close up on pandora her face is filled with rage disdain a manic energy christ the beauty its almost evil she wont be satisfied with sacrifice she wants her opponent to feel pain emotional pain first by the cruel names she hurls then physical pain by striking the first blow now you have the classic struggle two women locked in combat over a man the younger woman has love on her side but even that isnt a match for the strength of pandoras vengeance or her sharpened nails fur shall we say flies until the two male members of our fascinated audience step in one of them is bitten for his pains redford winced and rubbed his right shoulder pandora sank her fangs into me as i was dragging her off i have to say i was tempted to punch her myself your friend left she tossed off some typical cliche about pandora being sorry but she looked more miserable than vindictive and pandora energized and so was he with the telling of the tale shed been in a dangerous mood all evening and it was only more treacherous after the bout jerry and justin bowed out with more dispatch than grace and i stayed behind awhile to try to bring pandora down did you succeed i didnt come close she was wild then she threatened all manner of absurdities she was going to go after the little bitch and rip her face off she was going to castrate leonardo by the time she was finished he wouldnt be able to peddle buttons on the street corner not even beggars were going to wear his rags and so on after about twenty minutes i gave it up she was furious with me then for cutting the evening short and shouted a lot of abuse after me she didnt need me she had bigger deals better deals you claim to have left her at about twelve thirty that would be close and she was alone she only kept domestic droids she didnt like people around unless she summoned them there was no one else in the house to my knowledge where did you go when you left i came here tended to my shoulder it was a nasty bite i thought id do a little work made some calls to the coast then i went to my club used the afterhours entrance and spent a couple of hours having a steam a swim what time did you get to your club id say it was around two i know it was well past four when i got home did you see or speak to anyone during the hours of two and five a m no one of the reasons i often use the club at those hours is for the privacy i have my own facilities on the coast but here i have to make do with membership the name of your club the olympus on madison he arched a brow i see my alibi isnt without its problems i did however code in and out its required im sure it is and she would certainly see if he had are you aware of anyone who would have wished pandora harm lieutenant the list would be as long as life he smiled again perfect teeth eyes that were both amused and predatory i dont happen to count myself among them merely because she didnt matter that much to me did you share pandoras latest drug of choice he stiffened hesitated then relaxed again that was an excellent ploy non sequiturs often catch the unwary off guard ill state for the record that i never touch illegals of any kind but his smile was wide and easy and told her quite plainly he lied i was aware that pandora dabbled now and again i considered it her own business id have to agree that shed found something new something she seemed to be overdoing in fact id come into her bedroom earlier that last evening he paused a moment as if thinking back bringing a scene into focus shed taken a pill of some kind out of a small beautiful little wooden box chinese i think the box he added with a quick smile she was surprised because i was early and shoved the box into a drawer on her vanity and locked it i asked what she was protecting and she said he paused again eyes narrowed what did she say her treasure her fortune no no something like her reward yes im sure thats what she said then she popped the pill chased it with champagne then we had sex it seemed to me she was distracted at first then suddenly she was wild insatiable i dont believe it had ever been quite that potent between us we dressed and went down jerry and justin were just arriving i never asked her any more about it it just didnt apply to me o o impressions peabody hes slick sos slime eve shoved her hands into her pockets as the elevator descended toyed with loose credit tokens he despised her but he slept with her was willing to use her i think he found her pathetic potentially dangerous but marketable and if that marketability had waned or the danger increased could he have killed her in a heartbeat peabody stepped into the garage first conscience isnt his priority if this deal they had were tipping the wrong way or if she had anything to pressure him with hed erase her people that smug that controlled tend to have a lot of violence bubbling somewhere and his alibi sucks yeah it does doesnt it the possibilities made eve grin were going to check that out right after we go by pandoras and find her cache inform dispatch she ordered make sure were clear to pop locks that wouldnt stop you peabody murmured but engaged the link o o the box was gone it was such a stunning letdown that eve stood in pandoras lavishly ornate bedroom staring down at the drawer for a full ten seconds before it fully registered it was empty this is a vanity right thats what they call it look at all the bottles and pots on it creams for this creams for that thats why its called a vanity she couldnt help herself peabody picked up ajar the size of the first joint of her thumb ever young cream you know what this shit goes for dallas five hundred over the counter at saks five hundred for a lousy half ounce talk about vanity she set it down again ashamed shed been tempted even for an instant to stick it in her pocket you add all this stuff up shes got ten maybe fifteen thousand worth of enhancements get a grip peabody yes sir sorry were looking for a box the sweepers have already done the standard here taken in the discs from her links we know she didnt get any calls that night or make any from here anyway shes pissed shes revved what does she do eve continued to open drawers paw through them as she spoke she drinks more maybe rants around the house thinking of all the things shed like to do to the people whove ticked her off bastards bitches who the hell do they think they are she can have anything and anyone she wants maybe she comes in here and pops another pill just to keep the energy up hopeful though it was a plain enameled box rather than an ornate wooden one eve flipped a lid inside was an assortment of rings gold silver gleaming porcelain carved ivory funny place to keep jewelry peabody commented i mean shes got this big glass chest here for her costume and the safe for the real stuff eve glanced up saw her aide was perfectly serious and didnt quite muffle the laugh theyre not exactly jewelry peabody cock rings you know you put them over it then sure peabody shrugged tried not to stare i knew that just a funny place to keep them yeah sure is silly to keep sex toys in a box next to the bed anyway where was i shes using chasing the pills with champagne somebodys going to pay for ruining her evening that fucker leonardo is going to crawl hes going to beg shell make him pay for screwing some worthless slut behind her back and for letting the little bitch come around to her house her house goddamn it and fuck with her eve closed a drawer opened another her security tags her as leaving the place just after two the doors on automatic lock she doesnt call a car its at least a sixtyblock walk to leonardos shes in icepick heels but she doesnt take a cab theres no record of any company picking her up or dropping her shes registered for a palm link but we havent found it if she had it with her and made a call either she or someone else disposed of the unit if she called her killer he or she should have been smart enough to ditch it peabody began a search of the twolevel closet and managed not to hyperventilate over the racks of clothes many with price tags still attached she might have been wired on something but no way would she walk downtown half the shoes in this closet arent even scraped on the soles she wasnt the walking kind she was wired all right damned if shes taking some stinking cab all she has to do is snap her fingers and she can have half a dozen eager slaves slathering to take her anywhere she wants to go so she snaps them somebody picks her up they go to leonardos why fascinated by the way eve juggled pandoras point of view with her own peabody stopped the search and watched eve she insists she demands she threatens maybe its leonardo she calls or maybe its somebody else they get there the security cameras smashed or she smashes it or the killer smashes it peabody pushed her way through a sea of ivory silk because hes already planning to do her why take her to leonardos if hes already planning it eve demanded or if it was leonardo why dirty your own nest im not sure murder was the priority not yet they get there and if leonardos story holds the place is empty hes off drinking himself into a stupor and looking for mavis who is drinking herself into a stupor pandora wants leonardo there she wants to punish him she starts to wreck the place maybe she takes out some of her rage on her companion they fight it escalates he grabs the cane maybe to defend himself maybe to attack shes shocked hurt afraid nobody hurts her what the hell is this then he cant stop or doesnt want to stop shes lying there and theres blood everywhere peabody said nothing shed seen the pictures of the scene could imagine it all happening just as eve related hes standing over her breathing hard eyes half closed eve tried to bring the shadowy figure into focus her bloods all over him the smell of its everywhere but he doesnt panic cant afford to panic doesnt let himself panic what ties her to him the palm link he takes that pockets it if hes smart and he has to be smart now he goes through her things makes sure theres nothing that can lead to him he wipes off the cane where he gripped it anything else he thinks he might have touched in eves mind it played like an old video cloudy and full of shadows the figure male female hurrying to cover tracks moving around the body stepping around the pools of blood have to be quick someone might come back but have to be thorough almost clean now then he hears someone coming in mavis she calls out for leonardo rushes back sees the body kneels beside it now its even more perfect he knocks her out then he curls her fingers around the cane maybe he even gives pandora a few extra whacks he takes that dead hand and rakes its nails over maviss face uses it to tear her clothes he puts on something one of leonardos robes to conceal his own clothes she straightened from her search of a bottom drawer and found peabody staring at her its like you were there peabody murmured i want to be able to do that to go in the way you do walk in to a few more murder scenes and you will the hard parts getting out again where the hell is the box she could have taken it with her i dont buy that wheres the key peabody she locked this drawer wheres the key in silence peabody took out her field unit requested the list of items found in the victims purse or on her person there was no key taken into evidence so he got the key didnt he and he came back here and took the box and anything else he needed lets check the security disc wouldnt the sweepers have done that why she wasnt killed here all they were required to do was verify her time of departure eve walked over to the security monitor ordered a replay for the date and time in question she watched pandora storm out of the house stride quickly out of range two oh eight okay lets see what shakes time of death was about three computer advance to oh three hundred proceed at triple real time she focused on the chronometer freeze image sonofabitch see that peabody i see it time skipped from four oh three to four thirtyfive someone disengaged the camera had to do it by remote had to know what they were doing someone wanted to get in bad enough get something out bad enough to risk it for a box of illegals her smile was grim ive got a feeling dead in the gut peabody lets go hassle the lab boys chapter nine why you wanna give me grief dallas huddled in his lab coat chief tech dickie berenski dickhead to those who knew and loathed him tested a strand of pubic hair he was a meticulous man as well as a monster pain in the ass though notoriously slow in testing his batting average in court was high enough to make him the mvp of the police and security lab cant you see im buried here jesus with his fussy spider fingers he adjusted the focus on his microgoggles got us ten homicides six rapes a load of suspicious and unattended deaths and too many b and es to think about im not a fucking robot closest thing to eve muttered she didnt like coming to the lab with its antiseptic air and white walls it was too much like a hospital or worse testing any cop who used maximum force resulting in termination was required to undergo testing her experiences with that particular intrusive routine hadnt been pleasant look dickie youve had plenty of time to analyze the substance plenty of time he pushed back from the counter and his eyes behind the goggles were big and bold as an owls you and every other cop in the city figures your shits a priority like we should drop every other thing and devote every minute to you you know what happens when the temperature rises dallas people go bat shit thats what happens all you gotta do is take them down but me and my team we gotta shift through every hair and fiber it takes time his voice shifted into whine and set eves teeth on edge ive got homicide breathing down my neck and illegals snapping at my heels over some goddamn bag of powder you got the prelim i need the final well i havent got it his flappy lips pouted as he turned back and brought the enhanced view of the hair on screen i gotta finish dna on this eve knew how to work him she didnt like it but she knew ive got two boxseat tickets to the yankeered sox game tomorrow his fingers moved slowly over the controls box seats thirdbase side dickie tipped down his goggles to scan the room other techs were busy at their stations maybe i could get you a little more with one shove of his feet he sent his chair sliding to the right until he faced another screen cautious he engaged the keyboard and brought the file up manually he tapped slowly scanning the screen heres the problem see this element here it was nothing but color and foreign symbols to eve but she grunted as the data scrolled the unknown she imagined that even roarkes unit couldnt identify that red thing no no no thats a standard amphetamine you find it in zeus in buzz in smiley hell you can get a mild derivative of that in any overthecounter pepup this one he tapped a finger against a green squiggle okay what is it thats the big question dallas never seen it before the computer cant identify my best guess is its something from off planet that ups the stakes doesnt it bringing an unknown from off planet can get you twenty years in maximum lockup can you tell what it does im working on it it appears to have some of the same properties as an antiaging drug and with some of the same energizers it beats hell out of free radicals but theres some nasty side effects when its mixed with the other chemicals found in the powder you got most of it in the report enhanced sexual drive which is not a bad thing but thats followed by violent mood swings increased physical strength hooked up to a lack of control this shit really dances around in the old nervous system youre going to feel terrific for a while practically invulnerable youll want to fuck like a rabbit but you wont much care if your chosen mate is interested when the crash comes its going to be hard and fast and the only thing thats going to level you out is another dose keep taking it keep flying up and diving down and the nervous systems going to go nutso then you die thats pretty much what youve given me already thats because im stuck on element x its vegetation i can tell you that similar to the sharpleaf valerian found in the southwest indians used the leaves for healing but valerian isnt toxic and this is its poison taken alone and in sufficient dosage it would be yeah so are a lot of herbs and plants used in medicine its a medicinal herb i didnt say that its not yet identified he puffed out his cheeks but its likely some off planet hybrid thats the best ive got right now and you and illegals hassling me isnt going to make me find the answer quicker this isnt an illegals case its mine tell them that i will now dickie i need the toxicology on the pandora homicide thats not my baby dallas that was dumped on suzieq and its her twentyfour hours off youre chief tech dickie and i need the report she waited a beat there are two locker room passes that go along with those box seats yeah well it never hurts to spotcheck your team he keyed in his code then the file she secured it good for her chief tech berenski override security on file pandora id h voice print verified display toxicology toxicology tests still in progress preliminary results on screen shed been drinking a lot dickie murmured top french bubbly probably died happy looks like dom thats good work for suzieq added a little happy powder to it our dead girl liked to party looks like zeus no his shoulders bowed in as they did when he was intrigued or irritated what the hell is this when the computer started to detail elements he cut it off with an annoyed flick of the finger and began to run the report manually something mixed up here he muttered something screwy his fingers played over the controls like those of a welltrained pianist giving his first recital slow cautious and accurate dallas watched symbols and shapes form disperse realign and she too saw the pattern its the same eyes steely she looked over at the silent peabody its the same stuff i didnt say that dickie interrupted shut up and let me finish running this test its the same eve repeated right down to that green squiggle of element x question peabody what do a highpowered model and a secondrate weasel have in common theyre both dead youve answered part one correctly care to try for part two and double your winnings how did they both die the faintest of smiles flitted around peabodys mouth beaten to death now for the grand prize and part three what connects these two seemingly unrelated murders peabody looked down at the screen element x were on a roll peabody transmit that report to my office dickie mine she repeated when he glanced up at her illegals calls you dont know any more than you knew before hey i cant bury data right she turned on her heel ill have those tickets delivered by five o o you knew peabody said as they took the sky glide to the homicide sector back at the victims apartment you couldnt find the box but you knew what was in it suspected eve corrected a new blend one she was proprietary about increased sexual performance and strength she checked her watch i got lucky working on both cases at the same time having them both on my mind i worried i was just overlapping but then i started to wonder i saw both bodies peabody there was the same overkill the same viciousness i dont think it was luck i was in on both of them too and i was six steps behind the whole way you catch up fast eve stepped off the glide to take the elevator to her level dont beat yourself up over it peabody ive got more than double your time on the job peabody stepped into the glass tube gave a disinterested glance at the city below as they climbed why did you bring me in on these youve got potential brains and guts thats what feeney told me when he brought me in under him that was homicide too two teenagers hacked to death and strewed over the skyramp at second and twentyfifth i stumbled along about six paces behind him too but i found my rhythm howd you know you wanted homicide eve stepped out of the tube turned down the corridor toward her office because deaths an insult anytime when somebody hurries it along thats the biggest insult of all lets get a couple of coffees peabody i want to put this all in black and white before i take it to the commander i dont suppose we could actually eat something eve tossed a grin over her shoulder i dont know whats in my autochef but she trailed off as she walked in and found casto sitting at her desk long denimclad legs propped up and crossed at the ankles well casto jake t you look right at home been waiting for you darlin he winked at her then flashed a killer smile at peabody hi there deedee deedee eve murmured then walked over to order coffee lieutenant peabodys voice was stiff as iron but her cheeks were glowing pink its a lucky man who gets to work with a couple of cops who are not only smart but a joy to look at could i get a cup of that eve strong and black and sweet you can have the coffee but i havent got time for a consult i have some paperwork to see to and an appointment in a couple of hours i wont keep you but he didnt shift when she handed him the coffee ive been trying to light a fire under dickhead the mans slower than a threelegged turtle you being primary i figured you could requisition me a sample ive got a private lab we use now and then theyre quick i dont think we want to take this out of the department casto the labs approved by illegals i meant homicide lets give dickie a little more time boomer isnt going anywhere hey youre in charge id just like to put this one behind me leaves a bad taste not like this coffee he closed his eyes sighed my jesus woman whered you get this its gold connections ah that rich fiance of yours sure he savored another sip a man would be hard pressed to tempt you away with the offer of a cold beer and a taco coffees my drink casto cant blame you he shifted his admiring gaze to peabody how about you deedee got a taste for a cold one officer peabodys on duty eve said when peabody was reduced to stammers weve got work to do here casto ill let you get to it he unfolded his legs and stood why dont you give me a call when you go off duty deedee i know a place that has the best mexican food this side of the rio grande eve you change your mind on letting me rush that sample through let me know close the door peabody eve ordered when casto sauntered out and wipe that drool off your chin appalled peabody lifted a hand finding her chin dry didnt improve her humor thats not funny sir cut out the sir anybody who goes around answering to deedee loses five points on the dignity scale eve dropped down in the seat recently warmed by casto what the hell did he want i thought he told us clearly enough no that wasnt enough to bring him over here she leaned forward engaged her machine a quick test of security showed no breaches if he was in here i cant tell why would he go into your files hes ambitious if he could close the case ahead of me it would look damn good and illegals doesnt like to share anyway and homicide does peabody said dryly hell no she looked up grinned lets get this report hammered out were going to have to request an off world toxicology expert we better be able to back up the hole were going to put in the budget thirty minutes later they were summoned to the office of the chief of police and security o o eve liked chief tibbie he was a big man with a bold mind and a heart that was still more cop than politician after the stench the former chief had left behind the city and the department had needed the kind of brisk cold air tibbie brought with him but she didnt know what the hell theyd been called in for not until she was ushered in and saw casto and his captain lieutenant officer tibbie gestured to chairs in a strategic move eve chose one beside commander whitney we have a little squabble to settle tibbie began were going to settle it quickly and finally lieutenant dallas you are primary on the johannsen and the pandora homicides yes sir i am i was called in to confirm identification of johannsens body as he was one of my informants in the pandora case i was called to the scene by mavis freestone who has been charged in that case both files are still open and under investigation officer peabody is your aide i requested her as my aide and was authorized to attach her to my caseload by my commander very well lieutenant casto johannsen was also one of your informants he was i was on another case when his body was taken in i wasnt notified until later and at that time the illegals and homicide departments agreed to cooperate on the investigation we did however recent information has come to my attention that puts both of these cases under illegals jurisdiction theyre homicides eve interrupted with the link of illegal substances connecting both castos easy smile flashed the latest lab report shows that the substance discovered in johannsens room was also found in pandoras system this substance contains an unknown and is not yet rated which under article six section nine code b puts all related cases under the investigative head of illegals exception to which is granted with such cases that are already under investigation by another department eve forced herself to take a deep breath my report on these matters will be complete within the hour exceptions are not automatic lieutenant the illegals captain tapped his fingertips together the simple fact is homicide doesnt have the manpower experience or the facilities to investigate an unknown illegals does and we dont feel it was in the spirit of cooperation to hold data back from our department your department and lieutenant casto will be copied when my report is complete these are my cases whitney lifted a hand before she could spit lieutenant dallas is primary if these cases are linked with illegals they are still homicides which she has been investigating with respect commander casto dimmed his smile its well known at cop central that you favor the lieutenant and rightfully so given her record we requested this meeting with chief tibbie so as to insure a fair judgment on departmental priority i have more street contacts and a relationship with merchants and distributors of chemicals while working undercover ive gained access to mills factories and chemhouses which the lieutenant simply doesnt have added to that is the fact that there is a suspect charged with the pandora homicide a suspect who had absolutely no connection with johannsen eve broke in they were killed by the same person chief tibbie his eyes remained cool any approval or lack thereof was carefully masked is that your opinion lieutenant thats my professional judgment sir which i will show cause for in my report chief its no secret that lieutenant dallas has a personal interest in the suspect charged the captain spoke tersely it would be natural for her to want to cast a cloud over the case how can her professional judgment remain clear when the suspect is a close friend tibbie held up a finger to halt eves outburst commander whitney your opinion i will and have relied without qualification on lieutenant dallass judgment shell do her job i agree captain i dont much care for disloyalty in the ranks the reprimand was mild but the aim deadly now both departments have a valid point here on priority exceptions are not automatic and we are dealing with an unknown which appears to be involved in at least two deaths both lieutenant dallas and lieutenant casto have exemplary records and each i believe are more than competent to investigate these matters do you agree commander yes sir both are excellent cops then i suggest they cooperate with each other instead of playing games lieutenant dallas will remain primary and as such will keep lieutenant casto and his department apprised of any and all progress now is that it or do i have to threaten to cut a baby in two like solomon o o get that report finished dallas whitney muttered as they filed out and next time you bribe dickhead do a better job of it yes sir eve glanced down at the hand on her arm looked up at casto had to give it a shot the captain he likes those clutch rbis she didnt miss his notsosubtle reference to baseball no problem since im still the one up at bat youll get my report casto appreciate it ill do some more poking around on the streets so far nobody knows anything about a new blend but this off planet angle might open something up i know a couple drones in customs who owe me eve hesitated then decided it was time to take the term cooperation to heart try stellar five for a start pandora came back from there a couple of days before she died i still have to backtrack and see if she did any station hopping good you let me know he smiled and the hand that was still on her arm slid down to her wrist i got a feeling now that weve aired this out well make a hell of a team closing this one ups going to look good on both of our files im more interested in finding a murderer than i am in how it affects my promotion status hey im all for justice his dimple winked but i aint going to cry if making it pushes me closer to a captains salary no hard feelings no id have done the same thats fine then i might just drop around for some more of the coffee one day soon he gave her wrist a quick squeeze and eve i hope you clear your friend i mean that i will clear my friend hed taken two strides away when she admitted she couldnt resist casto yeah darling whatd you offer him dickhead the grin was as wide as oklahoma a case of unblended scotch he snatched at it the way a frogs tongue snatches a fly casto flicked his own tongue out winked again nobody bribes better than an illegals cop eve ill remember that eve stuck her hands in her pockets but couldnt help but grin hes got style ill give him that and a great butt peabody said before she could stop herself just an observation one i have to agree with well peabody we won that battle lets go try for the war o o by the time the report was complete eves eyes were all but crossed she sent peabody off duty as soon as copies were transmitted to all necessary parties she considered canceling her session with the shrink thought of all the reasons why she could and should postpone it but she found herself in dr miras office at the appointed time taking in the familiar scents of herbal tea and subtle perfume im glad you came to see me mira crossed her silkdraped legs shed had her hair restyled eve noted it was cut short and sleek rather than tucked up in a smooth roll the eyes were the same of course quiet and blue and filled with ready understanding you look well im fine i cant see how you would be with so much going on in your life professionally and personally it must be tremendously difficult for you to have such a close friend charged with a murder youre investigating how are you handling it im doing my job by doing it ill clear mavis and find out who set her up do you find your loyalties divided no not after i thought about it eve rubbed her hands on the knees of her trousers damp palms were a usual side effect of her meetings with mira if i had any doubt any doubt at all that mavis was innocent im not sure what i would do but i dont so the answers clear thats a comfort to you yeah you could say that ill feel a hell of a lot more comfortable after i close the case and shes out of it i guess i was worried when i made the appointment to see you but i feel more in control now thats important to you feeling in control i cant do my job unless i know i have the wheel and in your personal life shit nobody grabs the wheel from roarke hes running things then he would if you let him she gave a short laugh hed probably say the same about me i guess we do a lot of juggling for the controls end up heading in the same direction anyway he loves me you sound surprised nobody ever did not like this its easy to say for some people the words but its not just words with roarke he sees inside me and it doesnt matter should it i dont know i dont always like what i see there but he does or at least he understands it and now eve understood that this was what shed needed to talk through those black ragged edges inside her maybe its because we both had lousy beginnings we knew when we should have been too young to know how cruel people can be how power doesnt just corrupt in the wrong hands it mutilates he i never made love before him i had sex but i never felt anything but basic release but i could never be intimate she decided is that the word yes i think thats exactly the word why do you think you achieved intimacy with him he wouldnt have it any other way because he she felt her eyes begin to tear and blinked them dry because he opened something inside me id closed off no that had been scarred shut somehow he took control of that part of me or i let him have control of that part of me that died that was killed when i was a child when youll feel better if you say it eve when my father raped me she let out a shuddering breath and the tears didnt matter any longer he raped me and he violated me and he hurt me he used me like a whore when i was too small and too weak to stop him he would hold me down or tie me up he would hit me until i could hardly see or he would hold his hand over my mouth so that i couldnt scream and he would push himself into me and ram himself into me until the pain was almost as obscene as the act and there was no one to help me and nothing to do but wait for the next time do you understand that you werent to blame mira asked gently when an abscess was finally lanced she thought one had to carefully thoroughly slowly squeeze out all the poison not then not now not ever eve used the back of her hand to wipe her cheeks dry i wanted to be a cop because cops have control they stop the bad guys it seemed simple after i was a cop for a while i began to see that there are some who always prey on the weak and the innocent her breath steadied no it wasnt my fault it was his and the fault of the people who pretended not to see or to hear but i still have to live with it and it was easier to live with it when i didnt remember but youve been remembering for a long time havent you bits and pieces everything before i was found in the alley when i was eight was just bits and pieces and now more pieces too many pieces and its clearer closer she rubbed a hand over her mouth deliberately lowered it to her lap again i can see his face i didnt used to be able to see his face during the deblass case last winter i guess there were enough similarities there to click then there was roarke and it all started to come back clearer and faster i cant stop it is that what you want id wipe those eight years out of my mind if i could she said it viciously felt it viciously they have nothing to do with now i dont want them to have anything to do with now eve as horrible as those eight years were and as obscene they formed you they helped build your strength your compassion for the innocent your complexity your resilience remembering and dealing with those memories wont change what you are ive often recommended you agree to autohypnosis i no longer do i believe your subconscious is letting these memories surface at its own pace if that were so eve wanted the pace to slow to let her breathe maybe there are some things im not ready to remember still it doesnt stop theres a dream that keeps coming back just lately and constantly theres a room a filthy room with this dull red light blinking in the window off and on theres a bed its empty but its stained i know its blood a lot of blood i see myself curled in the corner on the floor theres more blood im covered with it i cant see my face its toward the wall i cant see clearly at all but it has to be me are you alone i think so i cant tell i only see the bed the corner and that light blinking off and on theres a knife on the floor beside me there werent any stab wounds on you when you were found eyes hollow and haunted lifted to miras i know chapter ten eve expected the cold blast of summersets disapproval when she walked into the house she was used to it she couldnt explain what perverse streak shed developed when she found herself disappointed that he didnt greet her at the door with some snide comment she stepped into the parlor off the foyer engaged the wall sensor where is roarke roarke is in the gymnasium lieutenant do you wish to contact no disengage shed go see him herself a good sweaty workout might be just what she needed to clear her mind she took the stairs behind the faux panel in the hallway descended a level and cut through the pool area with its blackbottomed lagoon and tropical greenery there was a whole world down here she thought another of roarkes worlds the lush pool with an overhead that could simulate starlight sunshine or moonbeams at the flick of a control the holoroom where hundreds of games could be accessed to while away a slow night a turkish bath an isolation tank the target range a small theater and a meditation lounge superior to any offered in the pricey health spas on or off planet toys she supposed for the rich or roarke might call them survival tools a necessary means of relaxation in a world that moved faster every day he balanced relaxation and work better than she eve could admit that somehow he had found the key to enjoying what he had while protecting it and gathering more shed learned quite a bit from roarke over the past few months one of the most important lessons was that there were times she had to push aside all the worries the responsibilities even the thirst for answers and just be eve that was what she thought of now as she slipped into the gym and coded the door to lock behind her he wasnt a man to stint on his equipment nor was he one to take the easy way and pay to have his body sculpted his muscles toned his organs flushed sweat and effort were as important to him as the gravity bench the aqua track or the resistance center because he was a man who appreciated tradition his personal gym was also stocked with oldfashioned free weights incline benches and a virtual reality system he was using the first of those now doing long slow curls as he watched a monitor flash with some sort of schematic and spoke to someone on a head link securitys a priority at the resort teasdale if theres a flaw find it and fix it he frowned at the screen switched fluidly from curls to extensions youll simply have to do better if youre going to have cost overruns youll have to justify them to me no i didnt say excuse them to me teasdale justify them have a report transmitted to my office by oh nine hundred onplanet time disengage youre tough roarke he glanced around as the screen went dark smiled at her business is war lieutenant the way you play it killer if i were teasdale id be trembling in my gravity boots right now thats the idea he set the weights down to take off the headset and put it aside she watched him switch to the resistance center set a program and start on leg presses absently she picked up a weight worked on her triceps and kept watching him the black sweatband gave him a warrior look she thought and the dark sleeveless tshirt and shorts showed off very attractive muscles and skin gleaming with honest sweat she watched those muscles bunch that sweat bead and she wanted him youre looking pleased with yourself lieutenant actually im pleased with you she angled her head let her gaze skim over him thats quite a body youve got there roarke his brow winged up as she strolled over reached down to test his biceps tough guy he grinned up at her she was in a mood he could see he just wasnt sure what mood it was want to see how tough think im afraid of you with her eyes still on his she stripped off her weapon harness hung it over one of the bars come on she walked over to a mat curled her fingers in challenge see if you can take me down still prone he studied her there was something in her eyes other than challenge he noted if he wasnt mistaken it was lust eve im covered with sweat she sneered coward he winced let me grab a shower then chicken you know some men are still stuck in the mindset that a woman cant go toe to toe on a physical level since i know youre above that i can only assume youre afraid ill whip your ass that did it end program slowly he sat up and reached toward a stack of towels he mopped his face wanna fight ill give you time to warm up her blood was already pumping im warm enough standard hand to hand no punching he said as he stepped onto the mat at her derisive snort he narrowed his eyes im not hitting you right like you could get past my he came in fast caught her off balance and sent her skidding on her butt foul she muttered and swung up to the balls of her feet oh now therere rules just like a cop they crouched circled each other he feinted she stepped in for ten interesting seconds they grappled her hands sliding off his slick skin his quick leg hook would have worked if she hadnt anticipated and gone in low using leverage and a quick twist of her body she flipped him over now were even she crouched again as he got to his feet shook back his hair okay lieutenant im going to stop holding back holding back my butt you were he almost caught her again certainly would have taken her down if she hadnt realized with seconds to spare that his strategy was to distract her with insults she evaded and turned into his move then when their faces were close their bodies straining she pulled out her best weapon she slid a hand between his legs cupped gentle fingers over his balls he blinked in surprise in delight well then he murmured and lowered his lips to within an inch of hers before she switched her grip he didnt even have time to curse as he went sailing he landed with a thud and she was on him a knee pressed to his crotch his shoulders pinned by her hands youre down pal and out talk about fouls dont be a sore loser its hard to argue with a woman when shes got her knee on my ego good now im going to have my way with you are you damn right i won she cocked her head and reached down to strip off his shirt cooperate and i wont have to hurt you uhuh when he reached for her she gripped his hands and pushed them back to the mat im in charge here dont make me get out the cuffs hmm an interesting threat why dont you his words trailed off as her mouth came down on his hard and hot instinctively his hands flexed under hers wanting to touch to take but he understood she wanted something else something more so he would let her find it im going to take you she bit down on his lip sending an edge of lust razoring through his gut do whatever i want to you his mind was already spinning his breath clogging be gentle with me he managed and felt warmth twine with the heat when she laughed dream on she was rough quick demanding hands impatient restless lips he could all but feel the wildness of her need vibrate from her shimmer into him with some reckless energy that seemed to feed on itself if she wanted control he would give it to her or so he thought but somewhere during her onslaught of his system he simply lost the choice she scraped her teeth over him down him until the muscles he had toned trembled helplessly his vision wavered when she took him into her mouth worked him hard fast so that he had to fight every instinct or explode dont you hold back on me she nipped his thigh slid her way back up his torso while her hand replaced her mouth i want to make you come she sucked his tongue into her mouth bit released now she watched his eyes go opaque seconds before she felt the orgasm rip through him her laugh was shaky with power as she assaulted his ear i won again jesus christ jesus he managed barely to wind his arms around her he was weak as a baby and tangled with embarrassment at his complete loss of control was a giddy delight i dont know whether to apologize or thank you save it i havent finished with you yet he nearly chuckled but she was nibbling her way around his jaw and sending fresh signals to his battered system darling youll have to give me a minute i dont have to do anything she was drunk on pleasure energized by her own power you just have to take it straddling him she pulled her shirt over her head watching him she skimmed her hands up her own torso over her breasts and down again saliva pooled in his mouth smiling she took his hands and brought them to her with a sigh she let her eyes close his touch was familiar now yet always fresh constantly arousing his fingers played over her teasing her nipples until they were hot and on the point of pain then tugging until there was an answering clutch in her center obliging them both she arched back as he reared up to cover her with his mouth she cupped his head let herself become steeped in the sensations the scrape of teeth on sensitized flesh that ran from tender to brutal the flex and release of his fingers on her hips the slick slide of flesh against flesh and the hot ripe smell of sweat and sex and when she urged his mouth back to hers the explosive taste of reckless lust he made a sound caught between a groan and an oath when she pulled away she rose quickly delighted to find herself shaky on her feet her body heavy with need she didnt have to tell him it had never been she had never been like this with anyone but him he knew it already just as she had come to know that he found more with her somehow with her than with anyone else she stood over him no longer trying to level her breathing no longer shocked by the shudders that coursed through her she toed off her shoes unhooked her trousers let them fall away heat swamped her as his eyes skimmed up then down then up again to her face shed never thought much about her body it was a cops body and had to be strong resilient flexible with roarke shed discovered how wonderful those aspects could be for a woman trembling a little she planted a knee on either side of him then leaned forward to lose herself in the giddy pleasure of mouth on mouth im still in charge she whispered as she rose up with his eyes burning into hers he smiled do your worst she lowered herself to him took him into her slowly torturously and when he was deep when her body went rigid bowed back she let out a shuddering sob as the first glorious orgasm rippled through her greedy she lunged forward again gripped his hands with hers and began to ride explosions burst in her head in her blood behind her closed eyes riotous colors danced and there was nothing inside her but roarke and a desperate need for more of him still more of him climax slammed into climax slapping her up before she was able to float down again the grinding ache in her was met then built again until at last her body slid limply down to his she buried her face against his throat and waited for sanity to return eve huh my turn she blinked groggily as he rolled her onto her back it took her a second to realize he was still hard inside her i thought youd wed you had he murmured he watched fresh stunning pleasure flicker over her face as he moved inside her now you just have to take it she started to laugh but it ended on a moan well kill each other if we keep this up ill risk it no dont close your eyes see me he watched those eyes glaze as he quickened the pace heard her strangled cry as he drove himself deeper deeper inside her then they were both bucking plunging her hands grappling for purchase his hips thrusting harder her eyes went blank and wild he covered her mouth ruthlessly with his and swallowed her scream o o they were tangled together like two boxers down for the count and gasping for air hed slid slightly down her body and found that though her breast was handy to his lips he didnt have the energy to take advantage of it i cant feel my toes she realized or my fingers i think i broke something it occurred to him that he was probably cutting off most of her air and her circulation with an effort he reversed their positions better she took a long wheezing gulp of air i think did i hurt you huh he tipped her head up and studied her foolish blankeyed grin never mind you finished with me yet for the moment thank god he dropped back down and concentrated on breathing jesus were a mess nothing like sticky sweaty sex to remind you youre human come on come on where darling he skimmed a kiss over her damp shoulder you need a shower im just going to sleep here for the next couple of days she curled up yawned you go ahead he shook his head gathering his strength he shoved her aside got to his feet after a deep breath he reached down and hauled her up over his shoulder oh sure take advantage of a dead woman dead weight he muttered and crossed the gym to the changing area he shifted her more securely then stepped onto the tile with a wicked grin he turned around so that her face would encounter the full force of one of the crisscrossing sprays sixtythree degrees maximum spray sixty it was all she had time for the rest of her words were lost in screams and curses that echoed off the shining tiles she wasnt dead weight now but a wriggling wet desperate woman he clamped down hard roaring with laughter as she sputtered and swore at him ninetytwo she shouted ninety fucking two degrees now when the spray pumped hot she managed to catch her breath ill kill you roarke the minute i thaw out its good for you he set her carefully on her feet and offered her the soap clean up lieutenant im starving so was she ill kill you later she decided after i eat o o within the hour she was showered satisfied dressed and attacking a twoinch sirloin you know im only marrying you for sex and food he sipped a deep red wine and watched her plow through the meal of course she nipped into a shoestring fry and because you have a beautiful face unruffled he only grinned thats what they all say those werent the reasons but good sex good food and a beautiful face could certainly mellow a mood she smiled at him hows mavis hed been waiting for her to ask but he had known shed needed to get something out of her system first shes fine she and leonardo are having a kind of reunion in her suite tonight you can talk to them in the morning eve looked down at her plate as she cut into the steak again what do you think of him i think hes desperately almost pathetically in love with our mavis and since i have some experience with that emotion i have sympathy for his situation we cant verify his movements on the night of the murder she picked up her wine he had motive he had means and very likely opportunity theres no physical evidence linking him to the crime but the crime took place in his apartment and the weapon was his so you see him killing pandora then setting the scene so that mavis takes the blame no she set her wine down again it would just be easier if i could eve tapped her fingers on the table then picked up her glass again do you know jerry fitzgerald yes were acquainted he waited a beat no ive never slept with her i didnt ask just simplifying she shrugged and took another sip my impressions are smart ambitious clever and tough your impressions are usually accurate i wouldnt argue with them i dont know a lot about the modeling game but ive been doing some research at fitzgeralds level its pretty high stakes money prestige media having top bill on a show thats being anticipated as much as leonardos is worth big credits fullblown coverage shell step right into pandoras shoes on it now if his designs click it could be worth a considerable amount to be the top endorser roarke agreed but its still speculative shes involved with justin young and she admitted that pandora was trying to lure him back roarke considered difficult for me to imagine jerry fitzgerald going into a murderous rage over a man shed more likely have one over a stylist eve admitted but theres more briefly she told him of the connection between boomers data and death and the new blend found in pandoras system we cant find her cache someone else went after it and knew where to look jerrys come out publicly against illegals of course thats publicly roarke added and youre dealing with profit here not partying thats my theory a new blend like this quickly addictive potent has the potential for a great deal of profit the fact that its eventually lethal wont stop its distribution or its use she pushed her halfeaten steak aside a gesture that had roarke frowning when she didnt eat she was worried it seems to me like you have a lead you can get your teeth into eve a lead that steers far wide of mavis yeah restless she rose a lead that doesnt point to anyone else fitzgerald and young alibi each other the security discs confirm their whereabouts at the time of death unless of course one or both of them got around security redford doesnt have an alibi or doesnt have one without big holes but i cant tie him yet that she wanted to seemed very clear to roarke what were your impressions callous ruthless selfinterested you didnt like him no i didnt he was slick smug confident he could handle some city cop without straining his brain cells and he volunteered information just like young and fitzgerald did i dont trust volunteers the way the mind of a cop worked was a marvel he mused youd trust him more if youd had to pry information out of him sure it was one of the basic rules for her he was anxious to feed me pandoras drug use so was fitzgerald and all three of them were almost happy to tell me they didnt like her i dont suppose youd consider they were simply being honest when people are that open especially to a cop theres usually another layer underneath im going to do some more digging on them she circled back sat again then theres the illegals cop im butting heads with casto yeah he wants the cases took it well enough when he lost the stab but its not going to be share and share alike with him he wants a captaincy and you dont her gaze shifted coolly to his when ive earned it and of course youll be sharing and sharing alike cheerfully with casto in the meantime her lips curved shut up roarke the point is i have to link boomers death with pandoras solidly i have to find the person or persons who connect them who knew them both until i do mavis is facing a murder trial as i see it you have two avenues to explore which are the glittery road to haute couture and the gritty road to the streets he took out a cigarette lighted it where did you say pandora had been before she got back on planet starlight station i have some interests there what a surprise she said dryly ill ask a few questions the people in the circle pandora exploited dont respond terribly well to badges if i dont get the right answers i may have to go there myself something in her tone alerted him problem no no problem eve she pushed away from the table again ive never been off planet bemused he stared never as in never not everybody just goes popping off into orbit whenever they get an itch theres plenty to keep most of us busy right here theres nothing to be afraid of he said reading her perfectly space travel is safer than driving in the city bullshit she said under her breath i didnt say i was afraid if i have to do it ill do it id just rather not thats all the closer im able to keep this to home the faster ill have mavis out of it ummhmm interesting he thought to discover his stalwart lieutenant had a phobia why dont we see what i can find out for you youre a civilian unofficially of course she looked back at him saw amused understanding and sighed fine i dont suppose youve got an off planet flora expert you can lend me while youre at it roarke picked up his wine again smiled as a matter of fact chapter eleven the case was going in too many directions at once eve decided the best course was the most familiar she took to the streets and she took to them alone shed left peabody with a pile of data to check buzzed feeney for an update but she headed out solo she didnt want to make small talk didnt want anyone looking too closely shed had a bad night and was well aware it showed the nightmare had been one of the worst so far it had squeezed her by the throat battered her awake in a sweaty whimpering mess her only relief had been that dawn had been breaking when it had reached its peak and shed been alone in bed with roarke already up and in the shower if hed heard her or seen her shed never have gotten past him perhaps it had been misplaced pride but shed used every tactic at her disposal to avoid him then had left him a quick memo before slipping out of the house shed avoided mavis and leonardo as well and had only run into summerset long enough to have been granted one of his freezing looks shed turned away from that and had walked out there was a sick knowledge inside her that she was turning away from a great deal more work was the answer or so she hoped work she understood she pulled up in front of the down and dirty club in the east end and got out of the car hey there white girl hows it passing crack oh without much hassle he grinned at her a giant of a black man with a face seamed with tattoos his rocket launcher chest was partially covered with a feathered vest that hung past his knees and added flair to the loincloth of neon pink he sported gonna be another hot one this day got time to go inside and cool me off with a drink might be for you sweet butt you taking cracks advice and turning in your badge to shake your talent in the down and dirty not in this lifetime he laughed patting his gleaming belly dont know why it is i got a liking for you you come on in wet your whistle and tell crack whats rocking down shed been in worse clubs and would be eternally grateful shed been in better the stale smells from the night hung still incense bad perfumes liquor smoke from dubious leaves unwashed bodies and casual sex it was too early for even the most dedicated partier chairs were overturned onto tables and she could see where someone had made a careless pass with a mop over the sticky floor substances she didnt care to identify had been left behind still the bottles behind the main bar gleamed in the colored lights on the stage to the right a dancer draped in pink net practiced a routine to the blare of simulated brass a jerk of cracks huge head had the domestic droid and the dancer wandering off whats your pleasure white girl coffee black crack lumbered behind the bar still grinning gotcha how bout a drop or two of my special reserve in that coffee eve lifted a shoulder when in rome sure she watched him program the coffee then uncode a cabinet where he took out a bottle fit for a genie and leaning on the cloudy bar smelling the smells she relaxed a little she knew why she had a liking for crack a nighthawk she barely knew but understood he was part of a world shed wandered in most of her life now whatcha doing in this nasty place honey pot being a cop afraid so she sampled the coffee sucked in her breath jesus some reserve only for my favorite people it skims under the legal limit he winked just what you want crack to do for you did you know boomer carter johannsen smalltime player data hound i know boomer hes meat now yeah thats right somebody slaughtered him you ever do business with him crack he come in now and then crack preferred his reserve straight up he sipped then smacked his tattooed lips in appreciation sometimes he flush sometimes not he liked to watch the show and talk the shit not much harm in old boomer heard he got his face erased thats right whod want to do that he pissed somebody off bad id say boomer he had big ears if he popped a few he had a big mouth too when did you see him last hell now hard to remember few weeks anyway seems to me he came through one night with a pocket full of credits bought himself a bottle a few tabs and a privacy room lucille went with him no not lucille shit was hetta all you white girls look alike he said with a wink did he tell anyone how he came to have full pockets mighta told hetta he was blissed out enough seems she picked up some more tabs for him he wanted to stay happy she said something about how old boomer was going to be an entrepreneur or some horseshit like we had ourselves a laugh over it then he come out and got up onstage naked we had a bigger laugh dude had the most pitiful cock you ever seen so he was celebrating a deal thatd be my take we got busy i had to crack a few heads toss out some bodies i remember how i was out on the street and he come rushing out i grabbed hold just fooling he didnt look happy no more he looked pissyourpants scared he say anything just shook himself loose and took off running last time i saw him as i recollect who spooked him whod he talk to cant tell you that sweet face did you see any of these people here that night eve took photos out of her bag spread them out pandora jerry justin redford and because it was necessary mavis and leonardo hey i know these two fancyface models his wide fingers traced lovingly over pandora and jerry the redhead she come in now and then trolling for partners looking to score could be she was here that night but cant say for certain sure these others arent on our guest list so to speak least i cant make em did you ever see the redhead with boomer he wasnt her pick she liked them big stupid and young boomer was just stupid what do you hear about a new blend on the streets crack his big face went blank closed off dont hear nothing friendly only went so far she knew silently eve took out credits laid them on the bar hearing improved he studied the credits then looked back at her face recognizing the tactic as negotiations she added to them the credits slid across the bar and disappeared some rumblings recent maybe about some new shit high powered good long buzz tough on the credit balance heard it called immortality nones come passing this way not yet most people round here cant afford designer theyll have to wait for the knockoff and that takes a few months more did boomer talk about it is that what he was into speculation shifted into cracks eyes he never flapped to me about it like i said i heard some rumblings pass through its getting good advance hype chemiheads are jazzed over it but i aint heard anybody had a taste its good business he said with a smile you got a product a new one you get the clientele wired up hungry then when it hits theyll pay theyll pay big yeah good business she leaned forward dont try a sample crack its fatal when he started to blow that off she put a hand on his beefy arm i mean literally its poison slowacting poison if theres anyone you care about who uses you warn them off this shit or you wont have them very long he studied her face no jive here white girl this aint cop talk no jive no cop talk a regular users got about five years before it overloads the nervous system and takes him out thats straight crack and whoevers manufacturing it knows it hell of a way to make a profit isnt it just now where can i find hetta crack blew out a breath shook his head nobody gonna believe it if i tell em anyhow not the ones already hungry he looked back at eve focused hetta shit i dont know aint seen her in weeks these girls come and go work one joint go on to the next last name moppett hetta moppett rented a room over on ninth last i heard around a hundred and twentieth anytime you want to take up where she left off sugarpuss just let me know hetta moppett hadnt paid her rent in three weeks nor had she shown her skinny little ass this according to the building super who also informed eve that ms moppett had fortyeight hours to come up with back rent or her property was forfeit eve listened to his angry yammering as she hoofed it up the stairs in the miserable threefloor walkup she had his master code in hand and was certain hed already used it as she unlocked hettas door it was a single room narrow bed dingy window with a few attempts at homey with the frilly pink curtain and cheap shiny pink pillows eve did a quick toss turned up an address log a credit book with over three thousand in deposit some framed photographs and an expired drivers license that listed hettas last address in jersey the closet was half full and from the scarred suitcase on the top shelf eve judged it to be all hetta had she ran the link made a dupe of all the calls on disc then copied the license if hetta had gone on a trip shed taken no more with her than walkingaround credits the clothes on her back and her club companions license eve wasnt betting on it she called the morgue from her car link run the jane does she ordered white blond twentyeight about a hundred and thirty pounds five foot four transmitting copy of drivers license holo she was barely three blocks away heading to cop central when the answer came in lieutenant we got a possible match need dental dna or prints to verify our possible cant be identified by hologram because eve asked but she already knew she doesnt have enough face left o o the prints matched the primary assigned to the jane doe handed hetta over to eve without a backward glance in her office eve stared down at the three files sloppy work she muttered moppetts prints were on file from her companions license carmichael could have idd her weeks ago id say carmichael wasnt much interested in a jane doe peabody commented eve reined in the anger flicked a glance up at peabody then carmichaels in the wrong business isnt she weve got links here peabody from hetta to boomer boomer to pandora what probability did you get when you ran them asked if they were killed by the same hand ninetysix point one okay eves stomach jittered with relief im taking all of this to the pa doing a tap dance i may be able to talk them into dropping charges on mavis at least until we gather more evidence if they dont she looked peabody dead in the eye im leaking it to nadine furst for broadcast thats a code violation and im telling you because as long as youre attached to me and this case you can be held equally responsible youre risking a possible reprimand if you stay i can have you reassigned before this goes down i would consider that action a reprimand lieutenant an undeserved one eve said nothing for a moment thanks deedee peabody winced dont call me deedee fine take everything we have over to edd hand deliver personally to captain feeney i dont want this data transmitted through channels at least not until i talk to the pa then try a little solo investigation she saw the light go on in peabodys eyes and smiled she could remember what it was like to be new and have your first shot go over to the down and dirty club where hetta worked tell crack hes the big one believe me you wont miss him tell him youre mine tell him hettas a corpse see what you can get out of him out of anybody who she hung with what she might have said about boomer that last night who else she spent time with you know the drill yes sir oh and peabody eve slipped the files into her bag and rose dont go in uniform youll scare the natives o o the pa smashed eves hopes in ten minutes flat she continued to argue for another twenty but it was all spinning wheels jonathan heartly agreed that there was a likely connection in the three homicides he was an agreeable man he admired her investigative work her deductive powers and her organized presentation of same he admired any cop who did the job in an exemplary fashion and kept his offices conviction rate high but he and the prosecutors office were not prepared to drop the charges against mavis freestone the physical evidence was too strong and the case at this point too solid to warrant a backpedal he would however keep his door open when and if eve had another suspect he would be more than willing to listen to her case puss head eve muttered as she slammed into the blue squirrel she spotted nadine immediately already in a booth and grimacing over the menu why the hell does it always have to be here dallas nadine demanded the minute eve dropped down across from her im a creature of habit but the club wasnt the same she noted not without mavis standing onstage screeching out her incomprehensible lyrics in her latest eyepopping costume coffee black eve ordered ill have the same how bad can it be just wait for it are you still smoking nadine glanced around uneasy this isnt a smoking booth like theyre going to say something in a joint like this give me one will you you dont smoke im hoping to develop bad habits you want the two bucks no keeping an eye out just in case anyone she knew was around nadine took out two cigarettes you look like you could use something a little stronger thisll do she leaned over so that nadine could light it took one puff hacked jesus let me try that again she drew in smoke felt her head spin her lungs revolt annoyed she crushed it out thats disgusting why do you do that its a developed taste sos eating dog shit and speaking of dog shit eve slid her coffee from the serving slot and took one brave sip so howve you been good better ive been doing things i didnt used to think i had time for its funny how a near death experience makes you realize not making time is wasting time i heard morse has been found competent to stand trial hes not crazy hes just a killer just a killer nadine ran a finger along her throat where a knife had once drawn blood you dont figure being the latter makes him the former no some people just like killing dont dwell on it nadine it doesnt help ive been trying not to i took a few weeks spent some time with my family that helped it also reminded me that i love my job and im good at it even though i folded you didnt fold eve interrupted impatiently you were drugged you had a knife to your throat and you were scared put it behind you yeah right well she blew out smoke anything new on your friend i wasnt really able to tell you how sorry i am that shes in trouble shes going to be all right id bank on you seeing to that thats right nadine and youre going to help me ive got some data for you from an unidentified police source no no recorders write it down eve ordered as nadine reached in her bag whatever you say nadine dug deeper found a pad and a pen shoot we have three separate homicides and evidence points to one killer the first hetta moppett parttime dancer and licensed club companion was beaten to death on may at approximately two a m the majority of blows were delivered to her face and head in such a manner as to obliterate her features ah nadine said and left it at that her body was discovered without identification at six the next morning and tagged as a jane doe at the time of her murder mavis freestone was standing on that stage behind you belting her guts out in front of about a hundred and fifty witnesses nadines brow shot up and she smiled well well keep going lieutenant so she did o o it was the best she could do for the moment when the broadcast hit it was doubtful whether anyone in the department would have to guess who the unnamed source was but they wouldnt be able to prove it and eve would for mavis if not for herself lie without a qualm if and when she was questioned she put in a few more hours at cop central had the miserable job of contacting hettas brother the only next of kin who could be tracked down and informing him that his sister was dead after that cheerful interlude she went back over every scrap of forensic evidence the sweepers had sucked up at the moppett murder scene there was no doubt that she had been killed where shed been found the murder had been a clean probably a quick hit a shattered elbow had been the only defensive wound no murder weapon had yet been found no murder weapon on boomer either she mused a few broken fingers the added finesse of the broken arm the shattered kneecaps all prior to death that she had to assume was torture boomer had had more than information hed had a sample and the formula and the killer had wanted both but boomer had hung tough there the killer for whatever reason hadnt had the time or wanted to take the risk to go to boomers flop and toss it why had boomer been dumped in the river to buy time she speculated but the ploy hadnt worked and the body had been found and idd quickly she and peabody had been at the flop within hours of the discovery and had bagged and tagged the evidence so on to pandora she knew too much wanted too much proved an unstable business partner threatened to talk to the wrong people any of the above eve mused and rubbed her hands over her face thered been more rage in her death more of a fight more of a mess then again she was hopped on immortality she wasnt some foolish club dancer caught in an alley or a pitiful weasel who knew more than he should pandora was a powerful woman with a sharp mind and an ambitious bent and eve remembered welldeveloped biceps three bodies one killer and one link between them and the link was money she ran all suspects through her computer checking normal credit transactions the only one who was hurting was leonardo he was in debt up to his gold eyeballs and then some then again greed had no credit balance it was the property of the rich as well as the poor she dug a little deeper and found that redford had been busy juggling funds withdrawals deposits more withdrawals electronic transfers had been bouncing from coast to coast and to neighboring satellites interesting she thought and more interesting still when she hit on a transfer from his new york account direct into that of jerry fitzgerald in the amount of a hundred and twentyfive thousand three months ago eve murmured rechecking the date thats a lot of money between friends computer scan for any and all transfers from this account to any and all accounts under the name of jerry fitzgerald or justin young in the past twelve months scanning no transfers recorded scan for transfers from any and all accounts under the name of redford to previously requested accounts scanning no transfers recorded okay okay lets try this scan for transfers from any and all accounts under the name of redford to any and all accounts under the name pandora scanning transfers as follows ten thousand from new york central account to new york central account pandora six thousand from new los angeles account to new los angeles security pandora ten thousand from new york central account to new los angeles security pandora twelve thousand from starlight station bonded to starlight station bonded pandora no other transfers recorded well that oughta do it was she bleeding you pal or was she dealing for you eve wished fleetingly for feeney then went after the next layer herself computer scan previous year same data while the computer worked she programmed coffee and speculated on scenarios two hours later her eyes were sore her neck screaming but she had more than enough to warrant another interview with redford she had to settle for his eservice but did have the pleasure of requesting his presence at cop central at ten the following morning after leaving memos for peabody and feeney she decided to call it a day it didnt do her mood much good to discover a memo from roarke on her car link youve been out of touch lieutenant i had something come up that requires my presence ill be in chicago by the time you get this i imagine i may have to stay over tonight unless i can clear this little mess up quickly you can reach me at the river palace if you need to otherwise ill see you tomorrow dont stay up working half the night ill know with an annoyed flick she switched off memo mode what the hell else am i supposed to do she demanded i cant sleep when youre not there she swung through the gates and saw with some hope that lights were blazing everywhere hed canceled the meeting fixed the problem missed his transportation whatever she thought he was home she walked in the door with a welcoming smile on her face and followed the sound of maviss laughter there were four people having drinks and canapes in the parlor but none of them was roarke quick observation powers lieutenant eve thought glumly then took a moment to scan the room before she was noticed mavis was still laughing and dressed in what only she would consider athome wear her red skin suit was studded with silver stars and covered with a sheer emerald sweep shirt left loose and open she teetered on sixinch icepick heels as she cuddled leonardo he had one arm wrapped around her and the other hand was fisted around a glass filled with something clear and fizzy a woman munched on canapes eating them with a speed and precision to rival a factory droid stamping out computer chips her hair was in short corkscrew curls with each twist a different jewel tone her left earlobe was encased in silver hoops that draped a twisted chain around and under her pointed chin to her other ear where it was affixed with a single thumbsize stud there was a tattoo of a rosebud along the side of her thin pointed nose over electric blue eyes her brows were sharp vs of royal purple which matched eve saw in amazement the microsize suspendered playsuit that ended in cuffs just south of her crotch the suspenders were strategically placed over bare breasts to cover the nipples the breasts were the size of farmgrown cantaloupes beside her a man with what appeared to be a map tattooed on his bald pate watched the action through rosetinted glasses and guzzled what eve deduced to be some of roarkes vintage white his party clothes consisted of baggy shorts that hung to bony knees and a chest plate of patriotic red white and blue she considered seriously sneaking upstairs unobserved and locking herself in her office your guests summerset said in dismissive tones from behind her have been waiting for you look pal theyre not my dallas mavis squealed it and leaped dangerously across the room in her fashionable stilts she caught eve in a tipsy bear hug that nearly felled them both youre so late roarke had to go somewhere and he said it was all right if biff and trina came by theyve been dying to meet you leonardo will fix you a drink oh summerset the goodies are just mag youre so sweet im delighted youre enjoying them he beamed at her there was no other description for the bright moony look that shot out of his stony face before he faded back into the hall come on dallas join the party mavis ive really got a lot of work but eve was already being dragged into the parlor can i get you a drink dallas leonardo offered her a sad puppy dog smile eve crumbled sure fine a glass of wine absolutely extraordinary wine im biff the man with the map on his head offered a slim delicate hand its an honor to meet maviss champion lieutenant dallas youre absolutely right leonardo he continued with his eyes intense behind the rosy lenses the bronze silk is perfect for her biff is a fabric expert mavis explained in a voice that continued to bubble and froth hes worked with leonardo for just ever theyve been plotting your trousseau my and this is trina shes going to do your hair she is eve felt the blood drain out of her head and into her feet oh well i dont even women with little vanity can panic when faced with a stylist boasting rainbow curls i dont really think gratis trina announced in a tone that was the vocal equivalent of rusted iron when you clear mavis im giving you free hair consultations and styling for the rest of your life she grabbed a handful of eves hair and squeezed good texture good weight bad cut heres your wine dallas thanks she needed it listen its nice to meet you but ive got some work i have to get to oh but you cant mavis latched onto eves arm like a leech everyones here to start doing you now the blood flowed out of her toes doing what to me were all set up upstairs too leonardos work space trinas biffs all the other worker bees will be buzzing around by tomorrow bees eve managed buzzing for the show cold sober and less likely to assume welcome leonardo patted maviss arm to try to restrain her enthusiasm little dove dallas might not want the house full of people at this point i mean he dodged around the investigation with the wedding so close but its the only way we can be together and finish the designs for the show the plea naked in her eyes mavis turned back to eve you dont mind do you we wont be in the way leonardo just has so much to do some of the designs have to be altered now because because jerry fitzgerald is going to be the headliner different coloring biff put in different body type from pandora he finished saying the name they had been avoiding yeah maviss smile went bright and fixed so its a lot of extra work and roarke said it was all right the house is so big and everything you wont even know theyre all here people eve thought scurrying in and out security nightmares dont worry about it she said she would i told you it would be all right mavis said planting a kiss on leonardos chin and i promised roarke i wouldnt let you bury yourself tonight dallas youre going to sit back and be pampered were getting pizza oh goodie mavis everythings working out mavis went on almost desperately her fingers tightening on eves arm on channel they were talking about this new lead and these other murders a drug connection i didnt even know the other people who got whacked i didnt even know them dallas so its going to come out that it was somebody else and its all going to be over its going to take a little time yet mavis eve stopped felt her heart drop at the flickers of panic in maviss eyes worked up a smile yeah its all going to be over pizza huh i could use some great mag im going to find summerset and tell him were ready for it take dallas up and show her okay she darted out it really lifted her leonardo said quietly that news report she needed a lift the blue squirrel let her go let her go bastards trina muttered around a canape management decided it wasnt in their best interest to have an accused murderer headlining it shook her bad i had the idea to take her mind off it this way im sorry i should have cleared it with you first no its fine eve took another sip of wine and braced herself lets go do me then chapter twelve it wasnt so bad eve decided not when compared to the riots of the urban wars the torture chambers of the spanish inquisition a test ride on the xr moon jet and she was a cop a tenyear vet used to facing danger she was certain her eyes wheeled like a panicked horses when trina tested her cropping sheers hey maybe we could just leave it to the experts trina said eve nearly whimpered with relief when she set the shears down again lets see about this she approached unarmed but eve watched warily ive got a hair consult program leonardo looked up from the long table covered with fabrics where he and biff muttered together full morphing capabilities i dont need a stinking program to prove it trina caught eves face in her firm wide hands eyes narrowed she began to move up then around eves head over the jaw up the cheekbones decent bone structure she approved who do you use for what face sculpting god trina paused snickered then let out an earblasting laugh the tone of a rusted tuba i like your cop mavis shes the best mavis said drunkenly she perched on a nearby stool studying herself in the triple mirrors maybe you could do me too trina the lawyers suggested i go for a more sedate look you know brunette or something fuck that trina pressed her thumbs under eves jaw to lift it ive got some new shit thatll blast any judge out of his robe cutie bordello pink with silver tipping just on the market oh yeah mavis flipped her sapphire locks back and considered what i could do for you with a little highlighting eves blood ran cold just the cut right were just snipping a little yeah yeah trina pushed eves head onto her chest this color a gift from god too she chuckled to herself yanked eves head back and dragged all the hair away from her face the eyes are good the brows could use a little work but we can fix that give me some more wine mavis eve shut the eyes that were good and told herself whatever happened it would grow back okay wet down trina whirled the chair and its reluctant occupant to a portasink tipped it back until eves neck was braced in the padded slot close your eyes and enjoy honey i give the best shampoo and head massage in the business there was something to be said for that the wine or trinas clever fingers mellowed eves mood toward some twilight world of relaxation dimly she heard leonardo and biff arguing over their preferences of crimson satin or scarlet silk for evening pajamas the music leonardo had programmed was something classical with sobbing piano arpeggios and the scent of crushed flowers filled the air why had paul redford told her about the chinese box and the illegals if hed gone back for them himself had them in his possession why would he want their existence known double bluff a ploy maybe there had never been a box to begin with or he knew it was gone already so eve didnt stir until something cold and sticky was slapped on her face then she yelped what the hell a saturnia facial trina glopped on more duncolored goo clear out your pores like a vacuum its a crime to neglect your skin mavis get out the sheena will you whats the sheena never mind with one final shudder eve closed her eyes and surrendered i dont want to know might as well have the full treatment trina slicked more mud under eves jaw quick fingers working up youre tight honey want me to plug in a nice vr program for you no no this is about as fanciful as i can handle thanks okay want to tell me about your man briskly trina tugged open the robe eve had been ordered to wear and clamped her mud coated hands on eves breasts when eves eyes popped open fired she laughed dont you worry im not into females your mans going to love your tits when im done with them he likes them just fine now yeah but saturnias breast smoother is top of the line theyll feel like rose petals take my word is he a nibbler or a sucker eve just closed her eyes again im not even here there you go she heard water run then trina was back and rubbing something into her hair that smelled appealingly of vanilla people paid for this eve reminded herself huge amounts that put gaping holes in their credit accounts people were obviously insane she kept her eyes stubbornly closed as something warm and wet was laid over her mudcovered breasts her face conversations went on cheerfully around her mavis and trina discussed various beauty aids leonardo and biff consulted over line and color very insane eve thought then let out a groan as her feet were massaged they were dipped in something hot and oddly pleasant she heard the crackle of something felt her feet being lifted covered then her hands received the same treatment she tolerated it tolerated even the quick buzz of something around her eyebrows and felt heroic when she heard mavis laugh easily and flirt with leonardo she had to keep maviss spirits up she thought it was as vital as every step in the investigation it wasnt enough to represent the dead she squeezed her eyes tighter when she heard the snip of trinas shears felt the light tugs the comb through hair was just hair she told herself appearances didnt matter oh jesus dont let her scalp me she forced her mind to focus on work ran through questions she would ask redford in the morning considered his possible answers it was likely she would be called to the commanders office about the news leak she would deal with that she needed a conference with both feeney and peabody it was time to see if any of the data the three of them had dug up would dovetail shed go back to the club have crack turn her on to some of the regulars someone might have seen whoever had spooked boomer that night and if that same person had talked to hetta she jerked when trina adjusted the chair to recline and began to scrub off the mud shell be ready for you in five trina told an impatient leonardo i dont rush my genius she grinned down at eve youve got decent skin im going to leave some samples with you use them youll keep it decent mavis peered down and eve began to feel like a patient on an operating table you did a wonderful job on the eyebrows trina they look so natural all she needs to do is dye her lashes they dont even need a lengthener and dont you think that dimple in her chin is mag mavis eve said wearily i dont want to have to hit you mavis only grinned pizzas here have a bite she stuffed some in eves mouth wait till you see your skin dallas its gorgeous eve only grunted the hot cheese had seared the roof of her mouth but it also stirred juices she risked choking and took the rest of the slice while trina bound up her hair in a silver turban its thermal trina told her as she shot the chair back up ive got a root and shaft penetrator on it eve eyed the reflection maybe her skin did look dewy and at a wary stroke of her fingers it certainly felt smooth but she couldnt see even a single strand of hair ive got hair under there right my hair sure you do okay leonardo shes yours for twenty minutes at last he beamed take off the robe oh look dallas were all professionals you have to try on the foundation for the wedding dress it will certainly need a few adjustments shed already been felt up by a stylist eve decided why not stand naked in a roomful of people she shrugged out of the robe leonardo came at her with something white and sleek before she could do much more than squeak he had it around her torso and snugged at her back his big hands reached under the material fussily adjusted her breasts bending down he drew a swatch of material between her legs secured it stepped back ah holy hell dallas roarkes tongues going to land on his feet when he gets you down to that what the hell is it a variation on the old merry widow with quick nips and tucks leonardo perfected the fit i call it a curvaceous added a bit of lift under the breasts for you yours are quite nice but this line adds more contour just a touch of lace a few pearls nothing too ornate he turned her to face the mirror she looked sexy curvy ripe eve realized with some amazement the material had a faint gleam to it as though it was damp it nipped at her waist molded her hips and she had to admit lifted her bustline to new fascinating heights well i guess for you know wedding nights for any nights mavis said dreamily oh leonardo are you going to make me one i already have in rascal red satin now dallas does it pinch anywhere rub no she couldnt get over it it should have been torturous but it was as comfortable as a sprint suit experimentally she bent twisted its just sort of there excellent biff found the material at a little cottage shop on richer five now the dress its only basted so we take care lift your arms please he slipped it over her let it float down the material was stunning eve could see that even when it was streaked with tailors marks it seemed perfect to her the sleek column the snug sleeves the simple line but leonardo creased his brow and tugged at the material folded bunched the neckline works yes where is the necklace huh the copper and stone necklace didnt i tell you to ask for it i cant just tell roarke i want a necklace leonardo sighed turned eve around and exchanged a look with mavis he nodded then tested the line at eves hips youve lost weight he accused no i havent yes at least two pounds he clucked his tongue i wont take it in yet see that you put them back on biff marched over and held a bolt of material next to her face with a nod he marched away muttering into his notebook biff would you show her the other designs while i note the adjustments to the gown with a flourish biff switched on a wall monitor as you can see leonardo has taken both your lifestyle and your body line into consideration with these designs this simple day suit is perfect for a corporate lunch a press conference unrestricted yet tres tres chic the material were using is a blended linen with just a whisper of silk the color is citrine with trim of garnet uhhuh it looked like a nice simple suit to eve but it was a jolt to see the computergenerated image of herself modeling it biff yes lieutenant why do you have a map tattooed on your head he smiled i have a very poor sense of direction now this next design continues the theme she viewed a dozen they blurred together in her mind rayspan in citrus lemon breton lace with velvet classic black silk every time mavis oohed or aahed eve ordered recklessly what was being in debt for the rest of her life compared to her closest friends peace of mind thatll keep you two busy awhile the minute leonardo slipped the dress back off trina bundled eve into the robe lets take a look at the crowning glory after unwinding the turban she pulled a wide forked comb out of her twirling curls and began to pick smooth and fluff eves initial relief that she had hair to be fussed with faded quickly as she stared directly at a snaking pink spring who does your hair trina nobody touches me but me she winked and god take a look braced for the worst eve turned the woman in the mirror was definitely eve dallas at first she thought it had all been some elaborate joke and nothing had been done at all then she looked closer stepped closer gone were the wild tufts and stray spikes her hair was still casually cropped unstructured but it seemed to have a shape after all and certainly it hadnt had that pretty shine before it followed the lines of her face nicely the fringe of bangs the curve at the cheeks and when she shook her head it fell back into place obediently eyes narrowed she raked fingers through it and watched it tumble back did you put blond in it nope natural highlights brought them out with sheena thats all you got deer hair what ever seen a deer hide its got all those colors from russet brown gold even touches of black thats what youve got there gods been good to you trouble is whoevers been doing you must have been using hedge trimmers and no highlight puncher either it looks good damn right it does im a genius you look beautiful suddenly mavis put her face in her hands and wept youre getting married oh christ dont do that mavis come on feeling helpless eve gave her encouraging pats on the back im so drunk and im so happy and im so scared dallas i lost my job i know baby im sorry youll get another one a better one i dont care i dont care im not going to care were going to have the most mag wedding arent we dallas you bet leonardos making me the most rocking dress lets show her leonardo tomorrow he came over scooped her into his arms dallas is tired oh yeah she needs to rest mavis let her head loll on his shoulder she works too hard shes worried about me i dont want her to worry leonardo everythings going to be fine isnt it its going to be fine just fine leonardo sent eve one last uneasy look before he carried mavis off eve watched them go sighed fuck like that sweet little thing could bash anybodys face in trina scowled as she gathered up her tools i hope pandoras burning in hell you knew her everybody in the business knew her loathed her ever fucking guts right biff she was born a bitch died a bitch did she just use or did she deal biff slanted a look at trina then shrugged she never dealt in the open but youd hear talk now and again that she was always well supplied the buzz was she was an erotica junkie she liked sex and she might deal to her partner of choice were you ever her partner of choice he smiled romantically i prefer men theyre less complicated how about you i prefer men too same reason so did she trina picked up her kit last runway gig i had the gossip was she was mixing business and pleasure had some guy she was bleeding she was flashing a lot of new glitters pandora liked to decorate her body with real rock but she didnt like to pay for it people figured shed made some deal with a source got a name on the source nope but she was on her palm link between changes all day that was about three months ago i dont know who she was talking to but at least one of the calls was intergalactic because she got royally pissed at the delay did she always carry a palm link everybody in fashion and beauty does honey were just like doctors o o it was close to midnight when eve settled down at her desk she couldnt face the bedroom preferred the suite she used for privacy and work she programmed coffee then forgot to drink it without feeney she had no choice but to go a roundabout route to try to trace a threemonthold intergalactic call from a palm link she didnt have after an hour she gave up and crawled onto the sleep chair shed take a nap she told herself set her mental alarm for five a m illegals murder and money she thought they went together pin down the source she thought groggily identify the unknown who were you hiding from boomer how did you get your hands on a sample and the formula who broke your bones to get them back the image of his battered body flashed into her mind and was ruthlessly shut off she didnt need to drift into sleep with that loop playing it might have been a better choice than the show she ended with o o the dirty red light was flashing over and over through the window sex live sex live she was only eight but her mind was quick she wondered if people would pay to see dead sex lying on her bed she watched the light blink she knew what sex was it was ugly it was painful it was frightening it was inescapable maybe he wouldnt come home tonight shed stopped praying that he would forget where hed left her or fall down dead in some handy ditch he always came back but sometimes if she was very very lucky he would be too drunk too buzzed to do more than stumble to the bed and snore those nights she would shiver with relief and huddle in the corner to sleep she still thought about escape of finding a way out of the locked door or down the five stories if the night was very bad she imagined just jumping from the window the flight down would be quick and then it would be over he wouldnt be able to hurt her then but she was too much a coward to jump she was only a child after all and tonight she was hungry and she was cold because he had broken the temperature control in one of his rages and it was stuck on full air she padded toward the corner of the room the excuse for a kitchenette experienced she pounded the drawer first to send any roaches scattering she found a chocolate roll inside the last one he would probably beat her for eating the last one then again he would beat her anyway so she might as well enjoy it she bolted it like an animal wiped her mouth with the back of her hand hunger churned still a further search turned up a hunk of moldy cheese she didnt want to think what had been nibbling on it carefully she took a knife began to shear off the nasty edges then she heard him at the door in her panic she dropped the knife it clattered to the floor as he came in what are you doing little girl nothing i woke up i was just going to get a drink of water woke up his eyes were glazed but not glazed enough she saw without hope missing your daddy come give your daddy a kiss she couldnt breathe already she couldnt breathe and the place between her legs where he would hurt her began to throb in painful fear i have a stomachache oh ill kiss it better he was grinning as he crossed to her then the grin faded youve been eating without asking again havent you havent you no i but the lie and the hope to evade both died as his hand swiped hard over her face her lip split her eyes watered but she barely winced i was going to fix some cheese a snack for when you he hit her again hard enough to make stars explode inside her head she went down this time and before she could scramble up he was on her screams her screams because his fists were hard and merciless pain blinding numbing pain that was nothing beside the fear the fear because however horrible this would not be the worst he did to her daddy please please please have to punish you you never listen never fucking listen then ill give you a treat a nice big treat and youll be a good girl his breath was hot on her face and somehow smelled like candy his hands tore at her already tattered clothes poking squeezing invading his breathing changed a change she knew and feared it became shallow greedy no no it hurts it hurts her poor young flesh resisted she batted at him screaming still was driven beyond fear to claw his cry of rage bellowed out he twisted her arm back she heard the dry hideous sound of her own bone snapping lieutenant lieutenant dallas the scream ripped from her throat and she came to swinging blindly in wild panic she scrambled up her own legs tangling and taking her to the floor in a heap lieutenant she reared away from the hand that touched her shoulder huddled back as sobs and screams knotted in her throat you were dreaming summerset spoke carefully his face impassive she might have seen the realization in his eyes if her own hadnt been clouded with memory you were dreaming he repeated approaching her as he would a trapped wolf you had a nightmare stay away from me go away stay away lieutenant do you know where you are i know where i am she got the words out between quick gulps of air she was freezing boiling and couldnt stop the tremors go away just go away she made it as far as her knees then covered her mouth and rocked get the hell out of here let me help you to the chair his hands were gentle but firm enough to keep hold when she tried to shove him away i dont need help im going to help you to your chair as far as he was concerned she was a child now a wounded one who needed care as his marlena had been he tried not to think if his child had begged as eve had begged after he put her in the chair he went to a chest drew out a blanket her teeth were chattering and her eyes were wide with shock be still the order was brisk as she began to push up stay where ive put you and be quiet he turned on his heel striding into the kitchen alcove and the autochef there was sweat on his brow and he dabbed at it with a handkerchief as he ordered a soother his hand was shaking it didnt surprise him her screams had chilled him to the bone and brought him to her suite at a dead run theyd been a childs screams steadying himself he carried the glass to her drink it i dont want drink it or ill pour it down your throat with pleasure she considered knocking it out of his hand then embarrassed them both by curling into a ball and whimpering giving up summerset set the drink aside tucked the blanket more securely around her and went out with the object of contacting roarkes personal physician but it was roarke himself he met on the landing summerset dont you ever sleep its lieutenant dallas shes roarke dropped his briefcase grabbed summerset by the lapels has she been hurt where is she a nightmare she was screaming summerset lost his usual composure and dragged a hand over his hair she wont cooperate i was about to call your doctor i left her in her private suite as roarke pushed him aside summerset grabbed his arm roarke you should have told me what had been done to her roarke merely shook his head and kept going ill take care of her he found her curled up tight trembling emotions warred through him anger relief sorrow and guilt he battled them back and lifted her gently its all right now eve roarke she shuddered once convulsively then curved into him as he settled back in the chair with her on his lap the dreams i know he pressed a kiss to her damp temple im sorry they come all the time now all the time nothing stops them eve why didnt you tell me he tipped her head back to look at her face you dont have to go through this alone nothing stops them she repeated i couldnt not remember anymore and now i remember all of it she rubbed the heels of her hands over her face i killed him roarke i killed my father chapter thirteen he looked into her eyes felt the tremors that still shook her darling you had a nightmare i had a flashback she had to be calm had to be to get it all out to be calm and rational she had to think like a cop not like a woman not like a terrorized child it was so clear roarke that i can still feel it on me still feel him on me the room in dallas where hed lock me hed always lock me in wherever he took me once i tried to get away to run away and he caught me after that he always got rooms high up and locked the door from the outside i never got to go out i dont think anyone even knew i was there she tried to clear her raw throat i need some water here drink this he picked up the glass summerset had left beside the chair no its a tranq i dont want a tranq she let air in and out of her lungs i dont need one all right no ill get it he shifted her rose caught the doubt in her eyes just water eve i promise accepting his word she took the glass he brought back and drank gratefully when he sat on the arm of the chair she stared straight ahead and continued i remember the room ive been having part of this dream for the past couple of weeks details were beginning to stick i even went to see dr mira she glanced over no i didnt tell you i couldnt all right he tried to accept that but youre going to tell me now i have to tell you now she took a breath brought it all into her mind as she would any crime scene i was awake in that room hoping hed be too drunk to touch me when he came back it was late she didnt have to close her eyes to see it the filthy room the blink of the red light through the dirty windows cold she murmured hed broken the temperature control and it was cold i could see my breath she shivered in reaction but i was hungry too i got something to eat he never kept much around i was hungry all the time i was cutting the mold off some cheese when he came in the door opening the fear the clatter of the knife she wanted to get up pace off the nerves but wasnt sure her legs were ready to support her i could see right away that he wasnt drunk enough i could see i remember what he looked like now he had dark brown hair and a face gone soft from drinking he might have been handsome once but that was gone broken capillaries in his face in his eyes he had big hands maybe it was just because i was small but they seemed awfully big roarke lifted his hands to her shoulders began to massage the tension they cant hurt you now cant touch you now no except in the dreams she thought there was pain in dreams he got mad because id been eating i wasnt supposed to take anything without asking christ he tucked the blanket more securely around her because she was still shivering and found he wanted to feed her anything everything so she would never think about hunger again he started hitting me and hitting me she heard her voice hitch made the effort to level it its just a report now she told herself nothing more knocked me down and hit me my face my body i was crying and screaming begging him to stop he tore my clothes and rammed his fingers in me it hurt horribly because hed raped me the night before and i was still hurting from that then he was raping me again panting in my face telling me to be a good girl and raping me it felt like everything inside me was tearing the pain was so bad i couldnt take it anymore i clawed at him i must have drawn blood thats when he broke my arm roarke stood abruptly paced away jabbed the mechanism to open the windows he needed air i dont know if i blacked out maybe for a minute i think but i couldnt get past the pain sometimes you can yes he said dully i know but it was so enormous black greasy waves of pain and he wouldnt stop the knife was in my hand it was just there in my hand i stabbed him with it she let out a shuddering breath as roarke turned to her i stabbed him and kept stabbing him blood was everywhere the raw sweet smell of it i crawled out from under him he might have been dead already but i kept stabbing him roarke i can see myself kneeling the hilt in my hand blood past my wrists splattered on my face and the pain the rage pounding at me i just couldnt stop who would have he wondered who could have then i pulled myself into the corner to get away from him because when he got up hed kill me i passed out or just zoned because i dont remember anything else until it was daylight and i hurt i hurt so bad everywhere i got sick really sick and when i was finished i saw i saw he reached down for her hand and it was like ice thin brittle ice thats enough eve no let me finish i have to finish she pushed the words out as though she were shoving rocks off her heart i saw i knew id killed him and theyd come for me put me in a cage a dark cage thats what hed always told me they did if you werent good i went in the bathroom and washed off all the blood my arm my arm was screaming but i didnt want to go in a cage i put on some clothes and i put everything else that was mine in a bag i kept imagining he was going to get up and come for me but he stayed dead i left him there i started walking it was early early in the morning hardly anyone was out i threw away the bag or i lost it i cant remember i walked a long way then i went into an alley and hid until night she rubbed a hand over her mouth she could remember that too the dark the stench the fear overriding even pain then i walked more and kept walking until i couldnt walk anymore i found another alley i dont know how long i stayed there but thats where they found me by then i didnt remember anything what had happened where i was who i was i still dont remember my name he never called me by my name your names eve dallas he cupped her face in his hands and that part of your life is over you survived it you overcame it now youve remembered it and its done roarke looking at him she knew she had never loved anyone more never would its not i have to face what ive done the reality of it and the consequences i cant marry you now tomorrow i have to turn in my badge what insanity is this i killed my father do you understand there has to be an investigation even if im cleared it doesnt negate the fact that my application for the academy my records are fraudulent as long as the investigation is ongoing i cant be a cop and i cant marry you steadier she rose i have to pack try it his voice was low dangerous and it stopped her roarke i have to follow procedure no you have to be human he strode to the door and slammed it shut do you think youre walking out on me on your life because you defended yourself against a monster i killed my father you killed a fucking monster you were a child are you going to stand there look me in the face and tell me that child was to blame she opened her mouth closed it its not a matter of how i see it roarke the law the law should have protected you with visions dancing evilly in his head he snapped he could all but hear the tight wire of control break goddamn the law what good did it do either one of us when we needed it most you want to chuck your badge because the laws too fucking weak to care for its innocents for its children be my guest throw your career away but youre not getting rid of me he started to grab her by the shoulders then dropped his hands i cant touch you shaken by the violence that spewed up in him he stepped back im afraid to put my hands on you i couldnt stand it if being with me reminded you of what he did no appalled it was she who reached out no it doesnt it couldnt theres nothing but you and me when you touch me its just that i have to handle this alone it was he realized the most bitter of words the way you had to handle the nightmares alone i cant go back and kill him for you eve id give everything i have and more if i could do that one thing but i cant i wont let you deal with this without me thats not an option for either of us sit down roarke please sit down he took one cleansing breath she wouldnt listen to anger he decided nor from him to reason do you trust dr mira yes i mean as far as you trust anyone he finished thatll do he walked over to her desk what are you doing im going to call her its the middle of the night i know what time it is he engaged the link im willing to abide by her advice on this im asking you to do the same she started to argue but found no solid ground weary she dropped her head into her hands all right she stayed there barely listening to roarkes quiet voice the murmured responses when he came back to her he reached out a hand she stared at it shes on her way will you come downstairs im not doing this to hurt you or make you angry youve accomplished both but thats not the main issue here he took her hand and drew her to her feet i wont let you go eve if you didnt love me or want me or need me i would have to but you do love me and want me and though you still have difficulty with the concept you need me wont use you she thought but she said nothing as they went downstairs it didnt take mira long in her usual manner she arrived promptly and perfectly groomed she greeted roarke serenely took one look at eve and sat id love a brandy if you wouldnt mind i believe the lieutenant should join me as roarke saw to the drinks she looked around the room what a perfectly lovely home it feels happy she smiled cocked her head why eve youve changed your hair its very flattering baffled roarke stopped stared what have you done to it eve lifted a shoulder nothing really just men mira took her brandy swirled why do we bother when my husband fails to notice a change he always says its because he adores me for me not for my hair i usually let him get away with it now then she sat back can you tell me yes eve repeated everything shed told roarke but it was the cops voice now cool composed detached its been a difficult night for you mira skimmed her gaze over roarke for both of you it might be hard to believe that it will begin to be better now can you accept that your mind was ready to deal with this i suppose the memories started coming more clearly more often after that she closed her eyes a few months ago i answered a domestic disturbance call i was too late the father was on zeus hed hacked the little girl to death before i got in i terminated him yes i remember the child she might have been you instead you survived my father didnt and how does that make you feel glad and uneasy knowing i have that much hate in me he beat you he raped you he was your father and you should have been safe with him you werent how do you believe you should feel about that it was years ago it was yesterday mira corrected it was an hour ago yes eve looked down at her brandy and squeezed the tears back was it wrong to defend yourself no not to defend but i killed him even when he was dead i kept killing him this blinding hate uncontrollable rage i was like an animal he had treated you like an animal made you an animal yes she said at eves shudder more than stealing your childhood your innocence he stripped you of your humanity there are technical terms for a personality capable of doing what he did to you but in simple english she said in her cool tones he was a monster mira watched eves eyes dart to roarke linger drop away he took your freedom she continued and your choices marked you branded you defiled you you werent human to him and if the situation hadnt changed you might never have been more than an animal if you had survived at all and yet after you escaped you made yourself what are you now eve a cop mira smiled shed expected exactly that answer and then a person a responsible person yeah capable of friendship loyalty compassion humor love eve looked at roarke yes but was the child capable no she i was too afraid to feel all right ive changed eve pressed a hand to her temple surprised and relieved to find the headache drumming there was easing ive made myself into something decent but that doesnt override the fact that i killed there has to be an investigation mira arched a brow naturally you can instigate one if finding your fathers identity is important to you is it no i dont give a damn about that its procedure excuse me mira held up a hand you want to instigate an investigation into the death of this man by your hand when you were eight years old its procedure eve said stubbornly and requires my automatic suspension until the investigative team is satisfied its also best if my personal plans are put on hold until the matter is resolved sensing roarkes fury mira flicked him a warning glance and watched him win the bitter battle for control resolved in what manner she asked reasonably i dont want to presume to tell you your job lieutenant but were talking about a matter that took place some twentytwo years ago it was yesterday eve found some hollow pleasure in tossing miras words back at her it was an hour ago emotionally yes mira agreed unruffled but in practical terms and legal ones more than two decades there will be no body or physical evidence to examine there are of course the records of your condition when you were found the abuse the malnutrition and neglect the trauma now there is your memory do you feel your story will change during interview no of course not but its procedure youre a very good cop eve mira said gently if this matter came across your desk exactly as it is what would be your professional and objective direction before you answer be careful and be honest theres no point in punishing yourself or that innocent misused child what would you do id beaten she set down the snifter and pressed her hands to her eyes id close it then close it its not up to me ill be happy to take this up with your commander in private give him the facts and my personal recommendation i think you know what his decision would be we need people like you to serve and protect eve theres a man here who needs you to trust him i do trust him she braced herself to look over at roarke im afraid of using him it doesnt matter what other people think about the money about the power i dont want to ever give him reason to think i ever could or ever would use him does he think it she closed a hand around the diamond hanging between her breasts hes too much in love with me to think it now well id say thats lovely and before much longer you might figure out the difference between depending on someone you love and trust and exploiting their strengths mira rose id tell you to take a sedative and tomorrow off but youll do neither no i wont im sorry to have dragged you away from home in the middle of the night cops and doctors were used to it youll talk with me again she wanted to refuse to deny as she had spent years refusing and denying but that time eve realized was over yes all right on impulse mira laid a hand on eves cheek and kissed her youll do eve then she turned to roarke and extended her hand im glad you called me i have a personal interest in the lieutenant so do i thank you i hope youll invite me to the wedding ill see myself out roarke walked over sat beside eve would it be better for you if i gave away my money my properties tossed aside my companies and started from scratch whatever shed been expecting it hadnt been this she gaped at him would you he leaned forward kissed her lightly no the laugh that bubbled out surprised her i feel like an idiot you should he linked his fingers with hers let me help take the pain away youve been doing that since you walked in the door with a sigh she rested her brow on his tolerate me roarke im a good cop i know what im doing when the badge is on its when i take it off im not so sure of my moves im a tolerant man i can accept your dark spaces eve just as you accept mine come on lets go to bed youll sleep he brought her to her feet again and if you have nightmares you wont hide them from me no not anymore what is it eyes narrowed he combed his fingers through her hair you did change it subtly but charmingly and theres something else he rubbed a thumb over her jawline eve wiggled her eyebrows hoping hed noticed their new improved shape but he only continued to stare at her what youre beautiful really quite beautiful youre tired no im not he leaned in closed his mouth over hers softly in a long lingering kiss at all o o peabody was staring and eve decided not to notice she had coffee and anticipating feeneys arrival had even come up with a basket of muffins the shades were open to her own spectacular view of new york with its spearing skyline behind the lush green of the park she supposed she couldnt blame peabody for gaping i really appreciate you coming here instead of to cop central eve began she knew she wasnt running at full capability yet just as she knew mavis couldnt afford for her to take any down time i want to get some of this business squared away before i clock in as soon as i do i imagine whitney will call me up i need ammunition no problem peabody knew there really were people who lived like this shed heard of it read of it seen it on screen and there was nothing particularly fabulous about the lieutenants rooms they were nice certainly plenty of space good furnishings excellent equipment but the house jesus the house it went beyond the category of mansion into that of fortress or maybe even castle the green lawns flowering trees and fountains there were all the towers the sparkle of stone that was before you were brought inside by a butler and blown away by marble and crystal and wood and space so much space peabody what sorry its all right the place is pretty intimidating its incredible she swung her gaze back to eve you look different here she decided then narrowed her eyes you do look different hey you got your hair cut and the eyebrows intrigued she leaned closer a skin job it was just a facial eve caught herself just before she squirmed can we get down to it now or do you want the name of my consultant couldnt afford it peabody said cheerfully but you look good you want to start primping up since youre getting married in a couple weeks its not a couple weeks its next month guess you havent noticed that its next month now youre nervous amusement flitted around peabodys mouth you never get nervous shut up peabody weve got homicide here yes sir slightly ashamed peabody swallowed the smirk i thought we were killing time until captain feeney arrived ive got a ten oclock interview with redford i dont have time to kill give me the rundown of your progress at the club i have my report back in the saddle peabody took a disc out of her bag i arrived at seventeen thirtyfive approached the subject known as crack and identified myself as your aide what did you think of him an individual peabody said dryly he suggested i would make a good table dancer as i appeared to have strong legs i told him it wasnt an option at this time good one he was cooperative in my judgment he was angry when i informed him of hettas death and the means she hadnt worked there long but he said she was goodnatured efficient and successful in those words in the vernacular dallas his vernacular which is quoted in my report he did not observe who she spoke with after the incident with boomer as the club was crowded and he was busy cracking heads exactly he did however point out several other employees and regulars who might have seen her with someone i have their names and their statements none noticed anything peculiar or out of the ordinary one client believed he observed her going into one of the private booths with another man but he didnt recall the time and his description is vague a tall dude terrific she clocked out at oh two fifteen which was more than an hour earlier than her habit she told one of the other companions that shed made over her quota and was calling it a night flashed a fistful of credits and cash bragged about a new customer who believed in paying for quality that was the last time she was seen at the club her body was found three days later frustrated eve pushed away from the table if id gotten the case sooner or if carmichael had bothered to dig well thats done she was well liked did she have a partner no one serious or long term those kind of clubs discourage dating the customers on the outside and apparently hetta was a real pro she did move around from club to club but so far i havent hit on anything if she worked anywhere the night she died theres no record of it did she use socially casually nothing heavy according to the people i spoke with i checked her sheet and other than a couple of old possession charges she was clean how old five years okay keep on it hettas yours she glanced over as feeney strolled in glad you could join us hey traffics murder out there muffins he pounced hows it going peabody good morning captain some digs huh new shirt dallas no look different he poured coffee while she rolled her eyes found our snake tattoo mavis hit ground zero at about two bought herself a screamer and a table dancer talked to the guy myself last night after i bounced to it he remembers her said she was way out of orbit and chugging them back he offered her a list of accepted services but she passed and staggered out feeney sighed sat if she crawled into any other clubs she didnt use credit ive got nothing after her totaling out from ground zero at two fortyfive wheres ground zero about six blocks from the murder scene shed been moving steadily down and across town from the time she left pandora and walked into zigzag she went into five other clubs between screamers all the way mostly triples i dont know how she stayed on her feet six blocks dallas murmured thirty minutes before the murder im sorry kid it doesnt make it look any better for her now the security discs leonardos scanner was busted up at ten on the night in question lots of complaints about kids whacking outside cameras in that area so its likely thats how it went down pandoras security was turned off using the code no fiddling no sabotage whoever went in knew how to get in knew her knew the setup had to feeney agreed i cant find any blips on the discs from justin youngs building security ive got them going in about one thirty and her going out again at ten or twelve the next day nothing in between but he paused for effect hes got a back door what domestic entrance through the kitchen to a freight elevator no security on the freight it goes to six other floors and the garage now the garage has security and so do the other floors but another pause you can also take it to the rear utility ground floor the maintenance area and securitys very spotty there could they have gotten out unobserved could have feeney slurped coffee if they knew the building the system and if they were careful to time the exit to avoid the sweep in maintenance could put a different light on their alibis bless you feeney yeah well send money or just give me these muffins theyre yours i think well have to talk to our young lovers again weve got some interesting players here justin young used to sleep with pandora and is now intimately involved with jerry fitzgerald who is one of pandoras associates and her top rival for queen of the runway both fitzgerald and pandora are after a screen career enter redford producer hes interested in working with fitzgerald has worked with young and is sleeping with pandora all four of these people are partying at pandoras at her invitation on the night shes killed now why would she want them there her rival her exlover and the producer she liked drama peabody put in she enjoyed friction yeah true she also liked causing discomfort i wonder if she had something she wanted to rub their faces in they were all very calm in interview she recalled very composed very easy lets see if we can shake them up eve glanced over as the panel between her offices and roarkes slid open it wasnt secured he said as he stopped on the threshold im interrupting its all right we just need to finish up hey roarke feeney toasted him with a muffin ready to strap on the old ball and chain just a joke he muttered when eve scalded him with a look i think ill continue to hobble along well enough he glanced at peabody lifted a brow sorry officer peabody roarke at eves introduction he smiled crossed the room the efficient officer peabody its a pleasure struggling not to goggle she accepted the hand he offered nice to meet you if i could steal the lieutenant for just a moment ill get out of your way he laid a hand on eves shoulder squeezed when she rose to go with him feeney snorted youre going to swallow your tongue peabody why is it just because a mans got the face of a devil and the body of a god women get all glassyeyed its hormonal peabody muttered but she continued to watch roarke and eve shed developed an interest in relationship games recently how are you roarke asked im fine he cupped eves chin dipped his thumb lightly in its dent i believe youre working at it i have some meetings in midtown this morning but i thought youd want this he handed her a card one of his own with a name and address scrawled on the back its the off planet expert you asked about shell make time for whatever you need she already has the sample you gave to me but would like another crosstesting i believe she called it thanks eve slipped the card into her pocket really the reports from starlight station starlight station it took her a moment christ i forgot i asked you my minds not cued it has a great deal to do just now in any case my sources tell me pandora did quite a bit of socializing this last trip which is usual there didnt seem to be anyone in particular she was interested in at least not for more than one night shit is it always sex with her it was a priority he smiled when eves eyes narrowed and speculated and as i said before our short liaison was a long time ago she did however make a number of calls all on her pocket link she never used the resorts system no outside record eve mused that would be my take she was on assignment and did her job with her usual flair theres some talk about the way she bragged about a new product she was going to endorse and a video eve grunted and filed the data away i appreciate the time always happy to support our local police we have an appointment with the florist at three can you make it she shuffled obligations in her head if you can squeeze it in so can i not willing to risk it he took her logbook out of her pocket and programmed the appointment himself ill see you there he lowered his head watched her eyes shift toward the table across the room i doubt this will diminish your authority he murmured then pressed his lips softly to hers i love you yeah well she cleared her throat okay poetry amused he skimmed a hand through her hair kissed her again to fluster her officer peabody feeney with a nod he stepped back into his office the panel slid shut behind him wipe that stupid grin off your face feeney ive got a dropoff for you she pulled the card back out of her pocket as she went back to the table i need you to take a sample of the powder we took from boomers to this flora expert roarkes cleared it shes not a police and security attache so keep it low profile can do ill be checking in with her later today on her progress peabody youre with me yes sir peabody waited until she was in eves car before she spoke i guess its a lot of work for a cop to juggle personal relationships tell me about it grill suspect lie to commanding officer hassle lab tech order bridal bouquet jesus but if youre steady you know careful it doesnt have to bog down your career if you ask me cops are a bad bet but what do i know in a nervous rhythm she tapped her fingers on the wheel feeneys been married since the dawn of time the commander has a happy home others do it she blew out a breath im working on it it struck her as she drove through the gates you got a personal thing going peabody maybe im thinking about it she rubbed her hands on her pants linked them pulled them apart anybody i know actually peabody shifted her feet its casto casto eve headed crosstown to ninth swung around a commuter tram no shit when did this happen well i ran into him last night that is i caught him shadowing me so shadowing you quickly eve rammed the car to auto it shuddered whined then chugged what the hell are you talking about hes got a good nose he sniffed out we were digging at a lead i was pretty steamed when i tagged him then i had to admit id have done the same thing eve tapped her fingers on the wheel thought about it yeah so would i did he try to pump you peabody flushed deep red stuttered jesus peabody i didnt mean i know i know im not used to this dallas i mean i like men sure she brushed at her bangs checked the collar of her stiff uniform shirt ive been around some but men like casto you know like roarke they fry the circuits yeah it was a relief to be able to lay it out to someone who would understand he did try to slide some data out of me but he took it well enough when i wouldnt give he knows the route the chief says interdepartmental cooperation and we pretty much ignore it you think hes got something of his own he might he made the rounds at the club just like i did thats how i tagged him first then when i left he followed me i led him around for awhile just to see what hed do her smile spread and i backtracked him you should have seen his face when i came up behind him and he knew hed been nailed good work we got into it a little territory and all that then we well we had a drink agreed to put the cop routine on hold it was nice we have a lot of common ground outside the job music and films and stuff hell oh jesus i slept with him oh i know it was stupid but well i did eve waited a moment so how was it wow that good huh then this morning he said maybe we could have dinner or something so it sounds pretty normal to me sobereyed again peabody shook her head guys like that arent attracted to me i know hes got a thing for you eves hand shot up hold on playback come on dallas you know he does hes attracted to you he admires your skill your mind your legs youre not going to tell me you and casto discussed my legs no but your mind came up anyway i dont know if i should take this any farther ive got to concentrate on my career and hes steeped in his when this case is resolved well lose the connection hadnt eve thought the same when roarke had hit her between the eyes it should have been true it usually was youre attracted to him you like him you find him interesting to be around sure and the sex was good the sex was incredible then as your superior peabody my advice is go for it peabody smiled a little then looked out the window maybe ill think about it chapter fourteen eve was pleased with her timing she clocked into cop central at went directly to interview by avoiding her office she avoided any messages from commander whitney demanding her presence she hoped by the time she had to face him shed have the buffer of new information redford was prompt she had to give him that and he was as sleek and unruffled as hed been the first time shed seen him lieutenant i hope this wont take long its a very inconvenient time then well get started right away have a seat she closed and secured the door behind her interview wasnt the most pleasant of atmospheres it wasnt meant to be the conference table was small the chairs hard the walls unadorned the mirror was obviously twoway glass and meant to intimidate she went directly to her recorder engaged and recited the necessary data mr redford you are entitled to counsel or a representative at interview are you reading me my rights lieutenant if you request i do so ill oblige you are not charged but you are entitled to counsel when being questioned in a formal interview do you wish counsel not at this time he flicked a speck of lint from his sleeve gold winked at his wrist in the form of a cuff bracelet im more than willing to cooperate with this investigation as ive proven by coming here today id like to replay your previous statement so that you have the opportunity to add delete or change any portions thereof she slipped the labeled disc into the slot with mild impatience in his eyes redford listened do you wish to stand by that statement as given yes its as accurate as i can remember very well eve replaced the disc and folded her hands you and the victim were sexual partners thats correct this was not an exclusive arrangement not at all neither of us wished it to be did you on the night of the murder engage with the victim in the use of illegals no did you at any other time engage with the victim in the use of illegals he smiled when he angled his head she caught more gold threaded through the sleek queue twisting to his shoulder blades no i didnt share pandoras affection for substances did you have the victims security code for her town house in new york her security code his brow furrowed i might have it probably for the first time he appeared uneasy eve could all but see his mind weighing his answer and the consequences i imagine she gave it to me at one time or another to simplify matters when i visited her composed again he took out his notebook keyed in data yes i have it here did you use her code to gain access to her home on the night of her murder a domestic let me in there wasnt any need for it no there wouldnt have been before her murder are you aware that her security code also engages and disengages her video system caution flickered in his eyes again im not sure i follow you with the code which you state is in your possession the outside security camera can be deactivated that camera was deactivated for a period of approximately one hour after the murder during that period mr redford you state you were at your club alone during that period someone who knew the victim who was in possession of her code who was aware of the workings of her home and security deactivated the system entered the house and it would seem took something from the house i would have no reason to do any of those things i was at my club lieutenant i keyed in and out a member can key in and out without ever going in she watched his face harden you saw an ornate possibly chinese antique box from which you state the victim took a substance and ingested it you further state that she then locked the box away in the vanity of her bedroom this box has not been found are you sure this box existed there was ice now but beneath it just around the edges of it she thought she caught something else not panic not yet but wariness and worry are you certain the box you described existed mr redford i saw it and the key the key he reached for a pitcher of water his hand was still steady eve noted but that mind was working overtime she wore it on a chain a gold chain around her neck no chain or key was recovered on the body or at the scene then it would follow that the murderer took it wouldnt it lieutenant did she wear the key openly no she he stopped the muscles in his jaw twitching very good lieutenant as far as i am aware she wore it under her clothes but as i have stated i am not the only one who was invited to see pandora without clothing why were you paying her i beg your pardon over the past eighteen months you transferred over three hundred thousand dollars into the victims credit accounts why his eyes went blank but eve saw for the first time fear behind them certainly what i do with my money is my own business no its not not when its murder was she blackmailing you thats absurd plays for me she had something on you something dangerous embarrassing something she enjoyed holding over you she nibbled away demanding little payments here and there and some not so little i imagine she was the type to flaunt that kind of power to enjoy it a man could get tired of that a man could begin to realize there was only one way to end it it wasnt the money really was it mr redford it was the power the control and that enjoyment she rubbed in your face his breathing deepened raggedly but his face remained still i would say that pandora was not above blackmail lieutenant but she had nothing on me and i would not tolerate threats what would you do about them a man in my position can afford to ignore quite a bit in my business success is much more important than gossip then why did you pay her for sex thats insulting no i suppose a man in your position wouldnt have to pay for sex still it might add a certain twist to the excitement do you ever frequent the down and dirty club on the east end i dont frequent the east end and i certainly dont frequent a secondrate sex club but you know what it is were you ever there with pandora no alone i said i hadnt been there where were you on june tenth at approximately two am what is this can you verify your whereabouts on that date and time i dont know where i was i dont have to answer that were your payments to pandora business payments gifts yes no he fisted his hands under the table i believe id like to consult with counsel now sure your choice we will break this interview to allow subject to exercise his right to consult counsel disengage she smiled youd better tell them all you know youd better tell someone and if youre not in this alone id advise you to start thinking seriously about rolling over she pushed back from the table theres a public link outside i have my own he said stiffly if you could show me to a room where i can make my call privately no problem come with me o o eve managed to avoid whitney by transmitting an update and steering clear of her desk she snagged peabody and headed out you shook redford you really shook him that was the idea it was the way you kept coming at him from different angles everything straight down the line at first then pow you tripped him up with the club hell get his balance back i still have the payment he made to fitzgerald to pitch at him but hell be more prepared this reprieve with his lawyers yeah and he wont underestimate you again you think he did it i think he could have he hated her if we can link him to the drugs well see so many angles to explore eve thought and time was racing racing toward maviss pretrial hearing if she didnt have something solid within the next couple of days i want that unknown idd i want to know the source we find the source we follow it is that when youre going to bring casto in thats a professional inquiry hed have better contacts ill share the wealth once we have the unknown nailed her link beeped and she winced shit shit shit i know thats whitney i can feel it she blanked her face and answered dallas what the hell are you doing sir checking a lead im en route to the lab i left orders for you to be in my office at oh nine hundred im sorry commander i didnt receive that transmission i havent been to my desk if youve received my report youll see that ive been tied up in interview this morning subject is currently consulting counsel i believe cut the tap dance lieutenant i spoke with dr mira a few minutes ago her skin seemed to ice over go stiff sir im disappointed in you lieutenant he spoke slowly his eyes hard on hers that you would consider wasting the departments time and manpower on such a matter we have no intention nor desire to investigate formally or to launch any informal inquiries into the incident this matter is closed and will remain closed is that understood lieutenant emotions swirled relief guilt gratitude sir i yes understood very well the leak to channel has caused major problems here yes sir snap back she ordered herself think of mavis im sure it has you are aware of departmental policy on unauthorized leaks to the media well aware how is ms furst i thought she looked quite well on screen commander he scowled but there was a glint in his eye you stay on the balls of your feet dallas and you be here my office eighteen hundred we have a fucking press conference good dodge peabody congratulated and all truth except that you told him we were en route to the lab i didnt say which lab what was that other business he seemed pretty steamed over it have you got something else going on does it hook with this no its old business dead business grateful to have gotten through it eve glided toward the gate of futures laboratories and research a subsidiary of roarke industries lieutenant dallas nypsd she announced into the scanner you are expected lieutenant please proceed to blue parking facility leave your vehicle and take transport c to the east complex sector six level one you will be met they were met by a lab droid an attractive brunette with milkwhite skin clear blue eyes and a security badge that identified her as anna her voice was as melodious as church bells good afternoon lieutenant i hope you had no trouble finding us no we didnt very good dr engrave will see you in the solarium its very pleasant there if youd follow me thats a droid peabody murmured to eve and anna turned smiled beautifully im a new experimental model there are only ten of us at this stage all in use here at this complex we hope to be on the market within six months the research behind us is very extensive and unfortunately the cost is still prohibitive for most general markets we hope that larger industries will find the expense worthwhile until we can be costeffectively mass produced eve cocked a head has roarke seen you of course roarke approves all new products he was very involved in the design i bet he was through here please anna continued turning into a long arched corridor in hospital white dr engrave has found your specimen highly interesting im sure you will find her very helpful she stopped by a mini wall screen and coded in a sequence anna she announced accompanied by lieutenant dallas and aide the tiles parted opening up into a large room filled with flora and lovely artificial sunlight there was the tinkle of running water and the lazy drone of contented bees i will leave you here and return to lead you out please request any refreshment you might like dr engrave often forgets to offer go smile someplace else anna the testy voice seemed to come from a clump of ferns anna merely smiled stepped back and let the tiles click together i know droids have their place but damned if they dont make me itchy over here in the spirea warily eve stepped to the ferns and through there kneeling in rich black dirt was a woman her graying hair was scooped up in a messy knot her hands reddened and soiled coveralls that might have once been white were stained with too many streaks to identify she looked up and her plain narrow face proved to be as filthy as her clothes im checking my worms trying out a new breed she held up a clump of dirt that wiggled very nice eve decided and was faintly relieved when engrave buried the busy clump so youre roarkes cop always figured hed choose one of those fussy purebreds with the skinny necks and big boobs she pursed her lips as she looked eve over glad he didnt trouble with purebreds is they need constant pampering give me a good hybrid any day engrave wiped her dirty hands on her dirty clothes when she rose she proved to be about five feet tall digging around with worms is good therapy more people should try it then they wouldnt need drugs to get through the day speaking of drugs yes yes over here she started off at marching pace then began to slow to meander need some pruning here more nitrogen underwatered root bound she paused beside spearing green leaves trailing vines explosive blooms its gotten to the stage they pay me to garden nice work if you can get it know what this is eve looked at a purple trumpetshaped bloom she was pretty sure but wary of a trap a flower petunia hah people have forgotten the charm of the traditional she stopped by a sink washed some of the dirt off her hands left more under her short ragged nails everybody wants exotic nowadays bigger better different a good bed of petunias will give a lot of pleasure for little care you plant them dont expect them to be something theyre not and enjoy theyre simple dont wither up on you if you look crosseyed a good bed of petunias means something well then she hoisted herself onto a stool in front of a workbench crowded with garden tools pots papers an autochef that blinked on empty and a topoftheline computer system that was an interesting bag of tricks you sent over with that irishman who knew his petunias by the way feeneys a man of many talents gave him a nice flat of pansies for his wife engrave engaged the computer already ran analysis on the sample roarke brought by sweettalked me into putting a rush on it another irishman god love em believe in crossing my ts on something like this the fresh sample gave me more to work with then you have the results dont rush me girl it only works with goodlooking micks and i dont like working for cops engrave smiled widely they dont appreciate the art of science bet you dont even know your periodic table do you listen doctor to eves relief the formula flashed on screen is this unit controlled its passkeyed dont you worry roarke said it was top security ive been off the turnip truck longer than youve been alive she brushed eve off with one grimy hand gestured toward the screen with the other now i dont have to go into the basic elements here a child could make them so i assume youve idd them its the single unknown i know the drill lieutenant heres your little problem she highlighted a series of factors you havent tagged it from this formula because they coded it what you got heres just a bunch of gibberish its what youve got here reaching over she took a small slide dusted with powder even your top labs would have a tough time fining this down it looks like one thing it smells like another and when its all blended together as it is in this form its the reaction that changes the mix you know much about chemistry do i have to if more people understood dr engrave i want to understand murder you tell me what it is and let me go from there impatience is another problem with people today engrave huffed then took out a small covered dish inside were a few drops of milky liquid since you dont give a rats skinny ass i wont tell you what i did well leave it that i ran some tests did some basic chemistry and separated your unknown is that it in its liquid form yes i bet your lab tech told you it was some form of a valarian southwest u s native species eve looked over and hed be close but no cigar its a plant all right and valarian was used in the grafting of the specimen this is nectar the substance that seduces the birds and bees and makes the world go round this nectar is not from any native species not native to the u s not native anywhere period she reached over picked up a potted plant and set it down with a thud this is your baby its pretty peabody said leaning closer to the lush frillededged blooms that varied from creamy white to royal purple she sniffed closed her eyes and sniffed deeper god its wonderful its like her head swam strong you bet your ass its strong thats enough or youll be buzzed for an hour engrave shoved the plant clear peabody eve took her arm shook snap out of it its like taking a full glass of champagne in one gulp she pressed a hand to her temple its wonderful an experimental hybrid engrave explained code name immortal blossom this one is fourteen months old and its never stopped blooming they were grafted in the eden colony sit down peabody the nectar from this is what were looking for by itself the nectar is potent and causes a reaction in bees not unlike drunkenness they have the same sort of reaction to overripe fruit windfall peaches for example where the juice is highly concentrated unless the intake is controlled its been found that the bees od on the nectar they just cant get enough of it addicted bees you could say that basically they dont want to go fucking the other flowers because theyre so seduced by this one your lab didnt hook into it because the hybrids on the horticultural colonies restricted list and puts it under galactic customs jurisdiction the colony is working to alleviate this problem with the nectar as it puts a world of hurt on the potential for export so the immortal blossom is a controlled specimen for the moment there are some medicinal uses and particularly cosmetic ones ingestion of the nectar can cause a luminescence to the skin a rejuvenation of elasticity and an appearance of youth but its poison longterm use undermines the nervous system our lab confirmed that sos arsenic but fine ladies once took it in small doses to make their skin whiter clearer beauty and youth are desperate matters for some engrave shrugged her bony shoulders in dismissal in combination with the other elements in this formula this nectar is an activator the result is a highly addictive chemical that causes increased energy and strength sexual desire and the feeling of renewed youth and since uncontrolled these hybrids will propagate like rabbits it has the potential to be produced cheaply and in great bulk theyll propagate in on planet conditions absolutely the eden colony produces vegetation flora and plant life for on planet conditions so you get a few plants eve mused a lab the other chemicals and youve got yourself an illegal with mass appeal pay up engrave said with a sour smile be strong be beautiful be young and sexy whoever came up with this formula knew his chemistry and his human nature and understands the beauty of profit fatal beauty oh sure four to six years of regular use will take you down your nervous system will just give out but in four to six years youll have a hell of a time and somebodys going to make big fat credits how do you know so much about this what immortal blossom if its cultivation is limited to the eden colony because im the top in my field i do my homework and my daughter happens to be head beekeeper on eden a licensed lab such as this or a horticulture expert can with limitations import a specimen you mean weve already got some of these down here on planet mostly replicas harmless simulations but some of the genuine article regulated for indoor controlled use only now ive got roses to graft take the report and the two samples to your bright boys at cop central if they cant put it all together from that they ought to be hanged anyway o o you all right peabody cautious eve kept a firm hand on peabodys arm as she opened the car door yeah just really relaxed too relaxed to drive eve noted i was going to have you drop me off at the florist plan b we swing by and get you something to eat to counteract your flower sniffing then you take the samples and engraves report by the lab dallas peabody let her head rest against the seat back i really feel wonderful cautious eve eyed her youre not going to kiss me or anything peabody slanted her a look youre not my type anyway i dont feel particularly sexy just good if taking that stuff is anything like smelling that flower people are going to go crazy for it yeah someones already gone crazy enough to kill three people eve dashed into the florist shop she had twenty minutes on the outside if she was going to track down her other suspects badger them get back to the station to file her report and make the press conference she spotted roarke loitering near a display of small flowering trees our floral consultant is waiting for us sorry she wondered why anyone would want trees that were less than a foot tall they made her feel like a freak im backed up i just walked in myself was dr engrave helpful and then some shes quite a character she followed him under a trellis of fragrant vines i got a load of anna ah the anna line i think its going to be a hit especially with teenage boys roarke laughed and urged her through mark this is my fiancee eve dallas ah yes he looked like everyones favorite uncle when he extended a hand and his grip was like an arm wrestlers on a dare lets see what we can do for you weddings are such a complicated business and you havent left me much time he didnt give me a hell of a lot either mark laughed patted his silvery hair sit relax have a little tea i have a great deal to show you she didnt mind really eve decided she liked flowers she just hadnt known there were so damn many of them and after five minutes her head began to swim with orchids and lilies roses and gardenias simple roarke decided traditional no simulations yes of course i have some holograms that may spark some ideas youre having it outdoors so i might suggest arbors wisteria very traditional and with a lovely oldfashioned fragrance eve studied the holograms tried to envision herself standing under an arbor with roarke exchanging vows her stomach jittered what about petunias mark blinked petunias i like petunias theyre simple and they dont pretend to be what theyre not yes certainly quite charming perhaps backed with a bank of lilies as to color do you carry immortal blossoms she asked on impulse immortals marks eyes brightened theyre quite a specialty item difficult to import of course but very hardy and spectacular in baskets i have several simulations we dont want simulations eve reminded him im afraid they can only be exported in small amounts and then only to licensed florists and horticulturists and only for indoor use as your ceremony is outdoors do you sell many very rarely and only to other licensed horticulture experts i do have something just as lovely you have records of those sales can you get me a list of names youre on the net for world delivery arent you naturally but i need to know everyone who ordered immortals during the past two years when mark sent him a baffled look roarke ran his tongue around his teeth my fiancee is an avid gardener yes i see it may take a few moments to access you want everyone everyone who placed an order to the eden colony for immortals during the last two years you can start with the states if youll just wait then ill see what i can do i like the arbor idea eve announced springing up when mark left them dont you roarke rose put his hands on her shoulders why dont you let me handle the floral arrangements ill surprise you ill owe you one indeed you will you can start paying me back by remembering were attending leonardos showing on friday i knew that and by remembering to access your three weeks leave for our honeymoon i thought we said two we did now you owe me one would you like to tell me why you have this sudden fascination with a flower from the eden colony or do i just assume that you found your unknown its the nectar it does a lot to tie the three homicides together if i can just get a break i hope this is what youre looking for mark came back in with a sheet of paper it wasnt as difficult as id feared there havent been many orders for immortals most importers are satisfied with simulations there are a few problems with the actual specimen thank you eve took the page skimmed down the list gotcha she murmured then whirled to roarke i have to go buy lots of flowers boatloads of flowers dont forget the petunias she charged out pulling her communicator peabody but but the bouquet the bridal bouquet confused mark turned to roarke she hasnt chosen roarke watched her fly out i know what she likes he said often better than she does chapter fifteen nice to have you back mr redford this is becoming an unfortunate habit lieutenant redford took his seat at the interview table im expected in new los angeles in a few hours i trust you wont inconvenience me long i believe in backing up my data wouldnt want anything or anyone to slip through the cracks she glanced toward the corner where peabody stood looking her officious best in full uniform on the other side of the glass eve knew whitney and the prosecutor watched every move she nailed it down here or very likely shed be nailed herself she took her seat nodded to the hologram of redfords chosen counsel obviously neither redford nor his attorney believed the situation was serious enough to warrant an intheflesh representation counselor you have the transcript of your clients statements i do the pinstriped tougheyed image folded his manicured hands my client has cooperated fully with you and your department lieutenant we agree to this interview only to finalize the matter you agreed to it because you dont have a choice she thought but kept her face bland your cooperation is noted mr redford you have stated that you were acquainted with pandora that you had a casual and intimate relationship thats correct were you also involved in any business dealings with her i produced two directtohome screen videos in which pandora played a part another was under consideration were these projects successful moderately and outside of these projects did you have any other business dealings with the deceased none a faint smile touched his mouth other than a small speculative investment a small speculative investment she claimed to have been laying groundwork for her own fashion and beauty line of course she needed backers and i was intrigued enough to invest you gave her money yes over the course of the last year and a half i invested just over three hundred thousand found a way to cover your ass eve noted and leaned back in her chair whats the status of this fashion and beauty line you claim the deceased was implementing it has no status lieutenant he lifted his hands let them fall i was duped it wasnt until after her death that i discovered there was no line no other backers no product i see youre a successful producer a money man you must have asked her for a prospectus figures expenses projected earnings perhaps a sample of the products no his mouth tightened as he looked down at his hands i did not you expect me to believe that you just handed her money for a projected line you had no information on its embarrassing he lifted his eyes again i have a reputation in the business and if this information gets out that reputation would certainly suffer lieutenant the counselor interrupted my clients reputation is a valuable asset this asset will be damaged if this data goes beyond the parameters of this investigation i can and will secure a gag order on this portion of his statement to protect his interests go right ahead this is quite a story mr redford now do you want to tell me why a man with your reputation your assets would commit three hundred thousand dollars to an investment that didnt exist pandora was a persuasive woman a beautiful one she was also clever she skirted around my request for projections and figures i justified the continued payments because i felt she was an expert in the field and you didnt learn of her duplicity until after her death i made some inquiries contacted her business agent her representative he puffed out his cheeks and nearly succeeded in looking sheepish no one knew anything about the line when did you make these inquiries he hesitated for a heartbeat this afternoon after our interview after i questioned you on the payments thats correct i wanted to insure there was no mixup of any kind before i answered your questions on advice of counsel i contacted pandoras people and discovered id been conned your timing is very skillful do you have any hobbies mr redford hobbies a man with your type of highpressure job your assets must need some sort of release stamp collecting computer doodling gardening lieutenant the counselor said with weariness the relevance im interested in your clients leisure time weve established how he spends his business time perhaps you speculate on investments as a release valve no pandora was my first mistake and will be my last i dont have time for hobbies or the inclination for them i know what you mean i had someone tell me today that more people should plant petunias i cant imagine spending time digging in dirt and fussing with flowers not that i dont like them you like flowers they have their place thats why i have a staff to deal with them but youre a licensed horticulturist i you applied for a license and were granted one three months ago just about the time you made a payment to jerry fitzgerald in the amount of a hundred and twentyfive thousand and two days before you placed an order for an immortal blossom from the eden colony my clients interest in flora has no relevance in this matter it has plenty eve shot back and this is an interview not a trial i dont need relevance why did you want an immortal i it was a gift for pandora you went to the considerable time trouble and expense to secure a license then purchased a controlled species at considerably more expense as a gift for a woman you occasionally had sex with a woman who over the last eighteen months bled you for over three hundred thousand dollars that was an investment this was a gift this is bullshit save your objections counselor theyre duly noted wheres the flower now in new l a officer peabody arrange to confiscate now just a damn minute redford scraped back his chair thats my property paid for you falsified data on your license you illegally purchased a controlled species it will be confiscated and you will be charged appropriately peabody yes sir smothering a smirk peabody took out her communicator and made the contact this is obvious harassment the counselor scowled and these petty charges are ridiculous oh im just getting started you knew about the immortal blossom knew it was a necessary element to create the drug pandora was going to make big money on that drug was she trying to cut you out i dont know what youre talking about did she turn you on to it give you enough tastes to addict maybe she held it back then until you wanted to beg for it until you wanted to kill her i never touched it redford exploded but you knew about it you knew she had it and there were ways of getting more did you decide to cut her out instead bring jerry in you bought the plant well find out if you had the substance analyzed with the plant you could manufacture your own you wouldnt need her you couldnt control her either could you shed want more money more of the drug you found out it was fatal but why wait five years with her out of the way youd have a clear field i didnt kill her i was through with her i had no reason to kill her you went to her house that night you went to bed with her she had the drug did she taunt you with it youd already killed twice to protect yourself and your investment but she was still in the way i killed no one she let him shout let the counselor spout his objections and threats did you follow her to leonardos that night or did you take her i was never there i never touched her if i was going to kill her id have done it in her own house when she threatened me paul shut up just shut up redford spat at his counsel shes trying to pin murder on me for christs sake i argued with her she wanted more money a lot more money she made sure i saw her supply of the drug how much she had at her personal disposal it was worth a fortune but id already had it analyzed i didnt need her and i told her so i had jerry to endorse the line when it was ready she was furious threatened to ruin me to kill me it gave me great pleasure to walk out on her you planned to manufacture and distribute the illegal yourself as a topical he said dabbing his mouth with the back of his hand once it was ready it was irresistible the money her threats meant nothing do you understand she couldnt ruin me without ruining herself and that she would never do i was finished with her and when i heard she was dead i opened a bottle of champagne and toasted her killer very nice now lets start again after eve turned redford over to booking she stepped into the commanders office excellent work lieutenant thank you sir id rather be booking him for murder than drug charges that may come im counting on it prosecutor lieutenant hed risen when shed come in and continued to stand his manners were well known in and out of the courtroom even when he went in for the kill he did so with panache i admire your interview techniques id love to have you on the witness stand in this matter but i dont believe it will come to trial mr redfords attorney has already contacted my office well negotiate and on the murder we dont have enough to tie him no physical evidence he went on before she could protest and motive youve proven he had the means to his end before her death its still more than possible that hes guilty but we have quite a bit more work to do to justify charges you justified charging mavis freestone on overwhelming evidence he reminded her you know she didnt do it prosecutor you know that the three victims in this matter are tied together she looked toward casto who lounged in a chair illegals knows it i have to go with the lieutenant on this casto drawled weve investigated the aspect of freestone being involved with the substance known as immortality found no connection between her and the drug or either of the other victims she had some splotches on her record but theyre old and minor you ask me the lady was in the wrong place at the wrong time he offered eve a smile i have to throw my weight with dallas and recommend the charges against mavis freestone be dropped pending further investigation your recommendation is noted lieutenant the prosecutor said the prosecutors office will take it into consideration as we review all current data at this point our belief that these three homicides are linked still falls short of solid proof our office is however willing to agree to ms freestones representatives recent request for testing re truth detection auto hypnosis and vr recreation the results will weigh heavily in our decision eve let out a long slow breath it was a concession and a big one thank you were on the same team lieutenant and now wed all best keep that in mind and coordinate our stand before this press conference as they prepped eve moved over to casto i appreciate what you did he shrugged it off it was my professional opinion i hope it helps your friend ask me redfords guilty as homemade sin either he whacked them himself or paid to have it done she wanted to latch onto that but shook her head slowly professional hits seems sloppy for pros too personal still thanks for adding the weight you can consider it payback if you want for handing me one of the biggest illegals cases of the decade once we clean it up and go public with the immortality drug and the busts im going to get me a set of captains bars then congratulations in advance id say that goes for both of us youre going to nail down these homicides eve then well both be sitting pretty ill nail them down all right she lifted a brow when he brushed a hand over her hair i like it with a quick smile he tucked his hands in his pockets you damned sure you gotta get married angling her head she smiled back i hear youre having dinner with peabody shes a jewel all right ive got a weakness for strong women eve and youll have to forgive me if im a little disappointed in the timing here why dont i try to be flattered instead she caught whitneys signal and sighed oh hell here we go makes you feel like a big meaty bone dont it casto murmured as the doors opened to a horde of reporters o o they got through it and eve would have considered it a good days work if nadine hadnt ambushed her in the underground lot this areas off limits to unauthorized personnel give me a break dallas still lounging on the hood of eves car nadine grinned how about a lift channel s out of my way when nadine only continued to smile eve swore and uncoded the doors get in you look good nadine said casually whos the stylist friend of a friend im tired of talking about my hair nadine okay lets talk about murder drugs and money i just spent fortyfive minutes talking about that eve flashed her badge at the security camera and bumped out to the street i believe you were there what i saw was a lot of dancing and dodging whats that squeaking noise my welltuned vehicle oh yeah you got hit with budget cuts again didnt you damn shame anyway whats this business about a new line of inquiry im not at liberty to discuss that aspect of the ongoing investigation uhhuh whats this buzz about paul redford redford has as stated in the press conference been charged with fraud possessing a controlled specimen and intent to manufacture and distribute an illegal and where does that tie to pandoras murder im not at liberty to all right shit nadine flopped back in the seat scowled at the traffic clogging the roadway how about a trade maybe you first i want an exclusive interview with mavis freestone eve didnt bother to answer she just snorted come on dallas let her tell her side of it to the public screw the public can i quote you you and roarke have her surrounded nobody can get to her you know ill be fair yeah we have her surrounded no no one can or will get to her and youd probably be fair but shes not talking to the media is that her decision or yours back off nadine unless you want to try public transportation from here just relay my request thats all im asking dallas just let her know im interested in letting her tell her story on air fine now change the channel all right i got an interesting little tidbit from the gossip station anchor this afternoon and you know how i live to hear the details of the lives of the rich and ridiculous dallas face it youre about to become one of them at eves furious grimace nadine laughed christ i love needling you its so easy anyway word is that the hot couple of the last couple months is split city im agog you may be when i tell you that hot couple consists of jerry fitzgerald and justin young eves interest level rose enough to have her reconsidering swinging into a bus stop and ditching her passenger do tell there was a very public scene today at the rehearsal for leonardos showing apparently our lovebirds got physical blows were exchanged they hit each other more than love taps according to my source jerry retired to her dressing room she has the stars dressing room now by the way and justin left in a huff and with a puffy eye a few hours later he was in maui partying with another blonde also a model a younger model what were they fighting about no ones sure sex is thought to have reared its ugly head she accused him of cheating on her he did the same she wasnt going to stand for it neither was he she didnt need him anymore he didnt need her right back thats interesting nadine but it doesnt mean anything but the timing eve thought oh the timing maybe it does maybe it doesnt but its funny people in the public eye like that both of them media personalities losing it in front of an audience id have to say they were pretty wired up or putting on a hell of a show like i said its interesting eve pulled up at the security gates of channel this is your stop you could take me to the door take a tram nadine listen you know youre going to look into what i just told you so how about matching some data dallas you and i have a history here that was true enough nadine things are balanced on a very thin line right now i cant afford to tip it i wont go on air with anything until you give me the go ahead eve hesitated then shook her head i cant mavis is too important to me until shes in the clear solid i cant risk it is she heading toward the clear come on dallas off the record the prosecutors office is reconsidering the charges but theyre not dropping them not yet have you got another suspect redford is he your new prime dont push me on this nadine youre almost a friend hell lets do this if anything ive told you or pass on later regarding this adds to your case you pay back ill feed you nadine as soon as its cleared i want a oneonone with you ten minutes before any info hits the media eve leaned over opened nadines door see you five minutes goddamn it dallas five lousy minutes which meant eve knew hundreds of ratings points and thousands of dollars i can do five if and when i cant promise you more itll be when satisfied nadine got out then leaned on the door you know dallas you just dont miss itll be when youve got a knack for the dead and the innocent the dead and the innocent eve thought with a shudder as she drove away she knew that too many of the dead were the guilty o o there was moonlight drizzling through the sky window over the bed when roarke shifted away from eve it was a new experience for him the nerves before during after lovemaking there were dozens of reasons or so he told himself as she curled against him as was her habit the house was full of people leonardos motley team had taken over an entire wing with their mania he had several projects and deals at varying stages of development business he was determined to close before the wedding there was the wedding itself surely a man was entitled to be a bit distracted at such a time but he was at least with himself a brutally honest man there was only one reason for the nerves that was the image that continually leapt into his mind of eve battered and bloodied and broken and the terror that by touching her he might bring it all back turn something beautiful into the beastly beside him she stirred then pushed herself up to look down at him her face was still flushed her eyes dark i dont know what im supposed to say to you he trailed a finger along her jaw about im not fragile theres no reason for you to treat me as if im wounded his brows drew together the annoyance selfdirected he hadnt realized he was that transparent even with her and the sensation didnt sit well i dont know what you mean he started to get up with the idea of pouring a drink he didnt want but she took a firm grip on his arm avoidance isnt your usual style roarke it worried her if your feelings have changed because of what i did what i remembered dont be insulting he snapped it out and the temper kindling in his eyes was a great relief to her what am i supposed to think this is the first time youve touched me since that night it was more like nursing than you have a problem with tenderness he was clever she thought calm or aroused he knew how to turn things to his own favor she kept her hand on his arm her eyes level with his do you think i cant tell youre holding back i dont want you to hold back im fine im not he jerked his arm free im not some of us are a little more human need a little more time leave it alone his words were a sharp slap on a naked cheek she nodded once slid down into bed and turned away from him all right but what happened to me when i was a child wasnt sex it was an obscenity she closed her eyes tight and willed herself to sleep chapter sixteen when her link beeped it was barely dawn eyes still closed eve reached out block video dallas dallas lieutenant eve dispatch probable homicide male rear of one hundred eighth street proceed immediately nerves churned in eves stomach she wasnt on rotation shouldnt have been called cause of death apparent beating victim not yet identified due to facial injuries acknowledged goddamn it she threw her legs over the side of the bed and blinked when she saw roarke was already up and getting dressed what are you doing taking you to a murder scene youre a civilian you dont have any business at a murder scene he merely shot her a look as she tugged on jeans your vehicle is in repair lieutenant he had some small satisfaction of hearing her mutter oaths as she remembered ill drive you drop you he qualified on my way to the office suit yourself she shrugged on her weapon harness o o it was a miserable neighborhood several buildings were decorated with vicious graffiti broken glass and the tattered signs the city used to condemn them of course people still lived in them huddled in filthy rooms avoiding the patrols blissing out on whatever substance offered the most kick there were neighborhoods like it all over the world roarke thought as he stood in the thin sunlight behind the police barricade he had grown up in one not so different though it had been three thousand miles across the atlantic he understood the life here the despair the deals just as he understood the violence that had led to the result eve was even now examining as he watched her along with the derelicts the sleepy street whores the miserably curious he realized he understood her as well her movements were brisk her face impassive but there was pity in her eyes as they studied what had once been a man she was he thought capable strong and resilient whatever wounds she had she would live with she didnt need him to heal but to accept not your usual milieu roarke roarke glanced down as feeney stepped up beside him ive been to worse havent we all feeney sighed and took a wrapped danish out of his pocket breakfast ill pass you go ahead feeney downed the pastry in three whopping bites better go see what our girls up to he walked through the barricade tapping his chest where his badge was fixed to settle the nervous uniforms guarding the scene lucky the media hasnt come in yet he commented eve flicked a glance up not much interest in a murder in this neighborhood at least not until the how leaks her clearcoated hands were already smeared with blood as she knelt beside the body got the pictures at the nod from the video tech she slid her hands under the body lets turn him over feeney hed fallen or had been left facedown and had leaked a great deal of blood and brains from the fistsized hole in the back of his head the flip side wasnt any prettier no id eve reported peabodys inside the building doing door to door see if we can come up with anyone who knows him or saw anything feeney shifted his gaze to the rear of the building there were a couple of windows filthy glass heavily grilled he skimmed the concrete yard where they crouched there was a recycler broken a grab bag of garbage junk rusted metal not much of a view he commented we tag him yet i took prints one of the uniforms is running them now weapons already bagged iron pipe tossed under the recycler eyes narrowed she studied the body he didnt leave a weapon with boomer or hetta moppett its obvious why he left one at leonardos now hes playing with us feeney tossing it where a blind frog would hop to it what do you make of this guy she snapped a finger under a wide neonpink suspender feeney grunted the corpse was decked out in full fashion pegged knee shorts in rainbow stripes moon glow tshirt expensive beaded sandals had money to waste on bad clothes feeney studied the building again if he lived here he wasnt putting it into real estate dealer eve decided midlevel you live here because your business is here she rose smearing blood from her hands onto her jeans as a uniform approached got a match lieutenant victim is idd as lament ro aka cockroach hes got a long sheet mostly under illegals possession manufacturing with intent a couple of assaults anybody use him he weasel for anyone that data didnt come up she glanced at feeney who acknowledged the silent request with a grunt hed dig and find out okay lets bag him and ship him i want a tox report let the sweepers in here her gaze skimmed the scene again and landed on roarke i need a ride feeney can do ill just be a minute she headed to the barricade i thought you were going to the office i am are you done here a few more things i can catch a ride with feeney youre looking for the same murderer here she started to tell him that was police business then shrugged the media would have its greedy hands on it within the hour seeing as his face has been turned into jelly its a pretty good bet ive got to she whirled around at the screams long screeching wails that could have drilled holes in steel she saw the woman big naked but for a pair of red panties burst out of the building she mowed over two uniforms whod been sipping coffee bowled them down like duckpins and streaked toward what was left of cockroach oh fucking a eve muttered and raced to intercept less than a yard from the body she leaped and took the woman down in a flying tackle that had them both making painful acquaintance with the concrete thats my man the woman flopped like a twohundredpound fish beat at eve with meaty hands thats my man you cop bitch in the interest of order of preserving the scene and of selfpreservation eve brought her fist up hard under the womans pudgy jaw lieutenant you all right lieutenant both uniforms reached down to help eve off the unconscious woman jesus she came out of nowhere sorry sorry jerking away eve scalded them both sorry you miserable braindead assholes another two seconds and shed have contaminated the scene next time youre assigned to something bigger than traffic detail you keep your stupid hands off your dicks now see if you can manage to call the mts and have them take a look at that idiot woman then you get her some clothes and take her into holding can you handle that she didnt bother to wait for an answer but started limping off her jeans were torn her own blood mixing with the dead mans and her eyes were still flashing when they met roarkes what the hell are you grinning at its always a delight to watch you work lieutenant abruptly he caught her face in his hands and crushed his mouth to hers in a kiss potent enough to stagger her back on her heels no holding back he said as she blinked at him have the mts take a look at you too o o it was several hours later when she received the summons to whitneys office with peabody beside her eve took the skywalk im sorry dallas she shouldnt have gotten past me jesus peabody let it go you were in another part of the building when she made her run i should have realized one of the other tenants would inform her yeah we all need to keep our crystal ball polished look the upshot is she didnt do any more than put another couple dents in me casto call in yet hes still in the field is he still in your fields peabodys mouth twitched we were together last night we were just going to have dinner but one thing led to another i swear i havent slept like that since i was a kid who knew great sex was such a terrific soother i could have told you anyway he got a call just after mine came in my take is hell know who the victim is maybe be able to help eve grunted they werent kept waiting in whitneys outer office but shown straight in he pointed to chairs lieutenant i realize your written report is on the way but i prefer a verbal rundown on this latest homicide yes sir she relayed the address and description of the murder scene the name and description of the victim along with details of the weapon found the wounds the mes determination of time of death peabodys initial door to door didnt turn up anything useful but we will follow that up with a second pass the woman who was living with the victim was of some help whitney lifted his brows eve was still wearing her stained shirt and torn jeans im told you had a bit of trouble there nothing to speak of eve had already decided the tongue lashing shed given would do there was no need to layer on punishment with official reprimands shes a former licensed street companion didnt have the credits to renew shes also a user by applying a little pressure in that area we were able to get her to tell us something of the victims movements last night according to her statement they were together in the apartment until about oh one hundred theyd had some wine and a little exotica he claimed he had to go had a deal to close she took some download passed out as the me puts the time of death at approximately oh two hundred in his prelim it jibes evidence indicates the victim was killed where he was found early this morning it also strongly indicates that the victim was taken out by the same person who killed moppett boomer and pandora she took time for a breath and continued to speak formally mavis freestones movements during the time of this murder can be accounted for by the primary and others whitney said nothing for a moment but kept his eyes on eves face this office does not believe that mavis freestone is in any way connected with this murder nor does the office of the prosecuting attorney i have dr miras preliminary analysis of ms freestones testing testing formality forgotten eve sprang up what do you mean her testing that wasnt scheduled until monday it was rescheduled whitney said calmly and has been completed as of thirteen hundred hours why wasnt i informed uncomfortable memories of her own experiences with testing roiled in her stomach i should have been there it was in the best interest of all parties involved that you were not he held up a hand before you lose your temper and risk insubordination let me tell you that dr mira clearly states in her report that ms freestone passed all testing the truth detector indicates her veracity in her statements as to the other elements dr mira feels that the subject is highly unlikely to have exhibited the extreme violence with which pandora was killed leaving out the hundredcredit words dr mira recommends the charges against ms freestone be dropped dropped the backs of eves eyes burned as she sat again when the prosecutors office is taking dr miras report under advisement unofficially i can tell you that unless other data come to light that disproves her analysis the charges will be withdrawn on monday he watched eve block most of a shudder approved her control the physical evidence is strong but outweighed at this point by miras report and the evidence gathered in the investigation of the allegedly connected deaths thank you i didnt clear her dallas nor have you but youve come damn close get the bastard and soon i intend to her communicator beeped she waited for whitneys nod before she answered dallas got your damn rush order dickie scowled at her like i got nothing else to do whine later what have we got your latest corpse had a nice ride on immortality before he bought it just before is my guess dont think he had time to enjoy it transmit the report to my office she said and cut him off before he could complain she was smiling as she rose this time i have this thing i have to go to tonight and i think i might be able to tie a few things up o o chaos panic and tattered nerves seemed to be as much a part of a highfashion runway show as needlethin models and glitzy fabrics it was intriguing and amusing to watch the players assume their roles the poutylipped mannequin who found fault with every accessory the rabbitpaced dresser who wore glinting needles and pins in a tuft of her hair the stylist who swept down on models like a soldier pumped for battle and the hapless creator of all the glitz who stood by amid the swirl wringing his huge hands were running behind were running behind i need lissa out in the cotton swirler in two minutes the musics on pace but were running behind shell be there jesus leonardo get a grip it took eve a moment to recognize the stylist trinas hair was in sharp ebony spikes that could gouge an eye at three paces but the voice gave her away and eve watched letting herself be elbowed back by another frantic dresser as trina glopped something that looked distressingly like come onto a streaked mane before squishing it into a smooth cone shape what are you doing there a man with owl eyes and a kneelength cape bore down on eve like a snapping terrier get out of those clothes for gods sake dont you know hugos out front whos hugo the man made a sound like escaping gas and reached out to tug off eves tshirt hey buddy you want to keep those fingers she smacked them away and glowered at him get naked get naked were running out of time threats made no dent and he snatched at the snap of her jeans she considered decking him then pulled out her shield instead you can back off or i can haul your ass in for assaulting an officer what are you doing here we have our license we paid our revenue leonardo theres a cop here i simply cant be expected to deal with police dallas mavis hurried over varicolored fabric draped over her arm youre really in the way here why arent you out front christ why are you still dressed like that i didnt have time to go back and change absently eve tugged at her stained shirt are you all right i didnt know theyd rescheduled your tests or id have been there i got through it dr mira was mag but lets just say im glad its over i dont want to talk about it she said quickly and looked around the disordered and crowded space at least not now okay i want to see jerry fitzgerald now the shows already started its timed down to the last microsecond with the skill of a veteran mavis swayed out of the path of a pair of longlegged models she has to concentrate dallas this pace is murder cocking her head she tuned into the music her next cue is in less than four minutes then i wont keep her long where dallas leonardo is where mavis back there waving one frantic hand she turned over one layer of fabric to a passing dresser in the stars room eve managed to dodge shift and spin her way through the milling crowd to a door marked prominently with jerrys name she didnt bother to knock but pushed it open and saw the woman in question being squeezed into a gold lame tube im not going to be able to breathe in this a skeleton couldnt breathe in this you shouldnt have eaten that pate dearie the dresser said implacably just suck it in an interesting look eve commented from the doorway makes you look like a fairy wand its one of his retro shots early twentiethcentury glamour i cant fucking move eve came closer narrowed her eyes at jerrys face the cosmetician did a nice job i cant see any bruises and she would check with trina to see if thered been any bruises to cover i heard justin young gave you a couple of shots bastard hitting me in the face before a big show id say he pulled his punch what did you fight about jerry he thought he could diddle with some little chorus dancer not on my time times the interesting factor isnt it when did he start his diddling listen lieutenant im a little pressed here and walking out on the runway with a scowl on my face is going to ruin the presentation lets just say justins history despite her claims to the contrary jerry moved with quick agility through the door eve stayed where she was listening to the burst of applause as jerry made her entrance in six minutes flat she was back being peeled out of the gold lame howd you find out about it trina hair for gods sake christ youre persistent i got wind of it thats all and when i called him on it he denied it but i could tell he was lying uhhuh eve considered liars as jerry stood arms out trina transformed her ebony swing of hair into a complicated twist of curls with a handheld heater sheer white silk with rainbow trimming was slipped over her arms he didnt stay in maui long i dont give a shit where he is he flew back to new york last night i checked the shuttles you know jerry its odd that timing thing again last time i saw you two you were all but joined at the hip you went with him to pandoras went home with him that night you were still there in the morning the word i get is he accompanied you to your fittings rehearsals doesnt seem like hed have much time to boff a chorus dancer some men work fast she offered a hand so the dresser could clasp on a half dozen jangling bracelets a public fight plenty of witnesses even some handy media coverage you know on the face of things it makes your dual alibis hold more water if i was the kind of cop to believe in the face of things jerry turned to the mirror to check the line of her costume what do you want dallas im working here me too let me tell you how i see it jerry you and your pal had a little deal going with pandora but shes greedy it looks like shes going to screw you and your partners a handy thing happens mavis comes in theres a fight for a sharp woman like you that could spark an idea jerry picked up a glass knocked back the sparkling sapphire contents youve already got two suspects dallas whos being greedy now did the three of you discuss it you justin and redford you and justin go off and solidify an alibi redford doesnt maybe hes not as smart maybe you were supposed to back him up too but you didnt he takes her to leonardos youre waiting did things get out of hand then which one of you picked up the cane this is ludicrous justin and i were at his place security verifies that if you want to accuse me of something bring a warrant until then back off were you and justin smart enough not to contact each other since the fight i dont think hes got your control jerry in fact im banking on it well have the transmission records by morning so what if he called me so what jerry raced to the doorway as eve strolled away it doesnt prove anything youve got nothing ive got another dead body eve paused looked back i dont suppose either one of you are going to alibi each other for last night are you bitch incensed jerry heaved the glass catching a hapless dresser in the shoulder youre not hanging anything on me youve got nothing as the noise and confusion of backstage rose to a new level mavis shut her eyes oh dallas how could you leonardo needs her for ten more changes shell do her job she wants the spotlight too much not to im going to find roarke hes out front mavis said wearily as leonardo rushed over to soothe his star dont go out there looking like that put this on its already been run without the overdress and the scarves no one will recognize it im just going to please it would mean a lot if you were wearing one of his designs out front its a simple line dallas and ill find some shoes that fit you somewhere fifteen minutes later with her torn clothes stuffed in her bag eve spotted roarke in the front row he was applauding politely as a trio of largebreasted models jiggled wildly in transparent rompers great just what we want to see women wearing when they walk down fifth roarke lifted a shoulder actually a great many of his designs are very attractive and i wouldnt mind seeing you in that number on the right keep dreaming she crossed her legs and the flow of black satin over them whispered in response how long do we have to stay until the bitter end when did you buy this he ran a fingertip over the narrow straps draped over her biceps i didnt mavis made me put it on its one of his without the frills keep it it suits you she only grunted her torn jeans suited her mood a great deal better ah here comes the diva jerry glided out and at each step of her dainty glass shoes the runway exploded into color eve paid little attention to the billowing balloon skirt and sheer bodice that caused such a furor of approval from the attendees she watched jerrys face and only her face as fashion critics murmured busily into their recorders and dozens of buyers ordered frantically from their portalinks jerrys face was serene as she waved aside dozens of muscular young men who prostrated themselves in front of her she sold the outfit with graceful twists and turns and clever choreography that had her stepping nimbly onto a pyramid of hard male bodies the crowd applauded jerry posed then aimed icy blue eyes at eve ouch roarke murmured id say that was a direct hit is there something i should know shed like to rip my face off eve said mildly my mission has been a success satisfied she sat back and prepared to enjoy the rest of the show o o did you see dallas did you see after a quick pirouette mavis threw her arms around eve at the finale they actually stood up for him even hugo who the hell is hugo hes only the biggest name in the business he cosponsored the show but that was with pandora if hed pulled out well he didnt thanks to jerry stepping in leonardos on his way he can pay back his debts the orders are already pouring in hell have his own showroom now and in a few months therell be leonardos everywhere thats great then everythings working out mavis fussed with her face in the mirror of the ladies lounge i have to find another gig and ill wear his designs exclusively things are going to go back to the way they should be they are arent they dallas theyre heading that way mavis did leonardo go to jerry fitzgerald or the other way around for the show he went to her originally pandora suggested it wait eve thought how did i miss this step pandora wanted him to ask jerry to model in his show it was just like her on impulse mavis took out a tube and removed her lip dye she studied her naked mouth a moment then chose a container of berry crush she knew jerry wouldnt play second lead not to her even though there was a lot of good buzz about the designs so asking her was a kind of dig you know she could say yes and take the backseat or say no and miss being in one of the hottest shows of the season and she said no made out like she had previous commitments saving face but the minute pandora was out of the picture she called leonardo and offered to fill in how much will she make for the show shell get about a mil but thats nothing the headliner gets to pick her fashions at a wholesalers discount an endorsement fee for each wearing then theres the media clause which is well the big models get it to go on the fashion channels the talk channels and all that they get to pump up the designs and get paid for the appearances exposure and big bucks for the next six months with an option to renew she could rake in five six mil plus bennies from this one appearance nice work if you can get it she profits in excess of six million from pandoras death you could look at it that way its not as if she was hurting before dallas maybe not but she sure as hell isnt hurting now shell put in an appearance at this postshowing party sure she and leonardo are the stars wed better get out there if we want any food those fashion critics are like hyenas they dont even leave bones youve been around jerry and the others for a while now eve began as they made their way back to the ballroom anybody using jesus dallas uncomfortable mavis shrugged im not a weasel mavis eve tugged her into an alcove resplendent with potted ferns dont take that line with me is anyone using hell sure theres some shit around poppers mostly and a lot of zero appetite its a tough business and not all the lowtier models can afford body sculpting youve got a few illegals filtered through but its mostly over the counter jerry shes into health shit that drink she guzzles she smokes a little but its some special blend for soothing nerves ive never seen her use anything dicey but but well shes real territorial about her stuff you know couple of days ago one of the other girls wasnt feeling well dragging from a late night she started to cop a taste of jerrys blue juice and jerry went nuts wanted to have her fired interesting wonder whats in it some vegetable extract she claims its made up for her metabolism she made some noise about going on the market with it endorsing i need a sample i havent got enough for a search or confiscation warrant she paused considered smiled but i think i know how to fix that lets go party what are you going to do dallas doubling her pace mavis caught up with eves long strides i dont like that look in your eye dont cause any trouble please come on its leonardos big night i bet a little more media coverage will increase his sales she stepped into the ballroom where the crowd was gyrating on the dance floor or huddled around the tables of food spotting jerry eve started over roarke caught her eye and crossed to her suddenly you look like a cop thanks im not sure it was a compliment are you about to cause a scene im going to do my best want to keep your distance not on your life intrigued he took her hand and walked with her congratulations on a successful show eve began edging aside a fawning critic to stand face to face with jerry thank you jerry raised a glass of champagne but from what ive seen youre not exactly a fashion expert she sent roarke a melting look though you do appear to have excellent taste in men better than yours did you hear justin young was spotted at the privacy club tonight with a redhead a redhead who bore a remarkable resemblance to pandora you lying bitch he wouldnt jerry caught herself hissed gently through her teeth i told you i dont care who he sees or what he does why would you its true though isnt it that after a certain number of sessions body sculpting and facial enhancements dont completely fight reality i suppose justin wanted a taste of youth men are such pigs eve accepted a glass of champagne from a roving waiter and took a sip not that you dont look wonderful for your age those harsh stage lights just tend to make a woman look mature fuck you jerry dashed the contents of her glass in eves face thought that would do it eve murmured as she blinked her stinging eyes thats assaulting an officer youre under arrest take your hands off me incensed jerry shoved eve back add resisting arrest this must be my lucky night in two quick moves eve had jerrys arm twisted up and behind her back well just call a uniform to take you in it shouldnt take you long to make bail now behave so i can read you your rights on the way out she shot roarke a sunny smile i wont be long take your time lieutenant he plucked up eves champagne and drank it himself he gave her ten minutes then wandered out of the ballroom she was standing at the hotel entrance watching jerry being loaded into a cruiser what was that for i needed to buy some time and some probable cause the suspect showed violent tendencies and a nervous manner indicative of drug use cops roarke thought you pissed her off eve that too shell be out almost before they get her in ive got to move where he demanded as they hurried around the ballroom to the backstage area i need a sample of that stuff she likes to drink the assault gives me clearance if we bend things a little i want it analyzed you honestly think shes using illegals that blatantly i think people like her like pandora and young and redford are incredibly arrogant theyve got money looks a certain amount of power and prestige it makes them feel above the law she sent him a look as she slipped into pandoras dressing room you have the same tendencies thank you so much lucky for you i came along to keep you on the straight and narrow watch the door will you if shes got a quick lawyer im not going to have time to finish this the straight and narrow naturally roarke commented and stationed himself at the door as she searched the room christ theres a fortune in cosmetic enhancements it is her business lieutenant vanitys costing her several hundred k a year id say just on the topicals christ knows what she spends in ingestives and sculpting if i could just find a little of that nice powder youre looking for immortality he let out a laugh she may be arrogant but she doesnt look stupid maybe youre right she opened the door of a friggie and smiled but shes got a container of that drink in here a locked container pursing her lips eve looked toward roarke i dont suppose you could veer from the straight and narrow he sighed walked over and studied the lock on the clear bottle sophisticated shes not taking any chances with it the bottles unbreakable from the look of it his fingers played over the lock mechanism as he spoke find me a nail file a hair clip something like that will you eve pushed through the drawers will this do roarke frowned at the tiny pair of manicure scissors close enough he jiggled the lock with the points finessed and stepped back there you are youre awfully good at that just a small insignificant talent lieutenant right she dug in her bag pulled out an evidence holder she filled it with a couple of ounces that should be more than enough would you like me to relock it it would only take a moment dont bother we can swing by the lab on the way on the way to to where ive got peabody staked out justin youngs back door she started out flicking him a smile you know roarke jerry was right about one thing i have pretty good taste in men darling your taste is impeccable chapter seventeen being hooked up with a rich man had a number of disadvantages in eves mind but it had one overwhelming plus that was food on the way back across town she managed to stuff herself to bursting with chicken kiev from the fully stocked autochef in his car nobody has chicken kiev in their car unit she said with her mouth full they do if they run around with you otherwise youd live off soy burgers and irradiated powdered eggs i hate irradiated powdered eggs exactly it pleased him to hear her chuckle youre in a rare old mood lieutenant its coming together roarke theyll drop charges on mavis by monday morning and by then ill have the bastards it was all money she said and dabbed up grains of wild rice with her fingers fucking money pandora was the connection to immortality and those three high flyers wanted their share so they lured her to leonardos and killed her leonardos was probably her idea she wasnt letting go there and she was revved to fight gave them the perfect opportunity and setting mavis walking in was just icing theyd have left leonardo hanging by his balls otherwise not to question your quick agile and suspicious mind but why not just whack her in an alley if youre right theyd done it before so they wanted some staging this time she moved her shoulders hetta moppett was a potential loose end one of them confronted her likely questioned her then got rid of her better not to chance whatever boomer had let slip during sex then boomer came next he knew too much had too much its not likely he knew about all three of them but hed nailed at least one and when he spotted that one in the club he went underground they managed to get him out tortured him killed him but they didnt have time to go back and get the stuff all for profit for profit and if that analysis comes out the way i think it will for immortality pandora was on it no question my take is that whatever pandora had or wanted jerry fitzgerald wanted to have more youve got a drug that makes you look good younger sexier it could be worth a fortune to her professionally not to mention her ego but its lethal thats what they say about smoking but ive seen you light up some tobacco she arched a brow at him unprotected sex was lethal during the latter half of the twentieth century didnt stop people from fucking strangers guns are lethal but we spent decades getting them off the street then point taken most of us think were going to live forever did you do testing on redford we did hes clean doesnt mean his hands are any less bloody im going to lock the three of them away for the next fifty years roarke eased the car to a stop at a light turned to look at her eve are you after them for murder or for messing with the life of your friend the results are the same your feelings arent they hurt her she said tightly they put her through hell forced me to help them put her through it she lost her job and a lot of her confidence theyre going to pay for that all right i only have one thing to say i dont need criticisms on procedure from a guy who pops locks like you pal he took out a handkerchief dabbed at her chin the next time you start to say you have no family he began quietly think again mavis is yours she started to speak reevaluated im doing my job she decided if i get some personal pleasure out of it whats wrong with that not a thing he kissed her lightly then turned left i want to go around the back of the building take a right at the next corner then i know how to get around the back of that building dont tell me you own that one too all right i wont tell you and by the way if you had asked me about the security setup at youngs place i could have saved you or i should say feeney a little time and trouble when she huffed he smiled if i get some personal pleasure out of owning large chunks of manhattan whats wrong with that she turned to stare out of the window so he couldnt see her smirk for roarke it seemed there would always be a table at the most exclusive restaurant front row seats at the current hit play and a convenient parking place on the street he glided in and killed the engine you dont i trust expect me to wait here what i expect doesnt usually hold water with you come on but try to remember youre a civilian im not thats something i never forget he code locked the car it was a good neighborhood but the car was worth an easy six months rent in even the most exclusive of units in the building darling before we shift into the official mode what do you have on under that dress a device designed to drive men wild its working i dont believe ive ever seen your butt move quite that way its a cops butt now ace so watch it i am he smiled gave it a nice solid smack believe me good evening peabody roarke her face bland as if she hadnt heard a word peabody stepped out from the shrubbery dallas any sign of eve went into a defensive crouch as the shrubbery rustled then swore as casto came out grinning goddamn it peabody now dont blame deedee i was with her when your call came in she wouldnt have been able to shake me interdepartmental cooperation eve still smiling he extended a hand roarke a pleasure to meet you jake casto illegals so i gathered roarkes brow cocked as he noted casto take in the black satin that slithered over eves body in the manner of men or unfriendly male dogs roarke showed his teeth nice dress eve you mentioned something about taking a sample to the lab do you always listen in on another cops transmissions well he stroked his chin the call came through at a particular moment you see id have had to be deaf not to catch it he sobered you figure you got jerry fitzgerald with a dose of immortality well have to wait for the analysis she shifted her attention to peabody is young in there thats confirmed a check with security shows him coming in about nineteen hundred he hasnt been out since unless he took the back way no sir peabody allowed herself a small smile i called his link when i arrived and he answered i apologized for the wrong contact hes seen you peabody shook her head men like that dont remember underlings he didnt make me and theres been no movement in this area since my arrival at twentythree thirtyeight she gestured over up his lights are on so we wait casto you could make yourself useful and stake out the front entrance he flashed a grin trying to get rid of me her eyes lit in response yep we could get technical as primary on the moppett johannsen pandora and ro homicides i have full authority on coordinating investigations therefore youre a tough woman eve he sighed shrugged sent peabody a wink keep a light burning for me deedee im sorry lieutenant peabody began formally when casto moved off he overheard the transmission as there was no way to prevent him from coming to the scene on his own it seemed more productive to enlist his aid it doesnt seem to be a problem when her communicator beeped she shifted aside dallas she listened a moment lips curving then nodded thanks she started to slip the unit into her pocket then remembered she didnt have a pocket and dropped it into her bag fitzgeralds sprung own recognizance not surprising shed get or over a little tussle at a fashion party if the lab results fall peabody said if we wait on that she glanced at roarke this could be a long night you dont have to hang peabody and casto can drop me when were done i like long nights a moment of your time lieutenant with a firm hand on her arm roarke led her a few paces away you didnt mention you had an admirer in illegals she ran a hand through her hair didnt i the kind of admirer whod like to nibble his way up your extremities thats an interesting way of putting it look he and peabody are an item at the moment that doesnt stop him from licking his chops over you she gave a quick snorting laugh then catching the look in roarkes eye she sobered and cleared her throat hes harmless i dont think so come on roarke its just one of those little testosterone games you guys play his eyes were still gleaming and caused something to jitter not unpleasantly in her stomach youre not like jealous yes it was demeaning to admit it but he was a man who did what had to be done really the jittery feeling turned into a nice warm spread of pleasure well thanks there was no point in sighing certainly no point in giving her a quick shake instead he dipped his hands in his pockets and inclined his head youre welcome eve were going to be married in a few days the jittering started again big time yeah if he keeps looking at you like that im going to have to hurt him she smiled patted his cheek down boy before she could do more than chuckle hed snagged her wrist leaned in close you belong to me her eyes fired her teeth bared the show of temper had him relaxing immediately it goes both ways darling but in case you havent noticed it seems only fair to tell you im very territorial over whats mine he kissed her snarling mouth i do love you eve ridiculously its ridiculous all right to settle her temper she tried a long slow breath look not that i figure you deserve any explanation but im not interested in casto or anybody else and as it happens peabodys gone over him so just shut down your thrusters done now would you like me to go back to the car and get some coffee she angled her head is that a cheap bribe to smooth this over ill remind you that my blend of coffee isnt cheap peabody takes hers light hold it she grabbed his arm tugged him back toward the bushes wait for it eve murmured as a car shot down the street it squealed to a halt did a fast vertical to squeeze into a toplevel parking spot impatient maneuvering knocked bumpers a woman in shimmering silver strode down the ramp to the sidewalk theres our girl eve said quietly she didnt waste any time you called it lieutenant peabody commented looks like now why would a woman who has recently gone through an uncomfortable inconvenient and potentially embarrassing situation run straight to a man shes just broken up with accused of cheating and who popped her in the face all in public sadomasochistic tendencies roarke suggested i dont think so eve said appreciating him its s and m all right but it stands for sex and money and lookie here peabody our heroine knows the back way in with one careless glance over her shoulder jerry headed straight for the maintenance entrance keyed in a code and disappeared inside id say shes done that before roarke laid a hand on eves shoulder is that enough to break their alibi its a damn good start reaching in her bag she took out surveillance goggles she strapped them on adjusting the power as she focused on justin youngs windows cant see him she murmured no ones in the living area she shifted her head bedrooms empty but theres a flight bag open on the bed a lot of doors closed no way to get a view of the kitchen and rear entrance from here damn it she put her hands on her hips and kept scanning theres a glass of something on the table by the bed and a light playing id say his bedroom screens on there she is now eves lips stayed curved as she watched jerry storm into the bedroom the goggles were powerful enough to give her a clear closeup of undiluted fury jerrys mouth was moving she reached down plucked off her shoes heaved them temper temper eve murmured shes calling for him throwing things enter the young hero stage left well ive got to say hes built with her own goggles in place peabody let out a low hum of agreement justin was buck naked his skin beaded with water his gilded hair sleeked with it apparently jerry was unimpressed she raged at him shoved while he held up his hands shook his head the argument grew heated dramatic eve mused with lots of arm gestures tossing heads then it changed tones abruptly justin was tearing off jerrys tenthousanddollar silver gown as they fell on the bed aw isnt that sweet peabody theyre making up roarke tapped eves shoulder i dont suppose you have another pair of them pervert but since it seemed only fair she tugged the goggles off handed them to him you may be called as a witness how im not even here he slipped the goggles on adjusted them after a moment he shook his head theyre not terribly imaginative are they tell me lieutenant do you spend much time watching fornication during surveillance theres nothing much a human being can do to another i havent watched recognizing the tone he slipped the goggles off handed them back its a miserable job id have to agree that murder suspects arent entitled to privacy she jerked a shoulder and readjusted the goggles it was imperative to find the humor again she knew some cops got off peeking into bedroom windows and misuse of the goggles was rampant on all levels she considered them a tool an important one no matter how often their use was challenged in the courts looks like the finale she said blandly i have to appreciate their speed justin levered on his elbows plunged into her with her feet planted firmly on the mattress jerry pumped her hips to meet him their faces shone with sweat and tightly closed eyes added twin expressions of agony and delight when he collapsed on her eve started to speak she held her tongue as jerrys arms came up cuddled justin nuzzled jerrys neck they held each other stroking cheek brushing cheek ill be damned eve muttered its not just sex they care more than the animal lust the very human affection was difficult to watch they separated briefly sat up together with legs companionably tangled he smoothed her tangled hair she turned her face into the palm of his hand they began to talk from the expressions on their faces the tone was serious intense at one point jerry lowered her head weeping justin kissed her hair her brow then got up and crossed the room from a minifriggie he took a slim glass bottle and poured a glass of dark blue liquid his face was grim as she snatched it from his hand downed it in one quick gulp health drink my ass shes using just her peabody put in hes not having any justin drew jerry from the bed and with an arm around her waist led her out of the bedroom out of vision keep scanning peabody eve ordered she tugged down the goggles so that they hung around her neck shes on the edge about something and i dont think its over our little shoving match the pressures gotten to her some people arent naturalborn killers if theyre trying to distance themselves from each other add more strength to their alibi it was risky for her to come here tonight eve nodded as she looked at roarke she needed him addictions come in all forms as her communicator signaled eve reached into her bag dallas rush rush rush dickie give me good news an interesting mix lieutenant other than a few additions to take it to liquid add pretty color and a mildly fruity taste youve got yourself a match all the elements from the powder previously analyzed are in there including nectar from the immortal blossom it is however a less potent mix and when ingested by mouth thats all i need transmit full report to my office unit stat copy whitney casto and the prosecutor want me to tie a nice red bow around it too he said sourly dont be such a shit dickie youll get your fiftyyardline seats for arena ball she broke transmission grinned call for a search and confiscate warrant peabody lets go take them down yes sir ah casto tell him were coming around front illegals will get its share o o it was five a m by the time theyd waded through the official paperwork and finished the first round of interviews fitzgeralds lawyers had insisted on a sixhour break minimum with no choice but to comply eve ordered peabody off duty until eight and swung by her own office didnt i tell you to go get some sleep she asked when she saw roarke kicked back at her desk i had some work frowning she glanced at the monitor on her desk unit the intricate blueprints had her hissing this is police property tampering with police property can get you eighteen months under home security would you hold off on the arrest im nearly finished east wing view all levels im not kidding roarke you cant use my link for personal business hmm note to adjust recreational center c square footage insufficient transmit all memos and amended dimensions cfd architectural and design freestar one office save to disc and disengage he slipped the disc out tucked it into his pocket you were saying this unit is programmed for my voice print just how did you get it operational he only smiled really eve all right dont tell me i dont want to know anyway couldnt you have done this at home certainly but then i wouldnt have had the pleasure of taking you home and making you get a few hours sleep he rose which is what im about to do now im going to catch a nap in the lounge no you were going to sit here combing through evidence and doing probability scans until your eyes fell out she could have denied it it wasnt very hard to lie under most circumstances i just have a couple of things i want to put into order he tilted his head wheres peabody i sent her home and the inestimable casto recognizing the trap but not the escape route eve shrugged i think he went with her your suspects theyve got a minimum break coming and so he said taking her arm do you she started to tug away but he continued to march her out into the hall im sure everyone appreciates your new interview look but i imagine youd do a better job of it after a nap a shower and a change of clothes she looked down at the black satin gown shed completely forgotten she had it on ive probably got a pair of jeans in my locker when he was able to bundle her into the elevator with little effort she realized she was flagging okay okay ill go home and catch a shower maybe some breakfast and roarke thought at least five hours sleep howd it go in there hmm she blinked shook herself alert not too much progress didnt expect it on the first round theyre sticking tight to their original story and claiming the drug was planted weve got enough for an enforced drug test on fitzgerald her lawyers are making a lot of noise over it but well get it she yawned hugely well use that to finesse data out of her if not an outright confession well triple team them on the next round roarke led her out the breezeway to the visitors lot where hed parked she was walking he noted with the intense care of a woman deeply drunk they wont stand a chance he said as they approached his car roarke disengage locks he opened the door all but folded her into the passenger seat well shift off castos a good interviewer her head lolled back on the seat gotta give him that peabodys got potential shes tenacious well keep the three of them in separate rooms keep changing interviewers on them im betting on young to fall first roarke eased out of the lot headed for home why the bastard loves her love messes you up you make mistakes cause youre worried protective stupid he smiled a little brushed her hair back from her face and she dropped steeply into sleep tell me about it chapter eighteen if recent behavior was any example of what it was like to have a husband eve told herself it couldnt be half bad shed been coddled into bed which she was forced to admit had been for the best and had been awakened five unremembered hours later by the scent of hot coffee and fresh waffles roarke had already been up dressed and poring over some vital business transmission it did irk her from time to time that he seemed to get by on less sleep than a normal human but she didnt mention it that sort of comment would only gain her a smirk it was to his benefit that he didnt point out that he was taking care of her knowing it was weird enough without having him crow over it so she headed toward cop central rested well fed and in her newly repaired vehicle which in under five blocks decided to surprise her with a new foible her speed indicator shot straight into red though she was sitting dead still in a traffic snarl warning she was told pleasantly engine overload in five minutes at current speed please reduce velocity or switch to auto overdrive bite me she suggested not so pleasantly and drove the rest of the way with the constant cheerful advice to reduce velocity or blow up she wasnt going to let it affect her mood the nasty blackhearted thunderclouds rolling in and sending air traffic scrambling didnt bother her the fact that it was saturday a week before her wedding and she was in for a long hard potentially brutal day at work didnt diminish her pleasure she strode into cop central her smile fixed and grim you look ready to gnaw raw meat feeney commented the way i like it best any additional data lets take the long way ill fill you in he detoured to a sky glide nearly empty at midday the mechanism stuttered a bit but carried them upward manhattan receded to a pretty toy town of crisscrossing avenues and brightly colored vehicles lightning cracked the sky with an accompanying boom of thunder that shook the glass enclosure rain poured through the crack in gleeful buckets just made it feeney peered down watched pedestrians scramble like maddened ants an airbus blatted its horn and skidded past the glass with inches to spare jesus feeney slapped a hand to his jumping heart where do those fuckers get their license anybody with a pulse can drive those sky doggers you couldnt get me in one with a laser blast public transportation in this citys a disgrace he took out a bag of candied nuts to calm himself anyway your hunch on the calls from maui panned out young called fitzgeralds place twice before he hopped a shuttle back he ordered the showing on screen too full two hours got any security of his place on the night cockroach bought it young came in with his flight bag about six a m his shuttle got in at midnight no data on how he spent the missing six hours no alibi he had plenty of time to get from the terminal to the murder scene can we place fitzgerald she was at the ballroom until a little past twentytwo thirty rehearsals for last nights do didnt show up at her place until oh eight she made plenty of calls her stylist her masseuse her body sculptor spent four hours yesterday at paradise getting herself buffed and polished young he spent the day talking with his agent his business manager and feeney smiled a little a travel consultant our boy was interested in a trip for two to the eden colony i love you feeney im a lovable kind of guy picked up the sweepers reports on my way in nothing we can use on youngs place or fitzgeralds the only trace of illegals was in the blue juice if theyve got more theyre keeping it elsewhere no logs or records of any transactions no sign of formulas ive still got the hard drives to diddle with see if they hid anything in them but if you ask me those two arent hightech geniuses no redford would probably know more about that weve got more than murder and trafficking here feeney if we can get the stuff classified as poison and pin them with prior knowledge of its lethal qualities well have fullscale racketeering and conspiracy to slaughter nobodys used conspiracy to slaughter since the urban wars dallas the glide ground to a halt i think it has a nice ring she found peabody waiting outside the interview area wheres the rest of our party suspects are in conference with their attorneys castos getting coffee okay contact the conference rooms their times up any word from the commander hes on his way in he wants to observe the pas office will participate via link good feeneys going to oversee the recordings on all three subjects i dont want any slipups when this business comes to trial you take fitzgerald for the first round castos on redford i want young she signaled when she spotted casto coming toward them juggling a tray of coffee feeney fill them in on the additional data use it wisely she added and copped a cup of coffee well switch teams in thirty minutes she slipped into her interview area the first sip of miserable eatery coffee made her smile it was going to be a good day o o you can do better than that justin eve was revving up had barely hit her stride it was hour three of interview you asked me what happened the other cops asked me what happened he took a drink of water he was well off his stride and faltering i told you youre an actor she pointed out all friendly smiles a good one all the reviews say so i read one just the other day that said you can make a bad line sing i dont hear music here justin how many times do you want me to go over the same ground he looked toward his lawyer how long do i have to do this we can stop the interview process at any time his lawyer reminded him she was a sharplooking blonde with killer eyes youre under no obligation to make any further statements thats right eve chimed in we can stop you can go back to holding youre not going to make bail on the illegals charges justin she leaned forward made sure his eyes focused on hers not while there are four counts of murder hanging over you my client has not been charged with any crime other than suspicion of possession the lawyer peered down her needlestraight nose you dont have a case here lieutenant we all know it your clients dangling over the edge of a very steep cliff we all know that want to take the fall alone justin that doesnt seem very fair to me your friends are answering questions right now she lifted her hands spread her fingers what are you going to do if they roll over on you i didnt kill anyone he flicked his gaze toward the door toward the mirror he knew he had an audience and for once he didnt know how to play the crowd i never even heard of those other people but you knew pandora of course i knew pandora obviously i knew her you were there at her house on the night she died ive said so havent i look jerry and i went to her house at her invitation we had a few drinks that other woman came around pandora got obnoxious and we left how often do you and ms fitzgerald use the unsecured entrance at your building its just a matter of privacy he insisted if you had media hounding you every time you tried to take a piss youd understand eve knew exactly what that was like and smiled toothily funny neither of you seemed to be particularly shy of media exposure in fact if i were a cynic id have to say the two of you exploited it how long has jerry been on immortality i dont know his eyes shifted to the mirror again as if he was hoping a director would say cut and end the scene i told you i didnt know what was in that drink you had a bottle in your bedroom but you didnt know the contents never took a taste of it i never touched it thats funny too justin you know it seems to me if something was in my friggie id be tempted to sample it unless i knew it was poison of course you know immortalitys a slow poison dont you it doesnt have to be he stopped himself breathed hard through his nose i dont know anything about it an overload on the nervous system slow acting but lethal all the same you poured jerry a drink handed it to her thats murder lieutenant id never hurt jerry he exploded im in love with her id never hurt her really several witnesses claim you did just that a few days ago did you or did you not strike ms fitzgerald in the backstage area of the waldorfs royal ballroom on july second no i we lost our tempers the lines were tangling in his head he couldnt remember his cue it was a misunderstanding you hit her in the face yes no yes we were arguing you were arguing so you punched the woman you love knocking her off her feet were you still violently angry with her when she came to your apartment last night when you poured her a glass of slowacting poison i tell you its not poison not like you mean i wouldnt hurt her i was never angry with her i couldnt be you were never angry with her you never hurt her i believe you justin eve soothed her voice leaned forward again laid a kind hand over his trembling one you never hit her either you staged it all didnt you youre not the kind of man who strikes the woman he loves you staged it just like one of your performances i didnt i he looked up helplessly into eves eyes and she knew she had him youve done a lot of action videos you know how to pull a punch how to fake one thats what you did that day isnt it justin you and jerry pretended to fight you never laid a hand on her her voice was gentle full of understanding youre not a violent kind of guy are you justin torn he pressed his lips together looked at his lawyer she held up a hand to hold off more questions and leaned close to justins ear keeping her face bland eve waited she knew the pickle they were in did he admit to the staging making himself into a liar or did he cop to punching his lover showing his capabilities for violence it wasnt a steady wire to cross the lawyer shifted back and folded her hands my client and ms fitzgerald were playing a harmless game foolish admittedly but it isnt a crime to pretend to fight no it isnt a crime eve felt the first crackle weakening the back of their alibi neither is going off to maui and pretending to play house with another woman it was all make believe wasnt it justin we just i suppose we didnt take time to think it all through we were worried thats all after you picked up paul we wondered if youd shoot for us we were all there that night so it seemed logical you know thats just what i thought she beamed a friendly smile its a very logical step we both had important projects going we couldnt afford whats happening right now we thought if we pretended to split up it would add weight to our alibi because you knew the alibi was weak you had to figure wed fall to the fact that either of you or both of you could have left the apartment undetected on the night of pandoras murder you could have gone to leonardos killed her and slipped back home without any security breach we didnt go anywhere you cant prove we did his shoulders straightened you cant prove anything dont be too sure your lovers an immortality junkie you had possession of the drug how did you get it i someone gave it to her i dont know was it redford did he hook her justin you must hate him if he did the woman you love she started dying justin the first time she took a sip its not poison its not she told me that was just pandoras way of keeping it for herself pandora didnt want jerry to benefit from the drink the bitch knew what it could do for jerry but she wanted he broke off heeding his lawyers sharp warning a little too late what did she want justin money a lot of money you did she taunt jerry did she threaten you is that why you killed her no i never touched her i tell you i never touched her we argued all right we had an ugly scene after leonardos woman left that night jerry was upset she had a right to be after everything pandora said thats why i took her out had a few drinks calmed her down i told her not to worry that there were other ways of getting a supply what other ways his breath heaved in and out frantically he shook off his lawyers restraining hand shut up he snapped at her just shut up what the hell good are you doing me shell have me in a cage for murder before shes finished i want to cut a deal why arent you cutting a deal here he scrubbed the back of his hand over his mouth i want to deal well have to talk about that eve said calmly what have you got to offer me paul he said and shuddered out a breath ill give you paul redford he killed her the bastard probably killed them all o o twenty minutes later eve paced the conference room i want redford to stew for a while let him wonder how much theyve told us not getting much out of the lady casually casto propped his feet on the table crossed his ankles shes tough showing signs of withdrawal dry mouth trembling occasional lack of focus but shes sticking she hasnt had a fix in what over ten hours how long do you figure she can last dont know enough casto spread his hands she could ice it out come out the other side or she could be a sloppy puddle of tapioca in another ten minutes okay so we dont count on her breaking redford was showing a few cracks peabody put in hes scared boneless his lawyers the hardass if we had him alone for five minutes hed crack like a walnut thats not an option whitney studied the hard copy of the most recent interviews youll have youngs statement to pressure him with its weak eve muttered youll have to make it look stronger he claims redford first introduced fitzgerald to immortality about three months ago suggested a partnership and according to our fairhaired boy it was all going to be legal and aboveboard eve gave a derisive grunt nobodys that fucking naive i dont know peabody murmured hes crosseyed over fitzgerald id say she could have convinced him it was a straight deal research and development a new line of beauty and youth aids carrying fitzgeralds name and all they had to do was edge out pandora casto smiled the money would roll in it still comes down to profit pandora was in the way eve dropped into a seat the others were in the way maybe youngs just an innocent schmuck maybe not hes pointed at redford but what he hasnt figured out yet is that he could be fingering fitzgerald at the same time she told him enough for him to plan a trip to the eden colony hoping the two of them could finesse a specimen of their own youve got your illegals conspiracy whitney pointed out if young shakes off the rest hell have his deal youve still got a way to go for murder at this point his testimony isnt going to hold much weight he believes redford did pandora he gives us motive we can establish opportunity but theres no physical evidence no witnesses he rose get me a confession dallas the pas putting on the pressure theyre dropping charges on freestone monday if they dont have something else to feed the media were all going to look like assholes casto took out a penknife began trimming his nails as whitney left the room christ knows we wouldnt want the pa to look like an asshole shit they want it all laid out on a platter dont they his eyes lifted to eves redfords not going to cop to murder eve hell go down for the drug hell its almost fashionable but hes not going to swing to four homicides weve only got one hope to pin on which is peabody wanted to know that he didnt do it alone we crack one of the others we crack him my moneys on fitzgerald then you take her eve blew out a breath ill work redford peabody take redfords picture go back to the club go back to boomers place to cockroachs to moppetts show the damn thing to everybody i need one lousy make she scowled as the link beeped and she engaged it dallas dont bother me its always lovely to hear your voice roarke said implacably im in conference so am i im leaving for freestar in thirty minutes youre going off planet but well have a good trip it cant be avoided i should be back within three days you know how to contact me yeah i know she wanted to say things foolish things private things im going to be pretty tied up myself for a while she said instead see you when you get back you might check your office lieutenant mavis has been trying to reach you most of the day it appears youve missed your last fitting leonardo is distraught eve did her best to ignore castos quick chuckle ive got other things on my mind dont we all find a minute to deal with him darling for my sake lets get all those people out of our house i wanted to boot them out days ago i thought you liked having all those people around and i thought he was your brother roarke murmured what old joke no eve i dont like having all those people around they are in a word maniacs i found galahad cowering under the bed just now someone has covered him with beads and tiny red bows its mortifying for both of us she bit down on her tongue to hold back the snort of laughter roarke wasnt looking amused now that i know theyre driving you crazy i feel better well move them along do that oh and im afraid there might be a few details for next saturday youll have to handle while im gone summerset has the memos my transports waiting she watched him signal to someone off screen then his eyes locked back on hers see you in a few days lieutenant yeah the screen went blank as she muttered bon fucking voyage well hell eve if you need to run off to your dressmaker or take your cat to therapy peabody and i can handle this minor matter of murder eves lips stretched in a vicious smile bite me casto despite his many annoying qualities casto had solid instincts redford wasnt going to break any time soon eve worked him hard and had the mild satisfaction of pinning him on the illegals charges but a confession to multiple murder just wasnt happening lets see if ive got this straight she rose she needed to stretch her legs she poured coffee it was pandora who told you about immortality and that was as i said about a year and a half ago perhaps a little more he was iced down now totally in control the illegals charges could be dealt with particularly from the angle hed chosen she came to me with a business proposition or so she termed it she claimed to have access to a formula something that would revolutionize the beauty and health industry a beauty aid and she didnt mention the illegal or the dangerous qualities not at that time she needed backing to start the line one she intended to launch under her name did she show you the formula she did not as i told you before she strung me along made promises admittedly it was poor judgment on my part i was sexually addicted to her a weakness she exploited at the same time the business aspect seemed to have merit she was using the product in tablet form and the results were impressive i could see that it made her look younger more fit it increased her energy and her sexual drive marketed correctly a product such as that would generate enormous profit i wanted the money for some commercially risky projects you wanted the money so you continued to pay her little dribs and drabs without being fully informed for a time i did grow impatient and made demands she made more promises i began to suspect that she intended to go out on her own or that she was working with someone else using me so i took a sample for myself took a sample he took his time answering as if he was still grafting the words i took her key while she was sleeping and unlocked the box where she kept the tablets i in the interest of protecting my investment took a few to have them analyzed and when did you steal the drug in the interest of protecting your investment theft is not established the lawyer interrupted my client had paid in good faith for the product okay well rephrase when did you decide to take a more active interest in your business investment about six months ago i took the samples to a contact i have in chemical analysis and paid him for a private report and learned redford paused to study his fingers i learned that the product did indeed have the properties pandora had promised however it was addictive which pushed it automatically into the illegals category it was also potentially lethal when taken regularly over a long period of time and being a righteous man you counted your losses and pulled out of the deal being righteous is not a legal requirement redford said mildly and i had an investment to protect i decided to do some research to see if the unacceptable side effects could be diminished or eradicated i believe we accomplished that or nearly so you used jerry fitzgerald as a guinea pig that was a miscalculation perhaps i was overeager as pandora continued to push for more money and made statements that indicated she was about to go public with the product i wanted to beat her to it and knew that jerry would be the perfect spokeswoman she agreed for a fee to try the product my people had refined in a liquid form science makes mistakes lieutenant the drug was still as we learned too late highly addictive and fatal it seems the process has been slowed but yes im afraid there is still the potential for physical harm in the long term a possible side effect i warned jerry of several weeks ago before or after pandora discovered you were trying to ace her out i believe it was after just after unfortunately jerry and pandora ran into each other at a function pandora made some comments about her former relationship with justin from what i gather and this is secondhand jerry tossed the business deal we had made in pandoras face and pandora didnt take kindly to it she was naturally furious our relationship was rocky at best by that time i had already procured a specimen of the immortal blossom determined to delete all side effects from the formula i had no intention lieutenant of releasing a dangerous drug to the public my records will substantiate that well let illegals handle that one did pandora threaten you pandora lived for threats one became accustomed to them i felt i was in a good position to ignore them even to counter them he smiled now more confident you see if she had gone forward knowing what properties were contained in the formula i could have ruined her i had no reason to harm her your relationship was rocky yet you went to her home that night in hopes that we could come to some compromise thats why i insisted that justin and jerry be present you had sex with her she was a beautiful desirable woman yes i had sex with her she had tablets of the drug in her possession she did as i told you she kept them in a box in her vanity his smile came back i told you about the box and the tablets because i assumed correctly that an autopsy would show traces of the drug it seemed wise to be forthcoming i did nothing but cooperate easy to cooperate if you knew i wouldnt find the tablets after she was dead you went back for the box protecting your investment if there was no product but yours no competitor how much more profit there would be i did not go back to her home after i left i had no reason to my product was superior neither of those products would have made the market and you knew it but on the street hers would have hit big bigger than your refined watered down and most likely more expensive version with more research more testing more money youd already put over three hundred thousand in her hands youd gone to the considerable expense to procure a specimen paid for the research and testing to date paid fitzgerald i imagine you were becoming a little anxious to see some profit how much did you charge jerry for a fix jerry and i had a business arrangement ten thousand a delivery eve interrupted and watched the point strike home thats the amount she transferred three times over a twomonth period to your account on starlight station an investment he began you addicted her then you hosed her that makes you a dealer mr redford the lawyer went into his spin routine turning a drug deal into a profitandloss arrangement between investment partners you needed contacts street contacts boomer was always a sucker for a credit in the hand but he got carried away liked to test the product how did he get the formula that was sloppy of you i dont know anyone by that name you saw him flapping his lips at the club making a big deal of himself when he went into a privacy room with hetta moppett you couldnt be sure how much hed told her but when he saw you and he ran you had to act youre on the wrong beam lieutenant i dont know these people maybe you killed hetta in panic you didnt really mean to but when you saw she was dead you had to cover it up thats where the overkill came in maybe she told you something before she died maybe she didnt but you had to get to boomer then id say you were enjoying it now the way you messed him up tortured him before you finished him but you got a little overconfident and didnt get to his flop to search it before i did she pushed away from the table took a turn around the room now youve got big problems the cops have a sample they have the formula and pandoras getting out of hand what choice do you have she put her hands on the table leaned in close what can a man do when he sees his investment and all those future profits going into the sewer my business with pandora was finished yeah you finished it taking her to leonardos was smart youre a smart man she was already wired over mavis if you do her at his place its going to look like hed had enough youd have to do him too if he was there but you had a taste for it now hes not there so its easier easier still when mavis walks in and you can set her up redfords breathing was a bit forced but he was holding the last time i saw pandora she was alive vicious and eager to punish someone if mavis freestone didnt kill her my guess would be jerry fitzgerald intrigued eve angled back to her chair leaned back really why they despised each other were in direct competition now more than ever on top of everything else pandora was angling to lure justin back that was something jerry wouldnt tolerate and he smiled it was jerry who put the idea of going to leonardos for a showdown into pandoras head this is a new one eve thought and cocked a brow is that so after ms freestone left pandora was edgy angry jerry seemed to enjoy that and the fact that the young woman had gotten a few shots in she egged pandora on said something to the effect that if she was pandora she wouldnt tolerate being humiliated that way and why didnt she go straight over to leonardos and show him who was in charge there was another little dig about pandora not being able to hold onto a man then justin hustled jerry out his smile widened they despised pandora you see jerry for obvious reasons and justin because id told him that the drug was pandoras doing justin would do anything to protect jerry absolutely anything i on the other hand had no emotional attachment to any of the players it was just sex with pandora just sex lieutenant and business o o eve rapped on the door where casto was interviewing jerry when he poked his head out she shifted her gaze studied the woman at the table i need to talk to her shes running down running out not going to get too much out of her today lawyers already making noises about a break i need to talk to her eve repeated how have you been handling her this round tough line hardass okay ill downgrade eve slipped into the room she could still feel pity she realized jerrys eyes were jittery and shadowed her face was drawn and her hands shook as they ran over it her beauty was fragile now and haunted you want some food eve asked in a quiet voice no jerrys gaze bounced around the room i want to go home i want justin well see if we can arrange a visit itll have to be supervised she poured water why dont you drink a little of this take a minute she covered jerrys hands with her own on the glass lifted it to the trembling lips this is rough on you im sorry we cant give you anything to counteract the crash we dont know enough yet and whatever we gave you might be worse im all right its nothing it sucks eve slipped into a seat redford got you into this he verified that its nothing she said again im just tired i need a little of my health drink she looked hopefully pitifully at eve cant i have a little just to gear back up you know its dangerous jerry you know what its doing to you counselor paul redford has stated on record that he introduced ms fitzgerald to the illegal under the pretense of a business venture it is our assumption that she was unaware of its addictive qualities we have no intention at this time of charging her with use as eve had hoped the lawyer relaxed visibly well then lieutenant id like to arrange for my clients release and her admission into rehab voluntary admission voluntary admission can be arranged if your client can cooperate for a few more minutes it would help me in closing the charges on redford if she cooperates lieutenant all illegals charges will be dropped you know i cant promise that counselor i will however recommend leniency on the charges of possession and intent to distribute and justin youll let him go eve looked back at jerry love she thought was an odd burden was he involved in the business transaction no he wanted me to pull out when he found out that i was dependent he pushed me to go into rehab to stop taking the drink but i needed it i was going to stop but i needed it the night pandora died there was an argument there was always an argument with pandora she was hateful she thought she could get justin back the bitch didnt care about him she just wanted to hurt me to hurt him he wouldnt have gone back to her would he jerry he hated her as much as i did she lifted her beautifully manicured nails to her mouth started to gnaw were glad shes dead jerry i dont care she exploded with a wild look to her cautioning lawyer she deserved to die she wanted everything never cared how she got it justin was mine i would have been headliner at leonardos show if she hadnt found out i was interested she went out of her way to seduce him to have me cut out so that she could take the job it would have been my job it should have been my job all along just like justin was mine like the drug was mine it makes you beautiful and strong and sexy and every time anyone takes it theyll think of me not of her of me did justin go with you to leonardos that night lieutenant what is this its a question counselor did he jerry no of course not we we didnt go there we went out for drinks we went home you taunted her didnt you you knew how to play her you had to be sure shed go hunt down leonardo did redford contact you tell you when shed left no i dont know youre confusing me cant i have something i need my drink you were using it that night it made you strong strong enough to kill her you wanted her dead she was always in your way and her tablets were stronger more effective than your liquid did you want them jerry yes i wanted them she was getting younger in front of my eyes thinner i have to watch every fucking bite i take but she paul said he might be able to get them from her justin told him to back off to stay away from me but justin doesnt understand he doesnt understand how it makes you feel immortal she said with a horrible smile it makes you feel immortal for gods sake just one drink you slipped out of the back that night went to leonardos what happened then i cant im confused i need something did you pick up the cane and hit her did you keep hitting her i wanted her dead on a sob jerry laid her head on the table i wanted her dead for gods sake help me ill tell you anything you want to hear if you just help me lieutenant anything my client says under physical and mental duress is inadmissible eve studied the weeping woman and reached for the link get the mts in here she ordered and arrange for hospital transport for ms fitzgerald under guard chapter nineteen what do you mean youre not charging her his eyes went dark with shock and temper as casto erupted you got a fucking confession it wasnt a confession eve corrected she was tired dead tired and sick of herself shed have said anything jesus christ eve jesus christ in an attempt to walk off fury casto paced up and down the antiseptic tiled corridor of the health center you aced her the hell i did wearily eve rubbed at a headache in her left temple listen to me casto the shape she was in shed have told me she personally drove nails into the palms of christ if id promised her a fix i charge her on the basis of that her lawyers will tear it apart in pretrial youre not worried about pretrial he passed the tightlipped peabody on his stride back to eve you went for the jugular just like a cops supposed to in a murder case now youve gone soft youre fucking sorry for her dont tell me what i am eve said evenly and dont tell me how to run this investigation im primary casto so back the hell off he measured her you dont want me to go over your head with this decision threats she angled her body up on the balls of her feet like a boxer ready to dance you go ahead and do what you have to do my recommendation stands she gets treatment though christ knows how much good thats going to do her in the short term then we reinterview until im satisfied shes coherent and capable of judgment she wont be charged eve could see he was making an effort to pull himself back and she could see it was costing him she didnt give a damn eve youve got motive youve got opportunity youve got the personality capacity tests shes capable of the crimes in question she was at her own admission under the influence and predisposed to hate pandoras guts what the fuck do you want i want her to look me in the eye clear in the eye and tell me she did them i want her to tell me how she did them until then we wait because ill tell you something hotshot no way she acted alone no fucking way she did all of them with her own pretty hands why because shes a woman no because money isnt her big pull passion is love is envy is so maybe she did pandora in a fit of jealous rage but i dont buy her doing the others not without help not without a push so we wait we reinterview and we get her to finger young and or redford then we have it all i think youre wrong so noted she said briskly now go file your interdepartmental complaint take a walk or blow it out your ass but get out of my face his eyes flickered the temper in them ripe and ready but he stepped back im going to go cool off he stormed off with barely a glance at the silent peabody your pals running a little low on charm this evening eve commented peabody could have said the same went for her commanding officer but she held her tongue were all under a lot of pressure dallas this bust means a lot to him you know what peabody justice means a little more to me than a pretty gold star on my record or some fucking captains bars and if you want to go run after lover boy and stroke his ego no ones stopping you peabodys jaw twitched but her voice was even im not going anywhere lieutenant fine just stand here and look martyred because i in midtirade eve stopped sucked in her breath im sorry youre a goddamn handy target at the moment peabody is that part of my job description sir you always have a fine comeback i could learn to hate you for that calmer eve laid a hand on her aides shoulder i am sorry and im sorry to put you in a tight spot duty and personal emotions never mix well i can handle it he was wrong to come at you that way dallas i can understand how he feels but it doesnt make him right maybe not eve leaned against the wall and closed her eyes but he was right about one thing and its eating at me i didnt have the stomach for what i did to fitzgerald in interview i didnt have the stomach while i was doing it while i was hearing myself hammer at her twist her up when she was suffering but i did it because thats my job and going for the jugular when the preys wounded is exactly what im supposed to do eve opened her eyes and stared hard at the door behind which jerry fitzgerald was mildly sedated and sometimes peabody the job just fucking sucks yes sir for the first time peabody reached out and touched a hand to eves arm thats why youre so good at it eve opened her mouth surprised when a laugh popped out goddamn peabody i really like you i like you too she waited a beat whats wrong with us cheered a little she slung an arm around peabodys sturdy shoulders lets go get something to eat fitzgeralds not going anywhere tonight on that eves instincts proved to be wrong o o the call woke her at a little before four am out of a deep and thankfully dreamless sleep her eyes were gritty her tongue thick from the wine shed indulged in to be marginally sociable with mavis and leonardo she managed a croak as she answered the link dallas christ doesnt anyone ever sleep in this town i often ask myself the same question the face and voice on the link were vaguely familiar eve struggled to focus to roll through her memory discs doctor hell ambrose it slid back layer by layer ambrose spindly female mixed race head of chemical rehab at the midtown rehabilitation center for substance addiction you still there is fitzgerald coming around not exactly lieutenant we have a problem here patient fitzgerald is dead dead what do you mean dead as in deceased ambrose said with a bland smile as a homicide lieutenant i imagine youre familiar with the term how damn it did her nervous system give out did she jump out a fucking window as near as we can determine she overdosed herself she managed to get her hands on the sample of immortality we were using to determine the proper treatment for her she took all of it in combination with a few of the other goodies we have stashed here im sorry lieutenant shes gone we cant bring her back ill fill you in on the details when you and your team arrive damn right you will eve snapped and broke transmission o o eve viewed the body first as if to ensure herself there hadnt been a horrible mistake jerry had been laid on the bed her colorcoded hospital gown draped to midthigh sky blue for addict first stage treatment she was never going to get to stage two her beauty was back oddly eerie in the bonewhite face the shadows were gone from under her eyes the strain from around the mouth death was the ultimate calmer after all there were faint burn marks on her chest where the resuscitating team had worked on her a light bruising on the back of her hand where the iv had pinched under the doctors wary eye eve examined the body thoroughly but found no signs of violence shed died eve supposed as happy as she would ever be how eve demanded shortly the combination of immortality and as far as we can determine by whats missing doses of morphine and synthetic zeus autopsy will confirm you keep zeus here in a rehab the idea had eve scrubbing her hands over her face jesus for research and rehabilitation ambrose said tightly subjects addicted need a slow supervised withdrawal period so where the hell was the supervision doctor ms fitzgerald was sedated she was not expected to regain full consciousness until eight a m my hypothesis would be that as we dont fully understand the properties of immortality as yet what was left in her system counteracted the sedative so she got up marched herself down to your drug hold and helped herself something of the kind eve could all but hear ambroses teeth grinding what about security the nursing staff did she turn herself invisible and walk right by them you can check with your own officer on duty about security lieutenant dallas be sure i will dr ambrose ambrose gnashed her teeth again then sighed listen i dont want to hang the mess on your uniform lieutenant we had a disruption here a few hours ago one of our violent tendencies attacked his ward nurse got out of his restraints we had our hands full for a few minutes and the uniform pitched in if she hadnt the ward nurse would very likely be standing at the pearly gates with ms fitzgerald right now instead of dealing with a broken tibia and some cracked ribs youve had a busy night doctor not one i want to repeat any time soon she dragged her fingers through curly rustcolored hair listen lieutenant this center has an excellent reputation we help people losing one this way makes me feel every bit as shitty as you she should have been asleep damn it and that uniform wasnt away from her post for more than fifteen minutes timing again eve looked back at jerry and tried to shrug off the weight of guilt what about your security cameras we dont have any lieutenant can you imagine how many media leaks wed have if we had recordings of patients some of whom are prominent citizens were bound by privacy laws here great no security discs nobody sees her take her last walk wheres the drug hold where she odd this wing one level down how the hell did she know that that lieutenant i cant tell you any more than i can explain how she unkeyed the lock not only on the door but on the holds themselves but she did the night watch found her on his sweep the door was open unlocked or open open ambrose confirmed as were two holds she was on the floor dead as caesar we tried the usual resuscitations of course but it was more for form than from hope ill need to talk to everyone in this wing patients as well as staff lieutenant fuck privacy laws doctor im overriding them i want your night watch as well pity jangled eves nerves as she recovered the body did anyone come in try to see her did anyone call to check her condition her ward nurse will have that information then lets start with her ward nurse you round up the rest of them is there a room i can use for interview you can use my office such as it is ambrose looked back at the body hissed between her teeth beautiful woman young with fame and fortune at her fingertips drugs heal lieutenant they extend life and the quality of it they eradicate pain soothe a troubled mind i work hard to remember that when i see what else they can do if you ask me and youre not she was headed here the first time she sipped that pretty blue juice yeah but she got here a lot faster than she was supposed to eve strode out of the room spotted peabody in the corridor casto i contacted him hes on his way its a goddamn mess peabody lets do what we can to mop it up see that this room hey you she saw the officer shed left on guard at the end of the hallway her finger pointed like an arrow she could see that it hit its mark by the way the uniform winced before she blanked her face and started toward her commanding officer eve blew off some steam giving the uniform a dressing down she didnt have to know eve would recommend no disciplinary action be taken let her sweat in the end when she was sweating and pale eve studied the nasty bruising scrape on the officers collarbone the vt give you that sir before i restrained him have it seen to for christs sake youre in a health center and i want this door secured you got that this time nobody in nobody out yes sir she snapped to attention looking eve thought pathetically like a whipped puppy barely old enough to buy a beer at a street stall eve mused with a shake of her head stand your watch officer until i order your relief she spun away gesturing for peabody to follow you ever get that pissed off at me peabody said in her mild voice id prefer a bareknuckled punch in the face to a tongue lashing so noted casto glad you decided to join us his shirt was rumpled as if hed tossed on the first thing that had come to hand eve knew the routine her own shirt looked as if it had been balled in someones pocket for a week what the hell happened here thats what were going to find out were setting up in dr ambroses office well question the relevant staff one at a time for the patients were likely going to be required to do a room to room everything on record peabody starting now in silence peabody took out her recorder clipped it to her lapel on record sir eve nodded to ambrose then followed her through reinforced glass doors down a short hallway and into a small cluttered office dallas lieutenant eve questioning of possible witnesses in the death of fitzgerald jerry she checked her watch for time and date and recorded them also present are casto lieutenant jake t illegals division and peabody officer delia temporary attache to dallas questioning to take place in the office of dr ambrose midtown rehabilitation center for substance addictions dr ambrose please send in the ward nurse and stand by doctor how the hell did she die casto demanded her system just give out what in a manner of speaking ill fill you in as we go he started to speak then controlled himself can we get some coffee in here eve i havent had my fix try that she jerked her thumb at a battered autochef then took her place behind the desk o o it didnt get much better by midday eve had personally questioned every staff member on duty in the wing with nearly the same results each time the vt in room had gotten out of his restraints attacked his ward nurse and all hell had broken loose from what she could gather people had poured down the hallway like a river leaving jerrys room unattended for anywhere from twelve to eighteen minutes more than enough time eve supposed for a desperate woman to flee but how did she know where to find the drug she craved and how did she gain access to it maybe some of the staff were talking about it in her room casto shoveled in veggie pasta on their midday break in the centers eatery a new blend always creates a big buzz its not much of a stretch to figure that the ward nurse or a couple of orderlies were gossiping about it fitzgerald obviously wasnt as sedated as anyone thought she hears them and when she sees her chance goes for it eve chewed over the theory and a forkful of grilled chicken hash i can buy that she had to hear it somewhere and she was desperate and smart i can buy that shed figure a way to get down to it undetected but how the hell did she get past the locks whered she get the code he fumbled there and scowled down at his meal a man wanted meat damn it good red meat and these pussy health centers treated it like poison could she have gotten a master code somewhere peabody speculated she was sticking to green leaf salad undressed with the idea of shaving off a couple of pounds or a code breaker then where is it eve shot back she was stone dead when they found her the sweepers didnt find any master code in the room maybe the frigging door was open when she got there disgusted casto shoved his plate aside thats the kind of luck weve been having thats a little too serendipitous for me okay she hears a discussion about immortality how its being kept in the drug hold for research shes in acute withdrawal with whatever theyve plugged into her smoothing out the worst of the raw edges but she needs it then like a gift from god theres a commotion outside i dont like gifts from god eve muttered but well run with it for now she gets up the guards gone and shes out of there she gets down to the drug hold though i cant see a couple of orderlies discussing directions to it still she got there weve established that but getting in what are you thinking eve she lifted her gaze to castos that she had help that somebody wanted her to get to it you think one of the staff led her down there so she could help herself its a possibility eve shrugged off the doubt in castos voice a bribe a promise a fan and when we go through everyones records we might hit on something that indicates a weak link in the meantime she broke off as her communicator sounded dallas lobar sweeper we found something interesting in the disposal hold down here lieutenant its a master code and its got fitzgeralds prints all over it bag it lobar ill be down shortly that explains a lot casto began the transmission perked up his appetite enough for him to dig into the pasta again somebody helped her like you said or she copped it from one of the nurses stations during the confusion clever girl eve murmured very clever girl times it all like clockwork goes down unkeys what she wants then takes the additional time to ditch the master she sure was thinking clearly wasnt she peabody drummed her fingers on the table if she took a hit of the immortality first and it seems likely she would it probably jolted her back on full she probably realized she could be caught there with the master if she ditched it she could claim shed wandered off that she was confused yeah casto flashed her a smile that works for me then why stay eve demanded shed had her fix why didnt she make a run for it eve castos voice was quiet sober as were his eyes theres a possibility we havent touched on here maybe she wanted to die a deliberate od she had thought of it didnt like what it did to her stomach muscles guilt descended like a clammy mist why understanding her reaction he laid a hand briefly over hers she was trapped you had her she had to know she was going to spend the rest of her life in a cage in a cage he added with no access to the drug shed have gotten old lost her looks lost everything that mattered most to her it was a way out a way to die young and beautiful suicide peabody picked up the threads and wove them the combination she took was lethal if she was clearheaded enough to get into the hold she would have been clearheaded enough to know that why face the scandal imprisonment another withdrawal if you could go out quick and clean ive seen it happen casto added in my line its not unusual people cant live with the drug cant live without it so they take themselves out with it no note eve said stubbornly no message she was despondent eve and like you said desperate casto toyed with his coffee if it was an impulse something she felt she had to do and do quick she might not have wanted to think long enough to leave a message eve nobody forced her theres no sign of violence or struggle on the body it was selfinduced it may have been an accident it may have been deliberate youre not likely to fully determine which it doesnt close the homicides no way she acted alone casto exchanged a look with peabody maybe not but the fact is that the influence of the drug may explain that she did just that you can hammer away at redford and young for a while christ knows neither one of them should get off clean in this but youre going to have to close this thing sooner or later its done he set his cup down give yourself a break well this is cozy justin young stepped up to the table his eyes hollow and redrimmed fastened on eve nothing spoils your appetite does it you bitch as casto started to rise eve lifted a finger signaling him down she shoved pity aside your lawyers manage to spring you justin thats right all it took was jerry dying to push them into granting bail my lawyer tells me that with these latest developments thats just how the fucker phrased it with these latest developments the case is all but closed jerrys a multiple murderer a drug addict a dead woman and im all but in the clear handy isnt it is it eve said evenly you killed her he leaned forward on the table the slap of his hands rattling cutlery you might as well have rammed a knife in her throat she needed help understanding a little compassion but you kept hacking away at her until she fell to pieces now shes dead do you understand that tears began to swim in his eyes shes dead and you get a nice big star next to your name bagged yourself a mad killer but ive got news for you lieutenant jerry never killed anyone but you did this isnt over he swept an arm across the table sending dishes to the floor in a mess of broken crockery and spilled food no way in hell is this over she let out a long breath as he walked away no i guess its not chapter twenty shed never known a week to move so fast and she felt brutally alone everyone considered the case closed including the pas office and her own commander jerry fitzgeralds body was reduced to ashes her final interview logged the media went into its usual frenzy top level models secret life the killer beneath the perfect face quest for immortality leaves a trail of death she had other cases certainly had other obligations but she spent every free minute reviewing the case picking through evidence and trying out new theories until even peabody told her to give it up she tried to juggle the few little details on the wedding roarke had asked her to see to but what the hell did she know about caterers wine selections and seating charts in the end she swallowed her pride and dumped the whole mess on a sneering summerset and was told in didactic tones that a wife of a man in roarkes position would have to learn basic social skills she told him to shove it and they both went off well satisfied to do what they did best under it all eve was almost afraid they were beginning to like each other o o roarke wandered from his office into eves and shook his head they would be married the next day in less than twenty hours was the bridetobe fussing with her wedding gown bathing herself in fragrant oils and perfumes daydreaming about her life to come no she was hunched over her computer muttering at it her hair tousled from constant raking with her fingers there was a stain on her shirt where shed spilled coffee a plate holding what might have once been a sandwich had been set on the floor even the cat avoided it he walked up behind her saw as he had expected to see the fitzgerald file on screen her tenacity fascinated him and yes allured him he wondered if she had allowed anyone else to see that she suffered over fitzgeralds death if shed been able she would have hidden it even from him he knew the guilt was there and the pity and the duty all would push her chain a part of her to the case it was one of the reasons he loved her that huge capacity for emotion strapped into a logical restless mind he started to bend down to kiss the crown of her head just as she lifted it they both swore when her head connected hard with his jaw christ jesus torn between amusement and pain roarke dabbed at the blood on his lip you make romance a dangerous business you shouldnt sneak up behind me that way frowning she rubbed the top of her head it was just one more spot to throb i thought you and feeney and a few of your hedonistic friends were going out to rape and pillage a bachelors party is not a viking invasion i have some time yet before the barbarism begins he sat down on the corner of her desk and studied her eve you need a break from this im going to be taking a threeweek one arent i she hissed as he only lifted his brows patiently sorry im being bitchy i cant get past this roarke ive put it aside a half dozen times this past week but i keep coming back say it aloud sometimes its helpful okay she shoved back from the desk narrowly missed stepping on the cat she could have gone to the club some of the fancy people slum at that kind of place pandora did exactly and they did run with the same basic crowd so yeah she could have gone to the club she could have seen boomer there she might even have had a contact tell her he was in this is all supposing that she knew him which is not firmly established and was working with him or through him she sees him there realizing hes mouthing off hes a loose end someone whos outlived his usefulness and is now a liability so far thats logical she nodded but didnt stop pacing okay he spots her after he comes out of the privacy room with hetta moppett jerry has to worry now what hes said he could have bragged even puffed up his own connection to impress the woman boomers smart enough to know hes in trouble takes off goes underground hettas the first victim shes got to go because she might know something shes taken out quick brutally so it looks like a random rage hit her ids taken that means itll take longer to trace her connect her with the club and boomer if anyone cared to connect her which was unlikely except they didnt count on you theres that boomers got a sample hes got the formula he had quick hands when he wanted them and a skill for larceny judgment wasnt his strong suit maybe he pressed for more money a larger cut of the whole but he was good at his job nobody knew he was a weasel but a handful of people connected to nypsd and those who did wouldnt have known how seriously and personally you take a partnership he cocked his head under most circumstances id say his death would have been chalked off to a soured drug deal a revenge hit by one of his associates and left at that true enough but jerry didnt move quick enough we found the stuff at boomers started to work on that angle at the same time i get a firsthand look at pandora at work you know the story there and youve heard the rundown on the circumstances on the night of her death pinning mavis with the crime was a stroke of luck good and bad it gave jerry time presented her with a convenient scapegoat a scapegoat who just happened to be near and dear to the primarys heart thats the bad luck how many times am i going to walk into a case and know the most likely suspect is absolutely innocent despite all the evidence despite everything its just not going to happen i dont know it did with me a few months ago i didnt know i felt after awhile i knew she jammed her hands in her pockets ripped them out again with mavis i knew from the get go i knew so i approached the entire case from a different angle now i see three potential suspects all as it turns out with motive with opportunity and with means one of those suspects i begin to believe is addicted to the very drug that started the ball rolling just when you think its safe to start assuming a dealer on the east end is taken out same mo why thats a sticking point roarke one i cant clean up they didnt need cockroach the odds of boomer trusting him with any data on this are so long they reach through the stratosphere but hes taken out and there are traces of the drug in his system a ploy roarke took out a cigarette and lighted it a distraction for the first time in hours she grinned thats what i like about you your criminal mind toss in a red herring to confuse the issue leave the cops straining to find a logical connection with cockroach in the meantime redfords manufacturing a variety of immortality on his own hes given it to jerry along with a hefty fee but he got that back by bleeding her for every bottle of it from then on a smart businessman hes gone to the trouble taken the risk of procuring a specimen from the eden colony two roarke said and had the pleasure of seeing that intense face go blank two what he ordered two i swung by eden on my way back on planet had a talk with engraves daughter i asked if she could find the time to do some crosschecking redford ordered his first specimen nine months ago using another name and a forged license but the id numbers are the same he had it shipped to a florist on vegas ii one with a dubious reputation for dealing in contraband flora he paused to tap his ash into a marble bowl id say it was sent from there to a lab where the nectar was distilled why the hell didnt you tell me before im telling you now it was just confirmed five minutes ago you can probably contact security on vegas ii and have the florist questioned she was swearing as she pounded to her link gave orders for just that even if they crack him itll take weeks to cut through the bureaucracy and have him transported on planet so i can have a go at him but she rubbed her hands together anticipating it you might have mentioned you were doing this if it came to nothing you wouldnt be disappointed instead you have to be grateful his eyes sobered eve this doesnt change the situation overmuch it means redford was working on his own longer than he wanted us to know about it means she broke off and dropped into a chair i know she could have done it roarke on her own she could slip out of youngs apartment without detection she could have left him sleeping come back cleaned up every fucking time or he could have known hed go to the wall for her and hes an actor hed toss redford to the wolves in a heartbeat but not if it implicated jerry she lowered her head to her hands a moment fingers rubbing hard over her brow i know she could have done it i know she could have seen a window of opportunity and gotten into the drug hold she might have decided to end it her way it suits her personality but it just doesnt feel right you cant blame yourself for her death roarke said quietly for the obvious reason that you arent to blame and also a reason youll accept guilt clouds logic yeah i know she rose again restless ive been off my stride with this one mavis remembering about my father ive missed details overlapped where it wasnt necessary all these distractions including the wedding he suggested she managed a weak smile ive tried not to think too much about that nothing personal consider it a formality a contract if you like with a few trimmings have you considered that a year ago we didnt even know each other that were living in the same house but for a good deal of the time were on two different steps that all this stuff we feel for each other might not really be the sort of thing that holds up in the long stretch he looked at her steadily are you going to piss me off the night before were married im not trying to piss you off roarke you brought it up and since it has been one of the distractions id like to clear it up these are reasonable questions and deserve reasonable answers his eyes went dark she recognized the warning and braced herself for the storm instead he rose spoke with such icy calm she nearly shuddered are you backing out lieutenant no i said id do it i just think we should think she said lamely and hated herself well you think then find your reasonable answers i have mine he glanced at his watch and im running late mavis is waiting downstairs for you for what ask her he said with the slightest edge to his voice as he walked out damn it she kicked the desk with enough force to have galahad eyeing her maliciously she kicked it again because pain had some rewards then limped out to go find mavis an hour later she found herself being dragged into the down and dirty club shed suffered through maviss orders to change her clothes to do something about her hair her face even her attitude but when the music and noise hit her like a roundhouse punch she balked jesus mavis why here because its nasty thats why bachelor parties are supposed to be nasty christ look at that guy onstage his cocks big enough to drill spikes good thing i asked crack to save us an a table the place is sardine city and its barely midnight i have to get married tomorrow eve began finding it a handy excuse for the first time thats the point jesus dallas loosen up hey theres our party eve was used to shocks but this was a doozy it was a bit more than credulity could bear to see a table directly under a cock swinger crowded by nadine furst peabody a woman who she thought was probably trina and dear god almighty dr mira before she could close her mouth crack swooped up behind her and hoisted her off her feet hey there skinny white girl gonna party tonight got you a bottle of champagne on the house youve got any champagne in this joint pal ill chew the cork hell it sparkles what you want he gave her a quick spin to the vocal appreciation of the crowd caught her midair and thumped her down in a seat at the table ladies yall enjoy yourselves now or im gonna hear about it you have such interesting friends dallas nadine puffed on a cigarette no one was going to worry about tobacco restrictions in there have a drink she lifted a bottle of unknown substance poured some into what looked like a fairly clean glass were way ahead of you i had to get her to change mavis hipped her way into a seat she bitched all the way then maviss eyes filled she only did it for me she took eves drink swilled it down we wanted to surprise you you did dr mira it is dr mira isnt it mira smiled brilliantly it was when i walked in im afraid im a little fuzzy on details at this point we gotta have a toast rocky on her pins peabody used the table for balance she managed to raise her glass without spilling more than half its contents on eves head to the best fucking cop in the whole stinking city whos gonna marry the sexiest sumbitch i personally have ever laid eyes on and who because shes so goddamn smart has seen to it that im permanly attached to homicide which is where any halfblind asshole could tell you i belong so there she downed the rest of her drink fell backward into her chair and grinned foolishly peabody eve said and flicked a finger under her eyes ive never been more touched im shit faced dallas the evidence points to it can we get any food in here that doesnt promise ptomaine im starved the bride to be wants to eat still sober as a nun mavis bolted to her feet ill take care of it dont get up oh and mavis eve jerked her down murmured in her ear get me something nonlethal to drink but dallas its a party and im going to enjoy it i really am but i want to be clearheaded tomorrow its important to me thats so sweet weeping again mavis lowered her face to eves shoulder yeah im a regular sugar substitute on impulse she jerked mavis around and kissed her square on the mouth thanks nobody else would have thought of this roarke did mavis mopped at her eyes with the glittering fringe swinging from her sleeve we worked it out together he would wouldnt he smiling a little eve took another dubious look at the naked bodies gyrating on stage hey nadine she topped off the reporters glass the guy up there with the red tail feathers has his eye on you oh yeah nadine looked blearily around dare you dare me what to get up there shit thats nothing then do it eve leaned over grinned in her face lets see some action you think i wont rising nadine teetered righted herself hey hot stuff she shouted to the closest dancer give me a hand up the crowd loved her eve decided especially when nadine got into the spirit and stripped down to purple underwear eve sighed into her mineral water she sure knew how to pick her friends hows it going trina im having an out of body experience i think im in tibet uhhuh eve cast a look at dr mira the way the woman was cheering eve was afraid shed leap up onstage herself she didnt think either one of them wanted that vision in their memory logs peabody she had to jab her fingers into peabodys arm to get even a vague reaction lets get some more food here peabody grunted i could do that following her gaze eve watched nadine in a crotch grind with a sevenfoot black in body paint sure you could pal youd bring the house down its just that ive got this little pouch she staggered and eve caught her neatly by the arm jake called it my jelly belly im saving up to have it sucked just do some more abs dont go for the vacuum its heditary hereditary right she swayed and hobbled as eve steered her through the crowd everybody in my familys got one jake likes em skinny like you screw him then did peabody giggled then leaned heavily on a serving bar screwed our brains out thats not what does it though you know that evie eve sighed peabody i dont want to punch a fellow officer when shes impaired so dont call me evie right know what does it food she ordered from the server droid any kind and lots of it table three what does what peabody what does it it what you and roarke got thats what does it connection inside connections sex is just the extra sure you and casto having problems nope just dont have much connection now that the case is closed peabody shook her head and lights exploded in front of her eyes jesus im plowed gotta use the john ill go with you i can do it myself with some dignity peabody nudged eves hand from her arm i dont care to vomit in front of a superior officer if its all the same to you suit yourself but eve watched her like a hawk as she toddled across the floor theyd been at it nearly three hours she judged and though fun was fun she was going to get some food into her little playmates and see that they all got transport home smiling she leaned on the bar herself watching nadine still wearing purple briefs sitting at the table having an earnest discussion with dr mira trina had her head on the table now and was probably communing with the dhali lama mavis eyes shining was onstage screeching out an impromptu number that had the dance floor rocking damn it she thought as she felt her throat burn she loved the whole snockered lot of them peabody included she decided and opted to take a short peek into the toilet to make sure her aide hadnt passed out or drowned she made it nearly halfway across the club before she was grabbed as it had been happening on and off all evening as hopeful clubgoers trolled for partners she started to shake off goodnaturedly try again ace not interested hey the quick pinch on her arm annoyed more than hurt but her vision was already wavering as she was muscled through the hooting crowd and shoved into a privacy room goddamn it i said i wasnt interested she started to reach for her badge missed her pocket completely at a gentle nudge she spilled backward onto a narrow bed take a rest eve we have to talk casto dropped down next to her and crossed his feet at the ankles o o roarke wasnt in a partygoing mood but as feeney had gone to some trouble to create a monstrously hedonistic atmosphere he played his part it was a hall of sorts crowded with men many of whom were surprised to find themselves participating in such a pagan ritual still feeney with his electronic expertise had ferreted out some of roarkes closer business associates and none had wanted to risk offending someone of roarkes stature with a refusal so there they were the rich the famous and the scrambling pressed into a badly lit room with lifesize screens flickering with naked bodies in various imaginative acts of sexual frenzy a trio of live strippers already entertainingly naked and enough beer and whiskey to sink the seventh fleet and all its crew roarke had to admit it had been a nice gesture and was doing his best to live up to feeneys expectations as a man on his final night of freedom there you are boyo another whiskey for you after several of the irish himself feeney had slipped comfortably into the brogue of the country hed never seen that indeed his greatgreatgrandparents had never set foot on up the rebels eh roarke cocked a brow he himself had been born in dublin and had spent most of his youth wandering its streets and alleys yet he couldnt claim the sentimental attachment feeney did for a land and its rebellions slainte he said to please his friend and sipped theres a lad now you see here roarke the ladies among us are for looking purposes only no touching for you now ill do my best to restrain myself feeney grinned and slapped roarke on the back hard enough to stagger him shes a prize isnt she our dallas shes roarke scowled into his whiskey something he decided keep you on your toes she will keeps them all on their toes got a mind like a fucking shark you know focused on one thing till the things done tell you straight this last case had her bugshit she hasnt let it go roarke murmured and smiled coolly when a naked blonde sidled up to rub her hands up his chest youll have better luck with that one he told her gesturing to a glazeeyed man in charcoal gray pinstripes he owns stoner dynamics when she looked blank roarke gently disengaged the hands that were gliding cheerfully toward his crotch hes loaded she shimmied off leaving feeney gazing wistfully after her im a happily married man roarke so ive been told its lowering to admit im not but a little tempted to give a pretty young thing like that a quick ride in a dark room youre a better man for it feeney thats the truth he sighed low and long then veered back to the former topic dallas goes off for a few weeks shell put this aside get on with the next she doesnt like losing and she thinks she has he tried to dismiss it damn if he wanted to spend the night before his wedding picking apart a homicide with a muttered curse he steered feeney to a quiet corner what do you know about that dealer who got hit in the east end cockroach not much to know dealer fairly slick fairly stupid its amazing how many of them are both stuck to his own turf liked a quick easy profit was he a weasel too like boomer usta weasel his trainer retired last year what happens when a trainer retires another one takes on the weasel or hes let go didnt find any new trainer for cockroach roarke started to shrug it off but it kept niggling the cop who retired did he work with anybody what dyou think i got memory chips in my head yes flattered feeney preened well as a matter of fact i recall he was partnered with an old pal of mine danny riley that was back in oh fortyone seems like he cruised with mari dirscolli for a few years to about fortyeight might be fortynine never mind roarke muttered then he teamed with casto a couple years roarkes attention snapped back casto was he partnered with casto while he was cockroachs trainer sure but only one leg of a team works as trainer course feeney murmured as his brow furrowed usual procedure is to take over your partners contacts no record casto did he had his own weasels roarke told himself it was his own prejudice his own ridiculous kneejerk jealousy he didnt give a damn not everythings locked into record you dont find it coincidental that two weasels who worked close to casto got hit both of them with connections to immortality we arent saying casto had cockroach and its not that coincidental youre dealing with illegals here you got overlaps what other connection have you found that links cockroach to the other murders other than casto jesus roarke he ran a hand over his face youre as bad as dallas look a lot of illegals cops end up with abuse problems castes clean to the bone never had a trace in any of his testing hes got a good rep hes coming up for captaincy and its no secret he wants it hes not going to go messing around with this kind of shit sometimes a man is just a little bit tempted feeney and sometimes he gives in you want to tell me it would be the first time an illegals cop made a few credits on the side no feeney sighed again he was sobering up with this kind of talk and he didnt like it theres nothing to pin on him roarke dallas was working with him if he was a wrong cop shed have smelled it shes like that shes been distracted off stride roarke murmured remembering her own words think it through feeney no matter how fast she moved on this she always seemed to be one step off if someone had known her moves they might have anticipated her especially someone who thinks like a cop you dont like him because hes almost as pretty as you feeney said sourly roarke let that pass how much can you dig up on him tonight tonight jesus you want me to dig shit up on another cop go into personal records because he had a couple of weasels knocked and you want me to do it tonight roarke put a hand on feeneys shoulder we can use my unit youll make a good pair feeney muttered as roarke steered him through the crowd both a couple of sharks o o eves vision wavered as if shed suddenly stepped over her head into a tankful of water through the ripple she saw casto could smell the faint scent of soap and sweat on his skin but she couldnt home in on what he was doing there whats going on casto we get a call blankly she looked around for peabody saw the shimmering red drapes that were supposed to add sensuality to a room designed for quick cheap sex wait a minute just relax he didnt want to give her another dose not in addition to what shed been drinking at her hen party the doors locked eve so you cant go anywhere youve got a nice buzz on to make it easier all around he pushed a satinedged pillow behind his back it would have been easier still if youd just let go but you didnt you wont jesus christ i cant believe you put the hammer on lilligas who what the florist on vegas ii thats cutting it too damn close ive been using the bastard myself her stomach tilted nastily when she tasted bile at the back of her throat she leaned forward stuck her head between her knees and concentrated on breathing in and out downloads make some people nauseous well go with something else next time i missed you she tried to focus on keeping the heavy greasy food shed celebrated with instead of liquor from spewing back up i fucking missed you yeah he knew she wasnt speaking out of sentiment you werent looking for another cop hey why should you and you had your own worries broke the rules eve you know the primary is never ever supposed to get personally involved you were too worried about your friend i admire that really even if it is stupid he took her by the hair dragged her head back after a quick check of her pupils he decided the initial dose would hold her for a while he didnt want to risk overdosing her not until hed finished and i do admire you eve you sonofabitch her voice slurred over her thickened tongue you killed them each and every one relaxed he crossed his feet at the ankles its been hard to hold it all back ive got to admit rough on the ego not to be able to show a woman like you what a smart man can accomplish you know eve i was a little worried when i learned you were in charge of boomer he reached out ran a fingertip from her chin down between her breasts i thought i could charm you gotta admit you were attracted get your hand off me she slapped out at it missed by several inches your depth perceptions off he chuckled drugs mess you up eve take it from me i see it every shitty day on the streets got sick of seeing it thats how it started all those fancy dudes making their fancy profits and never getting their manicures sticky why not me for money what else is there i fell into the immortality connection a couple years back it was like kismet early days then took my time did my homework used a source on the eden colony to slip me a sample poor old boomer ferreted it out my connection from the eden colony boomer told you sure he did he had something in the illegals market he came to me didnt know i was already in on it not then i kept it under wraps i didnt know boomer had a copy of the fucking formula didnt know he was holding out hoping for a nice big chunk you killed him you broke him to pieces not until it was necessary i never do anything until its necessary it was pandora you see that beautiful bitch eve listened righting to bring her brain and motor skills back into mesh while casto spun her a tale of sex power and profit pandora had spotted him at the club or theyd spotted each other shed liked the idea that he was a cop and the kind of cop he was hed be able to get his hands on lots of goodies wouldnt he and for her hed been happy to do so hed been enchanted with her obsessed and yes addicted no harm in admitting that now his mistake had been to share his information about immortality with her to listen to her ideas for cashing in huge profits shed predicted more money than they could spend in three lifetimes and youth beauty great sex shed become addicted to the drug quickly always hungered for more and she had used him to get it but she had been useful too her career her fame had made it easy for her to travel to carry more of what was then being manufactured exclusively on starlight station in a little private lab then hed discovered shed brought redford in on the deal hed been furious with her but shed been able to string him along with sex and promises and the money of course but things had started to go wrong boomer had pushed for money had pocketed a bag of the drug in powder form i should have been able to handle him little wart trailed him here he was flying running his mouth tossing the credits id given him to keep him quiet around like candy i couldnt know what hed said to that damn whore casto shrugged you figured that out yourself right scenario eve wrong person i had to take her out i was in too deep for mistakes by then she was just a whore eve leaned her head back against the wall her head had nearly stopped spinning now she thanked god the dose had been light casto was on a roll she could keep him talking if she couldnt get the hell out on her own someone was going to come looking for her soon then you went after boomer i couldnt go to his flop and drag him out my face is too well known around there i gave him a little time then i contacted him told him wed be able to deal we needed him in on our side he was stupid enough to buy it then i had him you messed him up first you didnt kill him quick i had to find out how much hed let out who he might have talked to he didnt deal well with pain our boomer spilled his guts i found out about the formula really pissed me off i wasnt going to mess up his face like the hookers but i lost it plain and simple got emotionally involved you could say youre a cold bastard eve muttered making her voice weak and blurry now thats just not true eve you ask peabody he grinned gave her breast a quick tweak that sent fury and rage cycling to her gut i went for deedee when i realized you werent going to take a nibble too wrapped up in that rich irish bastard to take a look at a real man and deedee bless her was ripe for plucking never could get much out of her on what you were up to though deedees got good cop all over her slip a little help into her wine though she gets more cooperative you drugged peabody now and then just to pump her for any details you might have left out of your official report and to keep her sleeping pretty when i had to go out at night she was an airtight alibi anyway you know about pandora that went pretty much as you had figured too only i was staking out her place that night scooped her up the minute she came storming out she wanted to go to that designers wed pretty much finished up our sexual relationship by then just business now i figured why not take her i knew she was working to cut me out of the whole deal she wanted it all she didnt think she needed some street cop hanging on even if he was the one to give her the damn stuff to begin with she knew about boomer too but that didnt bother her what did she care about some dirty alley croucher and she never thought never considered that id hurt her but you did i took her where she wanted to go im not really sure if i was going to do it then but when i saw the security camera smashed it seemed like a sign then the place was empty just her and me theyd hang it on the dressmaker right or on the little lady shed had a fight with so i hit her the first strike took her down but she was up again that shit made her strong and mean i had to keep hitting her and hitting her fucking blood flying then she was down for good your little friend came in and you know the rest yeah i know the rest you went back and took the box with the tabs why did you take her palm link she always used it to call me she mightve recorded the numbers cockroach just something extra in the mix to confuse things cockroach was always willing to sample a new product you were hammering away and i wanted a hit where i was well alibied just in case so i had deedee you got to jerry too didnt you easy as a walk on the beach get one of the vts stirred up with a quick buzz wait for the chaos i had a reviver for jerry brought her around and had her out of there before she knew what was happening i promised her a fix and she cried like a baby morphine first so she wouldnt get any idea about not cooperating then immortality then a dash of zeus she died happy eve thanking me youre a humanitarian casto no eve im a selfish man looking out for number one and im not ashamed of it ive got twelve years on the streets wading through blood vomit and come ive paid my dues this drugs going to give me everything ive ever wanted ill take my captaincy and with that kind of connection ill feed profits from the drug into a nice numbered account for four or five years then ill retire to a tropical island and sip mai tais he was winding down now she could tell it from the tone of his voice the excitement the arrogance had cooled to practicality youll have to kill me first i know that eve its a damn shame i all but handed you fitzgerald but you just wouldnt let it be with what might have been affection he brushed a hand over her hair im going to make it easy on you ive got something here thatll take you down gently you wont feel anything thats damn considerate of you casto i owe you that much honey cop to cop if youd let it lay after your friend got off but you wouldnt i wish things had been different eve i had a real taste for you he leaned close so close she felt his breath waft over her lips as though he were indeed about to taste her slowly she lifted her lashes looking through them into his face casto she said softly yeah just relax now wont take long he reached for his pocket fuck you she brought her knee up hard her depth perception was still slightly skewed rather than connecting with his groin she knocked solidly into his chin he went backward off the bed and the pressure injector in his hand skittered over the floor they both dived for it o o where the hell is she she wouldnt have walked out on her own party mavis tapped her spiked heels impatiently as she continued to scan the club and shes the only one of us still sober ladies room nadine suggested halfheartedly tugging her blouse over her lacy bra peabodys checked twice dr mira she wouldnt have made a run for it would she i know shes nervous but shes not the running kind though her head was still revolving mira struggled to keep her speech coherent well look around again shes here somewhere its just so crowded still looking for the bride grinning widely crack lumbered up looks like she just wanted a last ride the dude over there saw her slip into one of the privacy rooms with a cowboy type dallas mavis snorted at the thought of it no way so shes celebrating crack lifted his shoulders got plenty more rooms ladies if you got an itch which room peabody demanded sober now that shed thrown up everything in her stomach including she was sure a good portion of the lining number five hey you want a gang bang i can round up some nice young boys for you all sizes all shapes all colors he shook his head as they marched off and decided that hed better go along to keep the peace o o eves fingers slipped off the injector and the elbow to her cheekbone sent pain grinding down her face and into her teeth still she had first blood and the shock of finding her ready to fight had shaken him you should have given me a bigger dose she followed up the statement with a shortarmed punch to his windpipe i wasnt drinking tonight asshole she managed to roll him over im getting married tomorrow she punctuated this by bloodying his nose that was for peabody you bastard he caught her in the ribs and winded her she felt the injector pass over her arm and heaved up by the hips to kick she would never know if it was blind luck her lack of depth perception or his own miscalculation but he dodged to avoid the gut thrust and her feet coming up like pistons caught him square in the face his eyes rolled back in his head his head hit the floor with an ominous and satisfying thud still hed managed to get more of the drug into her she crawled drifting in the sensation of swimming through thick golden syrup she made it to the door but the lock and its key code appeared to be twelve feet above her grasping hand then the door burst open and all hell broke loose she felt herself lifted patted down someone was ordering in nononsense tones that she be given air giggles bubbled up in her she was flying now was all she could think bastard killed them she kept saying bastard killed them all i missed it wheres roarke her eyelids were pulled back and she would have sworn her eyeballs rolled like fiery little marbles she heard the words health center and began to fight like a tiger o o roarke descended the stairs a grim set to his mouth he knew feeney was still upstairs huffing and blowing but he was convinced a business deal of the size of immortalitys potential required an expert and an inside connection casto filled both those bills eve might not want to hear it either so he wouldnt mention it yet feeney would have three weeks to poke around while they were on their honeymoon if there was indeed going to be a honeymoon he heard the door open and angled his chin they were going to have this out once and for all he determined here and now he took two more steps then was down the rest of them in a dead run what the hell happened to her shes bleeding there was blood in his own eye as he snatched a limp eve from the arms of a sevenfoot black in a silver loincloth as everybody began talking at once mira clapped her hands like a schoolteacher in a room of rowdy students she needs a quiet room the mts treated her for the drug but shell have some residual effects and she wouldnt let them deal with the cuts and bruises roarkes face went stony what drug his gaze latched on mavis where the hell did you take her not her fault still glassyeyed eve wrapped her arms around roarkes neck casto it was casto roarke know that as a matter of fact stupid stupid to miss it sloppy can i go to bed now take her upstairs roarke mira said calmly i can tend to her believe me shell be fine ill be fine eve agreed as she floated up the stairs ill tell you everything i can always tell you cant i cause you love me you sap there was only one piece of information roarke wanted at the moment he laid eve on the bed took a good look at her bruised cheek and swollen mouth is he dead nope i just beat the hell out of him she smiled caught the look in his eye and shook her head slowly nuhuh no way dont even think about it were getting married in a couple hours he smoothed the hair back from her face are we i figured it out it was hard to concentrate but it was important she lifted her hands cupped his face to keep it in focus its not a formality and its not a contract what is it its a promise its not so hard to promise to do something you really want anyway and if im lousy at being a wife youll just have to live with it i dont break my promises and theres this one other thing he could see her slipping and shifted slightly so that mira could tend the cut on her cheek what other thing eve i love you sometimes it makes my stomach hurt but i kind of like it tired now come to bed love you he eased back to let mira get on with her tending its all right for her to sleep best thing for her shell be fine when she wakes up maybe a little hungover which seems unfair since she didnt drink anything she said she wanted a clear head for tomorrow did she she didnt look calm when she slept he noted she never did will she remember any of that what she was telling me she may not mira said cheerfully but you will and that should do the job he nodded and stepped back she was safe again one more time safe he glanced over at peabody officer can i count on you to fill me in on the details o o eve did have a hangover and wasnt pleased about it her stomach was tied in greasy knots and her jaw was sore between mira and trinas wizardry with cosmetics the bruises didnt show as brides went she supposed studying herself she was passable you look mag dallas mavis sighed and took a slow turn around leonardos finest hour the dress sleeked down as it was meant to the bronze tone adding warmth to eves skin the lines highlighting her long lean form its very simplicity made the statement that it was the woman within who counted the gardens packed with people mavis went on cheerily as eves stomach roiled did you look out the window ive seen people before there was media doing flybys earlier i dont know whose button roarke pushed but theyve stopped goodie youre all right arent you dr mira said you shouldnt have any dangerous aftereffects but im fine it was only partly a lie having it closed knowing all the facts the truth makes it easier she thought of jerry and suffered she looked at mavis the glowing face the silvertipped hair and smiled you and leonardo still planning to cohabitate at my place temporarily were looking for bigger digs one where hell have room to work and im going to start making the club rounds again she took a box from the bureau handed it over roarke sent this up for you yeah opening it eve felt twin tugs of pleasure and alarm the necklace was perfect of course two drapes of twisted copper studded with colored stones i happened to mention it i bet you did with a sigh eve draped it on then fastened the long matching drops to her ears and looked she thought like a stranger a pagan warrior theres one more thing oh mavis i cant stand one more thing hes got to understand that i she broke off as mavis turned from the long white box on the table took out a sweeping spray of white flowers petunias simple backyardvariety petunias he always knows she murmured all the muscles in her stomach loosened all the nerves died away he just knows i guess when somebody understands you that way that you know intimately it makes you pretty lucky yeah eve took the flowers cradled them the reflection in the mirror didnt look like a stranger it looked she thought like eve dallas on her wedding day roarkes going to swallow his tongue when he gets a load of me she laughed grabbed maviss arm and rushed out to make her promises
