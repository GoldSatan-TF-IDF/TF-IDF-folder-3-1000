killer mine chapter one the arisaig reaches cornwall the focsle was hot with the heat of the engines yet i shivered as i set down my glass and reached for the bottle the glare of the naked light hurt my eyes i filled my glass again the liquor spilled fire down my throat as i drank but it did not warm me i was cold through to my very spine boots rang on the steel deck above our heads a body stirred in its hammock snorted rolled over and then settled itself again the hammock swayed like a bundle of straw to the roll of the boat the sour odour of human bodies mingled with the fumes of the cognac and the blue fog of tobacco smoke made my eyes smart whats the time i asked my mouth was dry a dusty cavity in which my tongue moved like a rubber pad the words came harsh and unnatural as i put the question you speak me what is the time two minutes ago well im asking you again i said harshly damn all italians to hell why did i have to sit drinking with an italian must mulligan have italians in his crew but the british wouldnt drink with me blast em the egg was only drinking with me because he was drunk and would drink with anybody or was it because he enjoyed watching the fear that welled up from the chilled hollow of my bowels he was laughing at me i could see it in his dark eyes whats the time damn you i shouted at him he pulled a large silver watch out of his breast pocket and turned the ornate gilt face towards me a quarter past three if mulligan was right in his reckonings we should be in sight of the english coast we had passed the bishop light well to starboard at dusk the egg put the watch back in his pocket and picked up his glass he drank with a noisy sucking sound his thick lips shone wet in the swinging light they smiled and his eyes watched me what was he thinking what went on under that bald skull of his the lips were cruel the eyes brown like a dogs dark like a passionate girls were cold god damn it i cried what are you smiling at i felt anger surge up in my body drowning the chill of fear so that my body seemed to swell out until the cramped focsle was too small to hold it his sallow eyelids flickered and when i looked into his eyes again they were wide so that i could look through to the rotten core of him he did not speak he just gazed at me with those wideopen cruel eyes the anger left me and i felt cold again god damn all italians i heard myself mutter how long had i been drinking what did it matter what did anything matter i was clear of italy england lay ahead out there in the darkness beyond the steel bulkhead the man who had stirred in his hammock rolled over on to his back stretched his arms and then sat up rubbing the sleep out of his eyes wot drinking again emilio he said to the italian gawd dont yer never stop drinkin

bald skull cracked in a grin that showed the white gleam of his perfect teeth signer mulligan he is on deck yes he not come down here the stink it is too much for him and he laughed silently well its your funeral mate ruppy swung his legs out of the hammock and slid to the floor he buttoned his jersey into his trousers and pressed both hands into his belly as though thrusting his guts into place he suffered from hernia that was why he was called ruppy he was thin and scrawny with the face of a turtle and an adams apple that moved up and down in his scraggy neck as he swallowed a two days growth of sparse grey stubble grew out of the seamed dirt of chin and neck he brought out an enamel mug and filled it half full from the bottle well eres to the bleedin perisher wot pays through the nose fer short measure on them cases he wiped his mouth on the sleeve of his jersey and looked down at me swaying gently to the motion of the ship sppose youre trying to get up enough courage ter go

at his stomach i sat down again god how i hated myself i felt the tears burning in my eyes and put my head in my hands to hide my sense of loneliness a hand suddenly rested on my shoulder and ruppys voice with all the habitual harshness gone out of it said come on chum dont take no notice o me yerll feel better when yer seen yer famly i shook my head and wished hed go back to his sneering ive no family i said no famly blimey thats tough but yer got friends aint yer no i told him only the fellow in penzance you see i left england when i was four the only thing i can remember about england is when i was on the deck of a ship that took us to canada my father pointed the coastline out to me it was just a grey smudge on the horizon that and the day my mother went away those are about my earliest recollections we lived at a place called redruth in cornwall thats where i was born but if yer went to canada when you were four why the ell didnt yer join the canadian army i didnt stay in canada after my father died i went to australia to the gold mines i was twenty then a miner like my father after the war had been going on for some time i got a ship to england but france fell and italy came in and we were held up at port said so i joined wavells mob this is the first time ive been to england since i was four years old damn him why had he started me off like this why didnt he go on sneering at me i could stand that i began to swear it was a pointless waste of words but it forced the tears of selfpity away you oughterve gone back to canada chum he said there wouldnt ave bin no questions ast there i couldnt get a ship i said i reached out for the bottle and poured myself another drink yer dont want no more o that firewater he advised putting a restraining hand on my arm that was like the claw of a bird yer goin ashore soon and yerll need to be sober but i took no heed filling the glass and draining it at a gulp footsteps sounded on the companion ladder the door opened hey pryce the skipper wants you it was a dumpy little man they called shorty okay i said he went back up the companion ladder and his feet sounded again on the steel deck as he made his way aft towards the wheelhouse the unfastened door slatted back and forth to the movement of the ship i took another drink and then got to my feet the watch off duty swayed in their hammocks the steel walls peeling and greasy with dirt dipped and rose dipped and rose the naked bulb swung dizzily before my eyes the italian watched me his eyes were on my belt and they glittered like live coals i hitched up my trousers and my fumbling fingers bit into the flesh of my stomach as i felt for and found the outline of the money belt around my waist what are you staring at i snarled ata nothing signore he answered and his eyes reverted to that soft expressionless brown youre lying i said he shrugged his shoulders spreading his arms and drawing down the corners of his mouth a picture of abject docility and innocence i took a step towards him so thats why youre drinking with me is it you thought youd get me stinking you thought youd rob me eh he cringed away from me those brown eyes suddenly mirroring his fear better go up and see the skipper mate ruppy said catching me by the sleeve but i suddenly wanted to hit the italian just one blow to show what i thought of the whole bloody race of em and then i realised it would do no good it wouldnt change his nature it wouldnt make him any less avaricious any less cruel it wasnt his fault he was a neapolitan and it was the dirt and filth and poverty of naples that had made him what he was i shrugged my shoulders and went up into the clean wholesome air of the deck the night was still and dark with the sails flapping idly like bats wings spread against the velvet backcloth of the sky that was all studded with stars there was scarcely a breath of wind over the side our navigation lights showed a flat oily swell the tall masts of the little schooner swayed back and forth across the milky way and her gear creaked and groaned as the sails drew fitfully i went aft watching the faint white blur of our wake as the engines drove us steadily towards the land every now and then a beam of light swept across us from a lighthouse on our starboard quarter almost astern was another but below the horizon so that it was like a faint flicker of the northern lights and over the port bow yet another blinked with monotonous regularity hidden behind a mass of land that showed every now and then against the sudden brightening of the night the clean smell of tar and seawet cordage was strong after the sour fumes of the focsle i breathed in great gulps of this fresh salt air as i made my way towards the little wheelhouse but a hand seemed clutching at my brain so that i couldnt think clearly i stumbled over a coileddown length of rope and fetched up at the rail gazing at the smooth black surface of the water that i sensed rather than saw i felt the long flat swells rolling under our keel and gazed towards that dark line of coast that leapt into being every time the light flashed in our direction and then i looked again at the smooth comfortable swelling of the sea it looked so inviting so restful whilst out there where the coast showed black was danger and uncertainty i shook myself and felt for the belt around my waist my eyes were tired i was exhausted drained of the will to go on it was the same feeling that i had had that time up by cassino when the patrol i shivered and turned quickly towards the wheelhouse inside it was warm and bright shorty stood at the wheel his gaze alternating between the faintly glowing compass and the black night outside with the feebly slating sails mulligan was bending over a chart a pair of dividers in his hand he looked up as i entered he was a thin meagre little man with a craggy face sharp blue eyes and a harelip that gave him the look of a stoat he wasnt the sort of man youd expect to find in command of anything let alone a ship but a devil looked out of those bright blue eyes and he had a tongue on him that was worth two fullsized men when it came to driving others that tongue sharp and rasping as the rough edge of a steel file could get men moving faster than a pair of outsize fists men were afraid of that tongue and of those sharp little ferret eyes hed talk to a man quiet and soft as a kitten till hed discovered his weakness and then that tongue of his would get to work so that the man hated and feared him i held on to the edge of the chart table as the ship swayed and dipped mulligan watched me he didnt speak but just stood there gazing up at me a sarcastic little smile on his deformed mouth well what do you want me for i asked i couldnt stand him staring at me are we nearly there he nodded theres our position he pointed to the chart thats the longships light way to starbd noo well drop ye off at whitesands bay just north o sennen his voice with its queer scots accent droned on giving me directions and pointing out landmarks on shore for my guidance but i didnt listen how can anyone listen to a voice purring out of a half scots half french parentage when the cognac is mounting to his head and making the blood hammer through his veins the voice suddenly changed and the new rasp in it penetrated my mind what about yer fare the question was repeated in a sharp staccato bark i paid it to you when i came aboard at naples i reminded him what was he getting at my brain struggled to focus on what he was saying i paid you fifty pounds in english notes and it was twice what i ought to have paid thats as may be he answered and his eyes never left my face you paid me for a passage to england but ye didnt pay me for putting ye ashore at dead o night on a desairted stretch o the coast smuggling a man into england is agin the law its dangerous man and ahm no willing ter take the risk wioot ah get something oot of it see here mulligan i said angrily you agreed to take me to england for fifty pounds you knew what risk you ran when you took my fifty quid now you keep your side of the bargain he peered up at me with that crooked twisted smile of his if thats the way ye want it man all reecht well take ye on to cardiff where were bound and put ye ashore there but ahm warnin ye theyre awfu strict at the docks there and unless ye ken yer way aboot come off it mulligan i said and stretched out my hand to grip him by the collar and shake some sense into him but he backed away from me showing his discoloured teeth as he stretched his harelip to a grin his right hand was in his pocket i forced myself to relax no good quarrelling with the man on whom my safety depended whats your price i said ill give you an extra ten pounds he shook his head and laughed yell be landed at cardiff or yell pay my price he said and whats your price i asked him one hundred and thirty pounds he answered a hundred and thirty quid i gasped but thats i broke off he was laughing i could see it in his eyes that leaves ye wi exactly twenty pounds how did you know how much id got on me ye told me yersel the other nicht ye were drunk and boasting of what a man could do wi that much money despite all the restrictions and identity cards and ration books well it seems a shame that the police shouldna be given a chance then his voice was suddenly hard and flat a hundred and thirty quid thats my price for a boat to pull ye to the shore ye can take it or leave it the blood roared in my head i felt my muscles swell he had the chart table between us i kicked it over with my boot but as i went for him he backed away with a snarl and his right hand came out of his pocket with a gun it stopped me for a second and then suddenly i didnt care he could plug me if he liked i threw back my head and roared with laughter it was the drink that had got in me i knew that but i didnt care i just stood and laughed at him crouched so puny and twisted in the corner of his own wheelhouse with that ridiculous little gun in his hand i saw fear leap in his eyes and then i went for him if hed fired i dont think id have felt it so elated was i with the sense of the power of my body but he didnt fire he hesitated and in that second i had swept the pistol out of his hand and had seized him by the neck the fingers and thumbs of my two hands overlapped as i closed my grip lifting him from the ground and shaking him like a rat now what about my boat to the shore eh i cried and i heard myself let out another bellow of laughter i raised him so that his eyes were level with mine i looked into them they were so close it was like looking in through windows and i saw he was afraid i was glad of that and shook him so that his bones rattled i shifted the grip of my right hand to the belt of his trousers and raised him to throw him through the window of the wheelhouse and then something hit me a great explosion of pain burst at the foot of my skull for an instant i saw the wheelhouse clear through the splitting agony of my eyeballs my arms sagged beneath mulligans weight and his face came close to mine then my legs seemed to melt under me and everything was as black as hell as i crumpled up next thing i knew was there was water on my face it was cold and salt i was going under again there was a swimming blackness all about me i struggled thrusting upwards with my arms and legs again the sting of water on my face and the cold of the night air i breathed in a great gulp that hurt my lungs the darkness was shot with flame and then i was sinking again this time i didnt struggle i let the suffocating blackness steal over me it was such a restful way to go the water was cool and still as i sank but the urge to live rose in me and i began to struggle upward again my hands reached out clutched and broke their nails against something solid i grasped hold of it and fought my way back to consciousness it was wood a wooden board it lifted slightly and then clamped down pinching my fingers es comin rand skipper the voice was right above me it was shorty hes a skull on him like a rhinoceros mulligans voice replied ye hit him hard enough to split it open yet hes no bin oot moren fifteen minutes i opened my eyes it was dark but i could see the darker outline of a pair of knees hunched against the stars then i closed my eyes again the pain was unbearable it was as though a great lump of lead had got loose inside my skull and was being pitched around by the movement of the sea but it didnt hurt me to listen and my ears told me all i wanted to know waves were slopping at the gunnels of the boat and there was a steady creak of the rowlocks as the oars swung in and out i was being rowed to the shore the bow pitched violently and smacked into a small wave that slopped water over on to my face i struggled up to my elbow yed best lie still said mulligan in his phoney scots if ye dont ahll gi ye anither crack on the head wi the butt end o me pistol his face was so close to me as he bent down that i could smell the reek of cognac on his breath okay ill keep still i breathed my voice sounded faint and far away i relaxed against the gunnel the nerves of my whole body racked and wearied by the hammering pain in my head a slight wind had got up and over shortys rhythmically swinging shoulders the lights of the arisaig danced in the ruffled water the little schooner was hove to under mains and staysl she was about three hundred yards astern of us a graceful shadow in the faint light of the stars and the swinging beam of the longships i twisted my head round and caught the gleam of mulligans eyes watching me pain stabbed at my eye sockets as i turned my neck muscles i shifted the weight of my body to my right elbow so that i could look forard without turning my head mulligan made a threatening movement with the pistol which he held by the barrel then he relaxed as i lay still the shore was a black shadow reared up against the night sky with each sweep of the oars it came closer and blacker soon it towered above us blotting out half the sky with its rugged granite cliffs and through the still night came the steady thud and suck of waves breaking where are you landing me mulligan i asked just where i said i would he replied northern end at whitesands bay youll be aboot two miles from sennen or if ye climb straight up from the beach and strike inland yell reach the main road an thatll take ye into penzance i didnt say anything the black line of the coast was very near now i thought i could see the faint white of the waves breaking i strained my eyes into the darkness but it made them ache so that i had to close them so that was england and only a few miles from where i was born my father had talked so much about the cornish coast that i seemed almost to recognise it even in the dark but it was a queer way to be coming back to be landed alone from a boat at dead of night with no friend and a sudden fear seized me i forgot the pain in my head for a second as my fingers fumbled for the belt i could feel it there against my skin i searched for the pocket yes it was still solid and packed with notes or was it less packed had they fooled me fifteen minutes they said id been out time enough for them to take the money i glanced up at mulligan his eyes were fixed on me was it a trick of the dark or was there a sardonic gleam in them what about the boat fare mulligan i asked how much have you taken lie still he hissed and he held out the butt of his pistol ready the great granite cliffs were very near now they seemed reared up high high into the night a line of white seethed at their foot i slipped my hand under my jersey beneath my vest till i felt the leather of the belt lying against my skin i found the pocket it bulged but when i got my fingers inside it the crispness of the notes had changed to paper as though the pouch were stuffed with worthless italian lire i looked at mulligan how much did you take i asked him his face was so close to mine i could see the harelip stretch as he grinned what ah said ahd take plus fifteen quid for the inconvenience ye caused me yeve got five quid me bonnie boy and thats five quid moren ye deserve five quid and id had two hundred when i hailed him at port santa lucia in naples bay why didnt you take the five quid as well i asked he laughed it was a hard grating sound like the creak of the oars in the rowlocks because ahm no wanting inquiries made about the arisaig five poundsll last ye quite a bit the will to stay free is awfu strong in a man ah couldve filled ye full of lead and thrown ye overboard wi some old iron in yer boots but i dinna trust me crew when it comes to murdering a man though its what ye deserve how do you know what i deserve the anger boiled up in me stronger than the pain in my head what were you doing sailing in and out of the north african ports when rommel held the coast ill bet you werent talking your phoney scots then he laughed again mais non mon vieux jeparlais toujours le francais quand jetais en afrique or german i added who was he to tell me what i deserved this rotten crooked little bastard of a scots father and a french mother a wave broke and the white of its crest licked along the gunnel wetting my sleeve and slopping water into my face we were very near the beach now i could see it a faint smudge of steeply rising sand that ended in a granite wall damn them why should i let them get away with my money like that do you know how long it took me to make that two hundred pounds i asked no and ah dinna care was the reply two years i answered two years up in the lignite mines near florence nearly a half a million lire i had to pay through the nose for sterling more fool you mulligan snapped back ye couldve made it in a single trip wi one of the gangs operating the black market in the naples area well i made it the honest way i answered him i looked up at him out of the corner of my eyes he was watching me intently the pistol grasped by the barrel he must have seen me watching him for his hand tightened on the weapon i shifted my arm so that my hand was almost touching his boot i glanced at the waves seeping against the steep sandy shore the stern of the boat lifted we were almost in the break now the suck of the backwash was quite loud i shifted my weight so that i could use my arms one heave and hed be in the water and then wed see whod have the money i felt my fingers touch the wet rubber of his sea boots i braced my back against the gunnel and at that moment the stern lifted again and mulligan said reecht boys run her in he looked down at me and said mais avec toi man petit je ne cours pas des chances the butt of the pistol rose and fell my head seemed to crack like a broken eggshell and everything went black when i came to i thought i was in my bunk with a hangover it was so comfortable and my head throbbed with pain i felt chilly and moved my hands to pull the bedclothes up but there were no bedclothes a slight breeze was ruffling through my hair and my feet were wet my head throbbed and the waves flopped and seethed to the hammer of the pain i rolled over on my back and opened my eyes above me the stars were dimming with the pale light of morning i moved my hands under me and encountered sand the sound of a wave scattered pain through my head and water swilled up to my buttocks i sat up with a groan and gazed about me through paindimmed eyes i was sitting on a beach of yellow sand my feet stretched over the tide mark a wave rose up out of the half light broke white and flooded up the beach wetting me to the waist i scrambled back out of reach of the advancing tide i fingered my scalp gently through matted hair my fingers encountered an ugly bump just above the left ear and another right at the back of the skull when i looked at my hand there was halfcongealed blood mixed with sand for a moment i sat there with my head in my hands trying to collect my thoughts this must be england the cornish coast right by lands end and that was it i had just five pounds five pounds and no background it wasnt much of an introduction to my native land in a sudden frenzy of fear i thrust my fingers into the zipfastened pocket of my money belt i brought out the wad of paper that had replaced my hundred and fifty one pound notes toilet paper with trembling hands i shredded it through searching for the five pounds that swine mulligan had said hed left me piece by piece i separated those sheets of toilet paper and let them drift away in the wind then i ran through the pockets of my jacket nothing but in the right hand pocket of my trousers i found it it was a mean little wisp of folded notes wet and stained but oh god how glad i was of it in my fear that i had been left nothing those five sodden notes seemed suddenly gigantic wealth i put them in the pocket of my belt and struggled to my feet i felt feint and slightly sick the cliffs reeled and toppled i stumbled to the edge of the sea and doused my head with water till my scalp wound tingled with the salt then i turned and began to struggle along the sands towards the inward curve of the bay the dawn came reluctantly cold and grey showing me the sweep of the bay the farther tip of it was thrust out into the sea and ended in a tumble of jagged rocks the village of sennen cove huddled beneath the headland the wind had freshened from the souwest and the sea was already flecked with little whitecaps before i was halfway across the bay the sun had risen above the hills inland an angry red disc that barely penetrated the mist of low cloud that had trailed with the dawn across the sky a few minutes later the sun disappeared an autumnal chill was in the air i stopped and looked back the black granite cliffs which i had left were capped with a veil of cloud even as i watched the mist thickened and swept down blotting out the northern limit of the bay entirely within a few minutes the mist had closed down and i was walking through a thin grey void my world reduced to sand and the surf of breaking waves the chill of the moist blanket of the mist seeped through my damp jersey and ate into my very bones so this was england i thought of the sunshine and the blue skies of italy forgotten in that moment was all the dirt and flies and squalor the vindictive sneers of the italians the loneliness i wished i had not come chapter two at the ding dong mine i have set down in detail the manner of my return to my native cornwall because like the prelude to an opera it was all of a part with the strange events that followed as an outcast myself it was inevitable that i should be thrown into company with men who themselves lived outside the law at the time i admit i felt that i was the subject of a series of most fetal coincidences but now that i look back on the whole affair i feel that it was less a series of coincidences than a natural sequence one thing leading inevitably to another from the moment that i decided take dave tanners advice and reurn to england on the arisaig i was set upon a course that led me with terrible directness to cripples ease it may sound fantastic but then is anything more fantastic than life itself i have so often been angered by people who damn books from the comfortable security of their armchairs for being too fantastic i have read everything i have ever been able to lay my hands on from the just so stories to war and peace thats the way i got myself educated and i have yet to read any book that was more fantastic than the stories ive heard in the mining camps of the rockies or down under in the coolgardie gold district of western australia and yet i will say this that if i had been told as i strode over the mistshrouded road to penzance that i was walking straight into a terrible mine disaster not only that but into a pitiful story of madness and greed that involved my own family history then i just should not have believed it for one thing i was far too absorbed in my own wretchedness i had dreamed so often of this homecoming all cornishmen do their dream is of a lucky strike and then back to cornwall to swagger their wealth in the mining towns with big talk of the things theyve done and the places theyve been and here was i back in cornwall an outcast alone and penniless i doubt whether there was any one more depressed more completely dispirited by his own sense of loneliness yes and his sense of fear than i was and all round me was the deep soundlessness of the mist in place of the blazing blue of the italian skies there was no traffic on the road everything was dead and cold and wet old tales of the tinners old superstitions that id heard by the camp fires came to my mind id thought them stupid tales at the time piskies the giants the knockers the black dogs the dead hand and a host of other halfremembered beliefs they all seemed real enough up there in the mist on the road to penzance there were times when i could have sworn somebody was following me but it was just my imagination that and the fact that id have been scared of my own shadow if the sun had suddenly broken through the mist the trouble was that i hadnt understood what it would be like coming back to an organised society i hadnt realised quite how much of an outcast i should feel four years in italy is apt to give you the idea that the organisation of the masses is such an impossible task that any individual can discreetly lose himself in the crowd but in sennen cove after breakfasting at the inn under the curious gaze of the waiter i had gone into the little general stores to get a map of the district the shop was warm and friendly full of seaside things with a stand of postcards crudely illustrating old seaside jokes it reminded me of little places near perth a girl was talking to a man with a little brushedup sandy moustache obviously an officer on leave you wouldnt think it possible more than three years after the end of the war she was saying nearly fifteen thousand it says listen to this you ii find them on the race tracks in the black market running restaurants selling bad liquor organising prostitution gambling and vice dealing in second hand cars phoney antiques stolen clothing theyre mixed up in every rotten racket in the country parasites thats what this paper calls them and thats what they are she threw the paper down on the counter it lay open at the page she had been looking at the headline ran fifteen thousand deserters i know what id do with them if i were the government the girl added round them up and send them to the coal mines for three years thatd teach them i had bought my map and hurried out of the shop scared that the girl would notice me unseen eyes seemed watching me from the blind windows of the cottages as i hastened up the damp street and footsteps seemed to follow me as i climbed the hill to the main road a little knot of people waiting for the bus at the school watched me curiously as i hurried by i felt like a leper so raw were my nerves and so much did i hate myself i reached penzance shortly after noon having been given a lift over the last three miles of the road by a lorry loaded with china clay it was market day in penzance i strolled down to the waterfront there were men dressed much the same as myself in seamens jerseys and a jacket nobody took any notice of me i felt suddenly at ease for the first time since i had landed in england drifters and singlefunnelled coasters lay alongside the piers and the rattle of cranes and donkey engines kept the gulls wheeling over the oily harbour scum the mist had lifted and thinned to a golden veil the streets were already beginning to dry across the albert pier st michaels mount gleamed like a fairy castle in a shaft of sunlight i lit a cigarette and leaning against the iron railing by the car park fished in my wallet for dave tanners address as i unfolded the crumpled sheet of notepaper the sun came through and the rainwashed faces of the houses smiled down at me from the low hill on which the town is built i felt warm and relaxed as i read through tanners letter harbour terrace penzance cornwall th may dear jim i hear things are not what they were in italy now that the armys moved north and the peace treaty has been signed if youre getting tired of the ities and would like a change of air i can fix you up with a job in england no questions asked the bearer of this note name of shorty can fix passage for you in the arisaig which will be taking on cargo in livorno is maria the same darkeyed little bitch i knew or has she retired to raise a brood of american bambini if she is still at the pappagallo give her my love will you england is all controls and restrictions but those who know their way about do all right same as we do in italy but i miss the sun and the signorinas hope you take this opportunity to come over its a mining job and right up your street your old chum dave i folded the note and put it back in my wallet shorty had come out to the lignite mine with it himself that had been in august with the sun beating fiercely down the earth baked brown and the dust rising in choking clouds how different i thought to this clean sparkling air with the sun shimmering on the wet pavements in that moment i held my fate in my hands i didnt know it then of course but i had only to forget all about dave tanner and seek a job on my own and the thread that was leading me to cripples ease would be broken and i came so very near to breaking it i thought of the arisaig and how mulligan had cheated me if those were the sort of men dave mixed with and the job he had for me no questions asked that was what he had written that could only mean one thing a racket of some sort i recalled the man himself neat dapper quickwitted a welshman he wasnt the sort to live strictly within the law even as a corporal in charge of a water transport coastal schooner hed had his own little rackets shipping personal consignments of silk stockings wrist watches and liquor from livorno to civitavecchia and napoli and on the northbound trips olive oil sweets and nuts i put my hands in my pockets and immediately encountered the remains of my meagre five pounds i turned then and went along the quay in that moment the fatal decision was made harbour terrace was behind the gas works a narrow street running up from the harbour number two was next to a corn merchants the end house of a long line ill exactly alike there were torn lace curtains in the window and that air of faded respectability that belongs to the boarding house throughout the englishspeaking world a girl answered my ring she was about twentyeight and wore a yellow jumper and green corduroy slacks she smiled at me brightly but with the lips only her grey eyes were hard and watchful is mr tanner in i asked her lips froze to a thin line her eyes narrowed who did you say she asked her voice was thin and unmusical tanner i repeated mr dave tanner theres nobody of that name living here she said sharply and started to close the door as though to shut out something she feared hes an old friend of mine i said hurriedly leaning my bulk against the door ive come a long way to see him at his request i added theres no mr tanner living here she repeated woodenly but i pulled the letter out of my wallet this is number two harbour terrace isnt it i asked she nodded her head guardedly as though not trusting herself to admit even that well heres a letter i received from him i showed her the signature and the address hes a welshman i said dark hair and eyes and a bit of a limp ive come all the way from italy to see him she seemed to relax but there was a puzzled frown on her face as she said its mr jones youre wanting his names david and he has a bit of a limp like you said but hes away to the fishing now and then the guarded look was back in her eyes as though shed said too much when will he be back i asked there was an uneasy emptiness in my stomach for he must have had a reason for changing his name and i didnt like the frightened look in the girls eyes he left on monday she said and this is wednesday he cant possibly be back till tomorrow might even be friday it depends on what the weathers like ill come back this evening i told her it wont be any use she said he cant be back till tomorrow ill come back this evening i repeated whats the name of his boat no good coming this evening he wont be here come tomorrow she gave me a bright uncertain smile and closed the door on me i lunched on fish and chips and then went down to the south pier to make a few inquiries from an old salt i learned that david jones was skipper of the isle of mull a fiftyfive ton ketch used for fishing he confirmed that the isle of mull was unlikely to be back for at least another day but when i asked him where the isle of mull did her fishing his blue eyes regarded me curiously and i had that same sense of withdrawal almost of suspicion that i had had when talking to the girl at harbour terrace over to brettagny mebbe or out to the scillies he told me tednt like erring ee knaw tis mackerel and pilchard e be after an it depends where e do findn and he stared at me out of his amazingly blue eyes as though daring me to ask any more questions after that i went back into the town it was just after three the sun had gone out of the sky and the mist was coming down in a light drizzle penzance looked wet and withdrawn until shortly before eight oclock when i walked back through the gathering dusk to harbour terrace i was still free to make my own decision for the space of a few hours i could have broken that thread of destiny and with luck id have eventually got passage in a ship to canada and so would never have discovered what happened to my mother but fear and loneliness combined is a thing few men can fight tanner was the only soul i knew in a strange country he was my one contact with the future what did it matter if he were mixed up in some shady business i was a deserter and since that put me outside the law so long as i remained at liberty it was outside the law that i should have to earn my living to that extent i faced up to the reality of my situation what i could not face up to was the uncertainty and difficulties of the unknown if i tried to fend for myself i took the easy way comforting myself that if i didnt like tanners proposition i could decide against it later and so as a clock down by the harbour struck eight i turned up by the gas works into harbour terrace the single street light showed the rain dancing on the roadway and water swirling down the gutters of the steep little street it was an older woman who answered the door this time is mr david jones back yet i asked her her face paled and she glanced quickly over her shoulder at the stairs which ascended in a rigid line to the unlighted interior of the house sylvia sylvia she called out in a hoarse agitated voice a door at the top of the stairs opened and the girl i had seen before stood framed in the flood of light what is it auntie theres a gentleman inquiring for mr jones the door was instantly closed shutting out the light and the girl came down the stairs she was still dressed in her yellow jumper and green corduroys but her face was pale and drawn as she faced me in the doorway what do you want she asked and then almost in the same breath hes not back yet i told you he wont be back till tomorrow whyve you come again now her voice dropped uncertainly on the last word id said id come back this evening i reminded her then my eyes fell to her hand there was blood on it and more on her slacks and there was an impersonal familiar smell about her a surgical smell iodine she saw the direction of my gaze one of our lodgers she muttered hes cut himself on a glass excuse me i must go up and finish bandaging his arm as soon as shed said the word arm her eyes widened for a second she stared straight at me quite still then panic leapt into her fearstruck eyes and she flung herself at the door but i brushed her and the door back and stepped inside hes back isnt he i said closing the door hes back and hes hurt she leapt to the stairs and stood there panting barring my way like a tigress defending her young what do you want with him she breathed why have you come all that about coming from italy at his request that was all lies wasnt it you were asking questions about him down at the harbour this afternoon thats what i was told why i said look i dont mean any harm its true what i said this morning i fished the letter out of my wallet again there if you dont believe me read that letter thats his handwriting isnt it she nodded but she didnt read it immediately she stood there with her eyes fixed on mine as though i were a wild beast and she was afraid to release me from her gaze read it i said then perhaps youll believe what i say reluctantly she lowered her eyes she read through then she folded it carefully and handed it back her face had lost the strained look but the wide eyes looked tired and drained was maria his girl she asked her voice was soft yet somehow harsh oh god i said she was nobody just a girl in a trattoria the door at the top of the stairs opened and dave tanners voice called down sharply what the devil are you doing girl come and fix this arm before i lose any more blood his figure was black against the light from the room behind the wide shaft of light showed the grey cupids on the peeling wallpaper across it sprawled his shadow he was in his shirt sleeves and held a bloodstained towel to his left arm his hair was damp with the rain or maybe it was sweat who the hell was it anyway its all right dave she answered its a friend of yours ill come and fix that arm now a friend of mine he echoed yes i called up to him its me jim pryce jim pryce he peered down into the unlighted hallway his face caught the light it was drained of all colour the bones standing out like a caricature in marble a helluva moment youve chosen to come visiting he said then impatiently well come on up man dont stand there gaping at me as though i were jesus christ the girl suddenly came to life and hurried up the stairs i followed her we went into the bedroom and she shut the door and started to work on his arm what happened i asked oh just a spot of trouble he said vaguely and his face contracted with pain as the girl dabbed iodine into what was obviously a bullet wound who was maria the girl suddenly asked thats a pretty nasty wound i said quickly its nothing nothing whatever a flesh wound thats all what did you say syl i asked who was maria the girl said and dabbed iodine into the wound so that the sweat stood out in beads on his forehead just a girl he snapped he looked across at me his black eyes gleamed in his taut face whatve you been telling her nothing i said i had to show her your letter she wouldnt let me in oh then to the girl in a curt voice thats enough of the iodine now bandage it no he can do that get me some dry clothes and when youve done that well need some food to take with us as she opened the wardrobe he said to me well cut up by hea moor and madron youll not be minding a night march will you now yes but whats happened dave i asked nothing he said and held out his arm for me to bandage with his other hand he took a gold case from his hip pocket and lit a cigarette the lighter was gold too a diamond ring flashed on his finger the girl put a pile of clothes on the chair at the foot of the bed now get the food he said he spoke with the cigarette clinging to his underlip its time we were going and see if you can find another raincoat the girls face was sullen and her eyes flickered up at me with fierce hatred she wanted to be going with him she went out and i began to bandage his arm hey not too tight bach he said yes thats better he grunted as i pressed against the arm muscles to tie the bandage was it mulligan you came over with he asked as he began to change his wet clothes yes i said and the dirty bastard robbed me when he brought me ashore did he now you dont seem very surprised i said why should i be surprised the mans as crooked as an eel he turned suddenly look you now dont be blaming me man the arisaig is the only vessel we have on the italian run it was the best i could do its not every skipper who will take the chance of smuggling a deserter into the country a flicker of a smile creased the corners of his eyes it wouldnt surprise me you know if you were to meet mulligan again hows that i asked his back was turned towards me and he was struggling into a dry pair of workmans corduroys he did not answer look dave i said whats this job youve got for me is it still available yes i think so he said he pulled on a seamans jersey as his head emerged from the neck his mouth was twisted in pain and the sweat ran down his face he put his cigarette back between his lips and drew in a great lungful of smoke its a good job you know mining did i tell you yes i said you told me that in your letter he nodded and forced his injured arm into his jacket come on now he said your way is the same as mine ill tell you about it as we go he stuffed some cigarettes into his pocket and transferred his case and lighter and a thick wallet from his sodden jacket to the one he had put on his quick eyes glanced round the room then he opened the door he seemed in a great hurry to be gone i followed him down the stairs in the dark hallway he leaned over the banisters and shouted down into the basement for the girl just coming dave she answered the tip of the cigarette glowed red as we waited he was puffing at it nervously the gloom of the little hall was lessened by the light from the street that entered by a dirty fanlight above the front door the girls feet sounded hollow on the bare stairboards i could ear her quick frightened breathing as she emerged from the basement theres sandwiches and an old raincoat of fathers she said her voice breathless listen syl daves voice was a harsh whisper those clothes upstairs burn them clean up everything leave nothing whatever to show that i returned you understand and when they come around asking questions tell them i never came back see that the old woman doesnt jabber he turned to leave then but the girl clung to him where can i get in touch with you she asked quickly you cant youll come back wont you this in a fierce whisper yes indeed i will he assured her ill send a message but understand i never came back here and dont let on to them where ive gone how can i when i dont know indeed you cant thats why i didnt tell you he turned to me i could see his eyes in the dim light open the door and see if theres any one about i pulled the door open the street was deserted the rain came down in a steady stream in the light of the street lamp it slanted in thin steel rods to dance on the roadway and run gurgling down the gutters i looked back into the hallway the girl was clinging to dave her body pressed to his in a primitive declaration of passion that stripped her bare dave was looking past her to the open doorway the cigarette still in his mouth when he saw me nod he detached himself from the girl and came towards me the girl started to follow him he turned to her see that you get those things burned he said then he kissed her quickly and we left number two harbour terrace as i shut the door i saw the girl standing alone at the bottom of the stairs she was staring straight at me but she didnt see me the skin was tight and drawn on her face and i had the impression that she was crying though there were no tears in her eyes its a strange thing but it never seemed to occur to me to leave dave to fend for himself i didnt know what had happened but a man doesnt get a bullet wound in his arm for nothing nor does he abandon his girl and his lodgings with instructions for his bloodstained clothes to be burned unless hes been mixed up in something pretty shady for all i knew he might be involved in murder but i was swept up in the thing now and as i say it never occurred to me to leave him probably it was the company and the fact that he was an outcast like myself there is nothing to my mind so terrible as loneliness not the loneliness that comes to a man in a town when he is afraid of his fellow creatures we kept to mean badly lit streets as we threaded our way out of penzance we didnt talk yet i found immeasurable comfort in the presence of that small figure limping along beside me we came out at last on to a main road and as we climbed a short hill through the rain we left the lights of penzance behind us at the top i paused and looked back the town was just a ragged huddle of lights faintly visible through the driving rain come on man dave said impatiently and i knew he was afraid of those lights how far are we going i asked eight or nine miles he answered we trudged on well separate at lanyon he added where are you going i asked a farm ill be hiding up for a bit another girl i asked his teeth showed in the darkness as he grinned up at me is c casanova you think i am my remark had flattered his vanity he was one of those men who for no apparent reason is attractive to women and he enjoyed the sense of power it gave him what about me i asked where am i going botallack he replied theres a message ill be wanting you to carry too good god i said my father worked at botallack indeed then youd better change your name you know let me see canada wasnt it any irish in canada fair number i told him in the mining districts some well then what do you say to odonnel thats a good irish name indeed it is and its very suitable for a big man look you from now on youre jim odonnel okay sure i said whats in a name he laughed sardonically a hell of a lot sometimes you know he was silent for a moment i knew he was looking up at me and i knew what he was thinking did you have to ask for me by my real name he said at length how was i to know you had changed it i said he grunted she didnt know jones wasnt my real name damn it man you might have thought of that and showing her the letter its pretty mad she was shes nothing particular in the way of looks and she knows it after that we walked in silence mile after weary mile through the driving rain we went on through hea moor and madron and then up the long hill flanked by cedar woods and rhododendrons to the moors we met no one only two cars passed us and each time my companion drew me out of the line of the headlights he was taking no chances of being seen on the long hill out of madron his pace became slower and slower so that i had to keep on waiting for him his breathing was heavy and his limp more pronounced out on the moors at the top we came into the wind and the rain slanted across our faces from the south west it was pitch dark and silent save for the steady swish of the rain i was soon wet to the skin the raincoat was an old one and though made for a man much bigger than dave it was too short for me and did not meet across the chest i could feel the water coursing down my body underneath my clothes it began at the neck where two little pools formed in my collar bones and trickled icily down my sides running together at my loins and then down the insides of my legs and so into my squelching shoes daves feet began to drag he was stumbling along soon i was supporting him with one hand under his arm it was clear he couldnt go much farther his breath was coming in hard rasping sobs and he limped heavily i stopped him lets look at that arm i said its nothing he answered fiercely come on now we need to be clear of the moors by daybreak but i got out my matches and after breaking two managed to keep one alight for a second his left hand was sodden with blood which mingled with the rain to form pale red drops on his fingertips that arms got to be bound up i said where can we get some shelter a barn or something he hesitated then he said all right theres a turning a little way on to the right it leads down to ding dong its an old mine working and theres the remains of a blowing house thats more like a cave than anything else well be safe enough there we kept to the right of the road and about a quarter of a mile farther on came to a dirt road leading away into the moors it was half an hours walk to that mine at the pace we were going and before we got there i was practically carrying dave he hadnt much strength left in him the road deteriorated to a stonestrewn moorland track it led to a grassy mound and dimly visible through the black soundlessness of the night loomed the blacker shape of one of those granite engine houses that will stand to the end of time a little farther on we came upon a huddle of mineworkings vague mound shapes of broken rock we scrambled in amongst these and after a bit of searching dave found what he wanted a low stone archway this was the castle of the old blowing house we stumbled through and found ourselves miraculously out of the rain and wind gorse and furze grew in abundance and in a short while we were squatting naked before a sizzling blaze our clothes hung over branches to dry i fixed daves arm with a tourniquet and then we started in on the sandwiches i had pulled whole bushes up by the roots and these with some old baulks of timber i had found gave us plenty of fuel the smoke from the blaze was whipped out of the doorway by the wind if anybody had seen us squatting there completely nude before the fierce blaze of the fire our shadows dancing on the broken rock of the walls they would have thought it a trick of time and gone away believing they had been piskeyled back into the days of the ancient britons but there was no one to see us we were on a wild stretch of the moors and outside it was teeming with rain and blowing half a gale with water from a pool in the doorway i washed the blood off daves arm then i renewed the bandage the wound no longer bled even when i took the tourniquet off the bullet had passed through the fleshy part of the upper arm it did not seem to have damaged the muscles for he could still flex his fingers and move his wrist and elbows i put on a fresh bandage of strips torn from the tails of our shirts as i worked i began asking questions he lit a cigarette and didnt answer i suppose you were running liquor i suggested finally his gaze met mine i could see the flames of the fire dancing in his dark eyes he had the look of an animal thats been cornered his silence exasperated me i wanted to knock the cigarette out of his mouth and shake the truth out of him what happened i asked again did a revenue cutter board you what happened to the isle of mull there was shooting did you shoot back his eyes narrowed the small dark features were immobile the cigarette dangling from his bloodless lips his stony silence chilled me suddenly i had to know ever since we had left the house in harbour terrace my energies had been concentrated on leaving penzance behind us but now as i knelt naked by the blazing fire that scorched my buttocks i had time to think racketeer he undoubtedly was the skipper of a fishing boat doesnt have gold cigarette cases and diamonds i didnt mind that but a killer was different dave i said for gods sake tell me did you shoot back was anybody else hurt his eyes didnt leave my face they were cold and hard they were like the eyes of a panther i had once seen looking down at me from a branch of a tree as it lay crouched to spring i suddenly caught hold of him and shook him what happened i cried and my voice sounded strange the thin line of his lips curled the expression of his eyes changed so that he was looking through me he was seeing a scene that was indelibly planted in his mind and he was enjoying it he began to hum a tune crooning it to himself in an ecstasy of reminiscence they insisted on taking the hatches off i warned them not to but they insisted he suddenly looked at me he was still smiling secretly what could i do man it was their own fault wasnt it i jumped for the other boat thats when i got this bullet through the arm and then they opened the hatches it was a lot of noise she made and then she sank just as though shed hit a mine just lovely it was but its sorry i am about the old boat fond i was of her fonder than ive ever been of a boat how many were killed i asked his eyes went dead and the muscles of his face hardened its nothing to do with you man their own fault wasnt it now he put his hand on my arm dont be asking any more questions jim he said its shooting my mouth off ive been forget what ive said im feverish thats all he stared into the fire his face relaxed so that he looked little more than a kid i squatted back on my haunches i felt cold and wretched in the blaze of the fire that burned my neck i thought of the stories id heard of the wreckers that had operated along these rugged coasts before the lighthouses were built and how the fiends had knifed the survivors that struggled in through the break of the waves here was something just as horrible and i was mixed up in it a few hours ago i had been a deserter nothing more now i was mixed up in murder i shivered what about this job i asked huskily is it anything to do to do with your activities his lips remained set and his eyes hard yet somehow i knew he was smiling to himself its scared you are he said of course im scared i said suddenly finding my voice theres men been killed tonight and im involved ive only done one thing wrong in my life i ran when i shouldve gone on and got killed like any decent fellow i ran because my nerves were shot in ribbons with three consecutive nights patrolling through mines and booby traps in that hell of cassino i couldnt take it but thats all ive done and now here i am hiding on a desolate stretch of moors with with a murderer his eyes leapt to mine they were like hard glittering coals his right hand slid across towards his clothes i watched him not afraid but fascinated he felt in the pocket of his jacket then his eyelids drooped and he relaxed his hand shifted to the breast pocket of his jacket and he brought out his cigarette case he shivered as he lit a cigarette and when hed put the case back he moved nearer the fire he huddled over it watching me out of the corners of his eyes he was nervous and uncertain he sat there for a while so close to the blaze that his thin white body glowed red he stared into the flames and every now and then he shivered it was as though he saw in the heart of the flaming wood his future i realised that he was scared the silence became oppressive i remembered how he had slid his hand to the side pocket of his jacket suppose he became scared that id give him away there was no forecasting his reactions forget about it and get some sleep why dont you i said he raised his head and looked at me slowly i never killed anybody before you know he murmured then he turned back and continued to gaze into the flames all through the war i never killed a soul never even saw a dead body the r as c company i was with kept pretty well in the rear and then because id been in coal ships out from swansea i was transferred to a water transport company it wasnt me you know that thought up that idea of boobytrapping the hatches the captain it was damn his eyes how was i to know the whole bloody vessel would go up in a sheet of flame i thought it would just scuttle her how was i to know tell me that man his eyes were excited and his whole body moved with the widespread disavowal of guilt made by his hands why is it you sit there so silent you think its damned i am what right have you to judge didnt you walk out on your pals a deserter theres nothing rottener isnt it true that a man who deserts is is he opened his arms again unable to find the word i didnt desert did i i jumped to save my skin any one would have done the same he leaned forward on his elbow and peered up at me im not a murderer i tell you it was a cry of desperation then he muttered by god if thats what you think in a single lithe movement he had risen and was feeling in the pocket of his jacket i braced myself my tongue felt dry for gods sake sit down i said im in no position to do you any harm he hesitated then he seemed to relax thats right he said youre not are you he smiled it wasnt a real smile it was no more than a drawing back of the lips to show the flash of his even white teeth he looked like some devil his body all red with the firelight and his teeth bared behind him his distorted shadow sprawled menacingly over wall and roof i passed my tongue across my lips it rasped like a piece of adhesive tape sit down i said again youre all hepped up i cant do you any harm besides i need your help he didnt say anything he stood there looking at me for the moment his dark head thrust forward like a snake considering whether to strike then he shivered and went into the corner of the cave and relieved himself away from the fire his body was white again he was watching me all the time i could see his eyes like two red coals in the gloom then he came back to the fire and stood right over it with his legs apart so that the warmth of it seeped up his body he was shivering so that i wondered whether he wasnt a bit feverish after a moment he crouched down and began staring into the flames again funny what your childhoods days do to you he said softly we lived in the rhondda my father was a miner two pounds ten a week thats what he got and my mother to keep the six of us three sisters i had and me the eldest of the children i was at work in the pits when i was twelve and by the time i was sixteen its a mans job i was trying to do and me so weak i could hardly walk home after the end of each shift its not much food there is when theres six mouths to feed and the pits closing all along the valley by the time i was eighteen i was drawing dole so i went down to cardiff you know and worked as stevedore it wasnt long before i was handling stuff brought in by the sailors why should a man starve himself when theres crooks earning thousands of pounds that have the law on their side he gave a sudden harsh laugh ive been back to the rhondda once or twice shall i tell you something theres boys that used to play in the valley with me that are old men now no wonder the countrys in a bad way for coal and its nobody but themselves theyve got to blame he wriggled closer to the fire theyve sucked the life blood out of a great race of people for years why shouldnt i do a little bloodsucking if i murdered a thousand of them id be justified wouldnt i he picked a flaming brand out of the fire and held it aloft them and their bloody laws i dont care that much for them he flung the blazing log out through the door the flame of it died and vanished in a sizzle of steam as the rain swept over it see what i mean his eyes blazed at me across the fire what are laws theyre not made by the men who starve theyre made to protect the moneyed class theyre my enemies arent they well arent they his voice died suddenly and he turned his gaze back into the fire but i didnt know the old boat would go up like that i was beginning to feel chilly my clothes were dry now and i got up and put them on dave watched me for a while then he did the same when he was fully dressed he went to the entrance and looked out at the weather then he came back to the fire no use whatever going out in that wed best kip down here for the night what about your farm i said you said you wanted me there by daybreak he rounded on me who said i was going to a farm he snarled you did i reminded him he crossed over to me dragging his left foot understand this he said i never told you i was going to a farm i never told you anything you never met me you never came to see me you dont know me understand i nodded he searched my face finally he seemed satisfied and went back to the other side of the fire well go on tomorrow he said then he wrapped himself up in his raincoat and curled up close to the smouldering heap of timber his eyes closed for a second but i noticed that he slept with his right hand in his jacket pocket his face with the eyes closed looked old and drawn there was no trace of the boy in him that id seen earlier i was dead tired but though i lay down with my raincoat round me i could not get to sleep through long hours i lay huddled close to the fire thinking over the events of the day and listening to my companions regular breathing outside the rain streamed down the monotonous sound of it being relieved only when a gust of wind lashed at the mouth of the cave strange shadows flickered across the broken rock of wall and roof and occasionally a piece of timber moved in the fire sending up a shower of sparks god i kept on thinking what a mess ive got myself into how much easier would it have been if i had kept right on at cassino and got myself killed like the rest of the platoon or would i have still lived on crippled and disfigured a relic of human idiocy in some home for wrecks that they dare not show to the public at least i was alive and intact i suppose i must have dozed off for a little later it seemed i opened my eyes to find the fire nearly out and a wan light creeping furtively through the entranceway it was very cold i got up and went out the rain was still sheeting down out of a leaden sky all about me was a scene of bleak confusion the walls of the mine buildings had collapsed and mingled with the dumps of rock to form desolate mounts of sharpedged stone i got furze and more timber and built up the fire again daves eyes were open and he lay watching me his face was very white so that his eyes looked like two black sloes his right hand was still in the pocket of his jacket as i moved about the cave i was uncomfortably aware of his watchfulness the damp of the morning had chilled me to the marrow it made me nervous and every time my back was turned towards him i felt an almost uncontrollable urge to glance quickly back over my shoulder at last he got to his feet his hand was still in his pocket and he was watching me i tried to understand the expression in his eyes but i couldnt they were the eyes of a monkey mischievous cruel and without reason at last i could stand it no longer why do you stare at me like that i asked he gave a little shrug and his lips stretched to a thin smile he lit a cigarette i watched the deliberate movements of his hands they had long slender fingers and small wrists the hands of an artist or a man who lives on his nerves and drink i was just trying to decide whether i could trust you he said at last again the smile you see i dont know very much about you do i we drank together at the pappagallo thats all i might say the same about you i answered my eyes on his hand which he had put back in the pocket of his jacket yes but i dont carry your life in my hands he nodded towards the fire suppose you sit down and tell me about yourself he suggested i hesitated the hair was prickling along my scalp as i looked into the utter blankness of his eyes i suddenly felt an overwhelming desire to get that gun to get it before he used it sit down it was softly spoken but there was a harshness in his voice that made me obey without further hesitation now lets have your story he had seated himself across the fire from me he was puffing nervously at his cigarette in the bleak light that came in through the entrance his face looked wretchedly drawn the lines etched deeply into the white skin i began to tell him how i had left england when i was four moved to tin valley in the canadian rockies had started washing dishes in one of the local saloons when i was ten became a miner when i was twelve but he interrupted me i dont want data i want your background why did your father leave england and go to canada my mother left him i sat staring into the fire thinking back down the lane of my life if you want my background i said my father was a drunk he drank to forget my mother was very lonely i found a photograph of her amongst my fathers things after his death i pulled out my wallet and took from it my mothers photograph across the bottom was written in a found childish hand to bob from his love ruth nearne i passed it across to dave my father talked of nothing but cornwall he was desperately sick for home but he never made his fortune and he wouldnt come back to be mocked thats what he used to tell me he was afraid of being mocked for having lost his wife she went with a miner from penzance my father hated her and loved her all in the same breath i had forgotten why i was saying all this id never spoken about it to any one but suddenly up on those bleak moors in the derelict waste of that old tin mine it seemed right that i should be talking about it i dont know about welshmen i went on but cornish miners go all over the world theres not many mines that havent got cornishmen working in them and they cling together up there in the rockies my father found plenty of cornishmen hed bring them back to our hut and theyd talk mining by the hour over potties of bad rye feeding pinewood into the stove until the iron casing became red hot and when there wasnt any company hed tell me about our own country and the mines along the tin coast botallack and levant hed worked in them both and even now i reckon i could find my way around in those mines from the memory of what he told me of them he was a thin wiry little man with sad eyes and a hell of a thirst that and silicosis killed him at the age of fortytwo did you ever hear from your mother i looked up i had almost forgotten that dave was there so absorbed had i become in my memories no i said never and i was never allowed to refer to her the only clue i ever got as to her whereabouts was when he was raving drunk one night and mouthed curses upon a place called cripples ease theres a village of that name near st ives i found it on the map but i shall never go there he was dead drunk for a week then i think he must have heard something he died when i was sixteen i think i would have asked him about her when he was dying but he had a stroke and never regained consciousness oh thats terrible i looked up to find dave with a look of genuine sadness in his eyes and you never found out what happened to her he asked no i said but now that you are in cornwall i shook my head no i told him let the past lie buried he wouldnt have wanted me to try to find out he may have been a drunk but i loved him that secret smile was back on daves lips but this time it was different it was as though he was really amused at something maybe the past will not lie buried what do you mean i asked he shrugged his shoulders and handed back the faded print after that we sat in silence for a long while outside the rain swept across the waste of mine workings in a leaden curtain and the grey light glistened on the piledup mounds of slag at length dave got up and sniffed at the weather itll clear up after midday he said youll be able to start out then our ways part from here where do i go i asked botallack he replied ask for captain manack and give him this he tossed his gold cigarette lighter across to me thatll prove that i sent you to him now im going to get some sleep and i suggest you do the same what about your arm i asked indeed its all right he said and curled himself up in his raincoat in front of the hot embers for some time i sat staring out into the black curtain of the rain at length i grew sleepy and dozed off when i woke the sun was shining and i was alone in the cave i went outside the moors looked warm and friendly and the rubble of the old mine workings steamed gently in the warmth of the sun the gold of the gorse shimmered in the heat and birds were singing i called but no one answered dave had gone chapter three cripples ease the sun was westering as i climbed cam kenidjack the great granite blocks of the earn were black against the flaming sky and the heather of the hillside was dark in shadow but when i reached the top and stood on the huge flattopped slabs i felt the faint warmth of the sun and the heather on the farther slope glowed a warm purple the moors spilled away from under my feet to a coastline that was torn and broken by old mine workings it was as though one of the giants of cornish legend had rootled along this rugged coast in search of boulders to hurl at some neighbouring titan the sea beyond was like a tray of burnished copper a line of storm clouds lay black along the horizon their ragged edges crimsoned by the red disc of the autumn sun the wind blew strong and salt in my face so this was the cornish tin coast there was a lump in my throat since i was old enough to understand my father had talked to me of little else but this strip of cornwall where he had lived and worked until he married and i was actually standing on carn kenidjack the hooting carn this was where the two tinners were supposed to have watched the devils wrestling match below me three tracks sprouted from the heather and thrust dirtybrown fingers down to the stonetilted roofs of the miners cottages on the coast road i got my bearings from my map that was st just away to the left there and botallack and boscaswell where my father had been born and trewellard yes and there was pendeen i could just see the white pimple of the lighthouse peeping above the rim of the coast a little to the left the two shafts of wheal geevor showed black scaffolds against the copper sea and that waste of broken rock down by the cliff edge that was levant i knew the line of the coast by heart as though i had spent my boyhood exploring it i needed no map to tell me which was cape cornwall and kenidjack castle i had felt a sudden excitement as i found botallack head and recognised in the scored clifftop behind it the surface workings of the botallack mine i could even pick out the various shafts getting my bearings from the broken ruins of the old engine houses that were the only ordered things in that chaos of tumbled stone the mine was derelict now but in my fathers day it had been a great copper producer he had taken me through it gallery by gallery describing each level in the minutest detail so that looking down on it from cam kenidjack i could almost see the outline of the underground workings just as my father had so often traced it for me on the dusty floor of our hut i thought of kalgoorlie and the seething mine valleys of the rockies and the big new concrete buildings that housed their plants and they seemed so recent and characterless beside this little strip of tornup coast where tin had been streamed by men who had left traces of their rude hut circles and megalithic burial chambers up here on these desolate moors these were the mines that had given the ancient britons the ore to barter with for ornaments and silks with greek merchants from marseilles way back in the bronze age and only fifty years ago the whole area had seethed with activity as thousands of men worked beneath the rugged cliffs and even out under the sea and now it was all derelict just that one mine wheal geevor still working the ruddy glow of the sun began to fade out of the heather the great red ball was sinking behind the gathering storm clouds i watched until the last red slice of it disappeared and when i looked down the slope of the hillside to the coast again the sea had become a dark abyss and the worked clifftops and broken hillside were gloomy and unfriendly the heather was like burnt stubble now and the rocks took on weird shapes in the gathering dusk the country seemed to shiver in the cold wind and withdraw into its dark past i went on again then making for the nearest of the tracks that led down into botallack but i went slowly almost reluctantly now that i was face to face with the future i felt ill at ease again i tried to pretend that if i didnt like the job i could go elsewhere but back of my mind there lurked a fear that i should not be allowed to do that all sense of excitement at returning to my fathers own country was drained out of me perhaps it was because all warmth had left the country with the setting of the sun it was bleak and bare and depressing or perhaps i had a sense of premonition by the time i had reached the coast road that runs from st ives to the lands end it was almost dark the clouds mat had fringed the horizon when the sun set were now a black mass piled up half across the sky distant lightning forked in jagged streaks providing the only indication where cloud ended and sea began after each flash the faroff roll of thunder sounded above the dull roar of the sea and the moan of the wind in the telegraph wires to the north the revolving light of pendeen watch swung in a white glare through the dark of the gathering storm many of the cottages must have disappeared since my fathers day for botallack was now little more than an inn and a few farm buildings there was not a soul on the road but from the lighted doorway of the inn came the sound of an accordion and mens voices they were singing the old grey duck i hadnt heard that old song since my father had died it had been a great favourite with him when he was drunk i hesitated i did not want to face the curious gaze of the inhabitants of this tiny village yet i had to find out where captain manack lived and i needed a drink to steady myself i needed time to think too there were about half a dozen men seated in the bar when i went in two were playing cornish skittles the rest were grouped around the accordion player he was a big burly man with short grizzled hair and he sang with an old clay pipe clamped between toothless gums the singing was punctuated by the clatter of the wooden pins as the ball on its string swung through their ranks a big fire blazed in the grate and the place looked warm and cheerful i crossed over to the bar and ordered a pint of beer very conscious of the fact that the singing had almost ceased as they watched me samples of ore stood among the bottles and glasses that twinkled at their reflections in the mirror that backed the shelves there was a leaden chunk of mother tin and a big lump of iron pyrites that glittered brighter man gold in the strong light the landlord was friendly enough and i began talking to him about the mining industry he was short and wide in the shoulders every now and then he gave a little rasping cough and his skin had the grey pallor of silicosis i suddenly realised that the accordion had stopped playing the singing had ceased so had the click of the skittles i turned quickly no one was talking they were all looking at me i was seized with a panic desire to run but my feet seemed to be rooted to the floor i took a grip on myself they couldnt tell just by the look of me why do you all stare at me i heard myself ask it was the accordion player who answeredwe bin trying to make ee out from yer talk thees a furriner sure an yet ees a fitly way of speaking im canadian i said iss iss but thees got cornish blood in ee the old man insisted i felt relieved but i wondered how he could tell i suppose it was the fact that id been brought up to cornish dialect i could drop into it quite easily and did now iss i said me father was a tinner over to redruth afore we went to canada born at boscaswell he was an worked cores down in botallack till they knacked the bal the old man nodded approvingly a thort so he said the whole room was smiling at me the way ee were talking the old man went on puts me in mind of the old days in camborne and redruth i mind the time when the bals were working full blast and the kiddiwinks was full o cornishmen tarkin all sorts of strange outlandish tongues theyd packed their traps when things were bad that were in the nineties iss an there werent a corner o the world they hadnt been to ee knaw chile peru the silver mines at lima where old dick trevithick went kimberley joburg the states theyd been most everywheres thered been a mine working they came home soons the bals began to open up again strange clos they wore an strange abits they had but they hadnt forgot their native cornish way o speakin no morem ee have boay he shook his head sadly there was money about in them days ee knaw not laike it is now why me father would tell me o the days when there was nigh on fifty bals working in this part o the country alone now theres only the one he took his pipe out of his mouth and spat navvies work thats what it is now mind ee they was rough lads that came back in the old days whilst ee got eesel eddicated he peered across at me thees not looking for work is ee boay i didnt say anything and he didnt seem to expect a reply thee wouldnt find much mining work in these parts now ednt i right garge he asked the landlord thas right bill the landlord turned to me theell hear people say that the bals in cornwall is worked out he said taint so but ees got to go deep deepern theyll go these days for all their modern equipment started some o the mines up the government did during this last war thee can see one ofn in the cove down beyond cape cornwall that was when malay was took by the japs spent a mint o money they did in the valley there but it were the same as it were with the adventurers no soonern they were gettin near the tin than they knacked er found they could get tin from bolivia or some sicn place when i was a boay copper were bout all anybody thort on around here an when the copper was worked out the mine closed down but under the copper theres tin and plenty of it thee can ask any of the boays whove worked deep theyll tell ee the same theres tin under the copper i seen it meself but it would cost a heap of money to get at it for the mines is all full o water now full right up to the adits what about the eyebits i asked there must be some rich patches left above water isnt anybody working them ar theres one or two little groups gettin an uneasy living out ofn replied the landlord but there ednt no future in it an theres others wastin their money fiddlin about just below the adit level put in the old man theres one ofn right here in botallack got control of the old wheal garth e as installed a pump and cleared to about the hundred an twenty fathom level just wastin is money thats what es doin yet shes a rich mine the old wheal garth they knacked er after the adventurers had had a row that was back in the depression in or mebbe twas some o the adventurers got cold feet thort they were spendin too much on development they didnt knaw the difference atween prills and dradge most of em when the mine was workin copper all they knawed was the price copper fetched in the market and the amount of copper that was being brought to the surface when it came to developing down through bad country for the tin what lay deeper well they knacked er an near on two undred men were out o work but i wasnt listening any more my eyes had been attracted by a headline in the paper that lay on the bar it read mystery of abandoned revenue cutter crew of four disappear i glanced quickly round the bar they were all intent upon their argument on the future of cornish mining half fearful that my interest in the story would be noticed i furtively pulled the paper towards me the first line produced a sudden leaden sensation in my stomach and i read on absorbed to the exclusion of all other sounds a revenue cutter which had been sent out to intercept a vessel suspected of smuggling was found abandoned this morning on a lonely stretch of beach near marazion no trace has so far been discovered of the four officials who formed the crew of the cutter and the customs office at penzance state that they have received no information regarding the missing men percy redcliff a fisherman of hillside marazion discovered the vessel beached on the sand at am he immediately reported to the police police and customs officials have examined the boat they state that the wheelhouse and starboard side of the hull are damaged as though by a very heavy sea the cutter was seen by several ships during the previous afternoon the last to sight her was a naval corvette the captain of this vessel reported the cutter about five miles off newlyn heading south at about six knots through calm seas inquiries are now being made concerning the isle of mull a fiftyfive ton ketch owned by mr david jones it is believed that this vessel may have sighted the cutter later than the corvette until this vessel is located officials are unwilling to make any statement it is possible that the cutter came into collision with another vessel last night and was abandoned by her crew mr redcliff however pointed out in an interview that when he found the cutter she was quite seaworthy his opinion was that the crew would have had no justification in abandoning her further he stated that the damage was not in his opinion the result of any collision the names of the missing men are frank riley i stopped reading then and looked up something said by one of the men in the bar had thrust itself into my mind the landlord was speaking ar he said reckon e knaws summat and then i understood why my interest had been aroused who manack asked the old accordion player hes just daft thats all ar es daft right enough put in one of the skittle players bin queer in the ead ever since his wife was killed poor soul an then there was that ooman who went mad down there put in another iss the landlord said to me walked over the cliff she did tednt a place id go near at night anyway said the skittle player nor me agreed the old man with the accordion id be scared o seeing the death fetch o one o they women and he chuckled softly to himself i dont care what ee say put in the landlord i reckon ee knaws summat one way and another ees got control of the whole mine bought the other adventurers out for next to nothing im thinking then why was he one of the ones that wanted to knack her asked the skittle player the landlord shook his head dunno he said mebbe it was so as he could get control of the mine in the short silence that followed i leaned across to the landlord and asked is it captain manack youre talking about he gave me a quick glance no the old man captain manack is his son why do you known mebbe i said wheres he live and then i got the second surprise that evening for the landlord turned to me and said just down the road at cripples ease cripples ease i echoed he laughed yes he said queer sort o name eh used to be a pub that was before my time when everybody round here worked at the botallack then it came into manacks possession and the licence was allowed to lapse when was that i asked oh let me see just after the first war it would be there was some tale that he got it from the woman who kept house for him the same that went mad an walked over the cliff but then cos es reckned a bit daft theres all sorts of stories about him cant believe alf o what youre toald in a village laike this he grinned leastways es the one man that believes theres tin down in wheal garth and tryin to get it he and is son though what is son knows about mining i dont know they employs a couple o men down there furriners they are an we dont see much o them seems theyre more like quarry men than miners about all they do is cut granite slabs for kerb stones and things lorries come down from bristol sometimes lunnon even about once a week he shook his head old manackll never do no good with that mine im thinking whereabouts is cripples ease i asked he looked at me sharply just down the road he said vaguely why i hesitated then i said ive come here to see captain manack i had the feeling he was eyeing me closely thee dont want to be going down to cripples ease put in the old man with the accordion leastways not this time o night tednt a very friendly place he smiled showing his gums he did it without removing the clay pipe its the old man daft thats what i say e is e were all right until his wife had that assident what happened i asked fell down a mine shaft she did poor ooman he told me taint difficult the cliffs is littered with old shafts they found her at the bottom her head was stove in and she had her dog layin aside of er they say as ow she went down after the dog but theres others thinks different he added darkly what was her name i asked er name what was er name garge he asked the landlord harriet if i remember rightly ar that were it harriet manack she was a widow woman from penzance they say it was she brought im is interest in wheal garth when did this happen i asked itd be nine or ten years ago he replied was he married before the old man shook his head not to my recollection i felt relieved i didnt want to go digging up the past i finished my beer which road do i take for manacks place i asked the landlord turn right outside here he said about fifty yards on the road bends sharp right thats where ee turns off to the left theell find a track thatll take ee down to botallack cripples ease is by the mine workings theell not mistake it ednt nothing else down there cept ruins outside thick darkness shut in the village and thrust back the light that stole out through the open doorway of the inn the wind had risen and the roar of it swallowed the sound of my footsteps on the roadway a fork of lightning ripped open the underbelly of the clouds that hung above the coast in the flash of it the drab stone of the cottages that edged the roadway stood cut sharp and black as in a woodcut the thunder cracked heavy and close like a giant whip slashed across the heavens and then died away in a grumbling murmur over the sea i found the track without difficulty it ran west towards the sea and the great streaks of forked lightning were reflected in the tumbled waters the roar of the waves beating against the cliffs grew louder as i walked on and soon the flickering light showed me the surf boiling at the foot of kenidjack castle the thunder rolled round the heavens in an almost unbroken orchestra of sound tumbled broken heaps that had once been mine buildings loomed up out of the night the stone almost white in the dazzle of the lightning a fine mist of sea spray drove against my face salting my lips old engine houses stood like dilapidated keeps along the clifftop and between them were piled broken heaps of crushed stone tier on tier like terraces it was a devils mockery of the hanging gardens of babylon where not even thistle and chickweed would grow then black against a flash of lightning i saw a building that was whole and intact it was a gaunt ugly building standing foursquare to the winds that roared across the top of the cliffs it was there for an instant outlined against luminous clouds and still more luminous sea then it was gone swallowed up in the inky blackness that followed each flash i saw the house next against a crackle of lightning far off along the horizon it was nearer and seemed to crouch like some animal bunched to withstand the impact of the storm then suddenly a great flare of lightning split the sky right over my head the jagged rent of crackling light sizzling in a single streak to stab the hills inland the thunder was instantaneous the clouds seemed to split with light and sound at one and the same time and in that vivid flash i saw the windows of the building shine cold and dead like a blind mans eyes the face of the house was black with a weather coating of pitch beside it was the remains of a garden a poor broken thing of hydrangeas and foxgloves all choked with thistles there were several little fruit trees too gaunt wasted things whose branches flared away from the wind as though in mad flight for shelter with that splitting crash of thunder the heavens seemed ripped open the rain swept down in a solid sodden curtain driven in flurries by the wind which now blew in heavy gusts i ran stumbling to the door of the building and beat upon it a flash of lightning showed me two lines of writing above the lintel several coats of more recent paint had flaked away to reveal the old lettering in the next flash i was able to read it james nearne licensed to sell wines spirits and tobacco nearne james nearne it was a strange coincidence nearne wasnt such a common name nor for that matter was cripples ease a gust of wind blew a chilling sheet of rain against me i lifted the latch and threw myself against the door it was locked there was no knocker so i beat upon it with my fists but the sound of my knocking must have been lost in the roar of the storm for nobody came the water was pouring off the slates on to my neck in a steady stream i flattened myself against the door rattling at the latch the rain was seeping through to my underclothes i felt damp arid chilled in the incessant flicker of the lightning the rain showed like a dull tinplate curtain violent gusts drove it across the broken mine workings and beat it into the sodden ground i turned the collar of my jacket up and splashed my way round the walls of the house at the back a chink of light glimmered from a curtained window i sloshed through more puddles and grasped the sill the rain beat against the window washing in solid water down the panes through the chink i looked in upon a small lowceilinged room lit by lamplight the walls were of a brown glossy paint and that had peeled away in places to show a gay powderblue underneath or had disintegrated so completely with age and neglect to reveal the mouldering white of old plaster a cheerful fire blazed in a cheap victorian grate it was not the room that attracted my attention but the man seated behind a big desk near the fire he was broad in the shoulders and powerfully built his head was small and rather square the skin dark and lined with little wrinkles at the corners of his eyes and he had a moustache above a rather high lined forehead his short hair stood up almost straight this and his high cheek bones gave him the appearance of a character from grimm he was talking to somebody i could not see and at the same time counting notes from a thick wad oft the desk at his elbow was a bottle and a glass full of some yellowish liquor beside the desk against the wall stood a big safe the door of the safe was open had i known who the other occupant of the room was i should not have tapped on that window i should have stepped back into the deluging blackness and tried to find my way back to the inn one glimpse of the other occupant of that room would have told me the sort of setup i was getting mixed up with that would have been enough for me id have cleared out but i could only see the one man i could see he was talking to someone but i couldnt see who and because i was wet through and cold and this was the place dave had told me to come to i tapped on the window the man at the desk looked up his eyes had narrowed and his head was cocked a little on one side he had stopped talking and was staring straight at the window i tapped again with the tips of my nails the effect was instantaneous the man jumped to his feet swept the bundle of notes into the safe whisked the bottle in as well and closed the door he said something to the person i could not see at the same time throwing the contents of his glass into the fire which blazed violently then he stepped across to the window and pulled back the curtain our faces were about a foot apart with the streaming glass of the window panes between us his eyes were excited almost wildlooking who are you what do you want his voice was faint i want to speak to captain manack i shouted back im captain manack what do you want he sounded suspicious dave tanner sent me i said i saw him start the man seemed strung up or was it that he had been drinking can you let me in i shouted its wet out here he hesitated i fished in the pocket of my jacket and produced daves lighter holding it up for him to see dave told me to give you this i called he peered at it with a quick birdlike glance then he nodded go round the back and ill let you in he said and dropped the curtain after staring into that lamplit room the sudden darkness was indescribably black as i turned from the window a gust of rain lashed my face it seemed to beat upon my bare body so sodden had my clothes become i shivered and stood still for it was too dark for me to move then a blinding sheet of lightning showed me a line of outbuildings jutting from the house as i made for them a door opened and manack stood there with a lamp in his hand he shut the door behind me i was in a stoneflagged scullery and though it was cold i felt the instant relief from the fury of the wind and rain outside he held the lamp higher and peered at me he was quite a short man his size accentuated the breadth of his powerful shoulders his eyes glittered in the uncertain light youre not one of the crew of the isle of mull are you he said i shook my head i thought not and then why did dave send you and how is it you know his real name his voice was sharp almost a bark it expressed nervousness and excitement and the habit of command he said you had a job for me i explained im a miner he said it was a mining job oh he nodded as though that explained everything youre from italy a deserter yes he told me about you he said it quite matteroffactly as though being a deserter were a profession just arrived have you yes i said got in yesterday who brought you over mulligan i nodded too surprised to speak give me the lighter will you he said i handed it to him and then he said better come into my office theres somebody there who can check your identity he smiled to himself and led the way through into a big stoneflagged kitchen where iron pots simmered on a glowing range copper glinted warmly from the walls and a collie sheep dog lay stretched before the fire a girl looked up from her ironing as we entered she was big and strong looking and her face was flushed with the heat of the fire kitty therell be one extra for dinner he told the girl and hell be staying the night so get a room for him she gave me a quick glance it was intended to be casual im certain of that but when she saw me her eyes widened and a puzzled expression crossed her face she stared at me as she said in a low voice theres only the attic room well get that fixed up for him manack said her gaze was still fixed on me i felt embarrassed i dont know why girls often stare at me i suppose its because im more than usually big that seems to attract them it had caused me a lot of trouble in italy but somehow this was different it was as though she couldnt believe her eyes almost reluctantly it seemed she turned to my companion you know what your father said i mean about the attic room not being used i dont care what he said manack snapped if its the only room use it i was conscious of the girls gaze as i followed captain manack out into a dampchilled corridor our footsteps sounded loud on the stone floor manack set the lamp down on a table and opened a door i followed him into the room i had looked into from the window and then i stopped standing by the fire a drink in his hand was mulligan our eyes met at the same moment and he stiffened suddenly with his drink halfway to his lips and his mouth slightly open then his hand slid to his hip pocket he held it there his body tensed manack went straight over to the desk this the man you brought over from italy he asked mulligan yes mulligans eyes never left my face without looking round captain manack sat down in his chair and began unscrewing the lighter i remained standing by the door two thoughts were chasing themselves through my mind the first was that i didnt want to be mixed up with anything that mulligan was mixed up in the second was that i wanted to get back the money he had stolen from me between the desire to beat it and the desire to get my money back i stood like a dummy this fellows joining us manack said hes a miner he had the base of the lighter unscrewed now and was fishing inside it with a pin beside him lay a copy of the evening paper it was folded so that the story of the abandoned revenue cutter was uppermost i could read the headlines from where i stood he extracted a screw of paper from the lighter and smoothed it out on the desk i suddenly decided that i didnt want anything to do with this setup manack was mixed up with dave and the death of the revenue men and mulligan was in his employ hadnt i seen him paying out money to the man and mulligan was a crook a liquorrunning french bastard but by god before i left id have my money back he wouldnt get away with that with a hundred and fifty quid id be all right id get myself a passage to canada i glanced at mulligan he still had his hand on his hip pocket but he was looking at manack his mind was on the note that manack was reading in two quick strides i had him i caught him by the arms twisting them back and at the same time lifting him clear off the ground the harelip bared his blackened teeth in pain now mulligan i said hand over that money you stole from me i heard the scrape of manacks chair as he rose i backed away still holding mulligan off the ground and twisting his arms back so that he uttered a wild cry of pain then he kicked me kicked me right in the crutch the blinding pain of it bent me double i heard mulligans body hit the floor when i had eased myself sufficiently to look up he had scrambled to his feet and was backing to the window a little black beretta in his hand put that gun up mulligan what the hells the matter with you two manacks voice was sharp authoritative then i doubled up with pain again cursing mulligan through gritted teeth hands gripped me by the shoulder and pushed me gently into the armchair by the fire a hand at the back of my neck kept me bent right down the pain gradually eased and i stopped cursing i wanted to straighten up but that hand held me down it was very strong why did you go for mulligan like that manacks voice was soft almost gentle but the ring of command was still there i told him as i stared down through teardimmed eyes at the worn leather of the chair the hand released my neck and i looked up mulligan was still standing by the window he had put his gun away but his eyes were watchful and angry is that correct manack asked him mulligan shifted uneasily at the peremptory query how the divil was i to know he was going to work for ye captain he said his manner was half injured half apologetic i charge em fifty for the trip but that doesna include putting em ashore thats dangerous work and i take what i can get for it this mans a trouble maker well see about that replied manack i dont wish to make any trouble i said the pain had eased and i stood up just give me the money and ill go you dont have to go manack said then to mulligan give me that money mulligan counted the amount out from a wad of treasury notes which he took from his pocket i want to go i told manack at that he swung round oh so you want to go his eyes were grey and hard and his teeth showed in a smile beneath his moustache he went over to the desk and counted out the notes how much did you say he asked as he finished counting one hundred and fortyfive i told him he nodded thats the lot then he put the notes into an envelope stuck it down and then placed the envelope in the safe theres your money he said to me as he closed the safe door you can have it just as soon as youve finished the job you were sent here to do but he stopped me listen you he said and his voice was harsh now youre a deserter whats more youre implicated in the disappearance of four customs officials he laid a significant stress on the word disappearance his accusation took my breath away for a moment i was too surprised to speak i just stood there and stared into his hard smiling face then i found my voice thats a damned lie i said the first i knew about it was when i met dave with a bullet wound in his arm he laughed it was a quick barking sound so you know all about it eh well you go to the police and see if they believe your story the english police are rather conservative theres no amnesty for deserters in this country and the police dont eke them i use em because its convenient not because i enjoy their company you walk out of here and see what happens how did you get into the country youll say mulligan here skipper of the arisaig brought you over but did he he turned to mulligan mulligan grinned never set eyes on the man before in my life ahm no in the habit of carrying desairters in the arisaig manack turned back to me he was smiling with his eyes but not with his lips dave tanner will go to italy in the arisaig but before he goes hell leave with me a written confession the names of the crew will include yours together with a description youre too big a man to slip through a police net he suddenly smiled and his smile was friendly sorry to have to show you that im quite ruthless but its best for you to know where you send right away the job is not a long one when youve finished it you can go or stay as you please the pay is good and will be added to the rest of your money youll collect the total when the jobs done now if you go back into the kitchen the girl will show you where you feed and introduce you to the others i hesitated what the hell was i to do there were two of them they stood watching me my limbs were stiff with the pain i suddenly felt weak and humiliated it was as though i had walked into a net carefully spread for me and it had tightened about me so that i was helpless well manack snapped okay i mumbled i looked across at mulligan if i ever meet you again i said watch out for yourself okay he replied mais pour ca je ne passerai pas des nuits blanches and he laughed i turned then and left the room chapter four the room of the past i shut the door behind me and stood undecided for a moment in the passage manack was talking but his voice came to me as an unintelligible drone through the thick oak the passage was a pool of lamplight fading into dark shadows the chill of it struck through me reminding me of my wet clothes i shivered what the hell was i going to do now i could of course walk right out of the house there was nothing to stop me nothing at all except that i was a deserter i felt bitter and angry and helpless manack was dangerous far more dangerous than mulligan that talk about implicating me with the affair of the revenue cutter hed meant that those eyes of his and the wild look hed had that was nerves he was the sort of man who lived on his nerves he was like a man walking a tightrope that was it a man walking a criminal tightrope that sort would take any risk through the oak door i heard mulligans voice on a higher note then manacks voice cut in sharp and peremptory i was shivering and my teeth chattered i couldnt hear what they were saying irresolutely i set off down the passage to the kitchen id feel better with dry clothes and some food inside me the thought of food brought the juices up under my tongue i hadnt eaten all day time enough when id eaten to decide what i was going to do when i opened the kitchen door the girl was still at her ironing she looked up and smiled it was a slow friendly smile i went over to the fire the smell from the pots was good what time do you feed i asked she glanced at the alarm clock on the mantelpiece it was just after eightthirty about nine she said were late tonight ill show you your room afterwards its being got ready now have you any things no i said i had got myself right in front of the fire and my clothes were beginning to steam well im afraid you wont be able to borrow any pyjamas she was looking straight at me youre a bit larger than any of the men in this house except mr manack and he wears a nightshirt then she noticed the steam rising from my clothes youd better get your clothes dried she stripped the blanket off the ironing board here you are she said and tossed it over take them off and wrap that round you and when i hesitated she said dont worry about me im used to halfnaked men around wheal garths a pretty wet mine as i stripped off my things and hung them on the clothes horse i saw her looking at me several times curiously i felt flattered it was good to have a girl around again but then she said theres something strangely familiar about you how do you mean i asked wrapping the blanket round me and slipping out of my wet trousers i dont know she answered with a puzzled frown almost is though id seen you before ever been out of england i asked she shook her head and smiled never been out of cornwall she said then you cant have seen me before i told her this is the first time ive been back in england since i was four oh but the puzzled frown was still on her face whats your name she asked jim i said jim pr i just stopped myself in time jim odonnel im a canadian she smiled youre a deserter arent you that startled me i started to deny it but i stopped and said how did you know you have to be a deserter or a jailbird to get a job here there was a trace of bitterness in her voice and she bent over her ironing whats the racket i asked she looked up then her face stony and sullen ask captain manack she said i didnt say anything then i turned and let the glow of the fire warm my belly through the blanket a chair was set beside me and two hands took hold of my shoulders and pressed me into it her hands were still touching me as i sat down and her face was close to mine it was a nice face flushed with the heat of the fire and the lips slightly parted to show the gleam of white even teeth the lips had no makeup on but they were red i suddenly wanted to kiss them god it was ages since i had had a woman i think she sensed my urge for she drew quickly back but her eyes sparkled and i knew she wasnt angry she was a big girl but well proportioned with firm breasts that thrust at the cotton of her blouse so that i could see the outline of her nipples i looked quickly down into the hot glow of the fire i heard her go back to her ironing youve got fine shoulders she said softly youre not a miner are you yes i said you said this was the first time youd been back in england since you were four she said what were you doing over here at the age of four getting myself born i told her getting born you mean you were born over here where there was a note of excitement in her voice redruth i said then youre cornish i suppose so by birth i added cautiously my father was anyway your father was a cornishman she seemed unusually interested what about your mother she was cornish too is your mother still in canada no i replied and then for some reason i added i dont know where she is she ran off with somebody else thats why we went to canada i suddenly realised that she had stopped ironing i looked round quickly to find her leaning on the iron staring at me with her eyes wide and that puzzled expression on her face whats your name she asked i told you i said odonnel no no she said impatiently your real name at that moment the door opened and manack came in he glanced quickly from me to the girl and then back to me again i see youve made yourself at home he said and i thought there was a trace of sarcasm in his tone im getting myself dried i explained the men here have their own quarters he said the stoves not lit in there the girl put in they havent come in yet and its not worth lighting it now theyll go straight to bed if theyre to get up at the time you want them in the morning manack nodded come into my office he said to me mulligans gone i want to talk to you about the job i want done dont bother to put any clothes on if kitty can put up with you halfundressed no doubt i can i followed him along the passage to his office he shut the door better get near the fire he advised and poured me out a stiff drink take it you dont mind italian cognac im pretty used to it i said his eyes watched me as i raised my glass and drank they were steel grey and their movements were quick as though he found it a strain to look at anything for more than a few seconds his hands were long and slender and when his fingers werent drumming on the arm of his chair or running through his thick wiry hair they hung loosely from the wrist sitting there with only a blanket and a pair of pants on i felt at a disadvantage he knocked back his drink and poured himself another rotgut he said still its better than nothing if that revenue cutter hadnt butted in wed have been drinking french brandy or champagne damn em he filled my glass the liquor was warming whats your name the question came abruptly odonnel i said jim odonnel his eyes met mine with a glint of amusement irish eh he smiled funny thing you fellows always pick on irish names you seem to think it fits this sort of job theres a boy working for me here now ogrady he calls himself cockney right through to his backside he shrugged his shoulders what experience have you had of mining pretty fair i told him started working underground in the canadian rockies when i was sixteen im thirtytwo now and with the exception of four years in the army ive been working in mines all the time various goldmines in the coolgardie district of australia a short spell in malaya on tin and finally in lignite mines in north italy know anything about blasting i ought to i said you cant help knowing about it after twelve years of mining he nodded as though satisfied by my reply his fingers were drumming on the chair arm again you understand the nature of the business were engaged on it was more a statement than a question and he looked at me sharply i raised my glass i guess so i said liquor running he nodded and pulled a sheet of paper towards him across the desk suppose i tell you i dont want anything to do with it i said he swung round on me then youve no alternative he barked get that clear right from the start i wasnt joking when you were in here with mulligan youre here and youll do the job i want doing before you leave thats not the way to get good work out of a man i told him he didnt reply for a moment he just sat there staring at me those eyes of his they worried me most people when you look them in the eye you feel in touch with them you can see their mood even if you cant see what theyre thinking but not with manack his eyes told me nothing ive seen it in animals particularly dogs often as not when you cant trust a dog his eyes have a wild look they shut you out you cant see what hes feeling thats the way manacks eyes looked listen he said suddenly you come here without a friend in the world youre broke and the worlds against you do this job and you get your hundred and fortyfive quid back plus a further fifty not only that but ill fix you a passage anywhere you want to go and if i say no he nodded to the phone on the desk then ill ring the police isnt that a bit risky for you i asked but its no use trying to scare a man like manack i dont think so he said im pretty well known around this end of cornwall ive made it my business to be at worst id have to lay off a shipment or two but you stand a chance of hanging with the evidence that would pile up against you you mean id be accused of having a hand in the revenue cutter business i felt a surge of anger at the injustice of it but it was swamped by my sense of helplessness what could i do about it what the hell could i do he nodded his head slowly like a doctor agreeing with his patients worst fears well odonnel what do you say i thought i detected a derisive emphasis on the name of odonnel i shrugged my shoulders damn it why wasnt i dressed perhaps if id been dressed id have had the guts to call his bluff and walk out of the place but one glance at his face told me it wasnt bluff it wasnt that his features looked fierce or cruel it was just that it was a tense reckless face the man would do what he said how long will the job take i asked not being a miner i wouldnt know he replied it might take a week maybe two my offer is twenty pounds a week and a fiftypound bonus on completion of the job and all free of income tax he smiled it would have been a friendly pleasant smile but for those eyes okay i said my voice sounded hoarse whats the job thats more like it he said and seemed to relax his gaze wandered to the bottle another drink i finished mine at a gulp and held out my glass i needed that drink thats another thing he said as he poured it out theres no shortage of liquor in the place but i only serve it out after dark thats just so as nobody goes up to the village drunk he picked up the sheet of paper from his desk now then what i want you to do is to blow a hole in the sea bed blow a hole in the sea bed i stared at him in astonishment but he was quite serious yes he said and then added after a moments thought no point in my not telling you why since as soon as you see the layout youll be able to figure it out for yourself at the moment we bring the stuff in by boat to the main adit of wheal garth the adit empties into a big cave and weve got a large flatbottomed barge in there well that method is too dangerous weve got coastguards lookout as close as cape cornwall which is the next headland but one to the south not only that it means fine weather runs only sometimes our boats have to lie off for several days pretending to fish until the seas calm enough for the operation to be carried out he handed me the sheet of paper theres a plan of wheal garth at the hundred and twenty fathom level thats fifty feet below sea level weve dewatered the mine down to this level which is the first of the undersea levels now then see that long gallery running out under the sea he pointed it out to me on the plan a finger of ink stretching almost straight out from the coast beside it was the name mermaid that gallery is half a mile long ive had two men working on it for nearly a year deserters same as you one of them is a stone mason the other a quarry man weve straightened it out squared it off and built up a neat ledge along both sides on these ledges a carriage drawn by a hawser can run even when the gallery is full of sea water no metal rails to rust you see what i want you to do is he stopped then for the door had opened i looked round an elderly man had entered he was tall and blond with a short pointed beard and small round eyes that looked at me from beneath shaggy eyebrows i didnt know youd anybody here henry he said to manack and made as though to go his voice was soft and but for the trace of a cornish accent i would have said he was a norseman so fine a figure did he make as he stood there with the firelight glowing on his rugged bearded features just a minute father manack said this is jim odonnel hes going to work here for a bit hes a miner the old mans eyebrows lifted and there was a glitter of something like excitement in his eyes a miner is he he smiled it was a nice smile the sort of smile that seemed to warm the room well my boy he said to me its good to know therell be a miner working here at last ive been trying to persuade my son to take on miners here ever since he came back but thereve always been ah difficulties he added vaguely he turned to manack his eyes were shining this is kind of you henry he shook his head sadly pity you didnt grow up to be a miner youd have understood the possibilities of wheal garth then however ones a help a very definite help at least we can make a start now odonnel is working for me manacks voice was sharp the old mans eyebrows went up again it was a trick he had he was all tricks but i didnt know it then working for you he said and what may i ask can you be wanting a miner for you know nothing about mining he must work for me if hes a good miner then ill prove to the world that the cornish mining industry isnt dead well you may as well know about it now as later manack said im letting the sea into the mermaid gallery letting the sea in the old mans beard shot up youre mad you cant do it i wont allow it im afraid thats what im going to do manack spoke flatly as though it were all settled the old man strode across to the desk his eyes were wild and he was quivering with anger do you realise that wheal garth belongs to me yes but i provide the money replied his son calmly when i came back the mine was full of water right up to the adits its only because ive provided the money that youve got it clear of water to the hundred and twenty fathom level and if theres going to be any more money ive got to let the sea into the mermaid i tell you i wont allow it thundered the old man crashing his fist down on the desk youve no alternative was the reply manack turned to me leave us will you he said he had to repeat his request before i moved so fascinated was i by the astonishing altercation as i left the room manack senior was saying in a voice that quavered for twenty years and more henry ive lived and dreamed of nothing but this mine i knew it was rich i knew it i thought it was only rich at depth but i found the seam i found it i showed it to you the other day my god if youd only gone into the mines as i wanted you to youd understand what that seam is theres a fortune in it as i slowly closed the door i heard his son reply in a hard almost sneering voice yes but unfortunately not a taxfree one i went back to the kitchen the girl was serving food with a stocky little man at her elbow wisecracking in an accent that brought back memories of kalgoorlie he had a round cherubic face and the crown of his head was bald he was like a diminutive monk with his pot belly and round rosy cheeks blimey he said as he caught sight of me the horiginal wild man from borneo goin for a swim mate he grinned it was the widest grin id seen in years it seemed to split his chubby face open and it revealed two red lines of gums propped open by half a dozen decaying teeth you stay in or just passing through he asked hes going to work here the girl said she was halflaughing hes a miner thank gawd he said bout ruddy fed up i am o never bein sure when the roofs goin ter come in on us my names odonnel i told him jim odonnel the devil it is its oirish i am meself me names ogrady he held out his hand its grand tales well be afther telling each other man of those happy days back in oireland the girl i laughed it was a pleasant sound i thought you were australian i said by the way you were talking just now australian gor blimy thats a good one that is he said falling back into his original accent the nearest i ever got to australia was coaling a p and o boat at southampton that was back in thirtyone when the only work i could get was stevedoring come on mate he added youd better get some cloves on if youre goin to ave grub wiv us you can put em on in the mens dining hall he picked up two dishes from the table i got my clothes and allowed him the girl watched us silently i stole a quick glance at her as i left the kitchen she was watching us a hint of laughter in her eyes but as she met my gaze the laughter was overshadowed by something else and she frowned as though she were still puzzled about something we went through the cold scullery and through some old sables the floor was cobbled here and there were stalls for horses and curved iron mangers you been here long ogrady i asked better call me friar he said everybody does ogradys sort of a nom de gare same as your moniker is you aint no more irish than wot i am yes i bin ere abat a year nah gettin quite like ome he pushed open a door and led the way into a small bare room with canvas chairs set round a plain scrubbed table it was lit by a single oil lamp an anthracite stove in the corner looked dead and cold but an oil stove speckled the ceiling with its round ventilation holes the walls were thinner here and they shook under the full force of the wind the rain beat against the single curtained window in one of the canvas chairs a long cadaverousfeatured man sat playing with a knife his hands were rough and grey as though ingrained with dust he inspected me slowly out of dark eyes new bloke said friar by way of introduction a miner says is names jim odonnel this eres slim matthews slim matthews nodded whats the grub he asked friar he had a bitter discontented voice stoo and two veg friar dumped the dishes on the table there yare mate i got close to the stove and slipped into my clothes the two of them began to feed silently whos the girl in the kitchen i asked friar looked up his mouth full of food kitty trevorn he said shes the daughter of old man manacks second wife by her first marriage he means shes the old mans stepdaughter slim explained thats wot i bin tellin im aint it friar answered heatedly just because yer bin to a public school thats a larf nan aint it slim was at arrer an wots e do finishes up a ruddy stone mason if thats all eddication can do for a man reckn im just as well orf without it slim matthews said nothing he just sat slumped in his chair concentrating on his food and looking down his long nose he reminded me of some unhappy cur kicked around in the dust of an arab village street then youre the quarry man i said to friar to change the subject thats right he replied an there aint many blokes can swing a biddle like i can but im abat braned off wiv working dan there under the sea it aint natral thats wot i say it aint the way a mans supposed to work fair gives a bloke the creeps an wet as a latrine the capting says theres thirty feet of rock between us and the sea but it dont feel like that i tell yer the water streams dan the walls an most of the time we works wiv the water swurling rand our ankles still he sighed and scooped up another mouthful of stew in his spoon mustnt grumble i spose the pays good an nobody dont ask no questions an the grubs all right too they got their own farm that stew seemed about the best food id ever tasted i helped myself to more and asked what the idea was in letting the sea into the mermaid gallery he looked at me narrowly out of his small bright eyes well if the capting aint told yer mate mebbe id better keep me maf shut but you mark my words its a ruddy good idea hes got but then es clever as a monkey kitty slid you come from italy was that where you met the capting no i said a friend of mine sent me to him oh he removed a bit of meat from a back tooth with his nail wonder yer didnt hear of im at there though seems e was quite a lad mulligan do you know mulligan yes i said i come over with him in the arisaig well mulligan told me e was one of the most reckless officers in the ole of the eighth army how the hell would mulligan

asked how does he react to havin his mine opened up for liquor running he got pretty mad at his son this evening when he told him he was going to let the sea into the mermaid gallery oh you dont want

blue murder fer the capting an theres ell ter pay the ol gents yellin an screamin an the capting sharp and cool like i thought the ol man was goin right off his he suddenly stopped the announcers voice had mentioned a name that brought me up with a jolt the isle of mull out all day searching for the missing ship the police are also making inquiries about david jones captain and owner of the isle of mull so far no report has been received of any ship having sighted the isle of mull after the time at which it is believed the revenue cutter may have intercepted her penzance police and customs officials have reason to believe that the isle of mull was engaged in running cargoes of wines and spirits into the country the revenue cutter was sent out on wednesday to intercept the isle of mull since then no trace of the crew of four has been found though the cutter itself was discovered abandoned on a lonely stretch of beach not far from penzance this morning scotland yard admitted in an interview that considerable quantities of liquor were being smuggled into this country and they have reason to believe that it may be coming in through cornwall and other areas of the southwest cor chase me up a gum tree muttered friar is the isle of mull one of captain manacks ships i asked more to see what hed say than anything else he glanced at me sharply his face drained of all blood looked grey and his fat little cheeks seemed to have fallen he no longer looked genial there was a mean look in his eyes as though he were scared he didnt say anything and when slim came back with a bottle of cognac he sat drinking in silence whats upset our chum slim asked me when i told him about the isle of mull he smiled sardonically but he didnt say anything he seemed withdrawn into his own thoughts shortly afterwards friar and slim went out they took the bottle with them left to myself i realised i was very tired i got up and went through into the kitchen an old women was sitting by the fire i asked her to show me my room she led the way out into the corridor at the foot of the stairs she stopped and stood aside the master she whispered the old man was coming down the stairs a lamp in his hand it shone on his beard and his eyes glittered in his ruddy face ah odonnel he said just the man i wanted to see come into my study a minute will you i hesitated he went straight on along the corridor oblivious of my hesitation i followed him he was waiting for me at a door at the end of the passage with a strangely oldworld courtesy he stood aside to let me go in i found myself in a small and incredibly untidy room furnished largely in mahogany there were microscopes and scales and other laboratory equipment all mixed up with a litter of books papers and drawings he sat down in a worn leathercovered horsehair chair by the fire ive something i want to show you he said he had a mysterious air and the gleam of his eyes was even more noticeable so that i thought he had been drinking he went over to a cupboard and brought out a chunk of dullgrey rock my son tells me youre an experienced tinner my boy he said coming towards me with the lump of rock in his hand tell me what you think of this he placed the rock in my hand it was about the size of a mans head and incredibly heavy i saw at once that it wasnt rock at all it was ore practically solid ore well he asked and there was excitement and impatience in his voice its tin i said from a mother lode by the look of it he nodded and smiled a secretive little smile that crinkled the corners of his mouth where his beard was grey yes he said mother tin and what would you say if i told you there was a seam of it in wheal garth extending from the hundred and twenty level straight down to the sixteen hundred level id say you were a very rich man i said yes he nodded his head several times murmuring yes each time im a rich man im a very rich man he took the lump of ore and held it in his hands as though it was his very heart be held beating there against his roughened palms im fabulously rich ive hit a scovan lode a mother lode about the richest in the history of cornish mining then he suddenly jerked his body erect and flung the lump of ore crashing to the floorboards and my son damn his eyes my son doesnt see it he cant understand he put both his hands up to his head and beat his skull with his clenched fists how can i make him see it he asked swinging suddenly round on me listen my boy all my life ive worked for this for nearly thirty years nothing else mattered i worked in wheal garth when i was a boy i saw that ore i saw it with my own eyes and no one else saw it they all missed it i became a shareholder i got more shares they closed the mine i bought em out wheal garth belongs to me all that tin and now my son doesnt understand hes going to let the sea into the mermaid and hes got you here to do it youre the man whos going to wreck my whole life he suddenly took me by the shoulders his face was so near to mine that his beard touched my chin you cant do it do you understand you mustnt do it ill ill he took his hands quickly from my shoulders he was trembling all over he picked up the ore and fondled it as though it were a child i felt sorry for him i could understand his rage and frustration suppose i had struck lucky out there in the coolgardie and then been unable to get capital to develop but he could get capital surely he could float a company anybody would back a mine that yielded tin like that i suggested this but he rounded on me no he cried no never wheal garth belongs to me ill develop it myself or ill leave it to rot down there under the sea perhaps he wasnt sure of himself are you sure it goes right down i asked no he said of course im not sure how can any one be sure in mining all i know is that i saw this lode when i was a boy down at the sixteen level and only a week ago i found a similar lode at a hundred and twenty fathoms that proves nothing but here look at this he threw the lump of ore on to a chair and seized hold of a big diagram when they opened up the botallack mine they found as many as ten floors of tin each floor separated by floors of country little more than three foot thick they were horizontal beginning with the bunny now then look at this its a geological map he spread the diagram out on the arm of my chair theres botallack theres wheal garth almost next door and come lucky see how the strata goes along the coast its horizontal but look at it out here under the sea it suddenly folds up from being horizontal it dips at an angle of nearly fifty degrees when i first met that lode at the sixteen level i was in a gallery that ran a mile out under the sea the mermaid is only half a mile out i cant be sure but it seems reasonable to suppose that the lode in the mermaid is the upper end of the lode at the sixteen level this diagrams accurate i suppose i said he nodded it was the result of information pooled by the mine captains of botallack wheal garth and come lucky in thats when all three mines were working and making money he sighed and rolled up the diagram im glad you understand ive nobody to discuss it with here if only you were my son he fell to pacing the room combing his beard with his fingers i must stop him letting the sea into the mermaid if he does that it will cost so much more to work that lode he suddenly turned to me i suppose he has some sort of hold on you he has on most men who come here but you could leave this country couldnt you how much would you take to leave the country ill let you have fifty pounds more than hes going to give you how much will you take his voice was eager it was incredible how childish was his trust i said he would only get another miner no he said no its not so easy as that hes been wanting one for a year but he couldnt find anyone er suitable and soon hell get bored with this business of running liquor its excitement not money he likes then hell go away and leave me in peace to develop the mermaid look ill give you fifty pounds more than hes giving you and then when i start work you shall come back and ill make you bal captain well start in a small way at first and well gradually build up the lode will pay for development as we go well start from nothing and build the greatest mine in cornish history his eyes had a faraway look he was in a dream world of his own this i thought was the real cornish adventurer the men my father had talked about whod start from small beginnings and build and build and build almost he fired my imagination i who had seen the great mines of the rockies and malaya well he asked what do you say boay the cornish accent had become more pronounced in his excitement i said ill let you know tomorrow sir i was thinking that this was my way out with money in my pocket i could surely be out of the country before manack could get the police on my track i didnt trust captain manack i didnt trust the setup the police were on the track of this racket it would only be a question of time before they raided the place could you give me cash i asked he nodded i have a little money put by how much he owes me a hundred and fortyfive of my own which mulligan stole from me and for the work he offered me twenty quid a week and a fifty pound bonus when id completed the job call it twofifty very well he held out his hand thats kind of you my boy and i shall not forget let me know where you go finally when i start developing then ill let you know and if you want the job you can come over thats a promise i left him then he was standing by the fire the lump of ore in his hands and his fine bearded head bent in thought it was as though all his existence were in that great lump of tin i remembered the fierce light in his eyes as he told me how he had worked to gain control of the mine he was a terrible and pathetic figure i went along the cold damp corridor to the kitchen the girl was there sitting by the fire her chin resting on her hands her bare arms were red with the glow of the fire she looked up startled as i entered the old woman was making porridge the girl stared at me for a second her lips parted then she got to her feet and hurried out into the scullery as though intent on some household task i called out to her she stopped looking at me nervously as though held there by something about me that fascinated her will you show me to my room please i said no her voice sounded abrupt and harsh then as though to cover her abruptness she added i i must see about the milk it may turn sour in this storm she turned to the old woman who had stopped stirring the porridge mrs brynd show mr odonnel to the atticroom that slight hesitation i dont know why but it worried me the old womans face wrinkled up in a leathery smile do a yourself she said then she glanced up at me and i saw a flicker of some expression in her eyes i cant describe it all i know is that it was hostile the girl hesitated i couldnt see it but i knew she was trembling like a horse that is afraid to take a jump all right she said heavily ill show you she picked up the lamp and led the way out into the corridor leaving the old woman stirring her porridge she mounted the stairs slowly almost reluctantly the lamplight threw her shadow grotesquely on the walls of the old staircase the wind beat against the window at the top of the stairs we went down a narrow landing with peeling walls and then up a narrow uncarpeted staircase there was a door at the top with a queer little hatch cut in it she hesitated half turned and looked down at me as though to say something she raised the lamp slightly it seemed to me that she raised it in order to see me better then she turned quickly and opened the door the room was bare and close under the roof the rain beat on the stone tiles above our heads and the wind howled in the chimney the dormer window was uncurtained it was fitted with stout iron bars she lit a candle on the washstand ill leave you now she said but halfway to the door she stopped again i was aware that she was trembling she seemed to be trying to say something her eyes looked frightened and unhappy in the hot light of the lamp suddenly it burst from her startling and abrupt your names pryce jim pryce isnt it the way she said it i cant describe how it jarred on me it wasnt only that her voice was brittle and harsh it had fear and hatred and oh it was just horrible your fathers name is robert pryce i nodded is he alive she asked no i said she seemed to shiver then she turned quickly and without shutting the door behind her ran down the steep staircase i heard her footsteps hurrying away into the silent depths of the house as though she feared to look over her shoulder i went slowly to bed wondering how she knew my name for a time the peculiar behaviour of the girl excluded every other thought from my mind but then i began to notice the room i dont know what there was about the room i know now of course but i didnt then it was such a bare miserable little place and there were the iron bars across the window and that strange little natch in the door it was somehow the way i imagine a prison cell looks i lay in bed and tired though i was it was some time before i put the candle out even then i could not sleep i lay there in the dark listening to the sounds of the storm and thinking over the strange events of the day sometimes the wind would be no more than a whimper in the eaves then it would come roaring against the house beating at the walls till they shook to their foundations it would come like a wall of water flung at the tiny barred window it would ramp and whine and the rain would beat at the glass like a shower of gravel then it would die away to a whimper again so that i could hear the solid sound of the breakers thundering against the granite cliffs and every now and then a flicker of distant lightning would show me the room and in the sudden darkness that followed id hear the grumble of the thunder away towards the scillies i must have gone to sleep at last perhaps i had only just dozed off perhaps i had been asleep for hours i dont know all i know is that i was suddenly wide awake and instantly conscious of the room god how that room wanted to talk to me i was trembling and sweating then in a flicker of lightning i saw the door opening it was the click of the latch that had awakened me my body tensed expecting god knows what whos that i asked my voice sounded hoarse and unnatural its me a voice whispered back a match flared in the dark and was instantly extinguished as a gust of wind crashed against the window another match was struck and a candle flame wavered uncertainly it was kitty she stood there for an instant the candle trembling in her hand she had a dark dressinggown over her nightie and her feet were bare her eyes had a wild look and she clutched an envelope to her breast she didnt say anything she just stood there looking down at me it was as though she didnt trust herself to speak i sat up leaning on one elbow why have you come i asked she found her voice then but it was strange and husky because i promised was what she said because you promised promised who i asked your mother her voice sounded small and sad in that strange room i didnt want to she added quickly but id promised she moved forward it was a timid movement there she said take it she thrust the envelope into my hand then with sudden relief in her voice ive done what i said i would ill go now she turned towards the door but i caught her dressinggown dont go i said what was my mother doing here you knew her what happened no her voice trembled dont ask me anything let me go please you have the letter now thats all i promised to do let me go i tell you her voice was frightened now she struggled but i had her by the wrist sit down i said i was determined not to let her go there were so many questions i needed answered how did you know who i was it it was the way you held your head when you asked a question that and your eyes youve got her eyes you knew her then she nodded now let me go her voice trembled again no i said what was my mother doing here she suddenly fought to free her wrist from my grasp what was my mother doing here i repeated and she cried out at the pressure of my hand on her wrist for a moment she fought to free herself then suddenly she relaxed and sat limply down on the edge of the bed i felt her trembling all over she was all wrought up the candle was spilling hot grease on to her fingers she reached out and set it down on the table by the bed now i said will you please tell me what my mother was doing here she gave a sob i looked up at her she was staring at the little hatch cut in the door she wasnt crying she was fighting for breath i waited at last she said in a strangled voice she was she was mr manacks housekeeper the housekeeper in a flash friars words came back to me and the words of the landlord up at the inn at botallack and the name of the licensee above the door at cripples ease i looked down at the envelope in my hand it was addressed to robert pryce or his son jim pryce the ink was faded and the writing shaky as though it had been written by someone very old or someone labouring under great emotion when did she give you this i asked a long time ago her voice was little more than a whisper before the war nine years ago it must be it was just before she hesitated just before her death she whispered how did she die i asked i felt her body stiffen she did not answer i gripped her wrist angrily how did she die i repeated she she went over the cliffs her voice was flat she spoke like a person in a trance i felt suddenly as though all the breath had been knocked out of me and yet this wasnt half the horror of it why i asked she looked down at me then her eyes were wide and staring so might macbeth have looked on banquos ghost all sorts of terrible thoughts ran through my mind why i cried out why did she do it read the letter she said she was panting for breath read the letter then let me go i came to give you the letter that was all that was what i had to do dont you understand i dont want to answer your questions i dont want to think about it how long before her death did she give you this letter i asked i dont know i cant remember an hour maybe two or three i dont remember my god i breathed then it was suicide she nodded slowly i ripped open the envelope then inside was a single sheet of the same spidery writing it trembled in my hand as i leaned forward to read it in the dim flicker of the candle it was headed in my room th october in my room not cripples ease botallack cornwall just in my room as though that were all her world kitty leaned forward and picked up the candle holding it over the letter for me it guttered in the draught from the window and the grease spilled across her fingers and dripped on to the bedclothes i had let go of her wrist and it was only afterwards that i realised that she could have left the room then why she didnt i dont quite know curiosity perhaps the letter had been in her possession all those years but id rather say it was her sympathy her sense of my need of her company as i read the last thoughts of a woman going out to kill herself on the rocks of botallack head a woman who had once gone through the labour of bringing me into the world i have the letter on the desk beside me as i write that and the old faded photograph and a brooch she gave to kitty theyre all i possess of my mother ill not attempt to describe my feelings as i read that letter here it is read it and judge for yourself how i felt my darling bob yes you are still that all these years the memory of you has been like a light shining in the darkness of my life pray god you found happiness i found none the thought of you and jim and all the kindness and the love i left it has been very bitter they say i am not responsible for my actions now but please believe me bob at this moment my mind is very clear i love you and i have never loved anyone else they have shut me away in this room the windows are barred it is more than a year i think since i walked on the headland i cannot even see my little garden from here but today today he has forgotten to lock the door my mind is made up i am going up to the headland for the last time i shall give this letter to kitty together with the little brooch you bought me in penzance that day we went over to the mount by boat it is all that i have left of you poor child i grew very fond of her but she is afraid of me now since her mother died tell jim i love him he will not remember his mother but tell him she never forgot him oh bob i have paid dearly for my folly please please do not think too hardly of me i am going now if this letter ever reaches you do not fret at my passing all i ask of you is that you will remember only that i love you both your unhappy ruth i sat for a long time staring down at the faded writing whilst the candle guttered in kittys hand so much was hinted at so much was left unanswered i felt dazed and there was a lump in my throat at last i looked up and in a flicker of lightning saw the bars of the window etched black against the storm this was my mothers room wasnt it she nodded i looked down at the letter again i must have sat staring at it for quite a time i came out of my daze to find the girl tugging to pull her wrist free of my hand she was shivering violently the palm of my hand was moist on her flesh and my body was bathed in a cold sweat i must go she whispered frantically no i said and then i added quickly i cant sleep here not in my mothers room you must she said itd look queer if you didnt i cant the way i said it sounded like a groan i was afraid shed go away and leave me i didnt want to be left alone she was fond of you wasnt she i said i dont know she replied i thought so but i was frightened she looked at me so queerly sometimes but she was kind to me before before what i asked she hesitated then she said before my mother was killed i thrust the letter at her read it i said no she answered quickly no i dont want to read it i repeated but she stood up wrenching at her arm no she said her breasts were heaving in agitation how perverse are a mans reactions in that moment of all moments my mind could wander to admiration of her breasts as she stooped to free her wrist from my grip the candle fell to the floor flared for an instant and then extinguished itself in the darkness i heard the skin of her bare feet on the floorboards then the door opened and closed and i was left alone in the darkness of that room a flicker of faroff lightning showed me the sloping ceiling and the washstand like a lone sentinel against the crude flower pattern of the wallpaper the bars of the window leapt into sight with the lightning then darkness again and i lay there cold and numb with my mothers letter in my hand chapter five the mermaid gallery when i woke it was light i got out of bed and went over to the window a grey mist was swirling up from the sea blotting out everything but the tumbled ruin of the mine buildings that stood like wraiths amid the debris of the mine it was on this scene of desolation that my mother had looked for a whole year the bars and the mist no wonder she had been driven to suicide i shuddered and turning to get my clothes saw her letter crumpled among the blankets of the bed i picked it up and hurried into my clothes i wanted to get out of that room i wanted to get away from cripples ease and yet there were so many questions to be answered why had she been shut away up here they say i am not responsible for my actions now was she really mad it was a horrible thought as horrible as the girls dread of saying anything what was it that friar had said my mind shied from the thought of it and i went down the bare staircase into the silent house it was a quarter past eight by the grandfather clock in the hall the girl was not in the kitchen the old woman looked up at me curiously over a plate of porridge i went through the scullery and the stables to the mens quarters the room was empty and cold i looked through the door beyond it contained two army pattern iron beds the bed clothes were flung back there was nobody there i went out into the yard the mist blanketed everything deadening the sound of my boots on the cobbles it was dank and chill i went round to the front of the house to do this i found myself crossing that little waste of choked hydrangeas and foxgloves and i stood still for a moment surveying the wreckage of the garden my mother had created i glanced up quickly at the grey watchful house and then remembered that she had not been able to see her garden her window was round the front it caught my eye as soon as i turned the corner as though it had been waiting for me to appear it was a little dormer window high up in the slope of the roof its dim eye was disfigured by the iron bars i could picture my mothers white forlorn face peering down hour after hour day after day the mist swirled lifted and showed me the black granite of botallack head across the mine workings then it closed down again in a damp veil i went on past the front door then i stopped and went back to gaze up at the faded lettering that showed through the flaking paint above the lintel nearne that had been her maiden name james nearne might be her father she might have named me after her father the old lettering fascinated me but at length i was interrupted by the sound of voices they were muffled and distant yet when i turned i could see the short round figure of friar already emerging from the mist and quite close to me he was coming up the track from the mine workings and he was followed by the taller figure of slim matthews you have been working already i asked yep friar replied since ruddy alf past five an a fat lot o good it done us the bleeding trucks aint turned up what trucks i asked never you mind he answered but the bastards shoulda bin ere at six his face looked tired and was filmed with a grey dust we had breakfast then nobody spoke during the meal friar and slim seemed lost in their own thoughts at length i said when will i be able to have a look at the mine dunno friar replied the captings gorn ter penzance ter see abat the trucks it wont do any good slim said quietly theyve got scared an wot abat us friar snapped do they fink were goin ter sit on the ruddy stuff till its all blown over im for dumpin it into the sea you tell that to the captain slim said with a hard laugh well i reckon its abat time we packed it in were runnin our bleedin necks into a noose slim peered at him down his nose and there was a look of contempt in his eyes maybe he said but suppose we do pack it in then were on the run again stay and the whole thing may blow over thats all right for you friar answered you only got a two year stretch ahead o you if youre caught i aint only a deserter i got about three other charges against me includin resistin arrest an woundin a copper i dont want ter get caught his voice was almost a whine id get five years at least five years is a hell of a long time youd better talk to manack about it not ruddy likely if i clear at itll be quiet like an in my own time an dont you tell the capting wot i bin sayin hed be sore as hell if e thort i were runnin

the yard heres manack now slim said maybe hell have news well i bet it aint good news through the window i saw a big oldfashioned bentley tourer draw up close to the back of the house captain manack in riding breeches with a yellow polonecked sweater under his brown sports coat got out and came straight over to the outbuildings he had a newspaper in his hand a moment later he walked into the room his thick wiry hair stood up on end and his eyes looked quickly from one to the other of us as he shut the door the trucks arent coming he said scared asked slim manack nodded and thats not all he added you may as well know the worst whilst you are about it and he flung the newspaper down amongst the breakfast things staring at me from the centre of the front page was a picture of dave tanner it was headed wanted for murder underneath in black type was the caption david jones owner and skipper of the ketch isle of mull whose real name is dave tanner is wanted by the police in connection with the disappearance of the crew of the revenue cutter found abandoned near penzance yesterday morning the four revenue officials who manned the cutter are now thought to have been murdered one of tanners girlfriends sylvia coran of harbour terrace penzance has told the police that tanner returned at about eight pm on wednesday he had a bullet wound in the arm he left almost immediately with jim pryce a friend who had just arrived from italy i looked up manack was pacing backwards and forwards running his long fingers through his hair he suddenly rounded on the three of us damn all welshmen and their vanity he said savagely if hed been content with just one woman it would have been all right but the girl was in love with him and when the police proved to her that hed been keeping one of those artist women over at lamorna cove she told them what she knew pray god he never mentioned cripples ease to her theyre on to you too he said to me theres a full description of you on the inside page pretty accurate too anybody see you in the village last night yes i said i went into the pub up there for a drink you didnt tell em you were coming down here did you he noticed my hesitation immediately oh my god he said and i suppose you told them your real name no i said i asked where cripples ease was i i said i wanted to see you thats a pretty hot trail youve laid his voice was grim who was there any visitors no i told him they all looked like locals well well just have to hope they dont bother much about the papers theyre pretty slow about putting two and two together in this village but george wetheral the landlord hes got his wits about him hell remember you damn and blast what are you going to do asked slim he lingered over the words as though enjoying the situation do there was an excited gleam in manacks eyes this is what were going to do well wall the arisaigs cargo up for a start by tonight therell not be a trace of our activities in the whole of wheal garth pryce youll get right ahead with breaching the mermaid gallery and youll live underground well fix you with a bed in a dugout down the mine its quite dry there its our bolt hole concealed entrance and everything before you leave i want the mermaid operating as an underwater passageway to connect up with shipping what abat the ardmore friar asked shes doo in on sunday or monday ill look after that manack answered in the meantime we run no more cargoes until the undersea route is open youre working on kerb stones if anyone asks you understand both of you and if the police come around and ask for your identity cards and ration books tell em ive got them you neednt worry they cant touch you wot abat the ol man friar asked suppose the police start questioning im hell not talk about anything but the mine he never does he looked at slim and friar you two get to work walling up that cargo the sooner thats done the safer itll be if the police come round with a search warrant then he turned to me you get shaved now pryce as soon as youre ready ill take you down to the mermaid gallery and when ive done the job i asked youll leave for italy on the arisaig ill hold her until youve finished but i dont want to go back to italy i said youll go where youre sent his voice was brisk and confident you ought to be grateful to me for getting you out of this mess damn him he knew i had no choice what abat dave friar asked he goes on the arisaig too an good riddance thats wot i says friar suddenly looked up blimey theres that load o stuff for the arisaig coming in today or tomorrow what abat that its not coming any more questions all right then get that cargo stowed okay friar got slowly to his feet but i dont like it i tell yer straight i dont he grumbled then he suddenly asked wot appened to the rest of the isle o mulls crew mason fergis and pentlin you dont need to worry about them manack said they were all on board the isle of mull when she blew up friar scowled did yer ave ter kill the ole bleedin lot manack glared at him come on slim well get that cargo stowed friar said hurriedly they went out leaving me alone with manack he was pacing up and down i sat there trying to make up my mind what to do every instinct told me to get out of the place the sooner i was away from cripples ease the safer id be but something stronger tugged at me the bars on that window the name james nearne over the door the letter in my pocket manack suddenly stopped his pacing and faced me well i looked at him but i didnt say anything i hadnt made up my mind he picked up the paper and opened it at an inside page read that he said i looked down at the type it was a description of myself a very powerfully built man broad shoulders height about ft ins slouching walk dark complexion blue eyes thick brown hair starting low on the forehead when last seen pryce was wearing seamans clothes dark blue serge jacket and trousers dark blue jersey he had no hat and may be carrying a light khaki raincoat several sizes too small for him the girl had certainly given them a pretty accurate description still not want to go to italy manacks voice was sarcastic i looked up i dont need to tell you he added that on that description youd be picked up in no time if you left here he suddenly sat down in the chair opposite me listen pryce i run these cargoes into the mine at the moment in a barge propelled by an electric motor its a sort of submarine barge and lies submerged when not in use we bring it to the surface with compressed air before going out to pick up a cargo ill show you when we go down its not a bad device but its too dangerous it means my boats have to lie off for good weather and now that this has happened i darent risk it any more the mermaid gallery runs out just on half a mile i plan to blow the end of it so that cargoes can be lowered on buoyed guide wires down into the gallery theyll come into the mine by a hawserdrawn wooden carriage running on the rock ledges it may work or it may not if it does then it means that my boats can unload in any weather im not running any more cargoes by the old method i tell you that so that youll know just how determined i am for the blasting of the mermaid gallery to be done now ive got all the equipment you need including compressor and pneumatic drills he paused watching my face why dont you want to go back to italy he asked i shrugged my shoulders i was working in the lignite mines it was all right at first i wasnt getting shot at and the italians respected me but later well lignite mining isnt my line and then again i dont like working with italians its all right if youre the boss but if they feel theyve got you by the shorts well much more of their sneers and id have been involved in fights and italians dont fight the way men do in the gold mines he smiled parlate italiano he asked suddenly si si i answered molto bene he nodded benone he leaned forward look pryce you seem a reasonably honest and dependable sort of fellow ive got an estate in italy its a big vineyard in the mountains behind naples near benevento i know i said thats where the strega comes from thats right its not far from albertis thats where mulligans cargoes are coming from we ship out things like lighter flints contraceptives government surplus watches rubber tyres and so on things that fetch a high price out there with the proceeds mulligan brings back stuff like chianti kummel triple sec and strega the rest of the cargo is made up of cognac which is what my estate specialises in now then what i need is an agent out there to look after my interests it doesnt need any detailed knowledge all i want is someone there on the estate to whom i can send instructions and know that they will be carried out a man wholl keep an eye on things generally for me what about dave i asked he shook his head no he said daves a crook i need somebody honest ive other plans for dave im going to open up trade between italy and greece mulligans already got me a fairsized schooner its now being refitted at ischia well he said what about it its a fair offer suppose i say no he laughed you wont he said then he got up well the sooner you get to work the sooner youll be out of the country and safe and ill see that mulligan doesnt rob you on the way out get yourself shaved youll find a razor in their sleeping quarters when youre ready ill be in my office he left me and i sat there looking at nothing in particular seeing the parched earth and brown hills of italy christ how tired i was of the sun and the dust and the flies i sat there and cursed mulligan for taking that money from my belt if id had money id never have gone to see tanner id have been on my way to canada now and in canada id have found my self respect i got up heavily and went into the bedroom there was a glass above the washstand i peered at myself my eyes seemed sunk in black rings of strain and the two days growth of stubble completed the picture of villainy i got myself a razor and went through into the kitchen for hot water the girl was there on her own she looked frantically round as i entered as though seeking a way of escape then her gaze came back to me and remained fixed as though fascinated what do you want she asked some hot water i replied and the instant relief in her face was obvious as she drew the water off from the tap i said why was my mother shut up in that room she didnt answer so i repeated the question did they think her mad i asked she handed me the jug the steam rose clouding her eyes as she faced me did they i insisted please she said i took the jug and put it down on the table was it because of what happened to your mother i asked she turned as though to run out of the room but i caught her by the shoulders was it i repeated i could feel her trembling just as she had done when she came to my room was it my fingers were digging into her flesh she cried out but i didnt care i had to know then slowly she nodded what happened i cried tell me what happened i still had hold of her and she began to struggle then the door opened and the old woman came in i let kitty go and picked up the jug the old woman smiled i went back to the mens quarters then as i scraped at the stubble of my beard i fell to thinking of my mother again and suddenly i knew i just had to find out the truth of what had happened in those years before the war when kittys mother had been killed and my mother had been shut up in that horrible attic room i finished shaving and went out into the yard and round to the front door when i entered captain manacks office the safe door was open and he was feeding papers into the fire wont be a minute pryce he said just checking through things in case he gave me a quick secretive smile i honestly believed the man enjoyed the situation have a drink he said a tumbler of cognac stood beside him on the desk he pushed a bottle with an italian label across the desk to me pity to waste it he added but we cant leave any of it around now theres a tumbler on the mantelpiece i helped myself and sat thinking about the girl and the house and the whole incredible setup whilst manack went through his safe one thing i noticed as i sat there the stack of notes from which he had paid mulligan was gone there was no money in the safe not even my hundred and fortyfive pounds at last he stood up and closed the safe okay he said we finished the bottle between us and then went out into the damp blanket of the mist as we left the house i glanced back at it over my shoulder the little ironbarred window seemed to be watching us the panes opaque with the white light of the mist and at a lower window i caught a glimpse of the old man staring out at us his bearded face thrust close to the panes there was something very intense about that face at the window it made me realise that i and his son were going to destroy what he had spent thirty years to achieve and hed offered me two hundred and fifty pounds to clear out the house suddenly seemed to recede and become a ghostly outline of a building then it disappeared swallowed up in the mist it was as though there had never been a house there as though it were all a nightmare the air was still and heavy and cold beyond the muffled drumming of the sea against the cliffs i heard the distant moaning of the fog signal at pendeen watch away to the north of us captain manack led the way down a slippery path where black slugs crawled and bracken stalks stood gaunt and brown between great heaps of broken mine debris we passed an old engine house its chimney thrusting a broken brick finger into the swirl of white vapour great stone arches were all that was left of the old blowing houses and here and there a coagulated mass of rotting iron marked the grave of onceactive machinery there were old shafts surrounded by circular stone walls and great concrete pits all broken by frost where the tin had been washed the mist thinned as we went down towards the cliff top from white it turned to gold it was little more than a thin veil of moisture between us and the sun the iridescence of it strained the eyes we joined a rough track the tyre treads of heavy trucks had made deep ruts in the mud between the patches of broken stone the track led us to a huddle of stonebuilt sheds with galvanised iron roofs manack took us into the nearest it was full of tools and stores in a corner was a small forge for resharpening drills he took down an overall and handed it to me try that he said you and my father are about the same size theres a pair of his gum boots over there youll need them the mines pretty wet they fitted reasonably well and when we had equipped ourselves in overalls gum boots and miners helmets and had primed our lamps he led me across to the largest shed which housed the hoist there were wide doors to this shed and the marks of trucks ran right up to the cage we back the lorries in here so that nobody can see what were loading he explained i think he really enjoyed showing someone the way they worked the gig was not there he rang a bell if nobody answers then it means that the gigs not in use he told me if youre using it and somebody rings you must answer its ring theres a bellpush inside the gig there was no answer to his ring and he pulled over a large lever deep down the shaft i heard the sound of water and an instant later the clatter of the gig coming up its a pretty rickety contraption he said worked by a water wheel push the lever over that way and the gig goes down this way and it comes up all very heath robinson but it works my father wont use it prefers the ladders the gigs slow but its got plenty of power and thats what we need for the stuff we have to bring up in it where do you get the water to drive it i asked come lucky its full of water adits blocked no outlet to the sea like there is in wheal garth bit dangerous isnt it standing right over you like that he shrugged his shoulders and grinned maybe he got a kick out of working down there with a million tons of water towering above him in the flooded mine next door but then he wasnt a miner in this sort of country honeycombed with old workings how did he know what thickness of rock stood between him and the water in come lucky the thought of it made my blood i run cold the cage came up and we got in inside was a similar lever to the one outside he threw it over and in a moment we began to sink slowly into the ground at intervals black gaps showed in the circular walls of the shaft marking the entrance to the old galleries he stopped when we had gone fifty or sixty feet down the gates opened on to a gallery rather larger than the others i had seen what level is this i asked as we stepped out it isnt really a level at all we use it as a store room our lamps shone on dry granite walls a few yards down the gallery he stopped this is where youll live now he was pointing to the rock wall where i asked he peered down as though looking for a mark then he pressed against the rock a slab pivoted inwards i pressed against the lower slab that pivoted too an example of slims stone masonry he grinned inside was a rock chamber about twenty feet by twelve there were three iron bedsteads an elsan lavatory tin wash bowls cases of tinned food its ventilated and the slabs bolt on the inside he added he pivoted the slabs back into place and we went on the gallery had various crosscuts and winzes leading off it he shone his lamp into a raise which rose steeply thats the way to the surface he said you can only go up in the gig if its standing at the gallery quite soon the gallery opened out into a big chamber it was stacked with cases this is the storeroom he said liquor i asked he pointed to the label on the nearest case and his teeth showed beneath his moustache in a grin it was marked in italian aranci oranges cognac he said then come on well go down now friar and slim will be bringing the remaining cases up from the adit as we went down in the hoist i was very conscious of the growing sound of water it was not only the water driving the hoist wheels it was the steady persistent trickle everywhere the walls of the shaft glittered with it green waterweed lined the slimy circular surface of the rock in places water was actually gushing out from crevices the wooden frame in which the gig ran was green at the bottom we stepped out into a broad gallery down which ran an ankledeep stream of water the air was damp and a cold draught brought with it the sound of the sea this is the main adit manack said as we sloshed down it towards the boom and suck of the sea i could feel the sharp ridge of rails below the water mens voices came to us on the salt wind and a moment later the gleam of their lamps showed round a bend as they approached friars voice called out that you capting yes manack called back they were dragging an iron trolley the sound of its wheels on the rails filled the gallery as they came up with us only a couple more cases friar said peraps youll come up then and see to the sealing up of the stores im just taking pryce down to the end of the mermaid manack answered ill be right back okay well have the other two cases up by then we stood aside to let the trolley with its load of two cases pass the sound of it dwindled in a hollow rumble as the light of their lamps disappeared round a bend the sound of the sea became louder as we descended the sloping tunnel the dank saltladen air grew colder round another bend we came suddenly on a patch of daylight a cold grey light that was barely strong enough to reveal the black slimestreaked walls one of the old shafts manack said as we paused looking up a sloping cleft in the wet rock green halfrotten ladders were pegged to the rock snaking up through the gloom to the bright light that filtered down from above the rock cleft sloped so many ways that it was impossible to see the top this is the way my father comes into the mine sometimes he uses the gig but not often personally i wouldnt trust myself on those ladders theyve been there since before the war the shaft is part of the really early workings of the mine its not shown on any of the plans and was only discovered after after a nasty accident you mean when mrs manack was killed was this the shaft he looked at me quickly his face looked pale in the grey halflight yes he said you know about that i nodded friar told me i said friar talks too much he stared up the shaftshe was my stepmother i only met her once a pretty little woman they had to put ladders down to get her up her body was about halfway down my father explored and opened up the rest of the shaft later you wouldnt think a man would prefer the shaft where his wife was killed to the hoist would you now its almost as though he dares the shaft to kill him too he gave a harsh laugh and turned away as i followed him down towards the growing sound of the sea i said your father is very interested in the mine isnt he interested hes mad about it he eats sleeps and dreams wheal garth he thinks of nothing else worked in it when he was a kid swore hed own it one day now he does every single share except what the girl kitty owns that must have riled him he laughed the sound of it echoed against the walls of the adit the woman who was killed in that shaft was her mother a few weeks before her death harriet manack made a fresh will leaving everything she possessed which was mostly worthless holdings in wheal garth to kitty or thats the story my father never talks about it i said your mother had holdings in wheal garth didnt she the beam of his lamp shone on me how did you know that he asked i didnt i answered i was just guessing a man whose sole interest is the acquisition of a mine might be expected to marry into a family that had holdings yes he said youre quite right my mothers father was one of the original adventurers he had quite a big shareholding i hesitated a question was on the tip of my tongue but it stuck in my throat it was too direct i twisted it round another way i suppose you hold an interest in wheal garth from your mother no he answered she left it all to the old man again that harsh laugh she was hardly likely to leave it to me at the age of fourteen i ran away from school went to south africa worked as a mechanic in a garage opened up a tractor business selling and delivering to rhodesian farms did a bit of engineering i was a sad disappointment to them they both wanted me to become a miner you see i dont suppose id written to my mother for a year at the time she died and i was the only child she died in just after id got to south africa i was fifteen then after six years in south africa i went to south america trading in machinery along the western seaboard then i went to mexico fooling around in oil i was in persia trying to outsmart the arabs when war broke out the sea was very loud now but i scarcely noticed it i was thinking that if his mother died in she must have still been alive when my mother went off with manack senior the question that had stuck in my throat before came out suddenly how did your mother die i asked he turned and the beam of his lamp glared in my eyes pneumonia he said then in that hard quick voice of his what made you ask that i just wondered thats all i mumbled he went on then all down the adit we had passed old galleries leading off on either side some of them so narrow that a man could scarcely squeeze his body through others little more than boles through which a man would have to crawl on hands and knees but at a bend a wider gallery ran off to the right and as i shone my lamp into the gaping blackness i caught a glimpse of the top of a ladder poking up through a hole in the floor the rhythmic thump and suck of a pumping engine sounded above the muffled thunder of the waves in the mouth of the adit that leads down to the mermaid captain manack said theres a pump worked by a water wheel farther along that gallery it clears the mine to a depth of twentythree fathoms below sea level youll see the water running into the adit later a pale glimmer of daylight showed round the next bend and in a moment we entered what looked like a large natural cave the marks on the rock walls however showed that it had been hewn by hand the cave was halffilled with water which slopped and heaved against the rocks as though seeking a way of escape the sound of it was magnified by the rock walls so that it was scarcely possible to speak every now and then the shaft of daylight that came in through the narrow entrance of the cave was blocked as a wave heaved up and crowded into the cleft sometimes the sea spilled through in a white froth of surf and then the wind would whip a blinding sheet of spray across the cavern two packing cases stood on a flat ledge of rock which ran along one side of the water like a small landing stage on the other side of the cave a stream of ochrecoloured water poured out of a hole presumably the water pumped up from the lower levels the entrance is quite wide below the surface of the water manack shouted to me wheres the barge i asked he pointed into the tumbled water down there he yelled he went out on to the ledge by the cases and thrust his hand down into the water he brought up a rubber pipe shes fitted with tanks he called out to me theyre full of water at the moment we empty them by compressed air he dropped the pipe back and shone his torch into a recess there were half a dozen compressed air cylinders stacked there we take her out submerged the only thing above water is the man at the helm neat eh but it requires pretty calm weather he went back up the adit to the shaft that led down to the mermaid you see now why i want the mermaid gallery opened up that submerged barge is all right but its cumbersome and too dependent on the weather we had reached the shaft and he led the way down the rhythmic sound of the pump was louder even than the rumble of the sea in the cavern as we reached the bottom he said take my advice and just keep to the main adit this shaft and the mermaid gallery dont go exploring the other workings god knows when the mine was first opened up it was way back in the seventies father knows his way around but hes the only one and he admits that in all the years hes been here he doesnt know the whole mine its an absolute rabbit warren the seaward side of the main shaft has most of the really old workings there are dozens of ways out on to the cliffs they used to tunnel in for the ore the cliff face looks like a cave dwellers settlement in sicily inland from the main shaft the mine squeezes itself between botallack and come lucky its more recent than the old cliff workings but its still pretty old and the galleries have collapsed in places i shant go exploring i said i was thinking of all that water lying above us in come lucky maybe not he said but i thought id just warn you youre a miner i know but i dont imagine the mines in the rockies are honeycombed like these old cornish mines they certainly are not i said we were climbing up a narrow sloping tunnel that twisted and turned as they had won the ore from the granite country that enclosed it on either side in places the roof slanted up beyond the beam of my lamp the remains of the timber used for sloping still clung in rotten beams to the rock in other places the roof came down sharply and we had to bend almost double then suddenly we clambered over a shelf of rock and dropped into a much wider gallery that sloped gently captain manack stopped here and caught my arm this is the upper end of the mermaid he said it runs direct from the main shaft its almost dead straight from the shaft to where it stops half a mile under the sea and it slopes up all the way so that at the shaft its above sea level see here look at this he directed his lamp on to the sides of the gallery this is what friar and slim have been working at for over a year the sides of the gallery had been worked so that on either side there was a smoothtopped ledge the work was recent down the centre of the gallery two steel cables rested in the sludge weve built those ledges right the way out to the seaward end of the mermaid manack said most places we were able to hew it out of the rock for the gallery is a pretty uniform width only occasionally we had to build it up his face under the glare of the lamp on his helmet was full of enthusiasm he must have been the sort of small boy who was always blowing himself up with fireworks i take it theres some sort of a truck going to run on these ledges i said its already running he replied its wood and galvanised iron with rubber tyred wheels and large sprung ballbearings to hold it steady against the rock walls the cables there run on to a winch come on well go and have a look at the end of it seems a hell of a lot of labour i said and you dont know really whether itll work or not itll work all right he said it may now i said but it may not work when you break through the bed of the sea and the water comes roaring in thats your job he said the gallery had levelled out and the walls were wetter i guessed we must be under the sea now you say youve had plenty of experience of blasting have you had any experience of blasting into the house of water sure i said but then i knew the amount of country id got to go through before i got to the water and id some idea of the weight of the water too blasting through the bed of the sea is a different matter ive got all the data you need he said ive been over it with azdic i know the exact depth of the sea above the blasting point and i know the exact depth below sea level of the end of the mermaid ill explain in more detail when we get there ive got scaffolding up and everything i wanted my father to do it for me hes an experienced miner but he wouldnt blast him id almost persuaded him to about a month ago and in fact he did some preliminary blasting that was how he struck the seam he was looking for that finished it he wouldnt dream of having the sea let into the mermaid after that well its a pretty rich lode i pointed out he showed you a sample did he yes and if that lode goes right down to the sixteen level as he believes youd both of you be pretty rich men he laughed father doesnt realise how much labour and machinery cost these days that is when you can get them hes just on sixtyfive you know and his brains getting a little well he gets excited and hes not very realistic itd mean floating a company the control would pass out of his hands and he wouldnt stand for that by the way pryce hell try to stop you from doing this job i dont know just how hell try but he will if he gets too troublesome let me know itll mean a row but i always get my own way in the end he said it with the hint of a chuckle as though he got some devilish enjoyment out of rowing with his father i thought of the two hundred and fifty pounds the elder manack had offered me and the face at the window watching us go down to the mine we were splashing through nearly six inches of water now occasionally i felt the outline of the cable through my gum boots the gallery was very quiet here the distant sound of pumping was muffled and distorted so that it was like the steady beat of some giants heart cripples ease seemed remote and far away we were in a world of our own we were rag worms burrowing under the sea it aint natural thats what friar had said id never worked under the sea before to keep my mind off the weight of water above our heads i began thinking again of cripples ease the ghostly effect of the house fading away into the mist that picture of it was indelibly imprinted on my mind that and the little barred window it all seemed so unreal has cripples ease been in your family long i put the question to him more for something to say than out of any real curiosity father moved there in the early twenties he replied i dont know much about it id left by then some woman hed taken up with gave it to him her father died and left it to her together with a holding in wheal garth you can see the name over the front door james nearne he was landlord when the place was still a pub he caught my arm here we are he said he bent his head so that his lamp lit the floor of the gallery it dropped away into a great pit beyond the pit the gallery continued for perhaps ten feet and then stopped in the blank wall at the end was fixed a great galvanised iron block round the wheel of which ran the cable we had been following there was water at the bottom of the pit it lay like a still black sheet some fifteen feet below us its surface rippled by falling drops scaffolding spanned the hole and was built up into a shaft cut vertically in the roof of the gallery ladders climbed the scaffolding and disappeared in the black funnel of the shaft weve cleared about ten feet of that shaft by blasting manack told me i reckon theres about another fifteen feet to go didnt dare go on without an expert after each blow we cleared the rock in the final blow im banking on all the loose rock falling down there he indicated the pit the weight of the water may carry rock into the gallery i said i wouldnt like to say whatd happen when the sea breaks in here ive thought of that he said my idea is this you work up as near to the sea as you can when you darent go any farther you fix your main explosives in watertight cartridges then you run a long drill through put a small charge in and let the sea seep into the mermaid when the whole gallery is filled right up then we blow the main charges by electric detonators okay suppose the entrance gets jammed by rock then ill go down in a diving suit dont worry about it thatll be my problem what youve got to do is get to work on that shaft there and remember the sooner you get the job done the sooner youll be safe aboard the arisaig you take a look round now im going back to the main shaft to see how friars getting on i must remind him to get those compressed air cylinders up to the store room ill be back inside half an hour then maybe youll be able to tell me how long the job is going to take and what your plan of operation is all right i said ill have a look round i watched his lamp bobbing along the gallery it was surprising how straight that mermaid gallery was the levels of most cornish mines twist and turn as theyfollow the sea it was only later that i learned that the mermaid was a development gallery they had been looking for just what manack had found as the glimmer of captain manacks lamp faded to a faroff pinpoint of light i became very conscious of the sound of water all round me the regular heartbeats of the pump were just a faint throb a sound so slight that it might have been the pressure of blood in my ears dominating everything the only definite sound was the sound of the water it trickled it gurgled it went plop plop plop in the pool at the bottom of the pit i suppose it drained through to the lower levels for there wasnt any more than a few inches on the gallery floor and it had to go somewhere i thought of all those levels sixteen of them thrusting out under the sea and this was the top the roof of the mermaid gallery was the bed of the sea it bore the whole weight of the water it felt chill and dank the trouble was i didnt yet feel at home in the mine it was different to any id been in before and when things are different thats when a miner worries whilst i had been standing there listening to the sounds of the water the light of manacks lamp had disappeared altogether he must have reached the end of the gallery and turned up to the adit i swung myself on to the ladders and climbed the scaffolding the shaft they had blasted was roughly circular and about ten feet in diameter it coincided with the pit in the floor of the gallery the ledges on which the carriage wheels would run must be a good eight feet apart that gave plenty of room for the rubble from the breach in the sea bed to fall straight into the pit i climbed until i reached the end of the shaft for amateurs theyd done a pretty neat job theyd kept the shape of the shaft though it was a bit ragged at the edges i felt the rock above my head it was wet and in the light of my lamp i saw what looked like a shrimp scuttle into a crevice the sides of the shaft streamed with water i wondered whether manacks calculations were right the rock had a peculiar feel about it as though it was part of the sea bed it wasnt that it was soft and yet thats the way it felt it was granite all right with streaks of basalt but the surface of it was slimed over i climbed down and had a look at the pit there was a ladder running down into it as i peered down a change in the rock caught my eye there were some tools on the lower platform of the scaffolding i went down into the pit with a hammer and a cold chisel it was about fifteen feet down to the water the rock formation that had attracted my attention was across the other side i put my gum boot down into the water it was only a foot deep i waded across sudden excitement surged through me as i examined that dull rock i got to work with hammer and chisel all other thoughts were swept from my mind i knew i was not making any discovery the elder manack had found it first but god if youve ever been a tinner to chisel out almost solid ore like that after about a quarter of an hours work i was streaming with sweat and my blood was thudding through my veins for the air was not good down there but i didnt care i held in my hand a piece of mother tin about the size of my fist and i had chiselled it out myself i cleaned it on the sleeve of my overalls and peered at it turning the jet of my lamp full on in order to see it better gold or tin what did it matter the ore content was such that the man who worked the seam couldnt help but become rich if this were australia now i could have staked out a claim somewhere near manacks i stood there dreaming with the ore in my hand until a voice suddenly said so you have found the lode eh the beam of a lamp flashed on me from above i looked up i could see nothing but the glaring disc of a miners lamp now you understand why the gallery must not be flooded the voice added and i knew then that it was the old man well what have you decided he asked i didnt know what to say perhaps he took my silence for acquiescence for he said you shall have your two hundred and fifty pounds and when i start to work that lode you shall be one of my bal captains he stared up at the scaffolding standing there above me on the edge of the pit he looked a magnificent figure of a man if his helmet could have sprouted horns he would have looked like the old prints i had seen of the vikings my son is a fool he said he doesnt know when he is rich this will not work and if it does sooner or later hell be caught then what good will it have done to have let the sea into the mermaid before we could work that lode this gallery would have to be sealed off the mine would have to be dewatered to the two hundred level and the lode located there men are blind when they dont understand all he knows about is machinery he leaned towards me again come on up my boy you shall have your money and then you can go i found my voice then no i said im not going he peered down you mean you intend to stay here and blast your way through to the sea as my son wants his voice quavered i dont know i said but i cant go why his tone was tense i waded across to the ladder i was at a disadvantage down here with him standing above me i couldnt have it out with him like this i began to climb my lamp flashed on his gum boots he was standing right at the head of the ladder why he asked again and the echo of his question was flung back by the dripping walls because i said theres too much i need to find out and i heaved myself out of the pit and leapt to my feet we stood there facing each other seeing the reflection of our mine lamps in each others eyes you mean about my son he asked no i said he caught hold of my arm for a man of sixtyfive he was immensely strong the grip of his fingers was like iron listen he said ive found what ive been looking for all my life neither you nor anybody not even my son is going to rob me of that take my offer and go before it is too late no i said again dont be a fool he cried take it and get out if you dont he stopped and halfturned the light of another lamp was shining on us take what it was captain manacks voice the question was strung tight like a bow string we must have been so lost in our altercation that we had not noticed him coming along the gallery i have told him that i will not allow the sea to be let in here his father said i have offered to pay him what you would pay him if he will go and what will you pay him with sneered his son with my money oh no he stays until hes finished the job you intend to go through with this plan the old mans voice quavered yes his son replied then sir i must order you off my property the old man had a strange dignity i have no alternative he added sadly though it is hard for me to say this to my own son your own property captain manack laughed i know how you got this property if you want me to leave wheal garth then youll have to get the police to shift me and you wont do that will you father the old mans eyes glittered dangerously take care he said one day youll push me too far get rid of this man thats all i ask get rid of him and let the mermaid be thats all you ask his son laughed have you read this mornings paper you know i never read the papers this is my world im not interested in any other well to begin with pryce cant leave the police are after him theres a complete description he stopped then for he realised that the old man wasnt listening to him he was staring at me a look at once incredulous and fearful then suddenly his eyes were blank giving no clue to his thoughts i thought you said his name was odonnel he said to his son yes but his real names pryce jim pryce i said the old man was trembling he turned and stared at me pryce did you say yes i answered and then i added slowly ruth nearne was my mother his eyes jerked wide and his whole body tensed he was like a man under the impact of a bullet no he said no no its impossible his eyes darted round the rock walls then he recovered himself so youre ruth nearnes son she was a fine woman a fine woman he nodded in a fatherly way she often spoke of you the calmness of his manner roused me how would you know i snarled she was alone you took her away from my father and then you deserted her i went towards him you killed her you drove her to suicide the old man was watching me his eyes had a cunning look he edged away down the gallery captain manack got hold of my arm i flung him off i was within a few feet of the old man now i said you think id help you to work this mine knowing what i do of the way you treated my mother no i shouted instead ill blast a way through to the sea for you ill flood the place all your life youve thought of nothing but that damned lode of tin well youll never touch it youll never touch it because of what you did to ruth nearne when the sea comes roaring into this gallery thatll be the end of your dreams then itll be your turn to walk over the cliffs the old man was trembling dont do it he said dont do it the mine wants to be worked it has the pride of a rich mine it must be worked and if you try to let the sea in itll kill you ive warned my son now im warning you the mine will kill you he turned then and went quickly off down the gallery and i let him go chapter six the dog was murdered too so ruth nearne was your mother i was gazing after the old man the glowworm light of his lamp was already some distance down the gallery yes i said i was thinking of all the misery he had brought my mother is that why you came here i turned to captain manack he was watching me suspiciously no i said i didnt know it was your father she went off with not until last night what did you find out last night that he never married her that she acted as his housekeeper and that she committed suicide is that all you found out my god i cried isnt that enough your father drove my mother mad he kept her shut up in that attic room where i slept to leave a husband and a child and then find her lover married not only that but when your mother died he still didnt marry her she remained here as housekeeper and he married kittys mother god it was enough to send any woman mad he shrugged his shoulders well its a strange world he said his eyes seemed to laugh at me or perhaps it was some trick of the carbon gaslight it was almost as though he relished the situation if so he had the devils own sense of humour i felt angry and bitter and frustrated i should have thrashed that fiendish old man it was what he deserved instead id let him walk away down the gallery telling me my mother was a fine woman i could still see the yellow glow of his lamp bobbing along the gallery well its done now manack said theres nothing you can do about it but its a strange coincidence you coming here like this yes i said its a strange coincidence how long will it take you to blast through to the sea bed his voice was suddenly matter of fact a day or two i replied vaguely i hadnt given it a thought well go back now he said you can start this afternoon ill need help i told him you can have friar okay we started back down the gallery then nothing i could do about it he was right there id get the job done as quickly as possible and then go back to italy id be able to forget about cripples ease in italy back at the main shaft whilst we were waiting for the gig to come down manack said well run the air compressor and drill out to the mermaid immediately after lunch ive got about half a dozen sharp drills ill have slim resharpen the rest ill need an extra long drill when we get near the sea bed i told him he nodded ill get one he said ill borrow one from wheal geevor tomorrow we didnt go straight to the surface but stopped off at the storeroom gallery slim and friar had practically completed the job of walling up the stores in half an hour it was done when it had been covered with muck and dust it looked like solid rock slim knew his job as a stone mason they knocked off for lunch then manack stopped me as we went along the gallery to the shaft you feed here he said he pushed back the slabs that formed the entrance to the hideout youll find iron rations in those boxes ill have milk and bread and other things brought down to you its not safe for you to feed up at the house now okay i nodded no harm in my coming up for a breath now and then i suppose youll have to but keep your eyes skinned he left me then and went down the short gallery to the gig as it rattled upwards and their feet disappeared i was overcome with a sense of loneliness id never been so lonely in all my life i heard the gig stop and the door opened the sound of their voices died away all sound ceased it was deathly quiet the drip of water in the shaft was no more than an echo in the stillness in the hideout i found spare lamps carbide electric torches clothes a clock and a radio i prised open one of the boxes corned beef canned tomatoes sardines biscuits vitawheat canned salads apricots jam syrup butter knives spoons forks even a can opener i took some bully and biscuits and went up the narrow sloping gallery that led to the surface this gallery climbed steeply and came out at the bottom of a short shaft the circle of light at the top was blue and the sun was shining on one half of the protecting wall there was no ladder to show that it was used but stone footholds had been placed so that it was easy to climb up the rock wall i blinked as i climbed over the stone wall into a patch of gorse the mist had gone the sky was blue the light hurt my eyes i switched off my lamp and looked about me i was about fifty yards inland from the main shaft of wheal garth there was no one in sight the world was very quiet and still but it was a live stillness not the deathly stillness underground a corncrake chattered in a patch of scrub and there was the hum of bees in the blazing gold of the gorse bushes the chaos of the mine workings which had looked so grim in the mist now blended pleasantly into the landscape of wild cliffs and grass green headlands the debris of rock which had before looked grey was now a mass of colour from dark purple to russet brown the workings sloped away in a riot of dark colour to the cliff tops and beyond the cliff tops was the sea calm and blue and shimmering with light i climbed up to a slight knoll and lay down in the warm heather to eat my lunch cripples ease was hidden beyond the rise of the hill but i could see the track that wound down from it through the ruined mine buildings and beyond was botallack head there was a farm on the top of it and down the near side of it were remains of the mine an old chimney stood out against the shadowed darkness of the cliffs halfway down and right at the foot almost in the break of the waves an engine house stood on a slab of rock it looked like an aged fort there were others strung along the cliff top to my left out towards the headland known as kenidjack castle three i counted square and solid with thick granite walls and broken chimneys of warm red brick rising from one corner a girls voice hallooed it was far away towards botallack head i turned rustling the dry bells of the heather a lizard scuttled into a crevice of a rock it was a moment before i could pick the girl out she was almost at the foot of the head standing on the slab of rock on which the old engine house stood her hair was blonde and she wore a red shirt and white shorts and she was waving in the distance she looked infinitely attractive infinitely desirable a mans voice called in answer and i saw his figure scrambling down the rocky path to join her i lay back and closed my eyes how nice to be on holiday how nice to be on holiday down there with a girl id never realised how beautiful cornwall could be my father had always said it was the most beautiful spot on earth but when id arrived id thought it bleak and grim i opened my eyes again the boy and girl were climbing up a narrow path to the top of the cliffs i watched them disappear over the top of the headland i closed my eyes again the shimmer of the sea was very bright but the sun hadnt the hard glare of the italian sun it was somehow soft and iridescent and the country was green and pleasant not burnt an arid brown when i looked about me again a figure was coming over the brow of the hill that hid cripples ease i sat up it was a girl she was not coming down the track but striking across the heather above the mine she was walking straight towards me taking the direct route from cripples ease to the shaft of wheal garth it was kitty she was wearing a brown skirt and a green jersey her legs were bare and brown and her hair was blowing in the wind i turned over on to my elbow and watched her as she came towards me across the heather she had a basket in her hand and she was gazing out across the sea she moved carelessly and with ease as though shed walked these cliff tops all her life i wondered if she too were glad to be out of that house fifty yards from me she turned down the slope towards wheal garth she didnt notice me in the heather soon i could see into the basket it contained milk and bread and several packages are you looking for me i asked she stopped and glanced quickly round oh she said seeing me looking down at her you startled me captain manack asked me to bring these things down to you she held up the basket ill leave the basket here one of the men can bring it back when they come up this evening she set the basket down i brought it straight down because i thought you might need bread for lunch those biscuits must be awfully dry the milks fresh too she started back the way she had come dont go i said come up here and sit with me for a moment no no i must get back why i asked i ive a lot to do she stood irresolute her face clouded if youve got so much to do i said why didnt you let slim or friar bring the basket down ive told you she answered quickly i thought you might need some bread for your lunch she started up the slope kitty i said dont go please i want to talk to you no she said i thought youd be down the mine i didnt expect to find you here she was hurrying up the slope i got to my feet well if you wont come and talk to me ill have to come and talk to you i said go back to the mine she said you oughtnt to be out here in the open i caught up with her please i said i must talk to you she stopped and faced me suddenly she was panting and her cheeks were flushed will you have some sense if youre seen out here youll be recognised at once anybody would recognise you from that description oh you know about that i said i can read she answered now be sensible and go back to the mine besides the milk will spoil out there in the sun do you know everything that goes on here i asked enough to know you shouldnt be standing out here in the open like this why the hell dont you leave cripples ease i said its no place for a girl like you have you always been here she nodded yes always she said didnt you go to school no then how did you learn to read she laughed at that and then suddenly her laughter died your mother taught me she answered my mother she nodded she was almost my governess you see mummy was a rather gay person she hadnt much time for me poor dear i was a little girl in pigtails then she gave a quick laugh and turned i must go now she said no i said not yet its about my mother i want to talk to you i know but id rather not i caught her hand and pulled her round cant you understand i said i never knew my mother and now suddenly im in the place where she lived you knew her she loved you isnt it natural for me to want to hear about her and i want to know why she was shut in that room i dont want to talk about it her voice was angry and she wrenched at her hand let me go i tell you i wont talk about it and i want to know why she committed suicide i added holding her by the hand i can guess but i want to know her eyes widened you can guess she repeated of course i said my mother ran away with manack in and manack was still living with his first wife then even when she died he didnt marry her he married your mother and my mother went on living here acting as housekeeper and as your governess my god thats enough to break any woman it wasnt that she said slowly then suddenly she pulled her hand free im going back now i caught up with her she turned on me then her eyes blazing will you let me be she cried her voice was shrill frightened not until youve told all there is to tell about my mother i cried never she answered then ill stay with you until you do i told her angrily she loved you she gave you that brooch it was the only thing of my fathers she had left i have nothing of hers nothing at all and you who have everything of hers that i as her child ought to have had you havent the decency to talk to me about her for a few minutes it isnt that she said and her voice was sad what is it then i asked cant you realise that id rather not talk about her cant you just leave it at that no i cant i said angrily please she pleaded for gods sake i said catching her by the shoulders now come on i shook her why was my mother shut in that room her grey eyes were full of tears no she sobbed i cant i mustnt i shook her violently then she looked up at me the tears were trickling out of her wide eyes for a moment she seemed unable to find her voice then she said in a whisper that i could scarcely hear dont you see she killed my mother i dont believe it i said please let me go now she was sobbing quietly no i said i dont believe it youre not telling me the truth why should she do a thing like that she loved you she said so in that letter perhaps she said her voice was suddenly sad she was very sweet she used to bring me out here on the hills and tell me fairy stories and teach me the names of the flowers and birds i loved her very much and then her voice trembled and broke oh god it was horrible she sobbed i sat her gently on the heather what was horrible i said you may as well know now she said quietly she wasnt responsible for what she did im sure of that but afterwards i was always frightened of her afterwards you mean she was mad i asked she nodded i didnt want you to know but i had to give you that letter id promised to do that if ever i got the chance i had to give it to you didnt i of course i said please tell me all that happened id rather know everything i know its painful to you but please you do understand she nodded slowly but she didnt speak for a moment she sat looking out across the sea i sat on the heather beside her trying to see in the profile of her face the little girl in pigtails who had wandered handinhand with my mother across these cliff tops she must have been a pretty child she was pretty now she had a broad open face with high cheek bones and a short stubby nose it was the sort of face that made me think of a chekov play perhaps she also had her dreams of a moscow she was always just arranging to visit but never did i was four years old when mummy and i came to live at cripples ease she said i remember your mother miss nearne she called herself didnt like me at first and i didnt like her probably she resented us and though i didnt know why then i must have sensed that resentment and then one day i fell inside one of those old engine houses it was that one out there by kenidjack castle id been chasing a lizard i cut my knee and couldnt get out theres a sort of well where the boiler used to be it was quite deep with sheer stone sides i cried and cried but nobody came i thought nobody ever would mummy was always out somewhere and there was only miss nearne it was dark when she found me she took me back and bandaged my knee and then she told me a fairy story to stop me from being frightened any more but long before shed finished id fallen asleep so of course the next night i wanted to hear the rest of the story and after that she always told me a fairy story at bedtime and she started taking me for walks and telling me little stories about the animals and birds we saw she told me about the piskies and the miners whod worked these cliffs she looked at me and her eyes were sad you see we were both lonely and she knew such a lot of things yes i said she was a school teacher before she married my father she nodded and looked out towards the sea again i know and she used to tell me about her little boy who was a few years older than me she talked a lot about you she made up stories about you she lived in a dreamworld of her own and she let me share it and i loved it soon she began teaching me properly i went everywhere with her i helped her with the milking and with that little garden she made i tried to keep it tidy after her death as a sort of memory for the kindness she had shown me but there was the war and i had so little time now im afraid itll never be a garden again i wish it had never happened she added with sudden passion why did she stay on here i asked i mean after the old man married your mother i dont know was it because of you because she was lonely and all the love that she had lost was concentrated on you perhaps she said slowly she treated me as though i were her own child at first it was all right whilst mummy had her own car and was having a gay time but then during the depression i think she must have lost a lot of money she sold the car and began to be at home much more thats when the rows started mummy had to occupy her mind with something and she suddenly remembered she had a child but i was always with miss nearne i think she became jealous anyway when they started to have rows i im afraid i took mummys side you see i was growing up then i was less dependent on miss nearne and just beginning to be interested in the outer world mummy was always nicely dressed and her conversation was of people real people mostly men im afraid i saw less of miss nearne then and more of mummy and miss nearne gradually drew into herself she turned to me again im sorry she said i suppose in a way it was my fault but i was only a kid i didnt understand how people feel she seemed to hesitate so i said how long did this go on before your mother died several years it was on a tuesday i cant remember the exact date but it was on a tuesday in october the year before the war mummy was going to send me away to school miss nearne objected there was a terrible scene mummy called her frightful names and then my stepfather came in and stopped them that was after lunch miss nearne went up to her room and stayed there my stepfather took her tea up to her himself that evening mummy went out for a long walk with her dog peter he was an old labrador she was very fond of him shortly afterwards miss nearne went out too i remember her going out i was in the kitchen and she went past me without a word her face very white and strained i watched her going down towards the cliffs i watched her because i was trying to make up my mind whether to run after her and talk to her you see i was to go away to school it had all been decided that afternoon and i felt sorry at leaving her her voice dropped oh how i wish i had gone after her she paused and then went on an old shepherd we had then found her about an hour later out on the cliffs he brought her back in a state of collapse they took her up to her room she was very ill and could remember nothing mummy never came back they were out searching for her all night they found her next morning she was at the bottom of an old shaft that was halfhidden in brambles that one down there she pointed to a circular stone wall beyond the main shaft of wheal garth the wall wasnt there then nobody knew about the shaft i dont believe my stepfather knew about it and he knew every gallery of the mine even in those days who found your mother i asked a miner shed never have been found if it hadnt been for the dog howling peter died when they tried to bring him up his back was broken the man who found her said the dog must have fallen down the shaft and shed tried to get to him the coroner took the same view at the inquest then it was an accident i said she shook her head slowly no it wasnt an accident that morning after they found mummys body miss nearne was sitting with me in the kitchen she was terribly upset she always felt everything very deeply if it was only a sheep falling over the cliff mr manack came into the kitchen he didnt seem to notice me he looked straight at miss nearne and said does this belong to you it was a handkerchief she took it saw her initials and said yes where did you find it he said just by the shaft where harriet was killed then he ordered her to her room shortly afterwards i heard him going up i was terribly puzzled morbidly curious if you like i followed him the door was ajar i could hear what he said from the bottom of the stairs and what did he say i asked as she hesitated he said i knew youd done it even before i found the handkerchief there was no other explanation the dog would never have fallen down that shaft he knew them all and harriet always kept to the paths shed never have pushed her way through that gorse unless someone had called her down that rabbit track he told her then that she was not responsible for her actions but what about the dog i asked mr manack found mummy long before the miner did he found her when he first went to look for her he found her because peter was standing over the shaft whining good god i said then yes he threw the dog down the shaft there had to be a reason for mummy going along that track peter was the only reason he could think of how horrible i murmured yes she said he was a lovely dog he used to bring me baby rabbits hed bring them back in his mouth alive and quite unhurt but it saved your mother and after that she hesitated and then added quickly after that the bars were put in the attic window you see she couldnt remember where shed been or what shed been doing whilst she was out there on the cliffs she was very ill for a long time i was staring out across the cliffs but i didnt see the sea i didnt see anything only that bare little room with the bars across the window and the hatch cut in the door i was cold despite the warmth of the sun and when i did notice the sea shimmering like gold it seemed a mockery in this wretched place but was she really mad i asked i couldnt believe it im afraid so she replied sadly loneliness does queer things to people i know what loneliness is loneliness unbalanced her she had fits of rages when she broke things sometimes she didnt remember what shed done for perhaps a day or even more she suddenly put her hand on my arm im sorry to have told you all this i didnt want to thats why i tried to avoid you but i couldnt you see she told me so much about you and i was very fond of her when i was little please just remember that she was a good kind person but things went wrong with her life and well it was too much for her we sat quite silent then i tried to think of something to say but i couldnt the whole story was so fantastic so horrible i wanted to be by myself i wanted to think it all out the milk will spoil out there in the sun i muttered getting to my feet yes she said the milk will spoil i left her then and went slowly down across the rustling heather i stopped by the basket and looked back kittys figure was outlined against the blue of the sky as she climbed towards cripples ease i was sorry i had let her go then i would like to have gone on talking to her about other things i needed someone to talk to the sound of voices made me turn the girl in the red shirt and white shorts was coming back along the cliff top she was holding her boy friends hand and the sound of her laughter came to me on the light breeze i went into the hoist shed and so back to the hideout the light thrown by the inchlong jet of my lamp was very dim after the sunlight but the gloomy rock walls and the dim light were better suited to my thoughts than the brilliant glare of a beautiful september day i sat down on the bare springs of one of the beds and cursed cripples ease as i had heard my father curse the place so many years ago i was awakened from my reverie by the sound of knocking against the slabs of the entrance a voice called muffled and faint i got up and shot back the bolt i couldnt remember having bolted it but apparently i had the stone slabs swung back and friar poked his head in blimey like chokey aint it he grinned still it aint got iron bars its seein the daylight through iron bars wot used ter get me dan you ready we got to load the compressor slims gorn on dan yes im ready i said we went up into the blue sunlight and down to the mine sheds as we waited for the gig to come up i said wheres captain manack es still up at the hase be dan later es avin a ra wiv the ol man proper set to theyre avin we got into the gig and began to descend whats the row about i asked same ol thing the ol man dont want the mermaid flooded friar laughed but the captingll get is way e always does in the end reckn es got somefink on the ol man must ave otherwise is father wouldnt stand for is monkeyin arand wiv the mine the way e does there aint no luv lost between them two i went in after lunch ter find at wot the capting wanted doin blimey i could ear em at each others froats before i opened the door an when i went in there was the ol man white wiv rage an quiverin actoolly quiverin we had passed the main adit level and the gig stopped of its own accord at the next gallery the shaft went on down but i could see that this was as far as the gig went the place was full of the noise of rushing water in a cleft behind the shaft i could see a big water wheel revolving slowly a lamp shone towards us lighting up the arched rock walls of the gallery that you friar it was slims voice yep friar answered mind the cable he said to me as we went forward the cable was taut at about waist height a dark bulk showed in silhouette against the light of slims lamp it was a flat platform of wood about six feet wide its wheels resting on the rock ledges on either side of the gallery as we drew nearer i saw there was an air compressor standing just in front of it two planks were upended against the strange carriage is this the top of the mermaid gallery i asked friar thats right mate he answered an were goin ter ride at ter work in style this ere is known as the basket why the basket i asked lumme he said you wouldnt need ter ask that question if youd worked as long as slim and me as ter get the thing workin a bleedin year we bin cuttin them ledges an youd better go careful when you blast yer way up to the sea bed cos if this ere contraption dont work when the mermaids been flooded me an slimll ave a word ter say ter you wont we slim you know my view slims voice answered bleedin pessimist you are friar said fifty quids the bet an dont you forget it he turned to me me an slims got a bet of fifty quid on the basket e says the captings scheme wont work when the seas in the mermaid i says it will the captings no fool slim you dont know im as well as i do es an engineer an dont yer forget it even engineers get hoist with their own petard wot the ell are you talkin abat wots a petard a mine slim answered with a sardonic laugh come on he added lets get the compressor loaded on to the basket levering with crowbars we manoeuvred the compressor on to the platform of the carriage better check that we got every fink on that you need friar suggested i flashed my lamp over the platform there was a pneumatic drill steel drills air pipe drillholder picks and shovels what about charges i asked the capting as em was the reply okay i said right up you get then i climbed up beside the compressor any more for the skylark friar grinned and clambered up behind me slim went up the gallery to the bottom of the shaft he threw over a lever there was the sound of a gear engaging and i sensed the cable ahead of us sucking out of the mud an instant later i was nearly jerked off my feet as the contraption began to move forward the compressor swayed as the rubbertyred wheels moved over the uneven surfaces of the ledges the sprung bearings at the sides grated and clattered against the rock sides of the gallery its worked by the same wheel wot runs the hoist friar shouted in my ear i nodded it was impossible to talk the gallery sloped steadily downwards opening out before us to the extent of the beam of our lamps the carriage swayed and clattered and yet considering that it was not on rails but on rock ledges it ran remarkably smoothly the gallery began to level out water splashed on my hands and face from the roof and lay in dark pools that reflected the light of our lamps were under the sea now friar yelled in my ear i nodded but i wasnt thinking any more about the weight of water over our heads i was becoming accustomed to the mine and my thoughts were engrossed in the ingenuity of captain manacks idea when he had first told me that he was letting the sea into the gallery in order to provide an undersea route for contraband to be brought into the mine i must admit i thought the whole idea quite fantastic but now i was beginning to realise that it wasnt quite so fantastic as it seemed only rather unorthodox the use of caves for smuggling whether natural or hewn by hand is as old as the hills it had not surprised me therefore to find the underground workings of an old mine being used in this way but an undersea entrance with the contraband dropped over the side on wire slides on to an underwater truck that was an entirely novel idea true the whole contraption with its hawserdrawn carriage and rock ledge rails was crude but then so much of mining is crude the carriage slowed up as the scaffolding at the end of the gallery came into view it stopped directly beneath the shaft that had been begun in the roof well wotjer fink of it mate friar asked in the sudden silence okay i said reckn itll work yes i said i think it will he nodded and his cheeks cracked in a grin itd ruddy better he said moren a year we bin cuttin they ledges an just over twentythree undred kerb stones we made outa the rock we cut so for gawds sake be careful when yer blast through to the sea i got fifty pand on it i will i said i was looking up at the dark hole that showed between the scaffolding i think at that moment i had forgotten everything else but the job of breaking through to the sea bed as neatly as possible its a ticklish job blasting through to what cornish miners call the house of water i hadnt done it for a long time not since i was in the rockies in the coolgardie fields id always been working deep the job only happens in hilly country your mine has been developed to the limit of the capacity of the pumps to remove the water when you reach that limit you have to consider some alternative means of dewatering if the mine is on the side of a mountain as so many of the mines in the rockies are then the next thing is to drive an adit from the nearest valley up under the mine to act as a drain for the water that is preventing deeper development its quite a straightforward job provided theres no underground river or reservoir of water thats what makes it dangerous you probe ahead with a long drill and sometimes when you reach the house of water and the drill comes out with a gush of water pouring from the drill hole the whole face of the adit collapses drowning the miners thered been some nasty accidents like that at mines my father and i had worked in but it had never happened to me in this particular case drilling up to the sea bed it was less dangerous in one respect manack had said he could give me accurate figures for the amount of country we had to blast through on the other hand the weight of water was likely to be much greater than one would ordinarily encounter i stood there for quite a time gazing up into the gaping hole and considering the problem come on mate friar said at length lets get crackin okay i said we removed the tools fitted the air pipe to the compressor and got the drill up to the platform of the scaffolding friar then went down to the very end of the gallery where the giant block and tackle was fixed that held the hawser pulled a rock out of the wall and lifted the receiver of a field telephone he wound the handle and then said slim okay yes shes workin pull the basket back about four yards will yer an instant later the hawser at the rear of the carriage drew taut and the whole thing complete with compressor backed away from under the scaffolding yes thats fine friar said as the carriage stopped he replaced the receiver and climbed up on to the platform beside me ony fing we ain got laid on dan ere is room service he peered up at the shaft above our heads wot abat when the ruddy sea comes in he said its the only fing as far as i can see that may gum the ole works you mean if too much rock comes in and blocks the carriage way i asked he nodded thats my job i said well keep to light blasts clearing the rock after each blast as youve been doing up to now in the end therell be a thin crust of rock between us and the sea if the rocks sound itll be all right an if it aint you wont be around to pay slim the fifty quid youll owe him i said gawd he breathed and i could see his face was a shade paler he wasnt a miner and i dont think he enjoyed working underground anyway but give him his due he wasnt a coward only at the very end did he let his fear get the better of him by the time wed rigged the clamp for the drill screwing it like a bar horizontally across the face of the shaft i had worked out where i was going to put my drill holes and the size of the blast i was going to use i had forgotten about the rich lode that began in the pit below us about cripples ease and all that lay above ground my whole mind was concentrated on the task before us by this you mustnt imagine that i hold with the idea of smuggling or wanted any part of the working and profits of the scheme mining is like any other job give a good miner a problem to work out and hell become enthusiastic because of the job itself and i figured i was a pretty good miner even though i had been out of the game for six years captain manack came down shortly after four we were drilling our third charge hole then it was some time before we noticed him for we were both of us right up in the roof of the shaft and the roar of the compressor and the clatter of the pneumatic drill and the sizzle of compressed air and water was shatteringly loud in that confined space he clambered up the ladders beside us and when i saw the light of his lamp i turned off the juice my ears were deafened i could hardly hear what he said though the only sound was the muffled roar of the compressors engine and the hiss of escaping air how are you getting on he shouted in my ear okay i said and shone my lamp on the holes we had already drilled well make about a dozen holes and put in light charges i shouted its more than usual for a face as small as this but itll be safer that way he nodded when will you be ready to blow he asked i looked at my watch about seven maybe eight oclock i replied again he nodded i brought some tea down he said hed placed a canvas bag on the platform below out of the neck of it protruded the top of a thermos flask we knocked off then and the three of us had our tea seated on the platform of the scaffolding ive just been going over my figures manack said as he munched a jam sandwich i reckon youve eighteen feet to go how much headway will you make with each blasting about three feet i said maybe a little more itll be the fifth or sixth blow then yes i said todays friday that makes it sunday night or monday morning if you do two blastings a day can you do two yes i can do two i told him good then ill arrange for the arisaig to take you and dave off on monday night he brought out a cigarette case and we sat smoking for a moment in silence he leaned over the edge of the platform and shone his lamp down into the pit between the rock runways of the carriage the dull surface of the tin in the hole reflected back the light pryce he said will letting the sea into the mermaid prevent us ever working that lode whats the next level i asked undersea level yes itd be the two hundred level thats nearly five hundred feet below us i said thats a hell of a gap itll mean dewatering the mine down to that level youll be able to gauge the probable position of the lode from the geological charts your father has but even if the charts are accurate therell be a deal of development work to do before you strike the lode and even then you cant be sure that its the same lode he saw at the sixteenth level it may be just a pocket youd need a lot of capital with no return for your outlay until you hit the lode and shed make a fair amount of water with the sea in this gallery he nodded and shrugged his shoulders oh well its just too bad the old mans pretty mad is he i asked yes mad as hell but you neednt worry he wont interfere i thought of what id do to any son of mine who insisted on letting the sea in on a lode as rich in tin as that and i wasnt so sure the old man wouldnt interfere it seems a pity i said why dont you throw up the smuggling racket and take to a legitimate business mining that lode because im not interested in mining he replied but god i said if that lode goes down like the old man says it does youd both make a lot of money he peered at me eyes suddenly narrowed whats the idea pryce he said you dont want to do that blasting job thats it isnt it i dont care what i do here i replied so long as i get out of the place quick then you stick to your job and leave me to handle my own affairs i started to make some angry retort but he got to his feet you get on now ill bring the charges down soon after six what size do you want them i told him what size i wanted and he left us then the capting dont want advice friar said as we watched manacks lamp going down the gallery hes a fool i said if that lode goes on hed make a fortune wot wiv taxation like it is na friar laughed i can just see the capting coping wiv forms and regulations and accounts e just aint cut at fer it we clambered back up the ladders then and continued with the drilling at a quarter to seven manack phoned up to find out what progress wed made there were still three more drills to do so we knocked off for the evening meal friar went up to the house for his i had mine alone like a badger in my rockhewn hole by eightthirty we had begun drilling again and by ten i had inserted the charges and fused the detonators we took the compressor and all equipment back with us on the carriage out of the way of the blast the pit had been covered over with heavy timbers slim left the capstan controls as the carriage came to rest at the bottom of the main shaft and came towards us his face looked even longer than usual got some bad news for you he said to captain manack what is it manack asked daves turned up dave at cripples ease slim nodded the bloody fool manack was beside himself with fury i warned him that if there was ever any trouble he wasnt to come near the place god where is he now not up at the house i hope no slim replied he had that much sense he came straight to the mine i put him in the bolt hole where pryce is living good ill go up and have a few words with master tanner hes scared is he scared as hell thats the trouble with welshmen manack snarled too emotional and they dramatise everything like the italians right now i suppose he thinks hes gypo nolan being chased all over the streets of dublin he crossed over to the gig as the cage rattled upwards he said nothing but his eyes gleamed in the light of the four lamps hed taken his helmet off and was running his long fingers through his hair we followed him into the bolt hole bedding had been brought down and put on one of the beds dave was leaning against the rolledup mattress smoking a cigarette as we came in he leapt to his feet when he saw manack his quick dark eyes roved round the rock walls he almost cringed away as manack went up to him well manacks voice was soft but the tone abrupt i had to come dave said softly he took a puff at his cigarette it was the only safe place i never thought the coran girl would give me away like that i was over at clynts farm near morvah lizzie clynt brought me the paper herself i didnt trust her after that so i came here i had to man dont you understand you disobeyed orders and endangered the lives of the rest of us manacks voice was cold and violent youll leave for italy on the arisaig monday night in the meantime youll live here with pryce and youll stay here do you understand no going up to the surface youll stay here and youll keep the entrance closed ill give you instructions money and papers on monday he turned to me see he stays down here he said i dont trust him in his present state he went out followed by slim and friar the two slabs swung to behind them what did he mean by my present state daves voice was pitched high and his cigarette glowed red what did he mean man does he think im scared i didnt come here because i was scared indeed i didnt i came here because he hesitated and trod out his cigarette because i didnt trust lizzie clynt women are the devil you know ive no use for them but the one but youve got to trust them sometimes now havent you but when she showed me that paper he opened his gold cigarette case it was empty have you got a cigarette man no i said perhaps there are some in the food cases there i searched in the case i had opened and found a carton of cigarettes here you are i said and tossed him over a packet of twenty he lit one immediately the flame of the match shook in his hand he got up then and pushed open the slabs of the entrance i hate being shut up dont you i like to be able to hear whats going on outside wed hear the gig coming down now wouldnt we yes i said he was crossing towards the bed again when a muffled roar came from the depths of the mine the ground shook slightly dave swung round what was that he cried blasting i said were blowing in one of the galleries he went quickly over to the bed and sat down as though his knees ached a blast of air swept dust in from the gallery outside what are you blasting for manack isnt opening up the mine is he just a few structural alterations i said he didnt pursue the matter he wasnt interested that was outside himself and he was only interested in himself he wanted to justify his presence at wheal garth he wanted to prove to himself most of all that he wasnt frightened you know when i left you he said up at the ding dong mine yes i went down to morvah thats about two miles up the coast from here just outside the village on the hills theres a farm belongs to a farmer called john clynt his wife lizzie is about twenty years younger than him you know a lovely girl she is i met her at a dance once and id go up to the farm sometimes in the daytime when i was in port her husbands out farming all day well i went there you see i knew shed hide me away for the fun of having me during the day but how was i to know the police would find out about that woman at lamorna she brought the paper up to me this afternoon i was in one of the hay lofts you know and one look at her face told me shed do what syl had done syl was in love with me thats the trouble you know they all fall in love with me damn them why is it that women cant behave rationally syl was jealous i knew that but to go and give a man away to the police thats what i cant forgive oh for gods sake shut up i said but look you man shed no cause to do a thing like that i never told her i loved her but a man needs a woman now and then it was the same with liz she thrust the paper at me as i lay down there in the straw waiting for her to come to me and her face was set you know like a piece of sculpture in a church but for the scandal if her husband found out shed have been down to morvah village right away to fetch the police but i couldnt stay there was murder in her eyes as she stood over me whilst i read that story in the paper the only place i could go was cripples ease whats manack got to grumble at it was the most sensible thing to do indeed it was the only thing to do id like to get my hands on sylvia coran now id teach her not to go sneaking to the police id he looked up and saw that id picked up an electric torch and was moving towards the door where are you going up top to get a breath of fresh air i told him no he said stay down here and talk to me man im not used to these mines i dont like im going up top i said his face looked white and scared as i closed the slabs upon the lamplit gloom of that little rock chamber theres something about a man whos scared that always seems unwholesome they say a dog can smell fear maybe thats it but i just couldnt stay down there with dave tanner i went up the raise and climbed the shaft at the top i poked just my head over the protecting wall the night was bright with moonlight there was nobody around and i climbed out the sea was all silver and the stars gleaming palely behind the dark outlines of the old engine houses a faint rhythmic beat pulsed in the still air it was the sound of a ships engines the dark outline of her showed against the silver of the sea she glided slowly along the rim of the cliffs like a phantom i strolled down to the sheds of wheal garth and in the shadows there lit a cigarette it was so wonderfully still and peaceful i drank in that stillness this world of moonlight seemed so remote from that other world the world in which dave tanner was scared and i pushed the other thoughts out of my mind the moonlight and the stars and the stillness with the rhythmic beat of the ships engine like a distant tomtom that for the moment was reality not the rest the moonlight and the peaceful beauty of the place made me restless i turned and climbed up the slope behind me my boots rustled on the heather scaring rabbits into their burrows it was only when i came within sight of cripples ease that i stopped to think why i was walking towards the house then i knew i was going to see kitty i needed her shy understanding i wanted her sympathy not only that there was more i wanted the blood tingled in my veins i wanted to see her smile to make her aware that i was a man not just miss nearnes son i went on walking fast across the old workings there was nobody about the headland was all white in the moonlight and the house which had looked so grim in the storm that first night was white too i tried to avoid looking at that little dormer window in the roof but it seemed to watch me as i went past the front of the house and into the yard i reached the kitchen by the scullery door kitty was sitting beside the open range her head bent over a book the old woman sat opposite her mending some socks they looked up as i came in kitty jumped to her feet her cheeks were red with the heat of the fire what are you doing here she asked i hesitated i came to see you i said came to see me she seemed surprised and her eyes dropped to the book in her hand she put it down on the table what do you want to see me about her voice had a slight tremor in it i just felt lonely i said quickly its such a lovely night and and i wanted somebody to talk to i added lamely theres slim and friar through there if you want company she added but you shouldnt be up here i dont want to talk to either slim or friar i told her i want to talk to you she looked down and her fingers turned the leaves of the book she had been reading you shouldnt be up here was all she said i know that i answered look take a stroll down to the headland in a short while will you ill meet you down by the mine she didnt answer but the old woman looked up from her darning and said theres a nice moon dearie and the walk will do ee good will you i asked again maybe she said very quietly footsteps sounded in the corridor she looked up startled they didnt turn off towards the front door but came straight on to the kitchen the door opened it was old manack he stopped there in the doorway his pale eyes glittered in the lamplight my hands clenched automatically and i felt a violent desire to take him by his beard and fling him over botallack head where my mother had gone he must have seen the violence in my eyes for he stared at me as though fascinated by what he saw a sound broke through my clenched teeth it wasnt speech it was just a sound fear snowed in his eyes but only for a second then they narrowed cunningly and i swear he smiled in his beard i started towards him then i dont know what i intended to do but i wanted to get hold of him kitty caught hold of my arm and he quickly closed the door i stood there sweating in the warm kitchen and listening to his footsteps going down the corridor to the front door dont do anything please kitty said go back to wheal garth ill come down to you there just as soon as ive cleared the supper things away i promise she added i looked down at her id forgotten all about my need of her in that sudden surge of rage i could feel her body close against me as she held my arm she stepped back i suddenly felt cold and drained she was watching me wondering what i was going to do her face was pale and her breath was coming fast through her halfopen lips guess id better go i said ill wait for you at the mine she nodded and turned away towards the range i went out again into the moonlight i could hear friars voice behind the curtained windows of the outhouse diningroom i went round the house and started towards wheal garth and then i stopped directly ahead of me in black silhouette against the silver of the sea i saw old manack going down towards the mine my muscles tensed if the swine were going down the mine id have him there but he wouldnt be such a fool surely he wouldnt be such a fool i waited tense with excitement until his figure disappeared down the dip of the slope i crossed the old mine workings then and from the top of the slope i watched him making for the sheds once he stopped and looked back almost as though he feared i might be following him i dropped close to the ground he hadnt seen me for he went on and when he reached the mine he went into the store shed i scrambled down the slope when he came out again i was concealed amongst the gorse that surrounded the shaft to the hideout he had a helmet and overalls on and he carried a lamp but he didnt go to the hoist he went on down the slope he was making straight for the shaft he used the shaft where his wife had been killed the rim of its protecting wall showed like a ghostly circle amongst the brambles i could have laughed aloud to play right into my hands like this id get the truth from him now id wring it out of him down there in the bowels of his own damned mine the old man had reached the top of the shaft now he turned and glanced about him it was a furtive glance he wanted to be unobserved what the hell was he doing going down the mine at this time of night and why did he use that shaft what fatal fascination was there for him in that place and then another thought flashed into my mind a man who could coldbloodedly throw a dog down a shaft was capable of anything that thought was to recur more than once before the night was out satisfied that no one was watching him manack climbed over the protecting wall he stood for a moment on the inside his head and shoulders visible as he looked up towards the house then he disappeared i didnt stop to think id forgotten all about kitty i had my torch i could be down in the main adit as soon as he was i ran to the hoist and tumbled into the gig flinging the lever over as i shut the door and slowly the cage sank into the dripping darkness of wheal garth chapter seven piskyled i stopped the gig at the main adit level and with my hand cupped over my torch so that it showed only a glimmer of red light i hurried down the gallery the air was very still no wind blew up from the sea there was no sound of waves the only sound was the drip of water the quiet of the place magnified the sound the drip of water and the stillness both seemed merged it was as though night had seeped down into the galleries and the mine slept the adit seemed longer than when i had come down it with captain manack i was almost running i was afraid i had missed the old man but when i reached the bend that brought me in sight of the bottom of the shaft he used there was his lamp glowing yellow against the walls of the gallery i stopped then the old man was going down the gallery towards the sea i followed i had switched off my torch i could see the shape of the gallery against the distant light of his lamp a ghostly glimmer of moonlight filtered down into the gallery as i went past the shaft by which he had descended glancing up i could see the ladders snaking up over the dripping rock walls ahead of me the light of his lamp disappeared he had turned off to the right the gallery was suddenly dark i switched on my torch and almost ran to the point where his light had disappeared he had turned up a crosscut i thought he must be going down to the mermaid but when i turned into the crosscut and reached the shaft leading to the mermaid it was just a black hole with the rungs of a ladder sticking up out of it i switched off my torch and stood there in the darkness listening all about me was the drip and gush of water behind was the sigh and gurgle of the sea in the adit and ahead the rhythmic suck of the pump the unearthly stillness of the mine was full of sound no chance of hearing a mans movements the crosscut forked just beyond the open hole of the shaft i chose the righthand one it was little more than a cleft in the rock about the height and width of a man it sloped sharply down and then levelled off with ochrecoloured water ankle deep my boots were full of it the roof came gradually lower until i was bending almost double i hit my head on a protruding rock and cursed i uncupped my torch and shone the powerful beam ahead of me the tunnel straightened out until i could see at least fifty yards along it no sign of manack i knew then i had taken the wrong turning for i had not been that far behind him i turned and hurried back the lefthand fork was no wider than the other and it too sloped down my waterlogged boots squelched in the thick ooze that formed the floor the sound of the pump grew louder till its rhythmic thump and suck filled my ears to the exclusion of anything else with it was the gush of rushing water the tunnel levelled off heightened and broadened and round a bend i came upon the pump a giant waterwheel turned slowly in a deep cleft water poured with the force of a small fall from the roof of the cleft it fell with its full weight on the rear of the wheel turned it and then disappeared into a black abyss below sucking and gurgling in its haste to get to the sea from the side of the wheel a big arm thrust up and down working the bob of the pump the bob was a great beam as big as a tree pivoted at the centre it rocked up and down like a seesaw the farther end attached to a long rod which disappeared into the pump shaft at each thrust there was a great gurgling and sucking then it would rise and a mass of water would surge into a narrow adit cut through the rock beyond it was a monstrous piece of mechanism groaning and sucking down there in the depths of the mine it was like a prehistoric monster it was part of the mine itself it went on working night and day automatically without ceasing it was the sort of contraption the old cornish miners had used before the days of steam id seen pictures of them in old mining books but id never actually seen one before i took all this in at a glance as i dodged under the bobbing beam and hurried on along the tunnel the rhythmic thumping of the giant pump became muffled and resonant as the roof of the tunnel closed down on me at one place i had to crawl on my hands and knees through cold ochrecoloured water then the passage broadened out and the roof rose up and suddenly vanished i shone my torch upwards i was no longer in a tunnel but in a great gap where a tin bearing seam had been ripped out leaving the bare rock on either side sloping all the way they must have cleared to a height of almost two hundred feet the beam of my torch could just pick out the roof it seemed as though the rock which sloped up at an angle must grind together at any moment closing the twofoot gap a little farther on the roof came down again and i was bending low in a narrow stuffy passage with the water round my ankles twenty yards or so farther on the tunnel ran out into a wider gallery that crossed it like a tjoin i switched my torch off as i looked out into this larger gallery it was well that i did so for not fifty yards up the straight broad gallery to the right the light of a lamp showed the rock walls of a bend it surprised me that manack hadnt got farther but i didnt stop to think about that i turned into the gallery and hurried after the subdued glow of his lamp the floor of this gallery was much drier and sloped gently upwards it was easy going my mind had time to wonder what the hell manack was up to i would have expected him to go down to the mermaid that was the natural thing for him to do that was where his precious lode was but this way could only lead into the old part of the mine i had kept my bearings it was an entirely automatic reaction and i knew that we were now going inland to the north of the main shaft if he had kept straight on he would soon be in that part of wheal garth that narrowed and squeezed between botallack and come lucky at the thought of come lucky the hair prickled along my scalp come lucky was full of water suppose the old man were going to blow a hole in come lucky all that weight of water would come flooding into wheal garth that would stop his sons little scheme of letting the sea into the mermaid i began to run i had to keep close to him now i had to see what he was up to for all i knew he might have his charges fixed he might be going to fuse them tonight hed do it at night if he did it during the day his son and slim and friar might be caught and overwhelmed in the mermaid the gallery ahead suddenly became dark i switched my torch on shielding the beam with my hand round the next bend i found a narrow winze going off to the right a feint gleam of light shone on the wet floor of it the winze sloped down to a drift which narrowed till it was no wider than my body the roof came right down till i was bent low twice i cracked my head against the rock roof i could have done with a helmet in these low runnels it got wetter as we descended until the water splashed around my calves the passage twisted and turned following the haphazard line of some old seam that had been worked round a bend i suddenly came upon him not twenty feet away from me he was standing with his lamp in his hand looking straight towards me it was almost as though he were waiting for me i froze wondering whether he had seen me but apparently not for he shone his lamp towards the roof it was quite high where he stood and a ledge of rock ran up to a hole that looked no bigger than a rabbits burrow a stream of dirty liquid gushed from it he fixed his lamp to his helmet climbed the ledge and disappeared headfirst into the hole i waited a moment and then followed the hole was about three feet high and two wide the air in it was stale it smelt dank and rotten i crawled on hands and knees for perhaps twenty feet through filthy water then the roof rose and i could stand upright again the old mans lamp bobbed ahead of me like a willothewisp we turned right at a fork climbed along a narrow ledge that dropped away to nothing and then turned right into another gallery i was beginning to lose my sense of direction in this maze the tunnel curved away to the left the light of his lamp grew brighter he had stopped i too stood still he could not be more than twenty feet ahead of me then the light grew fainter i followed my torch was switched off i was going forward by the diffused light of the lamp ahead suddenly my right foot met nothing i flung the weight of my body back as i fell it was the only thing that saved me i fell back with my left leg twisted under me and my hands braced against the rock on either side i felt about with my right foot as i sat there the floor of the tunnel dropped away there was no floor there manacks light was fading shielding my torch i switched it on i was sitting on the lip of a hole about two foot six across i thrust the naked beam of the torch into the hole it was a narrow shaft its aged rock walls were covered with slime and glistened with the water that seeped out of every crevice it went down and down i could not see the bottom of it but i heard the faint sound of the sea above the steady drip of the water there was a corresponding hole in the roof it was an old shaft perhaps two hundred years old probably it had been cut when the mine was first being developed i was in a cold sweat but for the fact that i had instinctively fallen back on to my other leg i should now have been lying at the bottom of that black funnel broken and crushed with the sea sucking at my body i got to my feet and stepped across the yawning circle of the shaft it needed an effort of will to go on it had been a near thing and i was badly shaken id never been in an old mine before at the next bend i had to stop for manack was standing by the entrance to another narrow gallery his head cocked on one side as though listening i could see his eyes glittering in the light of his lamp which was reflected from the streaming walls again i had the feeling that he was waiting for me this feeling became an obsession i started to wonder whether he had deliberately chosen a gallery that led across an old shaft but it seemed ridiculous why should the man think any one was following him with the sound of water all round he couldnt possibly have heard me falling he disappeared into the dark cleft again i was following his lamp as it led me like a willo thewisp along a twisting corridor in the rock i went more carefully now using my torch where possible and where not testing in front of me with my feet at each step the light ahead suddenly vanished completely as though it had been blown out i waited a second in the darkness listening i could hear nothing but the sound of water and a distant whispering that might have been the sea or a gush of water it was an eerie sensation standing there in the complete darkness listening for the sound of a footstep that i could not possibly hear at length i switched on my torch and went forward by the red gleam that shone between my fingers a few steps farther on i caught quite definitely the sound of the sea it was a whispering murmur like the sound of wind in trees the gallery opened and the floor of it vanished again sloping in wet rock into an abyss of watery sound a whole seam had been hewn out here leaving a blank space between the rock walls and high above me a little circle of moonlit sky showed it was a long way away like a pinpoint of light it was hard to believe that up there was a world of gorse and heather with the lights of farmsteads shining out maybe at this very moment the girl and boy id seen earlier in the day were leaning against the circular wall that marked the shaft gazing out across the sea to the silver of the moon track it didnt seem there could be any world but this nightmare maze of tunnels creeping tortuously through dripping slimecovered rock the floor of the gallery didnt vanish like it had done before it continued across the sloping surface of the rock in a wooden platform most of the lagging had decayed and fallen away but the bare stulls driven into holes in the rock remained they were green and rotten with age i tested the nearest with my boot clinging to a handhold on the rock before trusting my full weight on it the wood broke with a soft crunch and i could hear it bouncing down against the rock walls until the sound of it was drowned by the sound of the water it was no use trusting my weight to those wooden stumps yet manack had gone ahead of me i shone my torch across the gap it was about twenty feet and on the other side there was the dark cleft of the gallery continuing for a wild moment i thought i was what old cornish miners would have called piskyled suppose that light i had been following wasnt manacks at all the old stories of the knockers and the hand of dorcas came to me and then i bent down and shone my torch along the line of the stulls iron staples had been driven into crevices in the rock that was how manack had got across no goblins no piskies just solid iron staples they seemed to bring a breath of sanity into that dank place i went across then holding my torch in my mouth and clutching to handholds with my belly flat against the slimy rock as my feet sought and found each staple testing it before venturing my full weight on it but i was very thankful when i was across that gap and in the gallery beyond i went on then there was no light ahead now a piece of rock fell out of the wall as i steadied myself against it i shone my torch on the roof the rock was no longer granite it was softer and there were great gaps in it and crevices more and more often my feet stumbled against broken chunks of it it was a piece of bad country shortly afterwards i came to a fall blocking the gallery it was an old fall and the rock was so soft that the water pouring over it had moulded it into one slimy mass the roof was higher here and a ledge in the lefthand wall ran back and up to a dark cleft i climbed this and instantly saw manacks lamp shining on the walls again i had the feeling he had been waiting for me the rock was granite again now and so low that i was bent almost double it led to a place where several galleries met they were all of them little wider than clefts i plunged on after manacks light i was scared now of losing touch with it this part of the mine seemed honeycombed every now and then i was passing openings in the rock crosscuts winzes raises galleries all higgledypiggledy the way the ore had been ripped out of the mine and they all looked so much alike twice i took a wrong tunnel turned back and found manacks lamp still quite near to the point where i had mislaid my way i became obsessed with this idea that he was waiting for me that he wanted me to follow him and every time i thought of having to find my own way back i broke out into a sweat of fear i tried desperately to retain in my mind a mental impression of each new gallery each turn and twist but there were so many of them it was utterly impossible not only that i had to concentrate on following the dim light of the lamp ahead and whilst hurrying at the same time to test the ground under each foot i crawled through a long tunnel not three feet high i was then only a few yards behind manack some trick of the mine brought a fresh wind blowing up this tunnel and with it came the sound of the sea the tunnel emerged into a narrow gallery it was so narrow that at times i had to edge along it sideways a part of the roof had come away in one place and when i had scrambled over the fall black darkness faced me i switched on my torch and hurried after manack the tunnel climbed steadily twisting and turning there was no light ahead all i had was the red glow from between my fingers here and there crosscuts shot off at right angles i kept on going faster becoming less cautious of the ground underfoot i had to catch up with manack then suddenly the gallery ended it was a fall a bad one by the look of it i shone my torch into the hole in the ceiling blinking in the sudden glare of the naked beam there seemed to be a dark hole i scrambled up thrusting myself right into the jaws of the fallen roof but there was no opening it had only been a shadow etching the face of the rock black there was no way on along that gallery a rock gave beneath my weight and i slid down the face of the fall dropping my torch and skinning my hands in the sudden darkness i searched feverishly for my torch all my hands encountered were cold rock and thick clinging mud god i mustnt lose my torch supposing the bulb had broken why hadnt i brought a miners lamp a miners lamp would last longer than a torch it couldnt get broken i knelt down on the floor cursing almost crying whilst my hands searched frantically then i remembered my matches of course id got my matches hell what was i panicking for i got a grip of myself i felt the conscious power of my will loose the tension of my nerves i realised that i was practically sobbing for breath as i put my hand in my jacket pocket the matches rattled comfortingly in the box i struck one the little yellow flare of light was like a beacon of safety the torch had rolled farther down the gallery than the spot at which i had been searching its chromiumplated case twinkled as though hugging itself with laughter i picked it up and thrust forward the switch the beam shone out as bright as ever i gave a gasp of relief then i turned in sudden renewed fear and hurried back down that twisting sloping gallery i had to find manack i didnt know my way out i knew i couldnt remember the twists and turns id come i didnt even know what part of the mine i was in all i knew was that i was in the old workings i might wander here for days surely manack would wait for me hed waited each time before or had i been wrong perhaps he hadnt any idea i was behind him i rammed my head against a buttress of rock and cried out with the blinding pain but i didnt stop i peered up each narrow cleft that led off the gallery i was in some were crosscuts others were just clefts that finished in nothing in none of them did i catch sight of the friendly glow of manacks lamp i came to a fork i couldnt remember it i took the righthand gallery before id gone twenty paces i was certain i hadnt come that way i went back and tried the left again i was certain it wasnt the one i had come down i stopped then i was panting heavily i must get a grip on myself i had been wrong about manack he hadnt been waiting for me it was all imagination why the hell had i come and then a new thought struck me suppose manack had known i was following him suppose he had led me up into these old workings on purpose what a way to finish a man what a perfect way to kill me to lead me up here into this rabbit warren and then abandon me those stories id heard of the roman catacombs i remembered the priest who had taken me over the santo calisto thirtynine miles of underground passages tier on tier of them and all along the walls the niches where romes christians had been buried in the early days of the persecution i could see that priest the lighted taper shining on his dark foreign face and upstarting wiry hair as he backed away from us down gallery after gallery he had told us that there were still galleries the monks had not explored that germans seeking escape after the fall of rome had forced their way into the catacombs and never come out that priest had scared me and when at the top i had asked what nationality he was for he did not speak with an italian accent he had smiled and said german i cursed out loud i must stop myself thinking of things like that i must get a grip on myself i took a deep breath and held it stopping my panting manack must be about here somewhere i called him by name i shouted at the top of my voice but all that happened was that the sound of my voice came back to me as a hollow muffled echo i tried again again i heard my voice come whispering back along the galleries long after i had ceased to call and then something like a laugh sounded but it was just a trick of my imagination it came again a rustling cackling noise with it came a draught of air probably it was the sound of the sea wandering along the galleries the sea i pulled myself together then and switched off my torch i had to conserve the battery no use wasting it whilst i stood still thinking and i must think i must reason this out i mustnt panic i was a miner not a kid going underground for the first time i turned about in the darkness searching for the direction of that faint breath of air that stirred along the gallery it took me back towards the fall of rock i followed it into a crosscut the crosscut was low i had to crawl through on hands and knees the breeze was stronger in this narrow tunnel i could feel it cool on my face it smelt dank and salt the tunnel opened out again and then descended steeply soon i was scrambling over fallen rock down an almost vertical funnel with water pouring between my legs soaking me to the waist it levelled out again i could hear the sea now the feint gurgle and lap of water came to me on the breeze which was strong and fresh then suddenly the gallery ended it wasnt a fall of rock that faced me it was just empty space i raked that space with the beam of my torch it was a great cavern whether natural or not i dont know the sea slopped about in the bottom of it i thought i could dimly see the black surface of the water on the edge of my torchs visibility there was no exit that way the sides of the cavern fell away sheer even if i could have got down there was no indication that there was a way out below water cascaded in little falls down the smooth weedgrown rock i scrambled back then up the funnel and along the tunnel and back to the gallery from which i had started no good following the wind i switched my torch out and tried to remember the way i had come if i could just retrace my steps i faced the gallery again and started walking i took the lefthand fork i went on following my nose selecting passages at random pretty soon i knew i was lost there were falls i had not seen before drifts kneedeep in ochrecoloured water nothing i recognised i found a weedgrown shaft that went up vertically and disappeared beyond the range of my torch without any circle of moonlight showing its pinpoint light of hope at the top probably one of the old shafts that had been blasted in water became more evident it poured from every crevice and ran kneedeep along a gallery i walked down the roof of that gallery gradually lowered until the gallery was no more than a pipe down which the water poured gurgling i went back again and tried another this led me upwards passing me from level to level it had a plan i could understand it then it suddenly petered out for no apparent reason except of course that the tinners had come to the end of the lode in that particular spot i went back again working my way down through the mine if i could get within earshot of the pump that would act as a guide for me i followed the run of the water the galleries were like narrow gothic passages and then suddenly they would open out into cathedrallike spaces where a broad seam had been worked i worked my way down deep into the mine and the lower i went the wetter it became the black walls poured water the air was dank and stale there was no sound of the pump no sound of the sea only the whispering trickle of water running over rock surfaces a narrow winze took me down into a broader gallery here the water was almost up to my waist i struggled along it i knew i should go back i was too deep but i couldnt face the thought of failure the light of the torch was beginning to dim for a time i refused to admit it but down here in this swamped gallery with the dark surface of the water curving ahead of me i knew the battery was fading the beam was no longer a white shaft of light it had yellowed and lost its power the change had been so gradual as to be almost imperceptible i forced my body forward through the weight of the cold water ahead the dark polished surface was broken with water pouring in from the roof and as i reached this point my foot slipped from under me and i plunged forward the water closing over my head i came up gasping holding the torch above my head and feeling about with my feet for the muddy floor of the gallery i found it and climbed out of the hole cold and dripping one glance at the roof told me that i had stepped into a shaft for there was a gaping hole there out of which water poured in a steady stream i knew then that i was down to the water level of the mine below me were miles and miles of workings all flooded there was nothing for it but to go back i was scared now really scared it was the yellowing beam of my torch that scared me the battery had been stored too long it might last five minutes it might last an hour but my time was limited i had to find a way out i glanced at my watch as i waded back along that flooded gallery the luminous hands showed five minutes to eleven id been underground about an hour i turned up a steep raise dragging my mudfilled boots out of the water my haste was almost frantic now i must get as near to the surface as possible before the torch gave out if i could find a shaft that ran up to a gleaming circle of moonlight i could try and climb it at any rate i could stay there until daylight and then start calling for help there wouldnt be much chance of any one hearing me but at least it would give me some hope or if i could find one of the galleries that led out on to the face of the cliffs as i climbed i began to search about with my face for a sign of a breeze that would indicate the direction of the sea or shaft but the air was still and lifeless the galleries were like a tomb i began to think of the catacombs of rome again no i mustnt think of that id lose my head if i thought of that there was that story by edgar allan poe what was it the cask of amontillado damn poe he was the last writer i ought to be thinking of if i was to preserve my wits then suddenly i stopped a gentle throbbing sound was in my ears was it my blood beating in my temples i was panting like a lunatic was it the blood or was it the sound of the pump i tried to forget the beating of my heart and listen but i couldnt be sure fear and the still damp air could play all sorts of tricks i went forward slowly concentrating all my energies on listening the gallery roof rose a rock ledge ran up to a dark hole the sound seemed to come from there or was it my imagination it was so ephemeral i climbed the ledge and crawled into a narrow tunnel that was comparatively dry god how dim my torch was getting the tunnel broadened and lifted to a gallery the throbbing sound became louder and sharper and turned to a dripping the rock was softer here part of the floor had caved in water dripped there resonantly that was the sound i had heard i switched the dimming torch off and leaned against the wall closing my eyes so that the darkness would not be so apparent that sudden spark of hope had vanished i felt exhausted i put the torch in my pocket and leaned my whole tired weight against the wall i had to think i hadnt long now before i should be in darkness the gallery was utterly still the only sound was the steady drip of the water there was no breath of air to guide me and then suddenly i realised that my hands were touching not granite but a softer rock i got my torch out again yes it was softer rock that was why the floor had caved in this was the same sort of rock that i had encountered shortly after manack had led me across that sloping of course this bad bit of country might extend over a wide area of the mine but it was unlikely the mine was predominantly granite soft stone would be only likely to fill in a fissure in the granite country i went on again i came to a winze and peered down it my torch barely showed me the outline of the walls but a breath of cool air seemed to caress my face i went down the winze and turned left into a narrower gallery following the air the walls were granite here and the roof was low at the next bend the gallery finished in nothingness i stood in the gap and looked out into what at first appeared to be a cavern but i could just make out a wall of rock rising opposite me and then with a gasp of joy i saw a ledge running down to a fall of rock the rock of the fall was soft and the water pouring over it had welded it into a solid mass i slid down on to it surely this was the way manack had led me surely i wouldnt be mistaken there couldnt be two falls so identical as i went down the gallery i became more and more convinced that i had stumbled on to the track by which i had come the rock walls were soft the roof was full of crevices and great cracks lumps of broken rock lay on the slimecovered floor and then i was suddenly at the sloping i could hear the water pouring down the slope of the rocks to the sea far below and right above me was that little pinpoint of light that marked the top of a shaft the relief made me feel weak at the knees i stood there for a moment steadying myself and gazing up at that distant circle of light what a difference it made to feel that i was in contact with the world above ground it made even the darkness bearable then i switched on the torch again and felt with my boot for the first of the iron staples i found the wooden stump of the sloping timber the staple was just above it but i couldnt seem to find it perhaps in my excitement i was feeling in the wrong place i took a firm grip at the handhold i had and felt farther out but there was nothing only the rotten stump of timber i stepped back into the arch of the gallery then and leaned out with my torch glowing dimly against the rock above the stull there was no staple nor was there a staple above the next baulk of timber at first i thought this sloping must be different to the one i had crossed before but there was the tiny pinpoint of light high up above me and the slopping of the sea below the rock formation was the same too i might be in the same cutting but higher or lower than when id crossed before bui surely that fall of rock would not have been duplicated with the ledge running back and up to the narrow cleft that ran into granite country i went back down the gallery to see it was the same fall all right when i returned to the slope i knell down and leaned out shining my torch on to the place in the rock where i thought a staple should have been a ragged hole showed in a cleft the iron of the staple had marked the rock and dirt was pressed back on either side the staple had been knocked back and forth until it had fallen out it was then that my torch began to flicker it hardly gave any light at all i switched it off here thank god was not complete darkness i could look up to that little circle of moonlight remote though it was i derived some comfort from it i got a match from my pocket struck it and leant far out its flickering light showed me that the next staple was also missing and the next after that they had been there when i had followed manack across the slope now they had been prised out it could mean only one thing manack had known i was following him he had been waiting for me at each bend he had deliberately taken me up into the old part of the mine then he had doubled back and crossed the stoping knocking the staples out behind him my god what a devil that was murder it wouldnt seem like it but thats what it was and i remember thinking again a man who would coldbloodedly throw a dog down a shaft would do anything i sat down on the floor of the gallery with my legs dangling over the abyss and considered what to do i was quite calm now i wasnt lost any more i knew my way back to the pump and the main shaft from here all i had to do was get across that twenty foot gap that was a problem i could understand i wasnt scared any more there was nothing to frighten me about it i wasnt facing the unknown now this was a reality something i could understand manack had tried to kill me indirectly he had attempted to murder me and all that stood between me and safety was twenty feet of bare sloping rock it was my wits against his when i had rested a while i started out to do the only thing possible i switched my torch on i found a foothold and a handhold and swung out of the gallery on to the rock face the torch gripped in my mouth the rock was not quite sheer an angle of about eighty degrees i should say and pressing my body close to the wet face of it i was able to relieve the strain on my limbs the trouble was that the rock was slimy with water and fingers and boots were inclined to slip below me the sea slopped about noisily as though licking its lips in expectation of my fall i worked steadily out across the gap from handhold to handhold sometimes my feet were firmly set in a crevice or on a jutting rock sometimes they dangled uselessly at the fifth handhold i could find no place for my foot to grip i hung there by my hands searching in the dim flickerings of the torch for the next hold but i couldnt see one i searched about with my feet there was nothing but smooth rock i hung by one hand and felt out with the left there was no handhold and no foothold just the slimy surface of the rock i had to go back then i tried climbing up i got a little way and nearly stuck my elbow joints were quivering with the strain by the time i regained the gallery i sat down then with my back against the rock wall of the gallery id try again later but first i had to rest i felt utterly exhausted i seemed to have been stumbling through the workings of this mine for a lifetime yet it was only halfpast eleven i tried to relax my clothes were wet and uncomfortable i wasnt cold the air though dark was quite warm i just felt dirty wet and tired damn that blasted old man what was the idea why had he wanted to kill me what was he afraid of my limbs soon began to grow stiff my clothes clung to me in a sodden mass i began to shiver i wasnt consciously cold just wet i got to my feet i had to get across that gap i tried climbing down and along under the stoping but again i reached a point where there were no hand or footholds coming back my foot slipped and the sudden strain on my hands caused one of them to slide on the wet rock i hung for a moment by one hand and only just managed to find a crevice with my boot it was with great difficulty that i climbed back into the gallery after that i knew it was no use i had to find a way round but my torch was finished now the pale glimmer of light was only sufficient to reveal the rock face when held a few inches from it i felt my way back to the fall of soft rock from the ledge climbed it crawled into the tunnel and took the first crosscut to the left creeping along with my hands on either wall i took another turning to the left it sloped down and a moment later the floor fell away from under my feet i risked one of my precious matches here the gallery dropped almost sheer for about fifteen feet and then levelled out again i scrambled down and went on the gallery forked and i took the left and was brought up in a few yards by a fall i struck another match there was no way through i went back and tried the right fork again a fall and at the cost of still another match i discovered the gallery was completely blocked i went back scrambling up the steep part in the dark i tried another gallery and another one ended in a shaft the other in a blank wall of rock i had only five matches left now and suddenly i got scared i wouldnt find my way back to the sloping at least there was a gleam of hope there i took a wrong turning first time i tried again in a sweat of fear this time i came out through the tunnel on to the fall of soft rock and so back to the sloping with that little pinpoint of light high high above me i sat there shivering and listening to the sound of water perhaps daylight would show a gleam of light on the sea water below if not that didnt bear thinking about nobody knew i was down here i could just stay here and rot and then suddenly i sat up i thought i heard a voice very faint and distant there it was again a long echoing call i must be going mad it was like a womans voice i listened but it didnt come again i sat back it was possible to imagine all sorts of sounds in the dripping of the water i thought of the stories old tinners had told up in my fathers shack in the rockies stories of goblins working underground of the spirit of gathon and sudden flares and lights wherever there do be a lode o tin thees sure to hear strange noises i remember one grizzled old miner saying but they never spoke of a womans voice then suddenly i sat up my nerves stretched taut to a stifled scream there was a light in the gallery beyond the sloping i tried to tell myself i was seeing things that the darkness was playing tricks on my eyes but i could see the cleft quite plainly like an old doorway and it was all yellow with light i stood up perhaps it was manack coming back the light seemed to be getting stronger then a longdrawn out cry curdled my blood it was a soft wailing sound that dragged itself through the galleries and came echoing back in wail after wail growing fainter each time it came again it was a womans cry a mad wailing echoing cry and slowly the light grew brighter in the shaft beyond the sloping chapter eight mad manack i dont know what i expected to come along that gallery i stood there clutching at the wet rock of the walls and my blood pounded in my ears but for the darkness of the gallery behind me i think i would have run the light grew steadily brighter till the walls glistened and i could see the rotten stulls of the sloping thrust out like arms from the sloping rock if it were human i knew it couldnt cross that gap but i dont think i thought it was human no man brought up on the old tinners tales could possibly have thought that wild cry human at last the light itself appeared it was attached to a miners helmet and the miner himself came steadily on towards the slope i thought of all the men who must have lost their lives down here the mine was old two or three centuries of tinners must have worked down here burrowing down from above and in from the cliffs many would have been killed i wailed in a sweat of fear to see what the thing would do when it reached the rotten lagging would it come on or would it stop the figure reached the gap stopped and then swung itself against the rock feeling for the staples it was human but it wasnt manack it was much smaller than manack it wasnt his son either or slim or friar i hesitated i hadnt been seen i was in the shadow of my part of the gallery the miner failed to find the expected foothold drew back and bent down looking for the staples that should have been there the beam of his lamp shone like a disc of light straight at me then i found my voice who are you i asked the figure jumped back with a startled cry it was a womans cry is that you jim asked kittys voice relief surprise humiliation they were all mixed up yes i said coming out into the light of her lamp oh thank god she said what in the world are you doing down here i asked her i came down to find you thank god youre all right the softness of her voice whispered back at me as though it had wandered through countless galleries didnt you think i would be i asked i dont know she replied i didnt know what to think i saw mr manack come up i was down by the sheds where you said youd meet me i waited but you didnt come up and then i got scared i went down to the hideout mr tanner hadnt seen you i went out to the mermaid then i thought you might be down there but you werent and when i got back you hadnt returned to the hideout i was really scared then and decided to come up into the old workings i thought you might have got lost or something but i see i neednt have bothered she added with a trace of sharpness i said is this the only way into the old workings no theres one other way its a very low tunnel you have to crawl flat on your stomach a stranger wouldnt find it i see i murmured but this is the way youd normally come yes my stepfather drove staples into the rock well your stepfathers just knocked them out again what do you mean you wont find any staples now i was just looking for them when you spoke to me she peered down no youre right theyve been knocked out yet less than an hour ago when i followed the old man across this gap they were there what do you know about that you mean she broke off unwilling to put the thought into words thats right i said he led me up into a rabbit warren of galleries then doubled back and cut off my only line of retreat a nice fellow your stepfather and he knew you were following him she said it slowly stating it as a fact he knew that didnt he how did you guess i said surprised its not a guess i knew he meant you to go down the mine after him when you left the kitchen i looked out of the window to to see if there really was a moon he was standing on the slope that leads down to the mine he was looking back to the house waiting as soon as he saw you come round the house he started on down towards the mine i left the kitchen and followed you i saw you hiding in the gorse waiting for him to come out of the store shed then when he disappeared down that shaft i saw you run for the hoist i waited and waited at length mr manack came up alone i thought youd be up soon after him but you didnt come so i went down to the hideout it was then i got worried and decided to look for you in the mine its not a place for a stranger to be wandering in even if he is a miner it certainly is not i told her my torch has gone dead on me im down to my last five matches ive scrambled miles and had the fright of my life i was just sitting here thinking that this place was likely to be my tomb look what about showing me that alternative route yes she said wait there i wont be long the light of her lamp faded down the gallery then suddenly all was dark again as she turned out of the gallery i became conscious once more of the unending drip of the water that infernal darkness almost had me convinced kitty had never been there that i had imagined it all i waited there in the darkness for five maybe ten minutes then a light glowed in the gallery behind me a moment later she was standing beside me and the great cleft where the tin had been sloped out showed clearly in the beam of the lamp she held in her hand the relief of having light and company i found her hand in the darkness id like to thank you i said its all right she said and drew back timidly i just felt there was something wrong so i came down her voice had fallen to a whisper well i said i dont know what would have happened if you hadnt turned up id have just stayed here till i rotted somebody would have come to look for you i dont know i said they might not have thought of looking for me up here and id never have got across that gap and i wouldnt have found the other way id no light it was only by luck i found my way back as far as this he lost me in the farthest reaches of the old workings i turned her towards me you saved my life kitty its nothing she said nervously well it is to me i said with an attempt at a laugh that got stuck in my throat we were silent for a moment neither of us knowing what to say i turned her face towards me she wouldnt look at me but she didnt turn her head away i bent and kissed her then her lips were warm and soft i drew her close to me but at the touch of my body she thrust away from me she was panting and i caught the gleam of her eyes they were wild and scared looking like an animals but i needed her i needed her close to me to prove that i wasnt alone any more i caught hold of her by the arms and drew her towards me her helmet fell clattering to the floor and her hair tumbled loose hiding her face as she fought me off suddenly she stopped struggling the next instant her body was pressed close against me and her lips sought mine they were open inviting lips and she thrust against me with an abandon of passion that was quite wild then she drew quickly back and bent to pick up her helmet i could hear her breath coming in quick pants she turned back along the gallery ill show you the tunnel she said in a whisper as though she did not trust herself to speak to me i followed her we came to the fall of soft rock climbed the ledge and entered the hole that had led to the next gallery she took the third crosscut to the left and almost immediately turned left again this gallery opened out to some height she stopped and directed the beam of her lamp high up to a black hole in the rock there you are she said i dont think you would have found that i certainly wouldnt i said she led the way up a series of ledges in the wall and disappeared head first i followed her we crawled along on our stomachs for perhaps twenty yards all i could see was her legs and buttocks humped against the light of the lamp which she held out ahead of her at last we emerged into another gallery and were able to stand upright a few minutes later i could hear the rhythmic suck and thump of the pump we turned left into a wider gallery that was full of noise the noise of the pump mingled with the gurgle and rush of water at the end of the gallery we passed under the great bob as it seesawed up and down ten minutes later we were in the gig clattering to the surface its difficult to describe the utter relief with which i looked out upon the moonlit headland there was the sea all silvered and the stars and the old workings looked white and pleasant in the ghostly light my whole body relaxed to the sight of it and i felt desperately tired the fear i had felt down there in those twisting galleries the sense of being lost the darkness it was all like some ghastly nightmare i could not believe that it had really happened it was as though i had just woken up it just didnt seem real i suppose i was looking a little dazed for she caught my hand and said youd better come up to the house and get dry youre wet through yes i said she left me and went into the store shed i just stood there gazing at the moonlight when she came out she had discarded her overalls she had the skirt and jumper on that shed been wearing that morning and her hair blew free about her face how come you know your way around the mine i asked as we started up the slope to the house she laughed ive lived here nearly all my life you dont expect a young girl not to go exploring and then when my stepfather found i liked going down the mine he used to take me with him i was the only person hed got to show his property to why didnt you get away from the place i asked i was thinking of this girl alone in the house with old manack alone with him except for the woman i dont know she said softly ive only been to penzance once that was to give evidence about she stopped then and added quickly i didnt enjoy that visit and then my stepfather was alone except for old mrs brynd and there was the war somebody had to look after the bit of a farm weve got the thought of old manack had brought the strength pouring back into me in a flood of anger id have it out with him when i got up to the house there was something more to it than just a desire not to have the sea let into the mermaid he was scared of something scared of me id seen it in his eyes down there in the mermaid when hed learned that i was ruth nearnes son my hands clenched and i strode up that slope with the great sense of power that anger brings the girl understood my mood for she said you wont do anything hasty just dry your clothes and go back to the mine youll be clear in your mind about whats happened when youve slept on it im clear enough in my mind about it now i answered and went on in silence a thought was gnawing at my brain a man whod commit murder like that the way hed tried to kill me a man whod do that must have a streak of madness in him i remembered how his eyes had glittered down there in the mermaid gallery that was it the man was mad the sight of that rich lode had driven him crazy and hed seen that lode as a kid hed only had one idea after that to own the mine and work that lode himself that i was the reason for his first marriage and for his second and if hed to kill a man to prevent the sea being let into the mine then he might have killed before the thought in my mind was so horrible that i tried to throw it out it would make my mothers madness more ghastly by far than i had ever dreamed i tried not to think about it but strode on with my hands clenched id have it out with him right now id get the truth out of him if i had to kill him with my bare hands to do it we had come in sight of the house now i could see the bars on the little dormer window they stood out sharp against the panes which were white with reflected moonlight the girl caught hold of my arm you wont do anything will you she asked again i didnt answer i didnt want to talk to anybody about it i just wanted to get at old manack please she said she was panting with the effort of keeping up with me it wont do any good he thought you were going to destroy the mine he loves it its his only child please we had reached the house now i made straight for the front door the girl clinging to my arm i tried to shake her off but she held on pleading the door was not locked i went in then i turned and tore her hands loose from my arm please jim she cried please but i got myself clear of her you go back to your kitchen i said no good will come of this she cried her face was distraught in the moonlight and her breath came in sobs i left her there with her great eyes watching me in despair and went down the dark corridor it was dank and chill like the galleries of the mine my wet clothes clung to me and my boots squelched on the stone flags there was a light shining under the door of the old mans study i turned the handle and pushed the door open the old man was sitting at his desk he looked up and when he saw me standing there in the doorway all dripping from the mine he started to his feet the lamplight shining on his pale eyes for a moment we stood there staring at each other i dont know whether he thought me a ghost or was just too startled to speak whatever it was he just stared at me with his mouth opened like a cavity in his head i turned and shut the door then i started towards him and at the same moment he made a dive for a little iron pickaxe that stood on a shelf among some relics of early mining i reached him as his hand closed on the deadly weapon he fought me off with a strength that was incredible in a man of his age but i was stronger than he was i twisted the pick from his grasp and flung him back he fetched up against his desk overturning the big swivel chair with a crash he was frightened now i could see it in his eyes his tongue showed through his beard as he licked his lips he was breathing heavily what do you want he asked if its about your mother you know all there is to know she was mad i felt an itch to get my thumbs into the grey stubble of his neck im not sure it isnt you who are mad i said keeping a hold on my anger his eyes stared at me they didnt blink it was as though they had no lids to them and they were pale paler than id ever seen a mans eyes i said you thought i wouldnt get out of those old workings didnt you you thought id die trapped down there beyond that stoping you wanted me to die his hands had tightened on the edge of the desk i dont know what youre talking about he made an attempt at aloofness but his voice trembled yes you do i said you knew i was following you you deliberately led me into the old part of the mine and then you went back and knocked those staples out how was i to know you were following me he asked why did you knock those staples out i asked him i didnt want any one going up into those workings he stood up what i do on my own property is my business pryce wheal garth belongs to me and no damned deserter i of a miner is coming letting the sea into wheal garth deserter of a miner is it i roared and what are you then a murderer at the word he seemed to shrink back his face pale the skin of his cheeks tightened across the bones so that his beard seemed to grow out of his skull no he said no his beard lifted thats a lie he almost screamed its not a lie i thundered you left me to die buried alive in your damned mine because you were afraid of me you had no more consideration for me than you had for the dog you flung down that shaft after your wife or than you had for my mother he seemed to have shrunk in stature he looked bent and old i did it to save your mother he said i tell you i did it to save her his vehemence brought the horrible thing that had been in my mind crawling to the surface i tried to dispel it it just wasnt possible and yet your wife harriet left you all her holdings in wheal garth didnt she he seemed to sense the drift of my question for he began to tremble and didnt speak didnt she i shouted at him he nodded he seemed mesmerised those pale unblinking eyes were fixed upon me as though yes as though they saw some horror did my mother have any holdings in wheal garth i asked him his eyes flickered i dont think he was capable of answering my question he was dumb with fear james nearne my mothers father owned this place i said he was landlord here when it was a pub when the mine was still working now you own cripples ease my mother made it over to you didnt she she must have done i went towards him then did james nearne also own shares in wheal garth i asked him and when he didnt answer i said so my mother made those over to you too eh and your first wife left you her holdings in wheal garth three women and they all owned shares in wheal garth and they all died i added still he was silent i understand now i said you killed them you and your love of that cursed mine you got their holdings and you killed them i didnt he shrieked suddenly finding his tongue his lower lip was trembling visibly stark madness stared out of those pale eyes he leaned forward then they would not work the mine you see a mine has a soul a derelict mine is a devilish thing it kills people unless they take notice of it it kills them i tell you he cried thats why harriet died it was the mine and your mother and you he screamed wheal garthll not let you destroy its riches by letting in the sea itll kill ee you see if it dont there was a froth of spittle on his lips and his eyes glittered as he stood there screaming at me like a monkey and i faced him dumb with horror appalled at his admission then the door was flung open what the hells going on here it was captain manack you keep out of this i said get back to the mine he ordered youve no business to be up here anyway whatd happen if the police paid a visit theres gossip enough as it is who cares about the police i answered i was angry at his interruption i wanted time to work it out the mine had killed them he had said and he was the mine that meant that he had killed them he had killed his wife he and not my mother my god what a fiend hed killed his wife and made my mother think she had done it you crazy swine i muttered his son came forward and caught my arm as i moved towards the old man i flung him off there was murder in me at that moment the captain must have seen it in my eyes for he cried out pryce his voice rang as though he was calling a platoon of infantry to attention stand back will you i said this is between your father and me you keep out of it and when ive finished with him i added through my teeth you can look after the bits get out of here he ordered do you hear get out not until ive finished with this murderous swine i said but as i started for the old man who was cowering against the desk the captain suddenly called out stay where you are pryce or by god ill shoot you i stopped then for he had a gun in his hand thats better he said and his teeth showed angrily beneath his moustache stand back against the wall go on stand back reluctantly i did as he ordered now then whats the trouble he asked his voice was tense this i answered hotly your fathers a murderer hes just tried to kill me down in wheal garth and he killed his second wife he pitched her down that shaft and then persuaded my mother that shed done it he killed my mother and kittys for all i know he killed yours as well no my mother died naturally but he did kill his second wife the sons lips were drawn in a tight little smile thats why i control what happens in wheal garth he added at that there was a terrific crash we all swung round kitty was standing there in the open doorway her face ghastly white and the broken remnants of the tea tray on the floor at her feet i i was bringing you some tea she said in a pitifully small voice better go back to the kitchen kitty i said she looked at me with staring eyes then she nodded slowly and went out as though in a daze seeing her go so stunned by what shed heard made me realise the pathetic tragedy of it all this old man crazed with the lust for tin and kitty living here and not knowing he had murdered her own mother the old man saw the open door and suddenly darted towards it i thrust out my foot and he pitched headlong to the floor id have been on to him if his son hadnt suddenly barked at me to keep back there was something in the way that man held a gun that made it clear he wouldnt hesitate to use it the old man was scrambling to his feet he reached the door mumbling incoherently to himself then he vanished into the corridor let him go said captain manack ill look after him in a minute he motioned me to a seat see here pryce he said this has been a bit of a shock to you but theres nothing you can do about it not now killing him he jerked his head towards the open door wont bring your mother back hes mad ive known it ever since i came back the mine has driven him crazy what happened this evening what started all this i told him when id finished he nodded slowly i was afraid of that he said but i thought his guilty conscience would keep him clear of you what are you going to do now i said there must be some justice in the world i got to my feet my god manack i want the swine brought to justice he drove my mother mad the sheer calculated cruelty of it is horrible i want justice i cried thumping the desk and by god ill have it even if it means giving myself up and standing a court martial listen he said what good will that do you none absolutely none ill look after the old man ill lock him up from now on hell be out of harms way you do the job you have to do then you clear off hell get his desserts hell spend the rest of his life wandering forlornly through the galleries of wheal garth watching the sea slopping about in the gallery that might have brought him a fortune hes mad enough now hell die a crazy pathetic old man youll have your revenge if thats what youre seeking im not seeking revenge i told him its justice i want he shrugged his shoulders you can do what you like when youve finished this job for me he said but he wont hang even if you can prove it which i doubt theyd send him to broadmoor and youd serve a sentence for desertion youd drag your mothers name through the courts see her wretched history plastered all over the pages of the sunday press and destroy kitty entirely he added he was right there i leaned against the desk the anger had gone i felt flat and tired i guess youre right i said the thought of kitty who had only once been as far as penzance giving evidence from the witness box at a murder trial it was unthinkable okay i said ill let him be and i went towards the door then i stopped but see hes locked up safe im not working down in the mermaid if hes loose not with all that water standing over us in come lucky dont worry about that he answered i dont trust him any more than you do i hesitated i wanted to tell him i was clearing out leaving the place getting right away from the whole rotten business but he sat there watching me the gun in his hand and his eyes narrowed he wouldnt let me go i knew that hed too much to lose hed kill me rather than let me get clear of the place i went out and closed the door behind me now that my anger was gone i felt adrift i had no purpose disgust for the whole rotten business filled my mind i felt the way hamlet must have felt the manner of my mothers death called for vengeance and yet i could not do it i could not just kill the old man in cold blood he was mad and disgust not anger filled me id go away id get clear of it all then i saw the kitchen door facing me and through it came the sound of a girl sobbing it was a wild uncontrolled sound i opened the door and went in kitty was alone she was sitting by the fire her shoulders racked by sobs so violent that it seemed impossible for her body to stand it her face was white even in the ruddy glow of the flames she didnt see me she was staring into the fire and her eyes were dry kitty i said she didnt hear me i went over to her and took her by the shoulders she looked up then and saw me the sobbing stopped she seemed to be holding her breath then suddenly she bent her head against my body and the tears came her body trembled and shook in my hands dont cry i said its past now it couldnt be helped it could she cried out wildly it could oh jim how can you forgive me she was so good to me and i believed him i believed what he said of her i should have known she didnt do it i couldnt have saved my mother but i could have saved her she looked up at me wildly say you forgive me jim say you forgive me i couldnt have known could i of course not i said stroking her hair the poor kid was beside herself oh god she breathed its so horrible all that year she was in that room a year and she believed shed done it she believed she was mad oh if id only known she sobbed its my fault i shouldnt have believed it of her if i hadnt believed it then she wouldnt have then hed have killed her a different way i said gently dont worry kitty it wasnt your fault she clutched at my hand and held it tight against her wet cheek she used to tell me fairy stories when i was a little girl with pigtails she said in a stifled voice she loved me i should have known her face looking at me through the hatch oh god the door opened and captain manack came in the old mans not in his room he said he came up and caught hold of kitty did you hear my father come out she gulped and then nodded which way did he go upstairs she shook her head he went out the front door she said slowly he let her go then and turned to me hes down the mine you come down with us he turned quickly and went out through the scullery i heard him shouting for friar and slim listen kitty i said seizing her by the shoulders and forcing her to look at me you cant stay here do you understand you must go away she nodded slowly and then she said in a small lost voice but where ive nowhere to go i hate this place but ive never been anywhere else youre coming away with me i said it without thinking my mind suddenly made up she stared at me voices sounded through the open scullery door they were coming nearer meet me down at the mine at three oclock in the morning theres no time to talk about it i said quickly as footsteps sounded on the cobbles of the stables meet me at three oclock understand she nodded slowly she was too dazed to think it out she would have agreed to anything i said at that moment promise i said i promise she answered i heard friars voice saying ruddy lark this is i dont fink we bin on the job since six this mornin yer know capting i didnt aim ter spend the night playin tag wiv your old man down that bleedin mine they stopped in the scullery weve gotto find him captain manack answered sharply then he came through into the kitchen come on pryce he said ill stay up here for a bit i said the girls had a shock to hell with the girl he snapped come on now im staying with the girl i told him youre coming down the mine with us there was an implied threat in the quietness of his voice dont start any trouble up here he added and glanced towards kitty i had half a mind to defy him but it wouldnt do any good hed got his gun i could see the shape of it bulging in his pocket all right i said then i turned to kitty promise i asked her again she nodded slowly i promise she said as though repeating something shed been taught i left her then and went out with manack as he shut the door behind us i saw her sitting just as she had been when i had come in her eyes staring straight in front of her without seeing anything i think it must have been then that i realised that i loved her i know it suddenly seemed quite natural that id decided to take her with me when i left in the morning and the sight of her suffering tore at me as though it were myself that was suffering outside i was surprised to see that the moon was still shining it seemed such a long time back that kitty and i had gone into the house we walked hurriedly and in silence manack beside me slim and friar behind we reached the mine buildings they went into the store shed and got helmets and lamps and clothes then we went into the hoist suppose es wanderin abat the cliffs friar said e might be anywhere dont yer fink one of us better stay on top no manack answered and we got into the gig hes down the mine its the place hed naturally go he flung the lever over and we began to descend but he stopped at the store room gallery this is where you get off pryce he said you dont want me down the mine i said no he stepped out beside me im not taking any chances with you my lad not after whats happened dave he shouted dave where is that damned welshman dave the light of a torch flickered yes yes what is it dave tanners voice sounded agitated as he suddenly appeared in the gallery oh there you are have you got a gun indeed i have captain i always then keep an eye on your chum pryce youre not to leave him understand if he tries to get away use your gun i hold you responsible for him he turned to me dont take this amiss pryce i dont mean you any harm but im taking no chances a couple of days and youll be through then you can go his action had taken me so completely by surprise that i said nothing for a moment dave had reached us now the whites of his eyes showed in his swarthy face what is the trouble captain he asked theres no trouble manack replied sharply just see that hes here in the morning thats all his voice dropped if hes not well you wont get your passage to italy the menace in his voice brought sudden suspicion to my mind when ive done this job for you i said what guarantee have i that youll let me go then my word he answered ive never gone back on my word pryce youll sail on the arisaig monday night if the mermaids opened up by then and get murdered by that swine mulligan i said his face darkened and he caught hold of my arm i told you i never went back on my word didnt i hell have instructions to land you at naples he met my gaze and i knew that he would do what he said all right i said he nodded and stepped back into the gig friar put the lever over and it rattled out of sight down into the bowels of the mine whatevers happened man dave said i waited and waited i thought youd never come back i dont like it here at all not on my own theres the sound of the water you know and its so quiet and when i didnt say anything he said is it a row with the captain youve had the sound of the gig ceased everything was quiet only the drip of the water i shivered and turned towards dave he started back it is a ghost youve seen man he said youre as white as a sheet and your clothes theyre all wet yes i said im cold and wet i went along the gallery to the hideout dave stepped aside to let me pass his hand in his jacket pocket he was scared of me scared of manack scared of himself he made me nervous as soon as i was inside the hideout he pulled the slabs to and bolted them even then he kept his distance i stripped and towelled myself down all the time he plied me with questions in the end i told him how old manack had tried to kill me terrible he said terrible he sat there shaking his head living the fear that i had suffered with all the emotionalism of his race but why did he do it man he didnt want me letting the sea into his beloved mine i told him you should have stayed here with me he said worried to death i was about you i thought maybe the police had come i went out once but then i was afraid that if they came theyd search the mine i bolted myself in like being in a coffin it was i got scared it was so quiet and me not knowing what was happening in the world outside and so he went on whilst i sat and tried to think the old man was loose in the mine and kitty up there alone in the house how was i to meet her at three in the morning with dave tanner sitting there nervous as a kitten and his hand on the butt of a gun and if i did meet her where were we to go i was a fool all id been thinking about when id told her to meet me was getting out of the place id forgotten i was wanted by the police forgotten that a description of me had been published and whilst i tried to sort it out in my mind that damned little welshman went on talking i tried to shut him up but it was like telling water to stay in a bottle with a broken bottom he just had to talk he had to talk because he was scared to sit silent in the end i could stand it no longer im going outside i said i had to know whether they had located the old man i got to my feet in the same instant dave had leapt to the entrance the gun in his hand no you dont he said listen dave i said i need some fresh air so do i he answered but the captain said i was to keep you here and its not going against the captains orders i am i cant stand this place i said its like a tomb it is indeed but he shrugged his shoulders i said you realise that the old man means to kill me hes tried already and hell try again hes loose in the mine at this moment for all i know hes outside in the gallery right now one charge and he could have us walled up in here by a fall of rock daves eyes dilated in horror you really think that i nodded and theyd never get us out in time i said you think hed try he might you dont want to be trapped down here do you indeed i dont ive always hated being shut in anywhere you see well then lets go up top i suggested i wont try and escape if thats what youre scared of where the hell would i go im wanted by the police the same as you thats true enough he went over the entrance and shot back the bolt well wait in the gallery why not up top i suggested the captain may return with that i had to be content at least i could watch for the gig to come up we dragged a couple of boxes out into the gallery and sat there dave was taking no chances and stationed himself well behind me for a time he talked incessantly but gradually he grew silent i felt tired and sleepy the time dragged by i think i must have dozed for i started awake and heard the rattle of the gig coming up dave turned out his lamp a faint glow showed at the end of the gallery it grew bright and the sound of the gig grew louder then for a brief instant i had a glimpse of miners lamps and the bearded skull of the elder manack standing between friar and his son a match flared in the darkness and dave relit his lamp im going up top i said stay where you are daves voice was nervous again i want to see the old man safely clear of the mine i said for gods sake man whats the matter with you i shant run with captain manack within call that seemed to satisfy him and he followed me without further protest as i went up the crosscut to the shaft and climbed the ladder to the top the moon was sinking towards the sea throwing long shadows across the white landscape i breathed in the fresh air and as we sat down on a patch of bracken among the gorse bushes i sensed that dave was less nervous up here in the open air we hadnt been there a few minutes before figures moved out of the black shadows of the sheds there were four of them friar and slim each had hold of one of the old mans arms his son followed behind they climbed the hill towards us as they came within earshot slim was saying bloody lucky i call it it fair makes me sweat ter fink abat it friar said well see that you dont mention it to pryce captain manack ordered i dont want him getting scared im all fer goin back ter the nice peaceful life of makin kerb stones friar said wot you say slim kerb stones is a sort o restful thing ter be makin you didnt think much of the job when we were cutting those ledges slim answered sourly well yer can ave too much of a good thing nah all we fink of is liquor he spat some o these ere ruddy black marketeers oughter come an get their liquor the ard way like we does the sound of their voices died away i watched them disappear over the brow of the hill four dark figures against the moonfilled sky what about going up to the top of the hill and seeing him safely inside the house i said i wont be happy till i know the old mans safely locked up the time was twothirty i had to keep him above ground till three he hesitated all right he said we went slowly up the hill i bore away slightly to the left where there was a gulley that ran up close to the house we went up this and came out within fifty yards of cripples ease there was no one about the house stood square and unbeautiful looking out with pale eyes to the sea come on dave said hes safe enough now a light flickered suddenly in the little dormer window the bars showed clearly against the orange glow then the light vanished as though cut off by the closing of a door dave was plucking at my elbow i shook him off impatiently something told me what i should see and it fascinated me for a moment the window remained as blind as the others then suddenly i saw what i was waiting for pressed close to the panes was manacks bearded face i can see it now haggard and drawn he was looking out to the mine and his face caught the light of the sinking moon so that it was white as the face of a ghost chapter nine blasting operations the sight of the old mans face peering out from between the bars of that little window gave me a horrible sense of satisfaction i had wanted justice this was vengeance i thought of how my mother had looked out from behind those bars and how it drove her to suicide and now the man who had made her believe she had killed kittys mother the man who had shut her in there away from the world was himself locked in that room and mad really mad i started to laugh the sound of my voice jarred and frightened me it was a harsh laugh but i couldnt stop it dave looked round ssh he said somebody might hear you but i went on laughing man alive whats got into you i shook my head gradually my laughter died away and i felt weak and exhausted you wouldnt understand dave i said we had reached the shaft now dave stood aside and motioned me to go first it was then that i remembered kitty it was two fortyfive id only quarter of an hour to wait you go on down i said ill stay up top a bit he looked at me quickly his eyes suddenly suspicious his hand came out of his jacket pocket the blue steel of his gun glinted go on he said get down the shaft his voice had the high pitch of tension he was scared of me for gods sake dave i said we came up for a breath of air didnt we it wont hurt to stay up top a little longer you dont want to go down to that stuffy little hole again do you no he said but im taking no chances see you heard what the captain said he said if you werent here in the morning id get no passage on the arisaig but good god i said im not going to run away bloody right youre not he answered sharply now get going listen i said i just want to stay up here for a few minutes more i wont run away i give you my word think id take your word its daft you are to talk of such a thing his dark eyes watched me narrowly the gun gripped in his hand its up to something you are man he said excitedly and im taking no chances im wanted for murder and the only man who can get me out of the country safely is captain manack now get down that shaft try anything and ill shoot you i laughed you wouldnt dare i said captain manack needs a live miner to open up that gallery a dead ones no good to him look dave ill tell you why i want to stay up top a little longer theres a girl up at the house she used to know my mother ive arranged to meet her down here there will that satisfy you shes coming down at three oclock thats in ten minutes time youre lying he breathed excitedly i dont believe a word of it its up to something you are i know it you want to get away on your own turn kings evidence maybe if you hadnt turned up the other night id have taken sylvia coran with me and the police would never have known id survived the disappearance of the isle of mull your fault it is that im on the run do you understand your fault and now you want to get away from me now you think im dangerous he was quivering with the violence of his feelings and there was a murderous gleam in his eyes well i am dangerous he added im not afraid of using a gun and i dont want any more talk about girls youre not meeting a girl youre trying to get away all that nonsense about seeing the old man safely up to the house lies all damned lousy bloody lies youre trying to get clear of us well youre not going to do it see now get down that shaft or ill start shooting he was all worked up the gun literally quivered in his hand as he brought it up i believe he wanted to use it i think he wanted to feel the power that firing a gun gives a man he needed that sense of power for he was scared and that made him dangerous i sat down on the protecting wall of the shaft i did it with an assumption of ease which i certainly did not feel have some sense dave i said fire that thing and itll be heard for miles kill me and its fitted with a silencer he interrupted with a tightlipped grin all right i said but if you kill me manack wont do anything for you right now he needs me i shant kill you he answered all right i said but if you wound me itll be just as bad captain manack needs that gallery opened up right away a wounded miner is no more use to him than a dead one dave laughed its a good shot i am and a miner can work all right even if he has no toes his voice suddenly became almost strident for crissake man get down that shaft or do i have to hurt you he raised his gun he meant it i could see that i shrugged my shoulders what was the good id need my feet if i was to get kitty away from this place he was raising the gun now his whole body trembled with the desire to fire it his eyes were almost glazed i had broken out into a sweat all right dave i said quickly as the black barrel of the gun pointed at my left boot ill go down he didnt seem to hear i could see the white of his first finger knuckle as he squeezed at the trigger all right dave i shouted his eyes lost their glazed look and met mine then he looked down at the gun in his hand slowly almost reluctantly he lowered his arm to his side the sweat glistened on his face he seemed dazed get on down then he said in a voice that was strangely husky he was like a man drained of all energy i went down the shaft the rock holds were wet and slimy under my hands darkness and the sound of water closed me in the world above was reduced to a white circle of light the moon was so low that no light came down into the shaft then the circle of light was filled with daves dark figure and the yellow gleam of his torch shone on the rock walls back in the hideout he closed the entrance and bolted it then he had me sit on one side of the dugout whilst he squatted on a box on the other side the gun across his knees and his black eyes watching me ceaselessly i lit another miners lamp and sat there thinking of kitty the hands of my watch moved slowly round to three oclock blast that frightened little welshman shed be up there waiting for me shed think i wasnt coming because i was angry with her my god she might do anything if i didnt turn up the picture of her seated by the kitchen range dryeyed and shaken with fearful sobs leapt to my mind she had blamed herself for what had happened she was in no fit state of mind to be left alone if i didnt meet her she might i thrust that thought out of my mind shed come down to the hideout as she had done before no good imagining things she was upset terribly upset that was all it was quite natural she wasnt the sort of girl who would go and do anything foolish but as the time drifted by i became more and more worried i kept on seeing her standing up there all alone as the moons shadows lengthened and lengthened and then when i didnt come there were the cliffs straight ahead of her shed think of the cliffs and how my mother had ended her life she was bound to i kept on glancing across at dave tanner and every time i did so his black eyes would meet mine watchfully once he said its no good im watching you and im not sleepy i fancied i could hear the tick of my wristwatch it was so still it was like a tomb suddenly there was a new sound dave started to his feet the gun in his hand it was the hollow sound of rock on rock it came from the entranceway somebodys trying to get in dave whispered his eyes were dilated and his whole body tense its the police its tapping they are searching for the entrance nonsense i said its the girl open up dave no he cried no stand back his gun was pointed at my stomach he was so strung up i didnt dare move if id moved hed have fired i didnt tell the captain he whispered but when i was coming here i ran slap into the local bobby up on the main road it was i came that way because it was quicker than going round by the moors he was standing quite still fiddling with his bike i didnt see him until he shone his torch on me the tapping ceased there was a faraway distant sound it might have been water or it might have been somebody calling the thickness of the rock slabs deadened all sound it came again after that there was silence i looked at dave measuring the distance for a sudden spring i had to get to that girl but he saw my intention in my eyes and retreated to the far corner the gun levelled at me dave i said i must speak to that girl you stay where you are he ordered but good god i said what makes you think that was the police i tell you it was the girl she came to find me like she did earlier this evening indeed i hope youre right he sat down heavily on one of the cases my god i hope youre right he wiped the sweat from his face with a dirty rag of a handkerchief if that was the police he didnt finish what makes you think it was the girl there was a note of hope in his voice look i said the kids had a hell of a shock shes just discovered that old manack murdered her mother you dont say i told him the whole story then it was the only way i told him everything and when i had finished he said jim bach thats terrible it was incredible how emotional he was now will you let me go up and see the girl i asked im scared she may do something silly up there on her own he hesitated fear and love of the dramatic and the emotional were at odds in his mind i said for gods sake cant you see whats in her mind she feels that its her fault my mother went over the cliffs that day she needs me to tell her its all right if im not there i stopped then loath to put the thought into words he nodded and got up irresolutely i give you my word not to try to escape from you i said and if the police are around well come straight back okay he went over to the entrance and quietly eased back the bolts then he pushed back the top slabs and peered cautiously out i was right beside him the gallery was dark save for the light of our lamps on the rock wall immediately opposite the hideout it didnt take me long to go up the crosscut to the shaft and climb the stone sets to the top the moon had just set the seas horizon stood out sharp and black like a ruled line against the vague light left in the night sky the cliff tops were full of dark huddled shapes impossible to tell whether kitty was there or not i ran stumbling down to the sheds of the mine she wasnt there i started calling her name it came echoing back to me from stone heaps and ruined mine buildings but she did not answer i went down along the cliffs towards botallack head time and again i thought i saw her but it was only a bush or an old stone wall i didnt like that place at night it gave me the creeps it had been all right in full moonlight but in this halflight it seemed hostile and withdrawn into some primitive past of its own all those workings the sweat of thousands of men had gone into honeycombing these cliff tops ignoring daves protest i stumbled up and down along the top of those cliffs calling her name but never an answering call save for a distant owl i was beside myself kitty suddenly became very precious to me i needed her and i was afraid id lost her dave limping along behind caught up with me as i stood once again on the brink of the dark cliffs of botallack head the place fascinated me the long rollers marched in endless straight lines against the base of the cliffs black rocks showed in the boiling surf away to the left the old engine house stood like a castle outpost its brick chimney halfsmothered in spray i thought i saw a body down there on a sloping slab that gleamed dully with the water that poured off it i blinked and when i looked again it had gone the light played tricks i stepped back i dont suffer from vertigo but there was something about those cliffs they drew me dave caught hold of my arm its back to the house shes gone im thinking he said with all the quick sympathy of an emotional nature yes i said shes back at the house i turned away well go up and see i added and strode off inland to the track that ran up to cripples ease he raised no objection i could hear him limping along after me the light was fading out of the western sky it was getting darker every moment the ruin of the old mine workings seemed to jump at us out of the night strange blurred shapes that had no substance the lights of a car moving along the main road through botallack village threw cripples ease in sudden dark relief once more i felt that sense of unreality the building had conveyed that first night it had no right to be occupied in the midst of all this desolation it should have been allowed to disintegrate with the rest it was part of the past the lights of the car beside it swung in a great arc for a second i was looking straight into the beams of the headlights then they disappeared behind the house get down man dave called as i stood there dazed by the brilliance i dived behind a wall of ruined stonework the car was coming down the track towards the house dave crawled up and lay panting beside me what would a car be wanting here at this time of night he muttered the tremor of his voice betrayed the state of his nerves trippers coming back late from a dance i suggested not a bad place for necking but i dont think i believed that myself somehow i didnt see a young couple coming out here after the moon had set the headlights swung clear of the house the stones gleamed on the great heapedup piles alongside the workings i looked at dave i could see his face quite clearly it was white and his breath came quickly the car slowed down to a crawl as it came level with the house not fifty yards from where we lay hid the headlights swung away from us as the car turned finally it stopped its lights blazing full on the dark facade of cripples ease two men got out and went to the front door one wore uniform police dave whispered the bloke in plain clothes is a detective i nodded if theyd got anything on the captain theyd have brought more men and surrounded the place he added its suspicious they are thats all relief and fear showed themselves in his voice the two policemen waited in the doorway at last the door opened it was captain manack he had a dressinggown on over his pyjamas and he carried a lamp a few words and the two police officers went inside the light entered one of the front rooms i could see right into it for there were no curtains and the shutters were not closed it had apparently been the bar it did not appear to have been altered since the days when the house had been a pub even at that distance i could see the bar counter with shelves for bottles behind and a dartboard hanging on the wall above the fireplace captain manack went out a few minutes later he came back into the room and shortly afterwards slim entered followed by friar they were both in their night things then the old woman came in and finally kitty a great weight seemed lifted off my mind at the sight of her standing there in the doorway in her dressinggown she seemed heavy and tired her face was white and expressionless i couldnt bear to watch her being interrogated maybe we ought to get back to the hideout i suggested lie still man dave whispered urgently lie still and dont move they may have men posted all round with night glasses just lie still and wait for the better part of half an hour we lay there our stomachs pressed to the cold stones that became sharper as the minutes lengthened at last there was no one in the room but captain manack and the two officers all three were smoking then they went on the door closed and the house was black again the light appeared next at the front door the two policemen went across to their car i heard the plainclothes man say in quite a cheerful voice good night sir sorry we called so late thats all right captain manack answered good night there was the slam of doors as the policemen got into their car then the engine roared into life and at the same time a face appeared at the little dormer window at the top of the house i could see it quite clearly in the blaze of the headlights it looked white and strained and the beard was thrust between the bars i could see the old mans eyes then the car began to move the headlights swung away from the face of the house and i could no longer see the window the house was no more than a ghostly shadow in the sudden blackness we watched the car turn right on to the main road we followed its headlights all the way to st just and traced its movement right out along the penzance road only then would dave agree to move and return to the hideout so much had happened my brain was dazed the girl was safe to that extent at any rate my mind was at rest and i fell asleep with my clothes on i awoke at the faint sound of metal striking rock i was sweating and the air in the dugout was stale i rolled over and looked at my watch it was eightthirty dave was sitting on his bed rubbing his eyes his face was pale and beaded with sweat and there were dark rings under his eyes the slabs of the entrance were being struck from outside in the gallery it was a regular beat to the form of a signal dave went over and drew back the bolts the slabs swung back and captain manack came in he too looked tired and his hair stood straight up like fine wire he glanced quickly from one to the other of us had breakfast yet pryce he asked no i said i overslept so i see he was like an officer on a foot inspection his eyes took in the frousty disorder of the dugout at length they fixed themselves on dave who had retired to the farthest corner and sat biting his nails and casting surreptitious glances at his master manack moved towards him his eyes had a strange look i began to get my things together those eyes of his scared me i wondered how much of his fathers madness hed inherited he caught hold of dave by his collar and jerked him to his feet the police were here during the night the words were bitten short between his clenched teeth i thought you said nobody saw you coming here well you see i dont want any more of your lies he almost screamed shaking the little welshman to and fro it was amazing the strength he had in those thin arms you said you met no one but the local policeman of all people swears he saw you coming along the main road just outside botallack is that true answer did he see you yes i was going god in heaven captain manack cried and flung dave against the rock wall you fool why the hell didnt you tell me at least id have known what to expect he turned to me pryce he said youve got to be through to the sea bed tonight thats impossible i told him nothings impossible he barked make the preliminary charges bigger the arisaig will be off the adit at four tomorrow morning if the jobs done you sail with her if not he shrugged his shoulders then you take your chance in this country understand youll have friar to work with you on the drilling slim tanner and myself will clear the loose rock after each blow now get moving i took a can of bully some bread and a bottle of milk and joined slim and friar in the gallery outside as we went towards the gig i heard daves voice pitched high on a note of fear cry out thats not true i swear it isnt i didnt want to scare you unnecessarily look you it was dark and scare me captain manack laughed harshly i suppose an unexpected visit from the police at four in the morning is one of those little surprises that are expected to act as a sedative well now im going to do some scaring there was a sudden scream and then silence what the hells he done i asked friar he pushed me into the gig you dont want ter worry yer ead abat that he said slim threw over the lever and we rattled down into the depths of the mine e aint killed im if thats wots worryin yer friar shouted in my ear though gawd knows its wot e deserves four oclock in the bleedin mornin the police turns up thats a bastard hour fer hinterrogation how did captain manack explain my visit i asked the gig slowed up and came to rest at the bottom of the shaft easy friar answered as we stepped out told em the truth said yer was a deserter from italy wotd just come into the country told em youd come ter im fer elp because youd bin wiv im fer a short time in eighth army e said ed ad ter refuse yer and youd gorn orf in the direction of st just and dave tanner i asked there wasnt nuffink ter prove ed ever come dan ter cripples ease believe it or not the coppers adnt even got a search warrant they just questioned us and then left i was scared the old man would let somefink slip but when they card e was ill they let it go at that but theyll be back thats why the captings so keen ter get the ole thing finished an the arisaig away tonight an ruddy glad ill be when its done too i aint too keen on coppers in and at of the place like trippers we climbed on to the carriage slim pulled back on the lever and we started down the gallery i opened the can of bully and started my breakfast what was it you discovered last night friar i shouted through a mouthful of bread and corned beef friar glanced at me quickly wot dyer mean he asked last night whilst you were down the mine looking for the old man i shouted to him you discovered something fair makes me sweat to think about it thats what you said what was it ow dyou know wot i said he asked you wasnt wiv us no i answered but i went up for a breath of air i heard you talking amongst yourselves as you took old manack up to the house what had you found oh nuffink much friar turned his head away and made a pretence of being interested in the movement of the bearing against the rock walls there was more water comin into the mermaid than wed reckoned thats all that wouldnt scare me i shouted wot he gave me a quick glance let it go mate it aint important where did you find the old man up in the old workings he nodded yep i fell silent then watching that crazy contraption move steadily down the wet gallery that ran out under the sea my guess was theyd never been down the mermaid last night captain manack had known where his father had gone and hed made straight for the old workings i felt uneasy theyd discovered something something the old man had been up to fair makes me sweat to think about it i glanced closely at friar wondering whether he was thinking about it now he was staring in front of him his big calloused hand clenched on the guard rail well whatever theyd found the old man was out of harms way now the carriage slowed the great timber beams of the scaffolding showed in the lights of our lamps i went to have a look at the effect of the previous days blast the trickling sound of water was loud now that the carriage was not bumping and swaying along the ledges there were several inches of water on the floor of the gallery we sloshed through it the timbers across the pit were piled high with rubble the charge had blown out more than i had expected i directed the beam of my lamp to the roof everything was covered with a thick film of rock dust it had mingled with the water to form a slimy grey paste one of the scaffolding timbers had been split by the blast water streamed down from the shaft i picked up a piece of rock from the floor it was granite all right but it was streaked with basalt wots up mate friar asked the rocks weaker here i told him dangerous he asked maybe i said lets go up and have a look we set ladders up into the freshly blown section of the shaft and clambered up the rock was faulty you didnt need to be an expert to see that it was streaked with veins of basalt and cracked with the force of the explosion through a thousand minute crevices the water was seeping it splashed on our helmets on our upturned faces and sizzled as drops struck the naked flames of our lamps it streamed down the walls so that they glistened like burnished steel dont look too safe to me friar said ow much rock is there between us an the sea i glanced at the rock walls measuring with my eye the height added to the shaft by last nights blow about fifteen feet according to captain manacks reckoning i told him fifteen feet dont seem much he muttered i examined the rock again the roof of the shaft was no longer neatly cut out by the force of the charge it was broken and jagged two more blasts should do it i said two more his voice sounded doubtful blimey i aint sure i cares very much abat doin one more look at that crack there mate wide enough fer me ter put me fist into looks ter me as though the ole bleedin lotll fall away soon as we get the drill goin looks worse than it is i told him well drill the charge holes and then probe ahead with the long drill he caught hold of my arm and peered up into my face you ave done this sort o thing before aint yer i mean yer do know wot yer up ter scared i asked wot me he drew back angrily course i aint i just like ter know im workin wiv somebody wot knows his onions thats all within ten minutes we had the drill clamp fixed across the shaft then friar started up the compressor and the whole undersea gallery reverberated to the roar and chatter of the pneumatic drill by the time wed done two holes captain manack arrived with dave and slim they offloaded the compressor and then set to work loading the broken rock on to the carriage manack climbed up beside us hows it going he shouted i shut off the air getting pretty wet i said have you got the long drill do you want it immediately he asked no i replied but ill probe ahead as soon as weve finished the charge holes he nodded ill bring it down next time i come i want to get this rock clear now when will you be ready to blow i looked at my watch it was nearly ten midday i told him what are the chances of being through to the sea bed tonight all depends how quickly you can clear the debris i said reckon i can blast faster than you can clear trouble is it may not be a very neat job rocks faulty here he nodded and climbed down i turned on the air again the drill leapt in my hand and bored into the rock pieces flaked off nose eyes and mouth were full of rock dust despite the spray of water that hissed into the drill hole every few seconds i paused to examine the rock i was scared of a fall down below us captain manack stripped to the waist drove himself and the other two they were clearing the pile of rock fast he brought me two long drills when he returned from disposing of the first load of rock by eleventhirty i had finished the charge holes and friar and i started to drill the probing hole when the drill was only three feet in water began to trickle along my hand and down my upturned arms by the time the drill was full home there was a steady flow from the hole running out of it as though from a tap only half turned on i called to captain manack i think your figures are wrong i told him when hed clambered up on to the ladders beside us it may be due to the flaws in the rock but id say wed drilled pretty near to the sea bed he nodded asdic wouldnt take into account a deep fissure in the rock he said it gives you the general level of the sea bed you think well be through at this blow no i answered but we may come pretty near it and that may make it unsafe to do any more drilling i dont like this rock if you want my advice i added youll start the whole thing again somewhere else where the rock isnt faulty but he shook his head no time for that if im to run any more cargoes i must have this undersea route open ill take a chance on it opening with a clean break okay i said got the charges he went down and brought up the charges i tamped them into the charge holes the rock had all been cleared except for one great jagged piece too heavy to lift they were rigging a pulley we loaded the compressor and the tools i fixed the fuse and we tramped back along the gallery to the main shaft then manack thrust over the lever that operated the carriage haulage gear the hawser lifted out of the mud with a sucking sound tightened and began to reel in on the drum beside the water wheel we waited until the carriage appeared out of the gloom of the gallery then we went up to the surface in the gig as we went up i said supposing the police arrive and start searching the mine whos to warn us the girl he answered what makes you think she wouldnt give you away i asked him after what she heard last night she must hate the place he looked at me and smiled beneath his moustache shell warn us all right he said i dont see why she should i persisted dont you he laughed the harshness of it sounded above the noise of the gig wheels on their wooden runners shell do it for your sake my sake yes good god man dont say you havent realised shes in love with you why else do you think she went searching for you up in the old workings last night he put his hand on my arm you dont have to worry about that he said by daylight tomorrow youll be beating out past the scillies on the arisaig she doesnt know that of course and see you dont tell her not that youll be seeing her before you leave but if she heard about it well women are funny creatures look at the mess dave got himself into the callous way he spoke of it i could have killed him perhaps he saw how i felt for he said you stay down here till the jobs done the arisaig will be off the adit at four oclock i fixed that this morning and mulligan has his orders hell not interfere with either you or tanner ill bring you letters for the manager of my estate this evening believe me the sooner youre out of the country the better for you the gig stopped at the store gallery we all got out with the exception of captain manack he went on up to the surface i followed the others into the dugout i was thinking of kitty i had to get a message to her somehow but it was no use asking manack to take it friar was sorting through one of the cases of rations wot abat bully an apricots he suggested i caught hold of his arm you going to the house friar i asked he looked up no he said my orders is ter stay dan ere we starts work again soon as them charges is blown i sat down on the bed what the hell would kitty be thinking of me manack was right if she heard i was leaving on the arisaig in the early hours of the morning anything might happen i couldnt leave her here and hed said she loved me my god i needed somebody to love me i needed her i couldnt go on like this alone i thought of the hot moonlit nights in italy the women there were easy enough but a man needed something more than that of a woman if kitty were with me i got up and started pacing up and down the dugout i suddenly knew that i had to have kitty with me i wouldnt go without kitty it wasnt only that i needed her that i loved her it was the thought of her staying on up there in the house shed go mad shed brood and brood on what had happened and then it didnt bear thinking on i had to get her away from the place id refuse to go on with the job unless manack agreed to her leaving with me yes that was the answer id refuse to do the job for him aint yer feelin ungry friar asked me eh my mind was so full of my thoughts that i scarcely understood what he said wots got into yer pacin up an down like that yer aint worried abat that shaft are yer yer dont think itll collapse on us no i said no i wasnt thinking about that then sppose yer come an ave somefink to eat i took the plate of bully and bread that he offered me and at that moment there was the distant muffled sound of an explosion once again the dust rose with the blast of air that swept through the mine friar stood up the capting said we was to start again as soon as the charges ad exploded i said the dust would choke you we wouldnt be able to see a thing give it time to settle he hesitated then he shrugged his shoulders okay mate but youd better do the explainin ter the capting we finished our meal and then prepared to go down again i was just refilling my lamp with carbide when captain manack entered has the charge gone off yet he asked yes i said about twenty minutes ago then why the hell arent you down there getting on with it waiting for the dust to settle i told him to hell with the dust he cried angrily go on get on with it we havent time to waste worrying about dust you cant do much till the dust has laid a bit i answered he was about to make some angry retort but he thought better of it is the ol man still safely locked up friar asked yes was the reply we went down then i was still thinking about kitty id have to have it out with manack but i put it off id wait till we came to the last blow hed be easier to handle then when we reached the end of the mermaid we found it wetter than ever the fall had not been as heavy as id expected i climbed up into the shaft and found the reason we were through the faulty rock the roof was solid now with the exception of several deep fissures through which the salt water poured in a steady stream manack clambered up beside me how many more blastings he asked two at least i said the second going through to the sea bed possibly i said you can see the rock is more solid here he nodded and went down to help the others clear the rubble friar took his place beside me and we began to drill the charge holes it took longer this time and before wed finished the fifth hole the rock had all been cleared including the big piece we were alone with the roar of the compressor and the chatter of the drill as it ate into the rock face friar i noticed kept looking down and every time i switched off the air hed cock his head on one side listening what are you expecting i asked nothing he said quickly nothing his face was running with sweat he wiped it off with a brightly coloured handkerchief ow many more ruddy oles are yer goin ter drill he asked three more i said why oh i just wondered his manner was a little too offhand there was something on his mind whats worrying you i asked nothing he turned back to the rock face come on fer gawds sake lets get on with it i put my hand on his shoulder and turned him towards me whats on your mind friar i asked nothing he replied savagely nothing come on lets get crackin sooner the seas in this ere ruddy gallery the better ill be pleased we drilled the remaining three holes and i fixed the charges then we drilled to the limit of the long drill water poured down the drill and on to our arms but it was not a steady stream only a trickle we werent through to the sea bed as i tamped down the charges friar stood back and gazed down to where manack and the others were replacing the timbers that covered the pit wish ter gawd ed ave somebody stay up at the ase he muttered what are you worried about i said the police yep the perlice an that crazy ol man i dont like it i tell yer straight i dont like it ere we are cooped up dan ere an nobody up top to give us warnin cept the girl anything might appen i stopped then and looked at him he turned away and pretended to adjust his lamp whats on your mind friar i asked there aint nuffink on me mind i took hold of his arm he was getting on my nerves theres something you know and i dont i said what is it it aint nuffink he pulled his arm free its me nerves thats all all very well fer you youre a miner i aint used to this sort o work gives me the willies thats wot it does it aint natural like ter be standing ere breaving gods air when were right underneath the sea he handed me another charge i tamped it home but my mind wasnt on the job he was scared not just scared because he was working down here under the sea he was scared because he knew something something that threatened us i thought of the conversation id overheard the previous night see you dont mention it to pryce i dont want him scared thats what manack had said i glanced at friar the sweat glistened on his neck as he bent to unscrew the drill clamp his eyes met mine and turned away quickly his hands fumbled he was a bundle of nerves and when wed fixed the charges his haste to get out of the mermaid gallery was so marked that it would have been funny had i not felt the threat of something i did not know about the gig stopped as before at the gallery leading to the hideout we all got out with the exception of manack ill be back in a few minutes with some tea he said the others went on up the gallery i hesitated then i turned to manack will you be seeing kitty i asked he nodded his eyebrows lifting slightly then tell her to be ready to leave with me tonight i said im taking her with me youll do nothing of the sort he snapped his eyes flashing angrily the arisaig isnt a refugee ship mulligan wouldnt stand for a woman on board ill look after mulligan i said we faced each other sullenly for a second neither speaking i was cursing myself for putting it the way i had i should have flattered his sense of power by appealing to him to allow her to come with me instead id imposed it on him as a decision already made id have to make it an ultimatum now either she comes with me i said or else or else what he snarled or else the mermaid stays like she is i see his eyes were furious see here captain manack i said the girl cant stay on in that house not after what shes heard it wouldnt be safe for you in any case im offering you the easy way out what about it his face relaxed he hesitated then he nodded all right pryce he said maybe its all for the best but its up to you to make your peace with mulligan all right thanks i said you wont forget to tell her will you and tell her im sorry about last night i was going to meet her down by the mine buildings explain why i couldnt will you all right he said and the gig rattled up to the surface the charges exploded just after fivethirty a few minutes later captain manack returned with two big thermos flasks of hot tea police been around at all slim asked no wot abat the ol man friar put in did yer see im wane locked up orl right of course manack answered sharply and out of the tail of my eye i saw him jerk his head significantly in my direction he was clearly angry with friar for putting the question as slim poured out the tea manack came over to me he had a bulky envelope in his hand there you are pryce he said handing it to me theres letters of instruction there to mulligan and carlo forzala the manager of my estate theres also two hundred and fifty quid in pound notes thanks i said what about the girl did you see her yes he said what did she say she said shed like to see you before you go is that all he nodded didnt she make any comment you did tell her that i wanted her to come to italy with me yes i told her how did you put it to her i didnt trust him you tried to put her off i accused him dont be a fool he answered angrily what did you expect the kids scarcely been out of botallack itd suit me if she did go with you shes good looking enough to cause trouble sooner or later see her before you go maybe youll be able to make her change her mind itd help if you were offering to marry her x but hell i hadnt thought about it hed turned away now and i sat down and glanced through the package the letters seemed okay i folded the envelope and tucked it into my body belt as soon as we had finished tea we went back to the mermaid the fall of rock was about the same as before the water was seeping in faster and the pit below the boards was a small lake friar and i rerigged the ladders whilst the others cleared the rock from the timbers covering the pit as i worked away with the drill i noticed friar getting more and more nervy and when the others had left with the first load and we were alone up there on the torn scaffolding he became really scared at length i shut off the air and said for gods sake friar whats wrong with you wot yer mean he asked his eyes darting towards the gallery below us there aint nothing wrong wiv me but his eyes were wide and his breathing heavy and all the time i felt he was listening for something though with the roar of the compressor it was impossible to hear anything go on he said get on wiv it cant yer whats the hurry i asked i told yer i dont like workin dan ere the sooner im hup top again the appier ill be thats all is this the last blow i dont know i said maybe then i caught hold of him by the shoulders listen friar i said theres something worrying you that i dont know about suppose you tell me what it is and when he didnt reply i said im not doing any more drilling till i know it isnt the water above us youre scared of its something back there in the mine what did you discover last night i shook him angrily you discovered something what was it and why are you worried about the old man being locked up safe its something to do with the old man isnt it slowly he nodded his head well come on out with it i said you cant expect me to work down here with you knowing what the danger is come on what are you scared of i aint scared he whimpered honest i aint his adams apple jerked up and down as he swallowed its just that he hesitated then his eyes looked straight at me you wont tell the captain will yer of course not i said okay well this is wot appened las night we came dan the mine ter find the ol man remember the capting seemed ter know where ed be e took us straight up into the old workings we ad ter crawl on our bellies through a ruddy tunnel no biggern a tree trunk e led us right back where the mine narrers between botallack and come lucky thats where we fand the ol man ed got a biddle an a pile o drills an e was ammering is way into the rock face at the end of a gallery fair swimmin in water that gallery was wot are you doin the capting asks im making sure youll not be lettin the sea into the mermaid the ol man answers wild like we took him at then mad as a coot thats wot e is slim ast the capting wot e reckoned the ol man was up ter the capting said e didnt know but e did an so did i so did slim too we was right under come lucky in that gallery wot the ol man was doing was breaking a way fru into the flooded mine water was fair rushin dan that gallery if ed made a breach itd ave come roarin right through the mine at ere we wouldnt ve stood a chance so that was it no wonder he was scared i lit a cigarette yer wont say anyfink abat it to the capting will yer he said i didnt oughterve told yer no i wont say anything i told him the carriage came rattling back along the gallery we could hear it even above the roar of the compressor we started drilling again by the time the debris had all been cleared and the compressor loaded on the carriage we had finished the charge holes and were working with the long drill but still we werent through to the sea bed though there was plenty of water about manack climbed up beside us well he shouted shall we make it this time i pulled the drill clear and told friar to go and shut the compressor off no i told manack itll be the next blasting he glanced at his watch youll be running it a bit fine he said its past nine already i shrugged my shoulders cant be helped i said even if i put heavy charges in i dont think itd break through it wouldnt be a neat job anyway the compressor engine slowed and coughed into silence the sudden quiet was uncanny the trickling sound of water whispered through the gallery we went back to the dugout then and waited for the blast of the charges manack didnt go up to the house this time though friar suggested twice that he ought to we were all a bit jittery at last it came a dull distant thud then the blast of air we only waited ten minutes then we went down in the gig and stumbled along the mermaid gallery through choking clouds of dust it clogged nose and mouth and hurt the eyes i could feel the grit in my teeth and on my tongue we were walking this time leaving slim behind to run the carriage out i dont know what i expected we must be very close to the sea bed now i wouldnt have been surprised to find the gallery blocked by sea water but it wasnt we went on down till the dripping walls told us we were under the sea the gallery was still open i dont know how the others felt but my nerves were strung taut as i walked down that gallery i didnt know what thickness of rock now stood between us and the sea and thats a frightening thought to a miner at length we reached the new fall i flashed my lamp up into the dark hole of the shaft water was seeping through from a number of places it glistened silvery in the light our gum boots stood six inches deep in a muddy grey lake captain manack rang slim and told him to send the carriage down the hawser sucked clear of the muddy stream as it pulled taut water dripped from it friar and i set the ladders up and climbed into the shaft a loose bit of rock crashed down narrowly missing my head water poured over me the rock looked pretty thin friar close behind me said gawd an ter think theres fishes and things swimmin arand just above our heads i didnt say anything no need to tell him i didnt like it the carriage arrived with the compressor manack came up as we were getting the drill clamp fixed he looked at me he was enough of an engineer to realise that the creviced roof of rock wasnt any too safe there were great cracks in it and the water came through in a steady stream i sent friar down to start up the compressor better take it easy when you start drilling manack said i nodded ill put double charges this time i said right ill have this rock cleared as fast as i can this is no place to hang around he grinned and clapped me on the shoulder dont take any risks he said the compressor started up drowning all other sound i watched him climb down the jagged rent of the shaft crazy reckless and unscrupulous he might be but he knew how to handle men friar climbed up beside me and we started drilling the time was then just eleven for two hours we worked in that cramped space thrusting that bucking drill into the watery rock face each time i thrust it home to the hilt my heart was in my mouth once a whole section of rock broke away crushing the ladder on which friar stood he only saved himself by hanging on to the drill clamp if id any sense id have refused to go on but then manack wasnt the sort of man to stand for that he came up to have a look more than once and each time i sensed the intense excitement in him this was the sort of thing he enjoyed by one oclock theyd finished clearing the debris from below the shaft once when i looked down i caught daves eyes glancing nervously up at the shaft the water was rising it was almost to the top of his gum boots his face looked white in the orange glow of the lamps they cleared the planks from above the pit friar glanced nervously down at the black expanse of water below us aint we nearly finished yet he asked his face was streaked with wet rock dust and his eyes looked fever bright with nervous exhaustion only one more i said then somebody shouted down below i could just hear it above the roar of the compressor i looked down captain manack was on the far side of the pit the side where the telephone was he seemed excited and he was giving orders to slim who glanced quickly up in our direction friar suddenly pulled at my sleeve somefinks up he yelled his voice was high pitched almost a scream manack scrambled along one of the ledges slim turned and vanished into the gallery dave followed casting one quick frightened glance in our direction manack scrambled up the scaffolding and on to the ladders in the shaft how many more he shouted the question into my ear his voice was steady and controlled one i told him okay he said well get everything ready as soon as youve placed the charges ring slim at the bottom of the shaft hell bring you in on the carriage with the compressor i nodded he patted me on the shoulder and disappeared down the shaft then i started the airflow again and began to drill the last hole i was halfway through when friar began tugging at my arm i stopped the drill somefinks wrong he said sheer terror showed in his eyes he was trembling he was sweating so much that the water ran off his face as though it had a film of oil on it i dont like it he screamed theyve all gone i looked down the gallery was dark there was nothing there but the roar of the compressor whyve they left us he cried its a trap he swung round on me shaking with fear i tell yer its a trap he started down the ladder then i caught him by the shoulder dont be a fool i said leave go of me he shouted i tell yer he means ter kill us hes goin ter let the sea in wiv us dan ere i pulled him back were the only people who can let the sea in i shouted now pull yourself together i shook him till i was afraid id throw him off the ladder at length he quietened down his eyes became more normal nothing can happen to us so long as this rock stands between us and the sea understand he nodded all right then lets finish this hole when the drill had gone in upto the hilt i sent him down to stop the compressor in the sudden silence he called up to me the waters rising he said its over two feet deep i said bring the charges up i wanted to get it over no he said no i aint stayin any longer you stay if yer like but ive ad enough im going back up the shaft come back friar i shouted no he shouted no i aint never comin back dan ere his voice faded away down the gallery i climbed down the charges were lying on the carriage alongside the compressor i picked them up then i hesitated the place was deathly quiet save for the sound of the water there was no light but my own far away down the halfflooded gallery friars lamp flickered in the water the stillness and the sense of being deserted was overwhelming i put the charges down and climbed on to one of the ledges when i dropped off the ledge on the other side of the pit the water came in over the top of my gum boots i pulled back the rock and wound the handle of the field telephone there was no answer i tried again and again no answer and all about me the water trickled and dripped i glanced up at the dark hole of the shaft should i go up there again and fix the charges i thought i could feel the rock splintering under the strain my nerves sensed the weight of the water on that thin shield of rock i was sweating and i wanted to start running down the gallery i got a grip on myself it had held for two hours and all that time wed been drilling if it held then itd hold now i was being a fool it was just that fear was catching if only slim had answered the phone but probably they hadnt had time to get back to the main shaft i literally forced myself to go back along the ledge get the charges and climb into the shaft twice i paused every nerve in my body screamed at me to go back but each time i made myself go on at last i was up there with the thin sheet of rock pouring water over my face and hands i started tamping the charges home they were double charges this time the work quietened my nerves i concentrated all my mind on the task of fixing those charges suddenly a new sound invaded the dripping stillness i stopped my work and listened there it was again it was like a bell ringing had the air pressure suddenly increased making my ears sing suppose the gallery leading up to come lucky had given way the old man had been drilling into the face of it friar had said he might have weakened it if the water from come lucky was flooding into the mermaid gallery the air pressure would rise making my ear drums sing my hands trembled at the thought i could feel the sweat forcing its way out through the pores of my skin i listened for the distant roar of water pouring down the gallery but everything was quiet only the drip of water and the insistent sound of that bell some trick of the rock perhaps i flashed my lamp on the roof of the shaft the fissures gaped wide water hissed on the flame of my lamp i licked my lips they were wet and salt from the water that fell on my face and still that bell kept ringing in my ears it was so indistinct that it was scarcely audible above the sound of the water imagination perhaps and yet i thought of all the cases id heard of miners being warned of disaster often it was a noise that warned them some sixth sense some change of the air pressure making their heads sing the sound was still there insistent urgent as though it had a message for me and then suddenly i remembered the telephone i dropped the charge i was holding and scrambled down the ladder i fell the last few feet splashing into the water below me i staggered to my feet there at the end of the gallery a red light glowed just above the place where the telephone was concealed i laughed out loud so that the sound of my own voice startled me the relief made me feel light headed i waded to one of the ledges my gum boots heavy with water i climbed along it to the telephone but it wasnt slims voice who answered me as i picked up the receiver it was kittys its you jim she said oh thank god i didnt know what had happened they all came out except you and friar ive been ringing and ringing her voice sounded nervous and she was panting whats happened i asked nothing she said it was only that i got worried when i saw them coming up out of the gallery captain manack seemed almost almost scared i wanted to make certain that you were all right yes im all right i said why did manack come up i rang him about ten minutes ago anything wrong nothing serious only that old mrs brynd let his father out of that room the old man came straight down the mine i saw him going down you mean old manacks escaped i shouted and hes in the mine yes she answered the strength drained suddenly out of my joints i glanced into the dark tunnel that stretched away ahead of me any moment i expected to hear the roar of water listen kitty i said urgently go straight up to the surface understand get straight up to the surface i didnt wait to hear her reply i dropped the receiver and scrambled back along the ledge beyond the pit i dropped to the floor of the gallery and ran splashing and stumbling through the water down the long tunnel that led to safety chapter ten come lucky i thought that gallery would never end my breath came in great gasps i ran as i had never run before the sweat poured from me i got clear of the water as the gallery sloped upwards but my gum boots were like lead i had to stop and tip the water out of them those precious seconds wasted seemed like years any minute i expected to hear the distant thud of an explosion and the rumble of water tearing into the mine suddenly a light showed ahead i hadnt the strength to call out it remained stationary as i pounded up the slope of the gallery a voice called out is that you jim it was kittys voice the little fool had stayed down get to the surface i gasped she didnt move get up to the surface i shouted again the effort of speech hurt my throat the blood was pounding in my ears and my chest heaved still she didnt move whats happened she asked as i came up with her you look as though youve seen a ghost what is it come lucky i answered seizing her arm i saw her eyes widen as she realised what i meant then we were running side by side along the gallery we reached the shaft that led up to the adit i hesitated but the desire to make height was overwhelming i thrust her to the ladder we climbed at a furious rate even so she outstripped me my limbs felt weighed down with a great weight id been working steadily all day and now this sudden demand on my strength i felt so tired i thought id never make the top the steady beat and thud of the pump coincided with the throbbing of the blood in my ears we made the top at the same moment a voice shouted a miners lamp showed the great bob of the pump swinging rhythmically up and down then the lamp ducked under the bob and came running towards us i have a fleeting recollection of old manacks face streaked with sweat and dirt and pallid with exertion then he brushed past us and another lamp appeared beyond the great bobbing beam of the pump stop him it was captain manacks voice his face was set and his eyes wild as he dashed past us after his father i took kitty by the arm and rushed her down the narrow crosscut and out into the main adit i could hear the sea slopping about in the adit cave and behind me the pump beats thudded like the beating heart of the mine i turned up the adit towards the main shaft ahead of us the lamps of the two manacks bobbed as they turned a bend we followed i couldnt hear the pump any longer all i could hear was the heaving gasps that came from my mouth as i strained my last effort we rounded the bend the lights had vanished but a faint orange glow showed in the shaft that the old man used we reached it and peered up the lamps showed like glowworms in the shaft the old man was about forty feet above his son water glistened on the weedgrown rock they were climbing at a furious rate i thrust kitty towards the ladders she began to climb i followed her i had barely set foot on the slimy rungs of the ladder when deep within the mine there was a muffled roar it was far away remote as the echo of a minor earthquake i paused listening for what i dreaded a blast of air struck my face it smelt stale and dank it was like air that had been imprisoned long under ground and then i heard it a faint rumbling roar another lighter blast of air swept up the shaft behind us bringing with it a choking cloud of dust deep in the mine the rumbling went on it was like the rumblings of some giants belly it was crude and terrifying something fell past me and hit the ground below with a splintering of wood i glanced down a length of ladder lay broken at the foot of the shaft its rotten timbers shattered by the fall high above us i saw the old man still climbing but below his son had stopped a great strip of laddering had been torn away and in that instant a sudden gush of dirty water spurted from the side of the shaft i saw captain manack swept from his hold on the ladder like a fly brushed off by a hose jet then the water hit me and i fell a body crashed on top of me as my feet hit the ground i fell rolled over and fetched up with a terrific crack on my helmet against a rock wall everything was black the whole place was full of the sound of water pouring from a height and behind that sound was the deeper more distant rumbling of water tearing through the mine something heavy lay across my legs it stirred jim it was kittys voice strained to a shriek are you all right i shouted yes oh thank god youre all right i found her hand and we got to our feet the noise of the water was terrific quick i cried that main shaft have you got a match ive got a torch she shouted back the beam leapt out in the darkness showing a solid fall of water pouring down the shaft there was no sign of captain manacks body he must have been swept away in the brown flood that poured down the adit run i shouted and we started off up that adit to the main shaft as we ran the sound of the water pouring down the shaft lessened instead the muffled roar of the come lucky flood ripping into wheal garth became louder as we came to the main shaft a soft glow showed in the darkness ahead i heard the rattle of the gigs wheels the glow brightened the gigs coming kitty shouted i flung myself at the lever which would stop it at our level i threw all my weight on it but it wouldnt budge the gig reached our level i had a glimpse of friar slim and dave huddled together in the light of their miners lamps slim had hold of the lever which kept the gig moving that was why i hadnt been able to shift the lever at our own level stop i shouted friar for gods sake stop they saw us i could see their eyes bright with fear they saw us but they didnt stop slim kept hold of the operating lever friar made a move towards the lever then he stopped staring out at us with his mouth open and his eyes staring with horror dave stood there biting his nails and making no move the gig rattled past the glow faded rage dominated all other emotions it swelled up inside me so that i felt i could tear down the timbers that formed the runway for the gig up the shaft i stumbled to the framework and tore at the wood with my bare hands then as the light of their lamps slowly dwindled up the shaft my rage subsided and cold fear took its place i turned to kitty she was standing quite still as though stunned by what had happened theyve left us to die she said isnt there some other way up i cried there must be some other way she shook her head there must be but i dont know of any there are plenty of shafts but none that we could climb without she suddenly broke off listening the sound of the gig had ceased down the shaft came shouts i peered upwards the lights of their lamps were still visible the gig was motionless pryce pryce one of them was calling what is it i shouted back the gig has stuck came back the answer faintly try to work it your end i thrust over the lever it went over quite easily now but nothing happened whats wrong kitty asked i tried the lever again the waters got down to the bottom of the main shaft i told her its stopped the wheel from turning then suddenly an idea burst upon me fool why hadnt i thought of that before except for odd shafts there was only that one way into the old workings by come lucky i listened the distant roar of water pouring through the mine seemed fainter it was finding its way direct to the lower level quick i said catching hold of kittys arm the sea we started running down the adit the shouts of the three men trapped in the main shaft faded can you swim i gasped out the question as we ran yes she answered we stumbled on the beam of her torch cutting a swathe in the darkness of the tunnel the sound of water grew louder then we saw it coming down the shaft wed tried to climb the volume was not so great now the main weight of the water was probably finding other outlets we waded into the brown flood that swept down the adit i gripped kittys hand she didnt say anything but i felt the answering grip of her fingers my god when i think of it now it needed nerve to go down and not up to go down into the race of swirling brackish ochrecoloured water but she didnt hesitate ill admit my heart was in my mouth the noise of water closed in around us blocking out the sound of the flood breaking through the mine we reached the crosscut that led to the pump and the shaft down to the mermaid gallery vaguely i heard the pump beats they were slow and laboured i stumbled and almost fell kitty shone the torch down into the ochre stream a piece of ladder was jammed across the tunnel and by the wall to my right a hand was thrust up from the water i caught it and pulled captain manacks head rose above the level of the water it lolled loosely like some frightful doll the teeth were bared and the eyes glazed his neck was broken we went on then there was no smell of the sea i was scared the weight of water had already filled the adit the floor of the tunnel dipped sharply down to the adit mouth the brown flood through which we waded deepened and moved faster the sound of it became like a roar of a waterfall in that confined space i kept tight hold of kittys hand it was difficult to prevent our feet being swept from under us at any moment the weight of water pouring into the lower levels of the mine might flood it to sea level then the full volume of it would come pouring down this adit the tunnel widened and the torch suddenly showed the dark cavern where the sea came in but there was no sign of the flat rock slab of the landing place it was covered by a bubbling froth of filthy liquid and where a narrow opening should have led through to the sea there was only the sloping roof of the cave i looked at kitty she met my gaze i made a motion with my hand indicating wed have to dive and swim under water through the adit mouth it was impossible to speak in that din of roaring water she nodded her grip tightened for a second on my hand and then released it and slipped off her overalls and gum boots i did the same then we stood there hesitating she was looking at me her eyes wide hurry i shouted she couldnt hear but i think she must have understood from the movement of my lips for she nodded again and handed me the torch as our hands touched she suddenly came close to me and kissed me then she stood back looking at the brown froth of water that filled the cave she stood hesitating for a second and then quickly spreading her hands dived in i saw her head for a second in the scum as the water bore her towards the exit her hair hung like strands of seaweed in the bubbling froth and her face was white against the dark heaving bulk of the water then she dived i waited but she did not reappear my ears suddenly began to sing there was a great roaring behind me i halfturned i knew what it was i knew that the water had risen above sea level that it was in the adit and roaring down towards the sea i crammed my helmet tight on my head and with the torch still in my hands dived straight out for the entrance as i hit the water there was a great roaring sound in my ears i could see nothing though the torch was still in my hands i kept my head down thrusting deeper with my legs and let the water do the rest i felt myself flung forward my head fetched up with a terrific jolt against rock only my helmet saved me from having my skull stove in my back was keelhauled along a slanting face of rock i felt myself being sucked down and down my hand struck a rock the pain of it jarred along my arms then i seemed quite stationary yet i knew i was being thrust along by the weight of water behind me my ears stabbed with pain a great band tightened about my chest the desire for air became my whole world then i was being pushed upwards i thrust up with my hands and feet an instant later i was gasping on the surface a wave lifted me and broke with a crash the backwash of it carried me clear of the dark shadow of the cliffs gasping in a smother of foam i swallowed water and choked with the salt of it the next wave bore down on me broke and carried me struggling towards the cliff my feet touched rock for an instant then the backwash carried me clear again i tore off the helmet which was still jammed tight on my head then i took a deep breath and burying my head in the surf summoned my last ounce of energy to crawl clear of the break of the waves one five ten minutes i dont know how long it took me to get clear my clothes clung to me hampering my movements and the seething welter of water seemed intent on flinging me against the cliffs but at last i was clear and trod water gently rising and falling with the waves behind me the dark wall of the cliffs towered into the night frilled at the base with a raging inferno of surf i began to shout but my voice was lost in the roar of the surf spilling across the rocks then i found i still had the torch it was in my trouser pocket when id put it there i dont remember probably just before i started to swim clear of the break i switched it on it still worked the friendly beam swept across the heaving seas an instant later i heard a feint cry an arm showed upthrust from the top of the wave a little further out i swam on kitty met me she had a cut on the side of her head and one shoulder was bleeding but she was treading water easily and smiled as i swam up all right i asked her she nodded youre bleeding she said so are you i answered and got a mouthful of water from a broken wave cap we laughed we were alive it was good to laugh we laughed till a wave rolled right over us then we didnt laugh any more the tide was setting towards kenidjack castle and we were being swept in towards the headland i stripped off all but my pants kitty got out of her skirt and then we settled down to swim for it the tide was setting fast and we were tired there was no chance of going with the current that way we should have landed on the jagged rocks at the foot of the headland we swam straight out to sea kitty was a strong swimmer and she was fresher than i was we kept a steady pace side by side and all the time i watched the surf boiling at the foot of the headland it was astonishing how rapidly it seemed to come towards us the ugly black teeth of rock grinned at us the surf slavered through them as though waiting to tear our bodies to pieces it came nearer and nearer then we were in the break of the waves diving through them and swimming for our lives for a moment i thought we wouldnt make it i could feel the undertow clutching at my body as wave after wave thundered down on us then we were out of the surf and treading water with the headland receding slowly from us kitty swam up beside me i think she must have realised how tired i was for she said can you make the shore now theres a little beach right in under the headland okay i said and we began to swim again that was the longest swim i ever did the current was not so strong now but it was still setting south along the coast and we were trying to swim straight in on the lee side of kenidjack castle at last we were in the break of waves again but there was no strength in them now and they carried us the way we wanted to go i trod water between the waves and then went in with a crawl as each one broke over me at last my hand downthrust to drive me forward touched rock i caught hold and clung to it as the surf receded the next wave carried me in and i felt pebbles under my feet a moment later i joined kitty up the narrow beach clear of the sea i lay down on the cold pebbles my chest heaving as though it would burst a cold wind blew in from the sea it was damp and chill under the cliffs i sat up the waves thundered in long lines of broken surf the water sucked and gurgled in the rocks the moon had set but there was still light enough in the clear sky to see the outline of kenidjack castle hunched against the stars i looked at kitty she was breathing heavily and her teeth chattered her slip clung close to her body emphasising her strong build her breasts rose and fell i reached out and took her hand she smiled but didnt say anything there was nothing to say wed been lucky damned lucky i suddenly remembered those three men going up the shaft in the gig i struggled to my feet god i was weary come on i said youll get cold here and we must see if we can do anything about the gig she nodded and rose to her feet you dont think the water will reach them there do you i dont know i said depends how high the water level was in come lucky has it been wet here during the past week yes she said very wet and come luckys a big mine much bigger than wheal garth only that one adit to drain wheal garth i asked yes thats the only one come on then i said we must hurry that water will rise fast we went along the beach climbed a shoulder of rock and then struggled up a long grassy slope to a path that led to the rock crest of the headland at the top we passed an old rifle range and then reached the first of the ruined engine houses kitty struck away to the right up the slope of the worked hillside to another track a few minutes later the huddled shape of the sheds at the top of wheal garth rose up out of the darkness we went straight into the hoisting shed i forced open the doors and peered down the sloping shaft far below a glow of light outlined the top of the gig and out of the shaft came the sound of men singing they were singing good king wenceslas it was a strange choice dave was leading them his voice came floating up the shaft clear as a bell he had a nice voice i shouted down to them but they went on singing i waited until they came to the end of a verse and then called down to them again the singing started up again and then subsided i called again a voice answered it was very faint i called down what do you need the answer came floating back up the shaft the words were indeterminate i think they said that the water was rising but i couldnt be sure i turned to kitty is there some rope here i shouted yes she said in the stone shed ill get it i followed her there were tools too i took two saws and an axe and with a coil of rope over my shoulders ran back to the shaft i lowered the tools on the end of the rope but the shaft was at an angle and they kept on getting caught on ledges of rock and on the timber framework of the hoist the men below started shouting and banging on the wooden cage of the gig then one of them began to scream it was a horrible sound it ceased suddenly and daves voice began to sing jerusalem the sound of the lovely hymn floated up the shaft with a thousand distorting echoes so that it sounded like a choir singing in a cathedral then suddenly the sound tailed off and vanished a mans voice began to shout it rose to a scream and then vanished in a gurgle as though he had been throttled leaning out peering down the shaft i saw the light had faded to a faint glow then it was suddenly snuffed out like a candle i called but there was no answering cry from the black depths of the shaft i stood up then and closed the wire mesh gates wed better go up to the house now i said kitty nodded she seemed dazed with the horror of listening to those men being drowned by the rising water i took her arm and we went out into the cool salt wind the house was in darkness as we topped the rise it was just a black shadow sprawling there in the blackness of the night i felt the girls body tense as she saw it god how she must loathe the place cripples ease it was a name that suited it it must have been a bitter and cynical landlord who called it that in the days when the miners from botallack used it as a pub we came to the track and started across it to the front door of the house and then i stopped the door was wide open and a figure moved in the darkness of the passage it vanished we crossed the track close to the desolate little garden that had once flowered under my mothers hands a light showed in the passage we both stopped then rooted to the spot it was old manack he held a lamp in his hands and was gazing out of the doorway towards us his mouth open and a wild look of horror in his eyes i started to move forward no he screamed no he leapt back and the door swung to blotting out the light there was the rattle of a chain and then the bolts were shot home i turned to kitty maybe he thought we were ghosts i said she was trembling she looked like a ghost her hair hanging in sodden strands over her pale face and the slip clinging like a white shroud to her body come on i said we need dry clothes then well go go she said where to italy i said didnt you get my message i asked captain manack to tell you i was leaving on the arisaig tonight and to ask you whether you would come with me remember yes i she stood very still as though petrified i oh jim i dont know what to say i cant stay here i know that but italy it seems so far couldnt we stay somewhere in cornwall dont forget im still a deserter i said and the police are looking for me the arisaig will be off wheal garth i looked at my watch it was still going the time was just after three in less than an hour its my only hope i took her by the shoulders ive got to be on that ship i said its my one way out of the country i dont want to go back to italy but id rather do that than serve a sentence for desertion and possibly get involved with whats happened here they might hang me no they wouldnt do that you havent done anything true but theres only my word for that dont forget four revenue officers lost their lives ive got to go kitty say youll come it wouldnt be so bad with you she hesitated then she raised her head her eyes looked into mine in the gloom youll not desert me jim of course not i said promise i promise all right then ill come i kissed her gently on the forehead soon as we can find a ship well go to canada i can always get work in the mines we went round to the back of the house and entered by the kitchen old mrs brynd was seated in her usual chair by the fire she started up as we entered whats happened she asked in a quavering voice i know something terrible has happened what is it tednt no use lyin to me i can tell from the looks of ee that somethings happened its all right mrs brynd kitty said the old woman sat down in her chair again the masters come back she muttered in a dreadful state he was now dont you fret kitty said better get some dry clothes on i told kitty anything you want to take bundle into an oilskin well have to swim for it unless theres some place where a boat can come in not with the wind in the souwest she answered ill do as you say what about you ill get you some of old mr manacks clothes no ill get them i said all right she said its the first on the left at the top of the stairs i lit a spare lamp and went out into the corridor a light glowed on the landing above i started up the stairs but as i reached the bend i stopped the old man was standing there a lamp in his left hand and the little mining pick held in his right we stood there looking at each other for a moment then i started up the stairs again he halfraised the pick the steel of it gleamed in the lamplight it was a vicious little weapon his eyes watched me as i came up the stairs he was trembling and he kept passing his tongue across his lips as i came round the bend of the stairs a shiver seemed to run through him he gave a little moan like an animal thats been hurt then he turned and stumbled down the corridor i heard his feet on the bare stairboards leading to the attic room as i reached the top of the stairs i went after him up the staircase to the room where he had put my mother he was standing there in the middle of the bare room behind him was the ironbarred window he was still trembling i pulled the door to the key with which mrs brynd had opened it for him was still in the lock i turned it the hatch was open he hadnt moved he just stood there the lamp in his hand i went back down the little staircase then in his room i found all i wanted i towelled myself down and changed into dry clothes i found some oilskins and a souwester i made a bundle of them and went downstairs to his sons office his desk was almost clear of papers and the safe door was closed i had expected that he would have got rid of all dangerous papers and hidden his surplus cash i was looking for something quite different i found it in the bottom drawer of the desk under a pile of bills it was a service pattern revolver there were rounds for it in a cardboard box i loaded the weapon and slipped it inside the oilskins i wasnt taking any chances with mulligan there was a tap at the door and kitty entered she had on a brown tweed suit and her hair was brushed back and tied with a ribbon she had a bottle in her hand and a glass i thought youd need a drink she said hesitantly what is it scotch she nodded and poured me out half a tumblerful there drink that up she said you need it after all youve done today ill say i do she gave me the glass and i took a big gulp i could feel the fiery liquid running down into my stomach i gasped and drank again what about you i asked you need some too yes she said perhaps i do i passed her the tumbler she took a sip at it and made a wry face go on i said itll keep you warm she nodded and drank again her face flushed and she gasped i took the glass from her and finished it off wed better get moving i said looking at my watch it was a quarter to four what about mr manack ive locked him in upstairs come on i picked up a torch that was lying on a table tested it and then followed her out into the passage she got a small bundle of things wrapped in oilskins from the kitchen and joined me we left the house by the front door and went straight down through the shadowy outlines of the ruined mine workings as we started down the slope i turned and looked back cripples ease lay like a dark shadow against the night sky only one light burned there that was in the little room at the top the bars were clearly visible and behind them inside the room the old mans shadow moved back and forth across the ceiling as he paced the floor i went on then down the slope my face turned to the clean wind that came up from the sea the ruined buildings seemed remote and primitive they stood there like decaying tombstones marking the passage of generations of miners they were the only indications of the honeycomb of workings running deep down below the cliffs and out under the sea i shivered and tried to forget about the events of the last few hours it was like a nightmare something that only existed in the imagination but the old engine house built of great granite slabs which came to meet us out of the darkness reminded me that it was all real enough that manack and friar and slim and dave were not the first men to die like rats beneath the ground we walked on i was glad to be going im a cornishman and a miner but by god i tell you i was glad to be leaving the tin coast kitty found a place where we could climb down not far from the adit mouth of wheal garth we found a patch of grass halfway down and sat there gazing out into the dark vista of the sea below us the waves rolled ceaselessly against the cliffs fringing the base with a line of surf beyond was a dark void in which the advancing lines of the atlantic swell were sensed rather than seen we had not long to wait just after four a dark shape drew in towards the cliffs kitty seized my arm and pointed it was the arisaig all right i could dimly see the outline of her schooner rig i pulled my torch out and flashed in morse send boat manack there was no answering signal i repeated the message still no answering signal but a moment later a small shape detached itself from the dark bulk of the schooner and came bobbing across the waves towards the cliffs we scrambled down to a ledge of rock that ran out into the sea i flashed my torch to direct them then we stripped to our underclothes tied our things up in the oilskins and swam out to meet the boat mulligan was in the stern sheets what the devils this girl doing here he asked as they pulled us aboard wheres tanner dead i said sos manack youre lying he snarled briefly i told him what had happened as we lay there rocking on the long atlantic swell i dont believe ye he said when id finished then row in and take a look at the adit i said he hesitated i could see he didnt like the idea of hanging about dawn would soon be breaking and then the arisaig would be in full view from the coastguards lookout at cape cornwall but he gave the order and the boats bows turned in towards the cliffs we had no difficulty in finding the mouth of the adit even in the dim light the sea looked a muddy brown and where the waves beat in against the cliffs an ochrecoloured torrent foamed up from just below the surface he ordered the boat to put about then and the seamen pulled out from underneath the cliffs back towards the arisaig the girl comes with me i said before all this happened manack had appointed me his representative in italy ill show you his letters later if you want any more cargoes youd better see that we get there safely he grunted but said nothing kitty was getting into her clothes she had towelled herself down with an oilskin jacket wrapped round her i did the same and when i was dressed i slipped the pistol into my jacket pocket the dark outline of the schooner showed in the gloom in a few minutes we were on board and the boat was in its davits orders were given in a subdued voice the sails ceased to flap and bulked out as they tightened and filled kitty had gone forard to the bows i joined her there behind us the light of pendeen watch outlined the rugged cliffs at regular intervals but she never looked back she stared straight ahead her hair blowing in the wind the bows began to talk as they dipped and rose across the waves i took her hand it trembled slightly well be married in rome shall we i said married she looked at me in surprise of course i i didnt know her fingers tightened on my hand and her eyes were shining in the darkness oh jim she said im so glad she turned away then and stared out ahead as the schooner ploughed her way through the water far out across the dark sea the wolf lighthouse winked at us and beyond on the edge of the horizon the bishop light showed for a moment pointing the way to a new life the end
