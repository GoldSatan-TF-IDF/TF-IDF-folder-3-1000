chapter one the inca room xander buffy and willow were on the bus they were going with the rest of their class to a south american exhibition at sunnydale museum its just not fair buffy was saying my mums invited one of the cultural exchange students to stay with us some strange south american in my house for two weeks its going to be terrible students from all over the world came to live with the sunnydale high students for two weeks every year perhaps because the teachers couldnt count they called this time cultural exchange week some days the students went on cultural visits the first visit was today to sunnydale museum dont worry said willow maybe your studentll be really nice yeah itll be cool xander agreed cultural exchange week is a beautiful mix of different cultures the two girls looked at him xander was strange sometimes and cultural exchange week means less school work even more beautiful he thought happily they arrived at the museum and went into the first exhibition room cordelia chase was standing with her friends in a corner they were laughing and looking at photos thats mine his names sven mmm he really is the bestlooking whos that buffy asked thats my exchange student cordelia said swedish and goodlooking she showed buffy the photo what does yours look like umm i dont know answered buffy just an ordinary guy xander held up his hands wait a minute its a guy not a girl and hes going to live with you for two weeks this is a terrible idea what about a beautiful mix of different cultures asked willow with a laugh buffy wasnt listening she was looking across the room at rodney munson a student in their class he was standing very close to one of the exhibits whats he doing she asked they all looked at rodney he had big braces on his teeth and he looked a bit scary he was doing something to the exhibit ill tell him to stop said willow she walked over to him rodney liked willow because she often helped him with his homework he certainly wasnt the cleverest student in sunnydale oh hi willow rodney said willow could see a small knife in his hand he was trying to take gold from one of the south american exhibits hi said willow er you mustnt do that rod why not rodney laughed will they tell me to leave school oooh im frightened willow laughed weakly at his joke she started to answer but just then their museum guide said welcome students we will now go into the inca room the students followed the guide into the dark room in the centre of the room there was a big sarcophagus the guide walked towards it five hundred years ago the inca people of peru chose a beautiful teenage girl as their princess xander and willow looked into the sarcophagus the beautiful teenage girl was now a scary mummy she was holding a kind of gold plate the incas needed to make a religious sacrifice they chose their princess as the sacrifice they put her in a sarcophagus while she was still living then they left her for ever the guide pointed at the plate this plate is special it protects the princess with the plate in the sarcophagus no one can wake her xander wasnt very interested he was thinking about other things so buffy whens your exchange boy arriving his name is ampata and im meeting him at the bus station tomorrow night mmm sunnydale bus station exciting joked xander this way please the guide said and they all followed rodney waited first he waited while the other students left the museum then he waited for six oclock when the museum closed he was hiding in the inca room it was easy there were lots of dark corners there later he came out it was safe no one could see him now a lot of the exhibits were behind glass but the mummy wasnt and her gold plate wasnt either rodney wanted that plate it looked expensive ill sell it and then ill be rich he thought he reached into the sarcophagus and touched the plate cool he thought he pulled the plate it didnt move he pulled it again until suddenly it came away in his hand he fell back and dropped it the plate broke into lots of pieces oh no rodney didnt think about his next move he didnt have time instead he felt hands around his throat it was the mummy and her dead eyes were open thats impossible he thought the mummy pulled him closer and closer rodney tried to shout for help but the mummys hands were too strong he couldnt speak and then the fivehundredyearold princess gave the high school student his first and last kiss chapter two braces and a bus station the next day in the school library buffy was doing her exercises with giles she had to do them every day a vampire slayer had to be strong giles was holding a big soft ball buffy was hitting it as hard as she could xander was watching buffy wanted to go to the world culture dance at the bronze the next evening but she was always busy at night she walked around the streets of sunnydale and looked for vampires so she said to giles can i go she hit the ball very hard with her foot giles almost fell no he answered why not buffy hit it again because youre the slayer giles said youre not like other girls you have a job an important job you havent got time for dances another hit blah blah blah said buffy she was angry it just wasnt fair giles tried again they often had this kind of conversation buffy listen to me you cant go to the dance your exchange student mustnt find out about you you have to be careful while hes living with you hes living in the same house as her hes not living with her xander said quickly no one seemed to understand the difference except him so i have to go to the dance buffy said like an ordinary person hit i didnt mean that said giles he was tired buffy knew that she was winning come on giles she got ready to hit the ball again ok ok giles said quickly thats enough for today go to your dance yes buffy smiled i win and i need a cup of tea and a rest giles walked slowly out of the library cool said xander we can all go to the dance together but youre going

xander i hope she didnt hear me hi will he said loudly we were just talking about happy things you me and buffy are going to the culture dance happy willow didnt look very happy not happy asked xander yes no willow said rodneys disappeared giles walked back in is there trouble with mr munson again he didnt come home last right the police are looking for him willow said was rodney with us when we left the museum asked buffy i dont remember him on the bus maybe he got in trouble at the museum said willow xander laughed maybe he woke up the mummy willow laughed too yeah and she got up from the sarcophagus and killed him buffy smiled suddenly they stopped laughing they were all thinking the same thing buffy xander willow and giles all ran out of the library they got into giless car and drove to the museum when they arrived the museum was closed luckily giles knew one of the guides someone else interested in boring dead things said buffy so they could go in they went into the inca room buffy saw something on the floor next to the sarcophagus hey look its the plate someones broken it has the mummy escaped then willow asked both buffy and xander looked in the sarcophagus but the mummy was still there giles looked at the pieces of the plate interesting he said look at these pictures suddenly a big man with a long knife appeared from nowhere he tried to hit buffy with the knife willow hid behind giles buffy jumped away and was ready for a fight the man looked down into the sarcophagus just for a minute he seemed surprised xander jumped onto him but he fell off as the man ran away hey i saved us said xander come on lets go said giles hell probably come back again soon willow was looking at the mummy again giles were the incas very clever yes very he answered did they have dentists they all looked into the sarcophagus again the mummy had braces rodney munsons braces i think rodneys body in the sarcophagus surprised the guy with the knife said willow he ran away because of it they were all back in the library rodneys body looked so dead she continued yeah five hundred years dead said xander but why this mummy was from the sebancaya area of peru said giles he was looking at a piece of the plate the answer will be on the plate but ill have to look at all those pictures and translate them itll take a long time but we can start tonight with ampata said buffy suddenly im late hes waiting for me at the bus station i have to go buffy rodneys dead how can you think about your exchange student now said xander he doesnt speak much english and hes alone said

station she was already half an hour late ampata a voice said very quietly he looked around but he couldnt see anyone ampata the voice said again ampata looked into the darkness hello then he saw her she was the scariest most horrible thing in the world he started to shout as she came nearer then she held his throat and kissed him and ampata knew that this was his last visit to the usa or to anywhere chapter three welcome to our country xander didnt like the sunnydale bus station he was sure that other people felt the same it was old dark and dirty ampata was flying into lax in los angeles and then he was catching the bus what a welcome xander thought the worlds most horrible airport and the worlds worst bus station forty minutes late said buffy maybe hes already here said

surprise but you have so much here too many vampires and too much work as a slayer thought buffy to herself ampata was looking at a photo on buffys desk it was buffy willow and xander what about your friends asked buffy they are ampata stopped speaking is she trying to find the right words in english buffy thought or is she hiding something then she felt bad ampata was just a girl from another country not everyone had dangerous secrets its only me ampata said finally buffy understood that sometimes she felt alone too she was the only slayer and sometimes it was difficult its a bit like that for me she said but dont worry youll meet lots of people tomorrow thank you ampata climbed into bed you must teach me everything about your life i want to be like you buffy with an ordinary american

life here it was much better than her life in peru years ago she wanted to make a new start in sunnydale xander and ampata were walking through school ok said xander i have something to tell you and

to the girls toilets ok ill wait for you said xander ampata went in and looked at herself in the mirror she looked happy but she also looked a bit ill no she thought ive taken two lives already thats enough then she saw her hands they looked old its not fair she thought angrily she didnt want to kill anyone else but she didnt want to go back in the sarcophagus she wanted to live then she saw the bodyguard behind her in the mirror please dont kill me she said she spoke in a very old language the bodyguard spoke in the same language youre already dead youve been dead for years but it wasnt fair ampata said i didnt do anything wrong rodney munson didnt do anything wrong the exchange student from peru didnt do anything wrong but you killed them anyway please said the princess im in love it was true she loved xander she felt like a real person with him and not a sacrifice the bodyguard came closer you must die you are the sacrifice you have no choice he held up his knife but as he brought it towards her ampata caught his arm in her hand yes i do she said i choose life she held his arm behind his back and kissed him his life became hers she looked strong and young again it only took a few seconds the princess moved his dead body into one of the toilets then she came out xander was waiting for her she smiled at him xander id love to go to the dance with you xander smiled back he felt very happy he took her hand and they walked off together now finally can be happy the princess thought chapter six the world culture dance ampata and buffy were in buffys bedroom ampata was almost

put on some makeup in front of the mirror and turned to buffy a long time ago knew someone just like you you are always thinking of other people buffy walked over to ampatas bags yeah yes ampata said slowly this person had to protect her people no one else could do it as ampata was talking buffy looked in one of her bags there were boys clothes in there what they chose her from all the girls of her age she was special buffy finished how much did ampata know you know the story asked ampata maybe said buffy she was sixteen like us ampata said she was a sacrifice and she died she never really

hey wheres willow shes not coming with us xander said he looked at buffys clothes what about you you dont look ready im not coming buffy said giles and i are looking for mummies instead xander started

hand well goodnight then be careful xander said to buffy quietly i will she said and xander and ampata left for the dance cordelia was wearing something from hawaii she thought she looked great of course hawaii was part of the united states so it wasnt really another culture but cordelia didnt care she just wanted to wear beach clothes as she walked into the bronze she saw willow willow was wearing an eskimo coat she looked very very hot cordelia didnt understand willow was one of the cleverest students at sunnydale high but she did really stupid things sometimes cordelias friend gwen waved at her hey wheres sven t dont know and i dont care said cordelia im trying to lose him hes so boring he never says anything just then sven appeared gwen looked at him hes quite goodlooking she thought and conversation isnt very important anyway hi sven she smiled lets get a drink willow felt uncomfortable it was very hot in the bronze maybe her eskimo clothes werent a good idea xander and ampata walked in together ampata looked beautiful and cool why did i wear these stupid clothes willow thought xander saw her and waved he and ampata came over hi will he said you look warm err thanks said willow you guys look great dingoes ate my baby were playing xander looked at ampata do you would you she smiled at him id love to dance she said and willow was alone again oz looked at all the high school students he didnt really like playing love songs but everyone was enjoying this one he saw a guy in cowboy clothes he was dancing with a girl in a kind of south american dress everyone was looking at them the girl was really beautiful then oz saw someone even more beautiful he couldnt stop looking at her she was wearing eskimo clothes but who was she the princess was very happy she loved dancing with xander then she looked at her arms she wanted to cry they were looking old again she had to do something quickly before xander saw her arms she ran off the dance floor and out of the door a boy was sitting on the stairs his name was jonathan ampata smiled at him and touched his hair jonathan was a bit worried i thought you were with xander he said not now ampata moved closer xander was surprised what was happening everything was going so well between him and ampata until why did she run off like that he looked around the room he had to find her he couldnt lose her now he left the main room ampata where are you he shouted jonathan heard him im going he said to ampata and he went back to the dance floor xander saw ampata alone on the stairs ampata whats wrong he asked ampata started to cry youre too good for me what xander didnt understand he held her very close talk to me he said i cant ampata answered she looked into xanders eyes xander looked back at her he really wanted to kiss ampata and he was sure that she wanted the same thing they kissed it was a wonderful kiss and then xander started to feel strange weak and he was falling chapter seven one mummy no make up buffy was worried when she heard someone at the door maybe it was willow but when she opened the door giles was there good youre here he said and came in yes not with my friends not at the dance said buffy she looked at giles youre a bit early im not ready to go to the museum yet things have changed were not going to find the bodyguard at the museum said giles why not because hes in the school toilets dead hes a mummy like rodney buffy was surprised dont understand did the mummy kill her own bodyguard ive looked at the pictures on the plate again said giles the bodyguard protects the sarcophagus with the bodyguard around the mummy cant escape so ampata didnt translate the pictures correctly maybe not said giles buffy was thinking when we talk about the plate ampata always seems upset wait a minute her bags buffy ran upstairs to her bedroom giles followed her look at the clothes she said to giles she pointed at ampatas bags giles looked through one of them theyre all boys clothes why did she bring these buffy opened ampatas second bag there was a horrible kind of mummy smell and a horrible dead mummy what about this what girl travels with a mummy and doesnt bring makeup ampata is our mummy said giles and our killer giles shes at the dance with xander lets go we dont have much time in the car buffy and giles were both thinking hard ampata told us to destroy the plate said buffy yes said giles the mummy couldnt escape with the plate there it broke and she was free suddenly buffy had an idea why dont we put the pieces of the plate together then she wont be free very good said giles ill go to the museum and look for the other pieces ill see you later he stopped the car outside the bronze and buffy ran inside she couldnt see xander or ampata but she found willow willow we have to find xander ampata is the mummy really for a moment willow looked very happy but only for a moment oh no what about xander where did they go asked buffy they went out that way i think they left the main room are all kisses like this xander thought as ampata kissed him he was feeling weaker and weaker he was starting to fall suddenly ampata stopped no i cant xander fell onto the floor ampata sat down next to him xander im so sorry she said xander wanted to answer but he couldnt speak ampata stood up ow she touched her head stop the plate are you ill whats wrong xander asked but ampata ran off he lay on the floor soon he started to feel a bit stronger are you ok he looked up it was buffy and willow i think so he said he sat up wow that kiss wheres ampata buffy asked i dont know she went off she was talking about the plate the plate giles come on buffy said what xander stood up slowly i dont understand he doesnt know said willow well tell him on the way there said buffy and they all hurried out the princess hated the inca room at the museum but she had to go back there when that stupid boy rodney broke the plate she was finally free free after years she was never going back to her old life now she had xander for the first time in her life she was in love as she walked towards the sarcophagus she heard a voice she knew that man it was giles the teacher interested in archaeology he was next to the sarcophagus and he was reading from one of his books she watched him he was putting pieces of the plate together the princess felt weaker and weaker no her arms and legs were looking older and older she moved towards giles thats it he said to himself the last piece ampata took the plate and threw it on the floor it broke into lots of small pieces with her other hand she held giless throat she moved closer she wanted to kiss him she needed to feed just then a voice came from behind her leave giles alone hes too young for you it was buffy she jumped over to ampata and hit her quickly twice ampata was surprised clearly buffy wasnt an ordinary girl ampata dropped giless body into the sarcophagus and was ready to fight buffy tried to hit her again but ampata held her arm back this girl is strong she thought to herself will feed on her she tried to kiss her but buffy was too quick she jumped on ampatas back ampata turned and buffy fell into the sarcophagus quickly ampata closed it good giles and buffy couldnt get out but the princess was feeling weak she had to feed on someone very soon she turned a corner and saw willow she took willows throat in her hand willow was very frightened leave her alone it was xander ampata turned she wanted to cry xander willow is my last sacrifice after this we can be together that will never happen said xander the princess felt weaker and weaker i must do it she said she moved closer to willow no xander shouted he jumped between the two girls ampata was now too weak to fight xander looked into the princesss eyes he was very angry take my life instead the princess was frightened she didnt want to kill xander but she didnt want to die she finally had an ordinary life and she couldnt leave it now not for xander not for anyone she looked at xander and moved towards him for their last kiss just then the top of the sarcophagus opened and buffy jumped towards the princess buffy pulled her away from xander and threw her across the room suddenly xander was only holding a pair of arms ampatas body crashed heavily to the floor and then she felt nothing it was the end xander didnt sleep well that night when buffy threw ampata onto the floor she broke into a thousand pieces he couldnt forget it the next morning he and buffy walked to school together xander was unusually quiet finally he said im a really fun guy today huh its ok said buffy we dont have to talk i cant believe it buffy he said sadly i am so unlucky with women i think ampata really liked you buffy said it wasnt her fault she was a young girl she never really lived its difficult when you cant choose your own life shes like me i didnt choose to be a vampire slayer and i wasnt very happy about it at first xander looked at her but youve done the right thing youve sacrificed your life buffy smiled ive got my friends they help me xander smiled back anything could happen when you lived on the hellmouth they all knew that but for the moment buffy and the slayerettes were safe the end
