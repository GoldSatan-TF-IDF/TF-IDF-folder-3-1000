prologue summer of was a mean and murderous bitch who showed no sign of lightening her mood september dragged in on the sweaty heels of august and smothered new york in a wet blanket of heat humidity and foul air summer jacie wooton thought was killing business it was barely two a m prime time with the bars spitting out customers and those customers looking for a little extra action before heading home the heart of the night as she liked to think of it when those with a yen and the price to satisfy it came trolling for a companion she was licensed for street work since shed screwed herself up with a little illegals addiction and a couple of busts but she was clean now and intended to work her way back up the prostitution ladder until she was back on the arm of the rich and lonely but for now she had to earn a goddamn living and nobody wanted to have sex and pay for it in all this heat the fact that shed seen only a couple of associates on the stroll in the last two hours told her there werent many willing to have sex and be paid for it in the current climate either but jacie was a pro had considered herself a complete professional since the night more than twenty years ago shed put her first license to use she might sweat in the heat but she didnt wilt just as shed cracked a bit under the probationary street license but it didnt break her shed stay on her feet or her knees or her back depending on the clients preference and do the job do the job she told herself bank the pay mark the time and in a few months shed be back in a penthouse on park where she belonged if the thought passed through her mind that shed gotten a bit old and soft for street work she blocked it out and focused on making one more score just one more score besides if she didnt make that one more score tonight she wasnt going to have anything left over for body treatments after the rent and she needed a tuneup not that she wasnt still choice she told herself as she strolled by a lamppost in the threeblock area shed staked as her own in the bowels of the city she kept in shape maybe shed traded the push for a bottle of vodka and she could sure as hell use a drink right now but she still looked good damn good and she was showing off the merchandise in a goglo halter and crotch skirt both pulsing red until she hit the body sculptor she needed the halter to boost up her boobs but her legs were still her best feature long and shapely and given an erotic touch with the silver spike sandals with lattice straps that crossed to her knees they were fucking killing her as she walked the streets looking for one more job to give her feet a break she leaned on the next lamppost cocked out a hip and scanned the allbutdeserted street out of tired brown eyes she shouldve gone for the long silver wig she told herself johns always went for hair but she hadnt been able to face the weight of a wig tonight and had simply spiked up her own ink black and given it a careless spray of silver netting a cab streamed by and a couple of cars passed though she leaned over gave them each the standard comeon nobody so much as paused ten more minutes and shed call it a night and shed give the landlord a free blowjob if she was short on the rent she pushed off the post and began to walk slowly on aching feet in the direction of the one room shed been reduced to she remembered shed once had a hightoned apartment on the upper west side a closet full of beautiful clothes and a full appointment book illegals as her counselor had told her sent you into a downward spiral that often ended in miserable death shed lived through it jacie thought but she was right dead center of misery six more months she promised herself and shed be back on top again she saw him walking toward her rich eccentric and out of place you didnt see many guys wandering around this area done up in evening clothes with a cape and top hat no less he carried a black satchel jacie put on her game face and slicked a hand down her hip hey baby since youre all dressed up why dont we have a party he smiled at her a quick appreciative smile that showed her a flash of white even teeth what did you have in mind his voice suited his dress upperclass she thought with both pleasure and nostalgia style culture whatever you want youre the boss a private party then somewhere close he glanced around then gestured toward a narrow alley im afraid im a bit pressed for time right now the alley meant a quick bang which was fine with her they could get the business done and if she played it right shed get herself the fee and a nice tip more than enough for the rent and the boob job she planned as she led the way youre not from around here right why do you say that dont sound like it dont look like it she shrugged none of her business tell me what you want baby and well get the financials out of the way oh i want it all she laughed then reached out to run a hand over his crotch mmm you sure do you can have it all then i can get out of these shoes and into a nice cold drink she named a fee elevating it as much as she thought possible when he nodded didnt blink at the inflated price she cursed herself for not adding more i need to have it up front she told him once you pay we start having fun right payment first still smiling he spun her around to face the wall jerked her head back by the hair he slit her throat so she couldnt scream sliced it with one stroke with the knife hed held under his cloak her mouth opened as she gaped at him and she made a gurgling sound as she slid down the dirty wall and now the fun he said and went to work on her chapter you never saw it all no matter how many times you walked through the blood and the gore no matter how often you looked at the horror man inflicted on man you never saw it all there was always something worse something meaner or crazier more vicious more cruel as lieutenant eve dallas stood over what had once been a woman she wondered when she would see worse than this two of the uniform cops on scene were still retching at the mouth of the alley the sound of their sickness echoed back to her she stood where she was hands and boots already sealed and waited for her own shuddering stomach to settle had she seen this much blood before it was hard to remember it was best not to she crouched opened her field kit and took out her id pad to run the victims fingerprints she couldnt avoid the blood so she stopped thinking about it lifting the limp hand she pressed the thumb to her pad victim is female caucasian the body was discovered at approximately oh threethirty by officers responding to anonymous nineoneone and is herewith identified through fingerprint check as wooton jacie age fortyone licensed companion residing doyers she took a shallow breath then another victims throat has been cut spatter pattern indicates wound was inflicted while victim stood against the northfacing wall of the alley blood pattern and trail would indicate victim fell or was laid across alley floor by assailant or assailants who then jesus oh jesus who then mutilated the victim by removing the pelvic area both the throat and pelvic wounds indicate the use of a sharp implement and some precision despite the heat her skin prickled cold and clammy as she took out gauges recorded data im sorry peabody her aide spoke from behind her eve didnt have to look around to know peabodys face would still be pale and glossy from shock and nausea im sorry lieutenant i couldnt maintain dont worry about it you okay now i yes sir eve nodded and continued to work stalwart steady and as dependable as the tide peabody had taken one look at what lay in the alley turned sheetwhite and stumbled back toward the street at eves sharp order to puke elsewhere ive got an id on her jacie wooton doyers an lc do a run for me ive never seen anything like this just never seen get the data do it down there youre in my light here she wasnt peabody knew her lieutenant was cutting her a break and because her head wanted to spin again she took it moving toward the mouth of the alley shed sweated through her uniform shirt and her dark bowl of hair was damp at the temples under her cap her throat was raw her voice weak but she initiated the run and watched eve work efficient thorough and some would say cold but peabody had seen the leap of shock and horror and of pity on eves face before her own vision had blurred cold wasnt the word but driven was she was pale now peabody noted and it wasnt just the work lights that bleached the color from her narrow face her brown eyes were focused and flat and unwavering as they examined the atrocity her hands were steady and her boots smeared with blood there was a line of sweat down the middle of the back of her shirt but she wouldnt stumble away she would stay until it was done when eve straightened peabody saw a tall lean woman in stained boots worn jeans and a gorgeous linen jacket a fineboned face with a wide mouth wide eyes of gilded brown and a short and disordered cap of hair nearly the same color more she saw a cop who never turned away from death dallas peabody i dont care if you puke as long as you dont contaminate the scene give me the data victims lived in new york for twentytwo years previous residence on central park west shes resided down here for eighteen months thats quite a change of venue what she get popped for illegals three strikes lost her topdrawer license did six months in rehab counseling and was given a probationary street license about a year ago she roll on her dealer no sir well see what the tox screen tells us once shes in the morgue but i dont think jack here is her dealer eve lifted the envelope that had been left sealed to prevent bloodstains on the body lieutenant eve dallas nypsd computergenerated she guessed in a fancy font on elegant creamcolored paper thick weighty and expensive the sort of thing used for highclass invites she should know she mused as her husband was big on sending and receiving highclass invites she took out the second evidence bag and read the note again hello lieutenant dallas hot enough for ya i know youve had a busy summer and ive been admiring your work i can think of no one on the police force of our fair city id rather have join me on what i hope will be a very intimate level here is a sample of my work what do you think looking forward to our continued association jack ill tell you what i think jack i think youre a very sick fuck tag and bag she ordered with a last glance down the alley homicide wootons apartment was on the fourth floor of one of the housing structures thrown up as a temporary shelter for refugees and victims of the urban wars a number of them stood in the poorer sections of the city and were always slated for replacement the city dickered back and forth between tossing out the lowrent lcs chemiheads and dealers along with the working poor and mowing down the shaky structures or revitalizing while they dickered the buildings decayed and nothing was done eve expected nothing would be done until the dumps collapsed inward on their residents and the city fathers found themselves in the throes of a classaction suit but until that time it was the sort of place you expected to find a downonherluck whore her room was a hot little box with a stingy bumpout for a kitchen and a thin sliver for a bathroom her view was the wall of the identical building to the west through the thin walls eve could clearly hear the heroic snoring from the apartment next door despite the circumstance jacie had kept her place clean and had made some attempt at style the furniture was cheap but it was colorful she hadnt been able to afford privacy screens but there were frilly curtains at the windows shed left the bed pulled out of the convertible sofa but it was made and the sheets were good cotton possibly salvaged from better times eve thought she had a lowend desk link on a table and a prefab dresser covered with the various tools of her trade enhancements scents wigs tawdry jewelry temporary tattoos the drawer and closet held work clothes primarily but mixed in with the whorewear were a couple of more conservative outfits eve imagined shed used for offhours she found a supply of overthecounter meds including a half bottle of soberup and a full unopened bottle as backup which made sense with the two bottles of vodka and the bottle of home brew in the kitchen she turned up no illegals which caused her to assume jacie had switched from chemicals to alcohol she opened the desk link and replayed the transmissions received and sent over the last three days one to her counselor to request an upgrade in her license one received and not answered or yet returned from the landlord regarding overdue rent another made to an uptown body sculptor requesting rates no chats with pals eve mused she scrolled through located the financials and found jacies bookkeeping spare and efficient paid attention to her money eve mused did the job banked the pay and pumped most of it back into the business expenses were high for wardrobe body treatments hair and face work used to looking good eve decided wanted to keep looking good selfesteem wrapped around appearance which was wrapped around sexual appeal which was wrapped around selling yourself for enough money to maintain appearance a strange and sad cycle in her opinion she made a nice nest for herself in a very ugly tree eve commented ive got no transmissions or any correspondence from anyone named jack or any one guy in particular for that matter no marriage or cohabitation on record no sir well talk to her counselor see if theres anybody she was close to or had been close to but i dont think well find him there dallas it seems to me what he did to her it seems to me that it was personal does doesnt it she turned around looked at the room again neat girlie with a desperate attempt at style i think it was very personal but not specific to the victim he killed a woman and a woman who made her living from selling her body thats the personal part you not only kill her but you hack out the part of her that made that living its not hard to find a street lc in this area any time of the night you just have to choose your time and place a sample of his work she murmured thats all she was she walked to the window and narrowing her eyes visualized the street the alley the building just out of view he might have known her or have seen her just as possible it was chance but he was ready if chance presented itself he had the weapon he had the note written and sealed and something a case a bag a satchel something to carry fresh clothes or to store whatever he was wearing hedve been covered with her blood she goes in the alley with him eve continued its hot its late business cant be very good but heres a job maybe one last job before she heads home shes experienced been in the life for two decades but she doesnt make him as trouble maybe shes been drinking or maybe he looked okay and theres the fact that shes not used to street work wouldnt have the instincts for it too accustomed to the high life eve thought to the sexual kinks of the wealthy and discreet coming down to chinatown mustve been like landing on venus for her shes up against the wall eve could see it see it perfectly the dark spiked hair shimmering with silver the comeonbigboy red of the halter and shes thinking she needs the fee to make the rent or she hopes he hurries because her feet hurt jesus they had to be killing her in those shoes shes tired but shell take one more mark before she calls it a night when he slashes her throat shes surprised more than anything it had to be quick and clean one quick slice left to right straight across the jugular sprayed blood like a son of a bitch her bodys dead before her brain computes it but thats only the beginning for him she turned back scanned the dresser cheap jewelry expensive lip dye perfumes designer knockoffs to remind you that youd been able to bathe in the real thing once and damn well would again he arranges her lays her out then cuts the woman out of her had to have a bag somewhere to put what hes taken from her he cleans his hands she could see him too the shadow of him crouched in the filthy alley hands slick with blood as he tidied up i bet he cleaned his tools too but he certainly cleans his hands takes the note hes written sets it neatly on her breasts he had to change his shirt or put a jacket on something because of the blood what then peabody blinked ah walks away figuring job well done he goes home how um walks if he lives close enough she took a breath pushing herself out of the alley and into her lieutenants mind into the killers mind hes on top of the world so hes not worried about being hassled by a mugger if he doesnt live close by hes probably got his own ride because even changing or covering up theres too much blood on him and thered be a smell itd be a stupid risk to take a cab or the subway good well check the cab companies for pickups around the crime scene during our time frame but i dont think well find anything lets seal this place up canvass the building neighbors as was expected from neighbors in such places knew nothing heard nothing saw nothing the landlord operated out of a storefront in chinatown between a market that was running a special on ducks feet and an alternative medicine joint that promised health wellbeing and spiritual balance or your money back eve recognized piers chans type the beefy arms in shirtsleeves the pencil mustache over thin lips the humble surroundings and diamond pinky ring he was mixedrace with enough asian to have him set up in the business bustle of chinatown though she imagined his last ancestor to see peking might have been at his prime during the boxer rebellion just as she imagined chan kept his home and family in some upscale suburb in new jersey while he played slumlord of the lower east side wooton wooton while two silent clerks busied themselves in the back chan flipped through his tenant book yes shes got a deluxe single on doyers deluxe eve repeated and what makes it deluxe got a kitchen area with builtin friggie and autochef comes with the package shes behind rent was due a week ago she got the standard reminder call a couple days ago shell get another today then an automatic evict notice next week that wont be necessary as shes changed her address to the city morgue she was murdered early this morning murdered his eyebrows lowered into an expression eve interpreted as irritation rather than sympathy or shock goddamn it you seal the place eve cocked her head and you ask because look i own six buildings got seventytwo units you got that many tenants some of them are going to croak one way or another you get your unattended death your suspicious death your misadventure and your selftermination he ticked them off on his fat fingers and your homicide for that he used his thumb then you guys come along seal the place up notify next of kin before i can blink some uncle or other is clearing the place out before i can put in a claim and get my back rent he spread his hands now and sent eve an aggrieved look im just trying to make a living here so was she when somebody decided to carve her up he puffed out his cheeks persons in that kind of work theyre going to take some lumps you know this outpouring of humanitarianism is choking me up so lets stick to the point did you know jacie wooton i knew her application her references and her rent payment never set eyes on her myself i dont have time to make friends with the tenants ive got too many uhhuh and if somebody falls behind on the rent wiggles around the evict do you pay them a little visit try to appeal to their sense of fair play he rubbed a fingertip over his mustache i run by the book here costs me plenty in court fees annually to move the deadbeats out but thats part of the operating expenses thats part of the business i wouldnt know this wooton woman if she stopped in to give me a handjob and i was home in bloomfield last night with my wife and kids i was there for breakfast this morning and came into the city on the sevenfifteen just like i do every day you need more than that you talk to my lawyers creep peabody stated out on the sidewalk oh yeah and id make book he takes some of his rent in trade sexual favors little party bags of illegals stolen goods we could squeeze him if we had nothing but time and righteousness she angled her head as she studied the display of naked hanging fowls so skinny death must have been a relief and the odd groupings of webbed feet for sale how do you eat feet eve wondered do you start at the toes and work up or at the ankle and work down do ducks have ankles ive spent many sleepless nights pondering just that though eve slanted over a bland stare she was glad to see her aide back in tune they do some of the butchering right here dont they slice and dice the merchandize in the kitchens sharp knives lots of blood a certain working knowledge of anatomy cutting up a chickens got to be a lot simpler than a human i dont know considering eve rested her hands on her hips technically okay theres more mass and its going to take more time and maybe more skill than your average fowl plucker but if you dont see that mass as human it wouldnt be so different maybe you practice on animals get the feel for it then again maybe youre a doctor or a vet whos gone around the bend but he had to know what he was doing a butcher a doctor a talented amateur but somebody whos been perfecting his technique so he could pay homage to his hero his hero jack eve said as she turned away to walk back to her vehicle jack the ripper jack the ripper with her mouth dropping open peabody trotted to catch up you mean like over in london back in whenever late s whitechapel poor section of the city during the victorian era frequented by prostitutes he killed between five and eight women maybe more all within about a onemile radius over a period of a year she got behind the wheel flicked a glance over to find peabody gaping at her what eve demanded i cant know stuff yes sir you know great bundles of stuff but history isnt generally your long suit murder was eve thought as she pulled away from the curb and always had been while other little girls were reading about fluffy asyetungutted duckies i was reading about jack and other assorted serial killers you read about that sort of thing when you were a kid yeah so well she didnt quite know how to put it she was aware that eve had been raised in the system in foster homes and state homes didnt any of the adults in charge monitor your interests what i mean is my parents and they were big on not restricting our choices wouldve brought the hammer down in that sort of area when we were kids you know formative years and all nightmares emotional scarring shed been scarred in every possible way long before she could read more than a few basic words as for nightmares eve didnt remember a time she hadnt had them if i was scrolling the internet for data on the ripper or john wayne gacy i was occupied and out of trouble those were the essential criteria i guess so you always knew you wanted to be a cop shed known she wanted to be something other than a victim then shed known shed wanted to stand for the victim that meant cop to her more or less the ripper sent notes to the police but only after a while he didnt start off like our guy but this one wants us to know what hes about straight off he wants the play he wants you peabody said and got a nod of acknowledgment ive just come off a highly publicized case lots of screen time lots of buzz and the purity case earlier this summer another hot one hes been watching now he wants some buzz of his own jack got plenty of it back in the day he wants you involved and the media focused on him the city fascinated by him thats my take so hell hunt other lcs in that same area that would be the pattern eve paused and what he wants us to think her next stop was jacies counselor who worked out of a threeoffice suite on the lower fringes of the east village on her large overburdened desk was a bowl of colorful hard candies she sat behind them in a gray suit that gave her a matronly air eve judged her to be on the shadowy side of fifty with a kind face and by contrast a pair of shrewd hazel eyes tressa palank she rose to offer eve a firm handshake before gesturing to a chair i assume this concerns one of my clients ive got ten minutes before my next session what can i do for you tell me about jacie wooton jacie tressas eyebrows lifted a slight smile touched her lips but there was a look in her eyes a steady look of dread i cant believe shed give you any trouble shes on a straight path determined to earn back her agrade license jacie wooton was murdered early this morning tressa closed her eyes did nothing but breathe in and out for several seconds i knew it had to be one of mine she opened her eyes again and they remained direct as soon as i heard the bulletin about the murder in chinatown i knew just a feeling in the gut if you understand me jacie she folded her hands on the desk stared down at them what happened im not free to give you the details as yet i can only tell you she was stabbed mutilated the bulletin said a female licensed companion had been mutilated in a chinatown alley early this morning one of the uniforms eve thought and there would be hell to pay for the leak when she found the source i cant tell you any more at this time my investigation is in its earliest stages i know the routine i was on the job for five years you were a cop five years sex crimes primarily i switched to counseling i didnt like the streets or what i saw on them here i can do something to help without facing that day after day this isnt a picnic by any means but its what i do best ill tell you what i can i hope it helps she spoke to you recently about her upgrade denied she has had another years probation its mandatory after her arrests and addiction her rehab went well though i suspect shed found a substitute for the push she was hooked on vodka two bottles in her flop well its legal but it violates her parole requirements for upgrade not that it matters now tressa rubbed her hands over her eyes and simply sighed not that it matters she repeated she couldnt think of anything but getting back uptown hated working the streets but at the same time never considered not seriously any alternative profession did she have any regulars you know of no she once had quite an extensive client list exclusive men and women she was licensed for both but to my knowledge no one followed her downtown i believe she wouldve told me as it wouldve boosted her ego her supplier she wouldnt give a name not even to me but she swore there had been no contact since her release i believed her in your opinion did she hold back the name because she was afraid in mine she considered it a matter of ethics shed been an lc nearly half her life a good lc is discreet and considers her clients privacy sacred much as a doctor or a priest she considered this along the same lines i suspect her supplier was also a client but thats just a hunch she gave no indication to you during your last sessions that she was concerned worried afraid of anything or anyone no just impatient to get her old life back how often did she come in every two weeks per her parole requirements she never missed she had her regular medicals was always available for random testing she was cooperative in every way lieutenant she was an average woman a little lost and out of her element she was not street savvy as shed been accustomed to a more select clientele and routine she enjoyed nice things worried about her appearance complained about the rate restrictions at her license level she didnt socialize any longer because she was embarrassed by her circumstances and because she felt those in her current economic circle were beneath her tressa pressed her fingers to her lips a moment im sorry im trying not to be upset not to personalize it but i cant help it one of the reasons i was no good out there i liked her and wanted to help her i dont know who couldve done this to her just another random act on one of the weaker just a whore after all her voice threatened to break so she cleared her throat drew air through her nose a lot of people still think that way you and i both know it they come to me beaten and misused humiliated and battered some give it up some handle themselves some rise to a different level and live almost like royalty and some are tossed into the gutter its a dangerous profession cops emergency and health workers prostitutes dangerous professions with a high mortality rate she wanted her old life back tressa said and it killed her chapter she stopped by the morgue it was another chance eve thought for the victim to tell her something without any real friends known enemies associates family jacie wooton was presenting a picture of a solitary woman in a physicalcontact occupation one who considered her body her greatest asset and had chosen to use it to attain the good life eve needed to find out what that body would tell her about the killer halfway down the corridor of the dead house eve paused find a seat she told peabody i want you to contact and harass the lab guys plead whine threaten whatever works but push them on tracking the stationery i can handle it going in im not going to lose it again she was already pale eve noted already seeing it once more the alley the blood the gore shed stand up eve was sure of it but at a price the price didnt have to be paid not here and now im not saying you cant handle it im saying i need the source of the stationery the killer leaves something behind we follow up on it find a seat do the job without giving peabody a chance to debate eve strode down the hall and through the double doors where the body was waiting shed expected morris the chief medical examiner to take this one and wasnt disappointed he worked alone as he often did suited up in clear protective gear over a blue tunic and skinpants his long hair was corded back in a shiny ponytail and covered with a cap to prevent contamination of the body there was a medallion something in silver with a deep red stone around his neck his hands were bloody and his handsome somewhat exotic face set in stone he often played music while he worked but today the room was silent but for the quiet hum of machines and the spooky whirl of his laser scalpel every now and then he said without looking up i see something in here that goes beyond beyond the human and we know dont we dallas that the human has an amazing capacity for cruelty to its own species but every once in a while i see something that takes even that one hideous step beyond the throat wound killed her small mercy understanding he lifted his head his eyes behind his goggles didnt smile as they usually did nor did they show any spark of fascination with his work she wouldnt have felt the rest that was done to her wouldnt have known she was comfortably dead before he butchered her was it butchery how would you define it he tossed the scalpel in a tray gestured with one bloody hand over the mutilated body how the hell would you define this i dont have the words i dont think there are any vicious isnt enough evil doesnt cover it not really i cant get philosophical now morris that wont help her i need to know did he know what he was doing or was it a hack job he was breathing too fast to steady himself morris yanked off his goggles his cap then strode over to wash the sealant and blood from his hands he knew the cuts were precise no hesitation no wasted motions he stepped to a friggie took out two bottles of water after tossing one to eve he drank deeply our killer knows how to color inside the lines sorry your deprived childhood continues to fascinate me i need to sit a minute he did so scrubbed the heel of one hand between his eyebrows up to his hairline this one got to me you cant predict when or how it might happen with all that comes through here day after day this fortyoneyearold woman with her homejob pedicure and the bunion on her left foot got to me she wasnt sure how to handle him in this mood going with instinct eve dragged over a chair sat beside him sipped water he hadnt turned the recorder off she thought it would be up to him whether he edited it or not you need a vacation morris i hear that he laughed a little i was due to leave tomorrow two weeks in aruba sun sea naked women the sort whore still breathing and a great deal of alcohol consumed out of coconut shells go he shook his head ive postponed i want to see this one through he looked over at her now there are some you have to see through i knew as soon as i saw her what had been done to her i wouldnt be sitting on a beach tomorrow i could tell you youve got good people working for you here people whod take good care of her and whoever else comes in over the next couple of weeks she sipped the water as she studied the husk of jacie wooton laid bare on a slab in a cold room i could tell you that im going to find the son of a bitch who did this to her and build a case that ensures hell pay for it i could tell you all that and all of it would be true but i wouldnt go either she rested her head back against the wall i wouldnt go he mirrored her position head resting on the wall legs kicked out with jacie wootons butchered body on the table a few feet in front of them and their silence after a moment became companionable what the hells wrong with us dallas beats me he closed his eyes for a moment knowing he was settling down again we love the dead when she snorted he grinned eyes still closed and not in a sick boinkthecorpse sort of way gutterbrain despite whoever they were when they were alive we love them because they were cheated and misused the ultimate underdogs i guess were getting philosophical anyway guess we are he did something he rarely did he touched her just a pat of his hand over the back of hers but it was eve realized a kind of intimacy an affectionate contact between comrades and more personal than any act the victim had ever exchanged with a client they come to us morris continued from babies to the doddering old and everything between no matter who loved them in life were their most intimate companions in death and sometimes that intimacy reaches down inside us and braids our guts like cornrows ah well she didnt seem to have anybody not really in life from the look i got at her place the lack of i guess you could say sentiment she didnt want anybody in life so okay he took another drink rose okay setting the bottle aside he sealed his hands again replaced his goggles i put a rush on the tox for what its worth liver shows some wear alcohol abuse but even with that ive found no major damage or disease last meal of pasta about six hours premortem shes had breast augmentation and an eye tuck butt lift and some jaw sculpting all good work recent no couple of years at least on the ass job and id judge that as the last maintenance fits her luck took a turn and she wouldntve had the price of good body work in the last little while moving to the job most recently done on her the killer used a thin smoothbladed knife probably a scalpel for the throat cut going left to right downward stroke from the angle her chin was up head back he came in from behind likely pulled her head back by her hair with his left hand sliced with his right morris demonstrated using both hands on an invisible form one stroke severing the jugular a lot of blood eve continued to study the body but imagined jacie wooton alive and on her feet face against the dingy wall of the alley then the jerk of the head the quick shock of the pull the bright pain and confusion lots of gush and splash a great deal he got messy even coming from behind for the rest its one long incision this morris drew with a finger in the air quickly even economically done id say you cant call it neat or surgical but this wasnt his first time hes cut into flesh before more than sims in my opinion he had to have dealt with flesh and blood before this poor woman not surgical not a doctor then i wouldnt rule it out hed have been in a hurry the light was poor his own excitement fear arousal morriss exotic face mirrored his inner disgust whatever drives this sort of well words fail me for once whatever drove him might very well have hampered his skill he removed the female organs with well say dispatch its not possible to say if there was sexual contact before the removal but from the time of death the mutilation there wouldnt have been time for games as they were done minutes apart would you peg him as a medical mt vet nurse she paused deliberately cocked her head pathologist he gave eve a small grin possible certainly it took some considerable skill given the circumstances but then again he didnt have to concern himself about the patients chances of survival he needed some knowledge of anatomy some knowledge of the tools he used on her i would say he certainly studied certainly practiced but it may not have been with a medical license and again may not have been with the goal of keeping the patient alive i hear there was a note yeah addressed to me which ensured id come on as primary so hes made it personal you could even say intimate ill have the test results and report to you as soon as i can i want to run a few more see if i can get a closer handle on the knives good take it easy morris oh i just take it he said as she started for the door dallas thank you she glanced back sure she gestured to peabody as she headed down the corridor tell me what i want to know the lab after considerable brownnosing by yours truly was able to discern that the material used in the note and envelope is of a particular grade of bond its not even recycled which not only shocks my freeager heart but means it had to be sold and manufactured outside of the united states and its territories we have laws here eve lifted her eyebrows as she walked back out into the heat i thought freeagers didnt believe in manmade laws of government interference in society we do when it suits our purposes peabody slid into the car its english the paper was manufactured in britain and is available in only a handful of outlets around europe not available in new york no sir in fact its difficult to buy it through the internet or mail order as we have unrecycled paper products on our banned list in this country mmmhmm eves brain clicked several steps ahead but as peabody was studying for her detectives exam she thought it was a good popquiz question so how did it get from europe to an alley in chinatown well people smuggle all sorts of banned products into the states or use the black market or if youre traveling on another passport touring or visiting the us youre allowed a certain number of personal possessions that arent strictly kosher you could even be a diplomat or something but whatever youd have to pay the price and its high that particular paper goes for twenty euro dollars a pop one sheet the envelopes twelve lab boys tell you that no sir since i was sitting out there i checked it out myself good work you got the outlets all the knowns though the papers manufactured exclusively in britain there are sixteen known retailers and two known wholesalers who carry this particular style and weight two are in london is that so i thought since hes copying jack the ripper the london angle was the best start there well pursue all the outlets but london will be priority see if you can get a list for purchases of that paper yes sir lieutenant about this morning i know i didnt do the job peabody eve interrupted did i say you didnt do the job no but has there been any time since you came under my command that ive hesitated to tell you when i felt you didnt do the job to my requirements or that i was dissatisfied with your performance or that youd screwed up in any way shape or form ah well no sir peabody puffed out her cheeks expelled air audibly now that you mention it then put it away and get me those client lists at central she was waylaid in the detectives bullpen with questions rumors speculation about the wooton homicide if cops were buzzing about a case she knew the public would be screaming she escaped to her office hit the autochef for coffee first then called for her messages and missed transmissions she stopped counting the hits from reporters when she reached twenty but six of those were from nadine furst at channel with coffee in hand eve sat at her desk drummed her fingers on it shed have to deal with the media sooner or later later would be better in fact sometime in the next millennium would suit her just fine but shed have to make a statement keep it short and official she decided refuse and avoid any sound bytes and oneonones thats what he wanted he wanted her going out talking about him getting airtime and print giving him some glory many of them did she reflected most of them did but this one wanted to be sensational he wanted the media shouting modern day ripper slashes through new york yeah that was his style big bold splashy jack the ripper she thought and turned to her computer to make notes grandfather of the modern serial killer never caught never positively identified central figure in multiple studies stories speculations for nearly two centuries subject of fascination and revulsion and fear media hype fueled panic and interest during his spree copycat expects to escape detection wishes to instill fear and fascination and pit himself against police would have studied the prototype would have studied medicine formally or informally in order to commit initial crime classy stationery possible symbol of wealth or taste some of the main suspects in the ripper case had been upperclass eve mused even royalty above the law considering themselves above the law other speculation had run to the ripper being an american in london shed always thought that bogus but was it possible her killer was a brit in america or maybe a what did you call it an anglophile somebody who admired things british had he traveled there walked the streets of whitechapel relived it imagined himself as the ripper she started to type up a report stopped then put in a call to dr miras office and wrangled an appointment dr charlotte mira wore one of her elegant suits an icy blue shed matched with a trio of long thin gold chains her soft brown hair had a few sunny highlights around her pretty face they were new eve noted and wondered if that was the sort of thing she was supposed to comment on or pretend she didnt notice she was never fully at ease in girl territory i appreciate you making time eve began i wondered if youd contact me today mira gestured to one of her scoop chairs everyones talking about your case your particularly gruesome case the more gruesome the more talk yes youre right because she imagined eve had subsisted on coffee all day mira programmed her autochef for tea i dont know how much of what ive heard is accurate im in the middle of writing my report i know its early to ask you for a profile but i dont want to wait on this one if im right hes just getting started jacie wooton wasnt his target not specifically i dont think he knew her or she him you believe it was random not exactly he wanted a particular type of woman an lc a whore a street prostitute in a poor area of the city he had very specific requirements wootons dead because she met them nothing more or less than that ill give you everything ive got orally then once ive worked it up ill send you everything in a file but i want i need she corrected some sense that im going down the right road tell me what you know mira handed her a delicate china cup then sat and balanced her own on her knee she began with the victim giving mira a sketch of jacie wooton as she had been as shed been found she described the note her fieldwork thus far and morris preliminary findings jack mira murmured jack the ripper eve leaned forward you know about him any criminal profiler worth her salt has studied saucy jack you think were dealing with a copycat do you settling back mira sipped her tea hes certainly laid the groundwork for that conclusion hed be educated egocentric he abhors women the fact that he chose that particular style of killing is telling his prototype for this crime assaulted and mutilated women in different ways hes elected to mimic the one that attacks and removes that which makes the victim female she saw by eves slow nod that the lieutenant had already reached that same conclusion he has essentially desexed her sex is equated for him with lust violence control humiliation his relationships with women are neither healthy nor traditional he sees himself as elite canny even brilliant so only you would do eve do for what for his adversary the greatest and most elusive killer of modern time couldnt settle for just any cop to pursue him he didnt know jacie wooton i agree or if he did his knowing of her was only to select the right victim but he knows you youre as much a target as she more she was a pawn a momentary thrill youre the game shed thought of that too and was still circling around how to make it useful he doesnt want me dead no at least not yet a faint crease of concern marred miras brow he wants you alive so that he can watch you chase him watch the media report his deeds and your pursuit the style of note was taunting and hed want to continue to taunt you you not just a cop but a highprofile cop and a female hell never lose to a woman and his certainty that hell crush you serve you your biggest defeat is a large part of the excitement for him then hes going to be seriously bummed when i take him down he could turn on you if he feels youre getting too close ruining his fantasy at first its a challenge but i dont believe hell tolerate the humiliation of being stopped by a woman she shook her head much of this depends on how much of the ripper personality hes taken on and which persona ascribed by the various theories to the ripper he himself believes its problematic eve when he said sample of my work did that mean his first or has he killed before and gone undetected its his first here in new york but im going to do a check through ircca some psycho tries to emulate jack the ripper every now and then but i dont know of anywhere he wasnt caught keep me updated and ill work up a more substantial profile i appreciate it she rose hesitated listen peabody had a little trouble this morning the vic was in pretty bad shape and well she got sick shes brooding about it like shes the first cop to puke on her shoes eve muttered anyway shes under some stress prepping for the detectives exam and then shes hunting for a place to cohab with mcnab which i dont really want to think about but she does so maybe you could find a minute to pat her on the head about it or something whatever shit mira let out a quick bubbling laugh its very sweet for you to be worried about her i dont want to be very sweet eve said with some passion or to worry about her this isnt the time for her head to be up her ass ill talk to her mira cocked her head and how are you me fine good no complaints um things good with you yes they are my daughter and her family are visiting for a few days its always nice for me to have them and the chance to play grandma uhhuh mira with her icy suit and pretty legs wasnt eves picture of anybodys grandma id love for you to meet them oh well were having an informal cookout on sunday id very much enjoy it if you and roarke could come about two she said before eve could think of a response sunday a little bubble of panic lodged in her throat i dont know if hes got anything going or not i ill check with him there was a laugh in miras eyes as she set her cup aside its just family nothing fancy now id better let you get back to work she walked to the door opened it and all but scooted eve out then she leaned back on the door and laughed it delighted her absolutely to see that slightly horrified and completely baffled expression on eves face when confronted with the idea of a family cookout she checked the time then hurried to her desk link shed just contact roarke immediately and box eve in before she could find an escape hatch eve was still horrified still baffled when she reached the homicide division again peabody leaped out of her cube and hotfooted after her sir lieutenant dallas what do you do at a cookout eve muttered why are you cooking at all much less out its hot out there are bugs i dont get it dallas what brows lowered eve spun around what is it ive got the customer lists it took some fast talking but i convinced the two outlets to give me the names of purchases those on record for the stationery found with jacie wooton did you run the names not yet i just got them let me have them ive got to do something to get my brain back in gear she snatched the disc out of peabodys hand and plugged it into her desk unit i dont have a cup of coffee in my hand eve commented as the names began to scroll and im sure i need it immediately yes sir you certainly do did you see theres a duchess and an earl and liva holdreak the actress and the coffee isnt in my hand how can this be and carmichael smith the international recording star has a standing order for a box of a hundred sheets and envelopes every six months as she spoke peabody put the mug into eves outstretched hand his musics too wanky for me but he himself totally iced im glad to know that peabody its important for me to know hes both wanky and iced should i arrest him for the murder of this very unfortunate lc we need to keep these things in the forefront just saying peabody grumbled she scanned the names shuffling those with only european residences on record to the bottom shed hit the ones with secondary residences in the states first carmichael smith keeps an apartment on the upper west side holdreak has a u s residence but its in new la well just drop her down a notch or two she started a standard run studying the names mr and mrs elliot p hawthorne esquire ages seventyeight and thirtyone respectively you wouldnt think elliot would be out cutting up lcs at his age married two years third time around elliot likes them young and i just bet he likes them stupid too doesnt seem stupid to marry a rich old guy peabody replied calculating you can be stupid and calculating at the same time keeps houses in london cannes new york and bimini made his money the oldfashioned way inherited it from his father no criminal record no nothing much still well see if hes in new york at the moment could have servants staff assistants crazy relatives hanging around him with access to his fancy paper she continued on down take the names peabody see if you can find out if any of them are in new york would it be that easy she wondered would he be that arrogant to leave something so easily traced back to him maybe maybe shed still have to prove it even if she targeted him through his fancy writing paper niles renquist she stated thirtyeight married one child brit citizen with residences in london and new york currently chief of staff for the un delegate from britain marshall evans got yourself digs on sutton place dont you niles fancy stuff no criminal on you either but youre worth a looksee she sipped coffee thought vaguely about food pepper franklin what the hell kind of name is pepper actress of course you are brit actress currently starring in broadway revival of uptown lady no criminal nothing but squeakyclean on this list it was a little depressing but she hit with pepper franklins cohabitation partner leo fortney sexual assault indecent exposure sexual battery bad boy eve reprimanded bad and busy boy when peabody came back eve already had her list in order of priority and was shrugging back into her jacket carmichael smith elliot hawthorne niles renquist and pepper franklin are all in new york or reputed to be in new york at this time suit up were going to go pay some of our english friends a visit she started out is the un in session un as in united nations no un as in unidentified numbskulls i recognize sarcasm when i hear it peabody said with some dignity ill check on it chapter it irritated her to jump through hoops every time she cleared one there was another stack to hurdle no amount of reason demand or threat got her through the maze of assistants staffers coordinators and personal attendants to carmichael smith or niles renquist she was forced to settle for appointments the following day which might have made her slightly less than diplomatic with the blonde touting herself as mr fortneys social secretary this isnt a social call see this eve all but pressed her badge to the womans nose this means im probably not feeling particularly sociable this is what we nypsd people like to call an official inquiry the blonde set her face into stern lines and succeeded in looking like a cranky baby doll mr fortney is very busy she said in an indignant lisp eve just bet some brainless guy found sexy he cant be disturbed if you dont tell your boss that lieutenant dallas of the nypsd is out here waiting to speak to him everyone in this buildings going to be disturbed hes unavailable eve had taken that line on smith who might very well have been at his health center having a complete physical workup and shed taken it on renquist who quite possibly had been in backtoback meetings with various heads of state but she wasnt taking it from some actresss bimbo companion peabody she said without taking her eyes off the blonde call for an illegals sweep i believe i smell zoner what are you talking about thats just silly obviously incensed the blonde danced on her fourinch platforms that had her impressive breasts bobbing like soccer balls you cant do something like that oh i bet i can and you know what happens sometimes on an illegals sweep it leaks to the media especially when theres a celebrity type involved i bet ms franklins going to be a little annoyed about that if you think you can intimidate me into illegals team will be here within thirty lieutenant peabody tried her cold cop voice shed been practicing youre authorized to lock down the building thank you officer that was quick work with me what the blonde clattered after her as eve strode out of the office where are you going what are you doing im going to lock down once a sweeps been authorized no one is allowed to enter or leave the premises you cant dont she grabbed eves arm ohoh eve paused enough to look at the lilywhite hand with its baby pink nails that clutched her sleeve that might be construed as assaulting an officer and an attempt to obstruct a police investigation since you seem a little dim to me ill just cuff you instead of knocking you on your ass then cuffing you i wasnt the blonde dropped eves arm as if it had burst into flame and scrambled back i didnt oh damn it okay okay okay ill tell leo hmm you know peabody eve took another testing sniff of air i dont think thats zoner after all i think youre right lieutenant i think its gardenia peabody let the grin spread as the blonde rushed back into the office she must be dim if she thinks you can call for a sweep that way dim or guilty bet shes got a little goodie stash in here who did you call eve asked weather its hot and its going to stay hot in case you wondered chin up the blonde stepped out again and announced in her best lisp mr fortney will see you now eve followed in the wake of the womans intense dislike fortney was set up in one of the five office suites the area appeared to have been decorated by the colorblind or the insane possibly both as even eves casual sense of style was bombarded with the clashing colors and patterns that dominated walls floors ceiling fortneys space had taken it one step further by adding animal prints that ran rampant over the walls in a jungle madness of leopard spots tiger stripes and splotches of unknown wildlife clear tables fashioned of glossy plates atop oddly phallic columns were used as accents his desk was a larger version of the tables with the penislike columns painted a virulent red he was pacing behind it as they entered talking rapidly into a headset we need to move on this within twentyfour up or down no in between ive got the outline the projections and the qfactor lets wrap it up he gave a comeahead gesture with a hand glittering with gold and silver bands while he continued to talk and pace eve sat in one of the tigerstriped chairs and studied him he was posing for her she had no doubt of it so shed accommodate him he was artfully dressed in a tunicjacket and pants both the color of green grapes his hair was a dark magenta worn long and sleek around a narrow deeply carved face his eyes too closely matched the shade of his suit to be natural like his fingers his ears glittered with gold and silver bands about six two eve judged with the heeled sandals and well turned out for his type took his body seriously she imagined and enjoyed showing it off in fancy duds since he was working hard to show her what a busy and important man he was she assumed he was neither he removed the headset smiled at her im so sorry lieutenant dennis im just swamped today dallas dallas of course dallas he made a little haha sound and walked to a long counter bent down to the minifriggie beneath he continued to speak in his rapidfire style in a accentless tone that said west coast to eve its just madness around here my minds going a thousand directions at once parched just parched drink no thank you he took out a bottle of something orange and frothy and poured it into a glass suelee tells me you were very insistent about seeing me suelee was very insistent i wouldnt see you well haha just doing her job dont know what id do without my suelee guarding the gates he beamed sat in an imabusybutpersonablesonofabitch style on the edge of his horrible red desk youd be amazed how many people try to get in to see me on any given day comes with the territory of course actors writers directors he threw up a hand waved it dramatically but i dont often have an attractive policewoman looking for a meeting his smile glittered white and perfectly even so tell me whatve you got play vid disc book cop dramas cooled off recently but theres always room for a good story the girl cop angles good whats your pitch your whereabouts between midnight and three a m this morning i dont understand im primary on a homicide investigation your names come up id like to know your whereabouts during the time frame i just gave you murder i dont oooh with another laugh he shook his head so his hair shook fashionably interesting pitch lets see my first reaction would be what shock insult fear a licensed companion was brutally murdered early this morning in chinatown you can speed up this process mr fortney by telling me where you were between midnight and three he lowered his glass youre serious midnight and three mr fortney well my god my god he laid his free hand on his heart patted it there i was home of course pepper comes straight home after the show we tend to go to bed early during a run its both physically and emotionally exhausting for her people dont understand the strain of performing night after night and how few reserves one has left after im not interested in where ms franklin was eve interrupted or in your stalling tactics she thought where were you well home as i said his tone was a little testy now pepper would have arrived by midnight and she needs a bit of company and care after a show so i always wait up to be there for her we had a nightcap while she ran down then we were tucked in before one so she could get her beauty sleep i cant understand why youd possibly question me an lc in chinatown what could that have to do with me can anyone verify that you were home during the timeframe pepper of course pepper i was right there to greet her when she arrived home just before midnight and we were in bed as i said by one shes a very light sleeper it comes from being so creative and sensitive shell tell you shed have known if i so much as stirred from the bed in the night he took another drink a longer one who was this woman who was killed do i know her i dont use the services of companions i do naturally know many people from various walks certainly some actors and hopefuls might moonlight as lcs jacie wooton it means nothing to me nothing the color that had come into his face during his rambling alibi began to diminish he shrugged carelessly now i dont believe ive ever been to chinatown you bought stationery in london several months ago fifty sheets and envelopes plain creamcolored unrecycled stock did i its certainly possible i buy quite a lot of things for myself for pepper as gifts what in the world does stationery have to do with anything its very expensive very distinctive stock it would be helpful if you could produce it paper bought months ago in london he made his haha sound again but this time it carried annoyance for all i know its still in london i think i should call my lawyer thats your choice you can ask your representative to meet us downtown at central to discuss your priors assaults and sex crimes his face turned nearly the same shade as his hair those incidents are in my past if you must know the sexual assault charge was completely unwarranted an argument with a woman id been dating that escalated and her revenge when i broke things off with her i didnt fight the charge as i felt it would only generate more ugly publicity and drag things out indecent exposure a misunderstanding id had a bit too much to drink after a party and impaired was relieving my bladder when a group of young women happened to pass it was foolish and illadvised but hardly criminal and the battery a shoving match with my exwife who started the incident by the way just an unfortunate display of temper which she used to skin me in the divorce i dont appreciate having all this thrown in my face or being accused of murder i was at home and in bed last night all night and thats all i have to say without my lawyer funny eve commented as she headed uptown a guy can be arrested and charged three times but none of it was his fault all misunderstandings yeah the laws a bitch what weve got here peabody is a weasely little man who likes to put on a big show look at me im important im powerful im somebody and he has a history of knocking women around showing off his dick and losing his temper surrounds himself with phallic symbols and has a bigbreasted blonde playing guardian of the gates i didnt like him but its a pretty big leap from shaking his wang to slicing up an lc steps and stages eve declared lets see if peppers home and how she slept last night the brownstone was lovely old and elegant and meant eve calculated as she walked toward the door private security the sort the owner could turn on and off at whim she rang the bell considered the entrance the flow of flowers in pots running up the short set of steps the proximity of neighboring houses when the door opened she had an immediate flash and not very pleasant of roarkes majordomo and the bane of her existence summerset the butler was dressed in stark black as was summersets habit he was long and thin with pewter hair atop a narrow face she actually felt her gorge rise may i help you lieutenant dallas officer peabody prepared to plow through him if necessary she flipped out her badge i need to speak with ms franklin ms franklin is engaged in her yoga meditation hour may i be of some assistance you can assist me by getting out of the way telling ms franklin shes got a cop at the door who wants to question her regarding an official investigation of course he said so genially she actually blinked please come in if youd make yourself comfortable in the living area ill inform ms franklin would you care for any refreshment while you wait no she eyed him suspiciously thanks ill just be a moment after gesturing them into a large sunny room with long white sofas he turned toward a staircase maybe we can trade summerset for him hey dallas check it out eve turned and studied what peabody was currently gaping at the lifesized portrait of pepper franklin rose above the sea green mantel of a white hearth in it she appeared to be dressed in nothing but mists they curled and draped around her shimmering and thin so that her impressive body was displayed her arms were stretched out as if welcoming an embrace she was smiling dreamily her lips painted deep rose her hair was a tumble of gold around a heartshaped face set off by wide deep blue eyes striking eve mused sensual powerful just what she wondered was a woman with that much style and strength doing with a loser like fortney ive seen her onscreen and in mags and stuff but this is you know wow she looks like i dont know a fairy queen thank you the voice was silver wrapped in fog that was the goal pepper said as she walked into the room its taken more or less from my role of titania she wore a skinsuit now in dark purple and had a short towel hooked around her neck her face still striking was sheened with perspiration and her hair was bundled up carelessly lieutenant dallas she offered a hand excuse my appearance im in the middle of yoga it helps keep me in shape body mind spirit it also makes me sweat like a pig im sorry to interrupt i assume its important she sat dropping down on the white sofa letting out a long sigh please have a seat oh god turney thanks she took the large bottle of water the butler brought her on a silver tray mr fortney is on the link hes called three times in the last thirty minutes he should know better than to call during yoga hour tell him ill get back to him she took a long drink angled her head well whats this about id like you to verify mr fortneys whereabouts this morning between midnight and three the easy smile vanished leo why his name has come up in the course of an investigation if i can verify his whereabouts during that period we can eliminate it and move on he was here with me i got home about eleven fortyfive maybe a few minutes later we had a drink i allow myself one glass of wine before bed after a performance we talked about various things then i went upstairs i suppose i was in bed and asleep by twelvethirty alone initially im always beat after a show and leos a night owl he was going to watch some screen make some calls something she lifted one elegant shoulder you a light sleeper ms franklin hell i sleep like the dead she started to laugh then caught the implication lieutenant leo was here honestly i cant imagine what sort of investigation you might be pursuing where leos name came up in any way youre aware its not the first time his names come up in a police investigation those incidents are in the past he had some bad luck with women until me he was here when i got home and we had coffee together this morning at about eight whats this about last fall mr fortney purchased in london some stationery oh for gods sake pepper tipped the bottle back for another drink im still angry with him about that ridiculous and careless unrecycled i dont know what he was thinking dont tell me he brought it with him into the us she rolled her eyes then stared at the ceiling really i know its against the law technically im very active in environmental groups which is why i could have skinned him for buying that stationery in fact we had a row about it and i made him promise to get rid of it im sure theres a fine and ill see he pays it im not a green cop im homicide those brilliant blue eyes went blank homicide early this morning a licensed companion identified as jacie wooton was murdered in chinatown i know peppers hand crawled up to her throat i heard the report this morning you cant possibly believe leo hed never do such a thing stationery of the type mr fortney purchased in london was used for a note left with the body he hes certainly not the only idiot who bought that stationery leo was home last night she bit off the words so that each one was highlighted lieutenant hes occasionally foolish tends to be a bit of a showoff but hes not vicious or violent and he was home she was going home herself dissatisfied shed done all she could for jacie wooton in one day but it wasnt enough she needed to clear her mind take a couple hours downtime then go back read over the reports the notes juggle it around in her home office fortney and franklin just didnt match for her the guy was a putz a braggart a fake with a handsome face her impression of franklin was that the woman was the real deal smart strong stable then again you never could tell why people ended up together shed given up trying to figure out how she and roarke had become a unit he was rich gorgeous sneaky just a little dangerous hed been everywhere and had bought most of it hed done everything and a great deal of what hed done didnt fall on her side of the law and she was a cop solitary shorttempered and unsociable he loved her anyway she mused as she drove through the iron gates of home because he did shed ended up here living in the huge stone palace draped in trees and flowers surrounded by the stuff of fantasy it was ridiculous really she thought that someone whod lived in reality often the harshest wells of it should end up in some sort of dreamscape she parked in front of the house shed leave her peagreen cop issue there as sort of an homage to summerset the gnome in her personal dreamscape he mightve still been on holiday sing hallelujah but since he despised her habit of parking out front of the spectacular entrance she saw no reason to stop she stepped inside into the cool and rarefied air of the house that roarke built and was immediately greeted by the cat the pudgy and obviously irritated galahad pranced up batted his head against her ankle and mewed shrilly hey ive got to work for a living i cant help it if youre alone all day with he who shall not be named out of the country but she bent down scooped the cat up you need a hobby or hey maybe they make vr for pets if not roarke will jump right on that she scratched the cat as she headed out of the foyer and downstairs to the gym little vr goggles for cats with programs about war on mice kicking a dobermans ass that sort of thing she dumped him on the floor of the gym and knowing the true path to his heart got a bowl of tuna from the autochef with the cat occupied she stripped down changed into workout gear and set herself a twentyminute run on the video track she opted for a beach run and set out at a light jog feeling her feet slap sand by the time she was at full pace shed worked up a nice sweat and was enjoying the salty breeze of the sea the sound of the surf you could keep your yoga eve thought give her a good fullout run then maybe a couple rounds with a workout droid follow it with a good strong swim and youd have your mind body and spirit tuned right up when the machine blinked endofprogram she grabbed a towel scrubbed it over her sweaty face with the intention of challenging the droid to a little handtohand she turned and there was roarke sitting on a weight bench with a cat in his lap and his eyes on his wife spectacular eyes she thought violently blue in a face carved by clever angels the dangerous poet the poetic danger whichever way you looked at it at him he was amazing hey she tunneled her fingers through her damp hair how long have you been here long enough to see you wanted a hard run youve had a long day lieutenant there was ireland in his voice dreamy wisps of it that could unexpectedly wind around her heart he set the cat aside and walked over to tip up her chin rubbed his thumb in the shallow dent in its center i heard about what happened in chinatown thats what pulled you out of bed so early this morning yeah shes mine just clearing my head before i get back to it again all right he touched his lips to hers you want a swim then eventually she rolled her shoulders to loosen them up handtohands next up i was going to use the droid but since youre here want to fight with me do you youre better than the droid she stepped back began to circle him marginally and to think some men come home after a day of work and are greeted by their woman he rolled up to his toes and back glad hed changed with the idea of a workout a smile a kiss perhaps a cold drink his grin flashed how tedious for them she lunged he countered she kicked out her foot coming within a halfinch of his face he slapped it away then swept her standing leg out from under her she went down rolled and was up again in seconds not bad she acknowledged and scored a hit midbody before their forearms slapped together in a block but i was holding back cant have that she came in on a spin left hook right cross that would have knocked his head back if shed connected his backhand stopped a hairbreadth from her nose with the droid shed have pounded and gotten pounded in return but this the demand for control was more challenging and a hell of a lot more fun she got under his guard flipped him but when she leaped on the mat to pin him he was already up again she had to somersault aside and came up just enough off balance to give him the opening her breath whooshed out as she hit the mat flat on her back with his weight pinning her she stared up into his eyes as she got her wind back lifting a hand so she could trail her fingers through the wonderful mane of black hair that nearly hit his shoulders roarke she murmured and with a little sigh tugged his hair to bring his lips to hers and when he relaxed started to sink into her she scissored her legs arched and flipped him over she was looking in his eyes again and grinning as she pressed the point of her elbow lightly to his throat sucker i do tend to fall for that one dont i well then it appears youve taken this he broke off winced what you hurt no just mustve jammed my shoulder a bit he rotated it winced again let me take a look she eased back shifting her weight and found herself flat on her back under him again sucker he said and laughed when her eyes went to slits foul no more foul than the seductive murmur of my name youre down darling he touched his lips to the tip of her nose well pinned his fingers linked with hers as he held her hands down now im going to have you you think i do victor spoils all that not going to be a sore loser are you he asked with his mouth rubbing hers who says i lost she arched her hips like i said youre better than the droid she arched again touch me i will lets start with this his mouth came down on hers warm and soft sliding her into the kiss deepening it until once again she lost her breath its never quite enough he whispered trailing his lips over her face down her throat never will be theres always more so he took more skimming those lips scraping his teeth over the swell of her breasts beneath the loose cotton tshirt her heart began to thud anticipation her fingers curled tighter against the ones that held her hands prisoner she didnt try to free herself not yet here too was control his and hers and trust absolute when he drew her hands down to her waist roamed with that busy mouth over her torso she braced herself for the onslaught of pleasure her skin was already damp her muscles taut he loved the feel of them hard and strong under all that smooth skin he loved the lines of her and the subtle almost delicate curves he released her hands then drew the shorts down with a slight frown he traced a fingertip over her thigh youve a bruise here youre always coming up with bruises hazard of the job she faced worse hazards they both knew he lowered his head touched his lips lightly to the faint discoloration amused she stroked his hair dont worry mom it doesnt hurt the laugh caught in her throat as his mouth got to work her hand fisted in his hair now and her other hand dug into the mat as her system shot from rest to revved a shockwave of heat a stunning ache that gathered in a fist of pressure then imploded inside her teach you to call me mum he said and nipped lightly at her thigh while she shuddered she got her breath back whistled it out again mom she repeated and made him laugh he wrapped his arms around her so they rolled playfully now hands sliding over flesh tugging off clothes lips meeting for nibbles or longer tastes she felt free and careless and foolishly in love as she held him against her easy enough to laugh even as her body quaked to rub her cheek against his in innocent affection even as he slid into her looks like ive pinned you again how long do you think you can keep me down another challenge is it his breath was backed up in his lungs but he moved slowly watching her watch him with long smooth almost lazy strokes he urged her up again until he saw her eyes begin to blur and the flush deepen in her cheeks and then heard her low sound that helpless sound of pleasure theres always more he said and captured her lips with his again and let himself fly with her chapter they ate in the dining room at roarkes suggestion that they have a meal like people who have lives outside their professions the remark was pointed enough to have eve checking her intention of grabbing a burger at her desk in her home office but her initial enjoyment of the crab salad was spoiled by his reminder that they had plans the following evening charity dinner dance he prompted when she stared blankly philadelphia we need to make an appearance he sipped his wine and smiled at her not to worry darling it wont hurt very much and we wont have to leave until after seven if youre running late you can change on the shuttle she poked sulkily at chilled crab did i know about this you did and if you ever glanced at your personal calendar you wouldnt so often be surprised and appalled by these little obligations im not appalled dinner dancing fancy outfit fancy people god its just that if something breaks at work understood she bit back a sigh because it was true he understood she heard enough comments from other cops about spouses or lovers who didnt or couldnt or wouldnt to appreciate it and she knew she wasnt nearly as flexible and understanding about the role she had to play as the wife of one of the richest and most influential men on or off planet she stabbed more crab and made an effort to pull her marital weight it shouldnt be a problem it might actually be fun sunday promises to be sunday mmm he topped off her wine figuring shed need it the cookout at dr miras its been a very long time since i attended something i suppose would be termed a kind of family picnic i hope theres potato salad she picked up her wine drank deep she talked to you you said yes of course we should take a bottle of wine or i wonder if beers more appropriate enjoying himself he lifted an eyebrow what do you think i cant think i dont know about this stuff ive never been to a cookout i dont understand the ritual if were both off on sunday we could just stay home in bed have sweaty sex all day hmm sex or potato salad youve hit me at two basic levels then he laughed at her and passed her half a roll hed already buttered eve its a simple family gathering she wants you there because youre important to her well sit around and talk about i dont know baseball or some such thing well eat too much and enjoy ourselves and youll have the chance to meet her family then well come home and have sweaty sex she scowled at the roll it just makes me nervous thats all you like having conversations with strangers i dont get that about you you have conversations with strangers all the time he pointed out you just call them suspects defeated she filled her mouth with bread now why dont we talk about something that wont make you nervous tell me about the case there was a lovely twilight outside the windows and candles flickering prettily on the table wine sparkled in crystal and silver gleamed and her mind she realized kept slipping back to a hacked body in a cold drawer at the morgue its not exactly dinner conversation not for normal people but it works for us the media reports were sketchy im not going to be able to keep them that way if and when he hits again i ducked reporters all day but im going to have to give them something tomorrow to stem the appetite she was an lc bumped down to street level because of some illegals busts she seemed to be clean now though id still like to find her supplier just to knot that thread a downonherluck lc shouldnt have the media slathering very long no it wont be who itll be how that gets them drooling he took her in an alley the way it looked she went in to do the job he faced her to the wall slit her throat even from behind he couldnt have avoided all the blood spatter she picked up her wine again staring into it rather than drinking then he laid her out across the alley floor morris thinks a laser scalpel he cut her pelvis out took the whole works you could all but swim in the blood she drank now let out a breath there was something about blood she thought the scent of death blood once you smelled it you never completely got it out of your system clean job though almost surgical had to have a bag to take it away in had to work fairly quickly had to clean himself up before he walked back out again even down there that time of night somebodys going to notice a guy covered in blood and no one did no theyd check again she thought and again but odds were theyd come up zero see no evil hear no evil speak all you want as long as it doesnt put you in the mix he didnt know her im almost sure otherwise hed have gone for the face some thats what they do thrill crime lust driven woman hater peabody got dogsick and spent a good part of the day kicking herself about it he thought of what the victim what the alley must have looked like and rubbed a hand over eves have you ever gotten sick not onscene its like saying you did more than i can take more than i can handle and i cant stand over this body and look at what you did but sometimes later it comes back on you middle of the night mostly then you get sick she drank now anyway he left a note addressed to me dont freak she said when she felt his fingers tighten over her hand its professional rather than personal hes admired my work wanted to give me a chance to see his he wanted me on this one an ego thing ive had two very hot cases this summer with walltowall media attention he wants that sort of buzz his fingers stayed over hers what did it say just that cocky he signed it jack emulating the ripper then you save me a lot of steps when you get it yeah the choice of victim the location the method even the note to a cop too much of its already leaked to the media and if they get their teeth in it its going to be a frenzy i want to shut him down fast before the panic been working with the note the paper whats unique about it unrecycled very pricey manufactured in england sold exclusively in europe do you manufacture unrecycled paper products roarke industries is green just our little contribution to environmental responsibility which also earns a healthy tax break in most markets he ignored the server droid who came to clear the plates and bring out small dessert parfaits and coffee wheres the paper taking you im focusing on london outlets first playing the ripper angle ive got a couple of celebs a politician type a retired financier and the asshole lover of some actress named pepper pepper franklin yeah she strikes me as straight up but the guy she trailed off narrowing her eyes as roarke scooped up a spoonful of parfait you know her mmm this is very nice refreshing you banged her though his lips twitched he managed to maintain a sober expression as he sampled more parfait thats a very unattractive term i prefer saying we had a brief and mature relationship which included the occasional banging i shouldve known shes just your type is she he queried gorgeous elegant sophisticated sex darling he sat back to sip his coffee how conceited of you not that you arent all those things and more im not talking about me she scowled at him a moment then went to work on the parfait i should have figured her for one of your formers the minute i saw the portrait ah she still has that does she the titania portrait she shoveled parfait in her mouth youre going to tell me you gave it to her as what you might call a parting gift what like on a game show his laughter was rich and full of fun if you like how is she i havent seen her in christ seven or eight years i suppose shes dandy watching him she licked her spoon but her taste in men has seriously declined why thank you he grabbed her hand kissed it while mine in women has seriously improved she wouldnt have minded working up a good head of jealousy steam to see what it felt like but it just didnt work for her yeah yeah yeah shes hooked up with a guy named leo fortney operator hes got operator all over him and a couple of pops including sexual assault doesnt sound like peppers usual fare is he your prime suspect hes number one right now though he was home in bed during the time involved shes corroborating but since she was sleeping im not putting much weight there plus he lied said they went nightynight together and she said different before she realized shed be blowing it for him still she struck me as a straight shooter she paused waited she is yes so whether or not he was there she thinks he was well see where it goes meanwhile ive got informals set up tomorrow with carmichael smith to start pop music king irritatingly saccharine lyrics overorchestrated melodies so im told you may not have been told as ive been that smith enjoys young women preferably more than one at a time and makes considerable use of groupies as well as professionals to help him relax between recording sessions and gigs minors thereve been rumblings that there might have been an underage fan now and again though hes usually more careful no violence that ive heard of though he likes bondage games he prefers being the one bound he one of yours no hes still with his original label i could probably poach him but his music just annoys me okay moving on theres niles renquist works for un delegate marshall evans i know renquist slightly so do you i do you met him i think it was last spring at another appalling obligation he watched her eyebrows draw together as she tried to place it the place the meet the man more a quick introduction than a meet actually a silent auction benefiting well there you have me he murmured id need my book for that but it was a few months ago here in new york youd have been introduced to him and his wife at some point because she couldnt bring it in she let it go did i have an impression apparently not hes lets see conservative leaning toward stuffy late thirties id say wellspoken welleducated what you might call a bit prissy his wifes quite pretty in the british teaparty style they have homes here and in england i know as i recall his wife telling me she enjoyed new york but much preferred their home outside london where she could garden properly did you have an impression cant say i liked either of them overmuch he lifted a shoulder in a vague shrug a bit on the pompous side and very aware of class distinctions and levels of society the sort id find tedious if not downright annoying with regular exposure you know a lot of people who fit that box his lip twitched i do yes i do elliot p hawthorne yes ive had dealings with him seventies sharp lives for golf apparently dotes on his third considerably younger wife and travels quite a lot now that hes retired i like him quite a bit is that helpful at all anybody you dont know not worth mentioning the evening at home with roarke had helped clear her mind eve decided as she rode up in the jammed elevator to the homicide division not only did she feel rested wellfed and tuned up but his informal rundown of some of the names on her list gave her a different insight it was more personal and certainly more informative than the dry facts from a standard id run she could shuffle his data around in her head as she questioned each party and angle those questions around the more personal information but first she needed to check for any updates on lab and me reports round up peabody and face the media music she elbowed her way out of the elevator and turned toward her sector and all but ran into nadine furst the onair reporter had a new short and sleek hairdo what was it eve thought with new hair on everybody it was blonder swingier and swept back from nadines perfect angular face she was wearing a short fitted jacket over slim fitted pants both in power red which told eve she was cameraready and she carried a huge white bakery box that smelled gloriously of fat and sugar doughnuts there was no mistaking that scent and eve homed in on it like a hound on a fox youve got doughnuts in there she tapped a finger to the box thats how you get through the bullpen avoid the civilian and media lounges and end up in my office you bribe my men nadine fluttered her lashes and your point is my point is how come i never get a damn doughnut because generally i time it better dump my offering in the bullpen sometimes its brownies and while every cop in homicide descends like a pack of coyotes i settle down in your office and wait for your arrival eve waited a beat bring the doughnuts leave the camera i need my camera nadine said gesturing to the woman beside her i need a sunny sunday at the beach where i can romp naked as a puppy in the surf but im not going to get it any time soon either doughnuts in camera out to ensure obedience and to prevent her men from rioting she snatched the bakery box herself before striding into the bullpen several heads lifted noses sniffed the air dont even think about it eve ordered and kept right on walking through choruses of protests and complaints there are three dozen in there nadine told her as she followed eve into her office you cant possibly eat them all i could just to teach those greedy hogs a lesson however this is a lesson in discipline and authority she opened the box sighed deep as she perused her choices all glossy all hers ill let them think im keeping them all and have my fill then have them weeping with gratitude when i take out the leftovers to share she plucked one out brought up coffee on the autochef then bit in cream filled yum chewing she checked her wrist unit then counted back from ten as she crossed to the door peabody rushed to the doorway as eve hit one dallas hey i was just taking another enormous bite eve closed the door in her aides sorrowful face that was really cold nadine commented and did what she could to swallow the laugh yeah but fun now that weve had our fun i need an update on the wooton murder and a oneonone it wouldve been easier to set this up if youd bothered to return any of my calls eve sat on the corner of the desk cant do it nadine i need to verify if there was as rumored some sort of communication left at the crime scene and the contents therein also what progress has or has not been made since nadine i cant undaunted nadine helped herself to coffee sat in eves battered visitors chair crossed her legs the public has a right to know and i as media representative have a responsibility to save it we can go through the dance but youve brought me these nice doughnuts and i dont want to waste your time giving nadine a moment to stew eve licked sugar off her thumb im going to issue a press release give a statement and youll have it along with the other media reps within the hour but i cant give you a head start or agree to a oneonone i need to pull back a little nadine was finished stewing and ready to cut to the core what makes this case different if theres to be some sort of media shutdown stop shift out of reporter mode for one goddamn minute youre a friend of mine i like you and beyond that i think you do a good job a responsible one great fine and right back at you but im not shutting you out the fact is im treating you as i would any other media rep except eve thought for the doughnut gorging and private chat my tendency to show favoritism toward you is one of the reasons you were pulled into the stevenson case last month that was nadine it was the quiet patience in eves tone something rarely heard that had nadine subsiding again there were complaints and theres speculation of the sort that could bring us both grief if i dont throttle back on the cop reporter relationship a bit so i cant feed you this time i need the rumbles to quiet down before i start to be known as fursts pet or you as mine enough reporters get together and start crying foul and favoritism its not going to be good for either of us nadine hissed through her teeth shed heard the complaints and the speculation and had already weathered some resentment among her own rank and file youre right and thats a pisser doesnt mean i wont hound you dallas goes without saying the battle light shone in her eyes again and matched the sharp little smile or bribe your men i like brownies especially the ones with those chunks of chocolate in them nadine set the coffee down got up listen if you need to leak something give quinton post a try hes young yet but hes good and the work matters to him as much maybe even a little more than the ratings that wont last she added cheerfully but you might as well get him while hes fresh ill keep it in mind alone eve refined her official statement then ran it through channels carting the bakery box back into the bullpen she dropped it on the communal autochef all movement stopped silence fell peabody she said into the breathless hush with me shed barely hit the doorway when the riot of rushing feet and clamor of voices erupted behind her cops and doughnuts she thought a wellhonored tradition that almost brought a sentimental tear to the eye i bet there were jellyfilled i bet there were peabody muttered as they muscled onto an elevator some of them had those little colored sprinkle things on top like edible confetti peabodys square and sturdy jaw wobbled with emotion all i had time for this morning was reconstituted banana slices on a stale bagel youre breaking my heart at garage level eve strolled off the elevator carmichaels first stop were catching him between his morning aqua therapy and daily skin treatment you couldve saved me one one little doughnut i could have eve agreed as they climbed in her vehicle i could have done that in fact she rummaged around in her pocket pulled out an evidence bag inside was a jelly doughnut i believe i did for me overjoyed peabody snatched it sniffed through the bag you saved me a doughnut youre so good to me i take back everything i was thinking you know how youre a cold selfish doughnuthogging bitch and all that thanks dallas dont mention it i really shouldnt eat it though peabody caught her bottom lip between her teeth stroking the bag as eve backed out of the slot i really shouldnt im on a diet ive just got to lose some of the square footage of my ass so i oh for christs sake give it back then but when eve reached out peabody cringed back doughnut bag clutched at her breasts face screwed into dangerous lines mine peabody you continue to be a fascination to me thanks slowly savoring the moment peabody unsealed the bag anyway i deserve it im using up lots of calories studying for the detectives exam and stressing about it stress sucks up calories like a vacuum thats why youre so thin im not thin im not stressed if youve got an excess ounce of body fat ill eat it respectfully sir peabody added with a mouthful of jelly doughnut but ive really been hitting the discs and the simulators mcnabs helping me out hes hardly even being an asshole right now wonder of wonders its coming up really soon i was wondering if you could tell me where you think my weak areas are so i could work on them you question yourself even when your gut tells you youre right you dont trust it enough youve got good instincts but you tend to be afraid to go with them without confirmation from a superior you often question your own competence and when you question yours youre questioning mine she glanced over unsurprised to see peabody keying her comments into her notebook between bites of doughnut youre writing this down it helps to see it you know then to do these affirmations in the mirror im a confident competent officer of the law and like that she flushed a little its just a method whatever eve nosed into a narrow space at the curb lets confidently and competently see where carmichael smith was night before last yes sir but i also have to stress and obsess about having eaten that jelly doughnut thatll work off the calories and even it out itll be like i never ate it at all then you might want to wipe the jelly off your lip eve stepped out of the car studied the building it had been she supposed a small threelevel apartment building at one time now it was a single residence on a tony street private security again two entrances in the front at least one in the back she assumed not so far from an alley in chinatown geographically but worlds away in every other form no lcs on the stroll here no glidecarts on the corners highmaintenance and low crime she circled around the walk and up to the main entrance on the second level security panel palm plate and a retinal scan a very careful man she engaged the panel and frowned at the music that soared out a lot of strings and keyboard around a creamy male voice love lights the world peabody identified its sort of his signature song its got more calories than your doughnut welcome the computer said in polite female tones we hope youre having a wonderful day please state your name and your business dallas lieutenant eve she lifted her badge for a scan police business ive got an appointment with mr smith this morning one moment please thank you lieutenant mr smith is expecting you youre cleared almost immediately the door was opened by a darkskinned woman in snowy white there was more music here quietly dripping its sweetness in the air good morning thank you for being prompt please come in make yourself at home in the living area carmichael will be right with you she glided eve thought like a woman on rollers instead of feet as she ushered them into a large room with blond walls there was a mood screen taking up one of those walls with an image of a white boat drifting on a blue sea as calm as a plate of glass thick gel cushions were spread over the floor in lieu of actual furniture and all were in pastels tables were long and low in that same blond tone a fuzzy white kitten curled on one of the tables and blinked emerald eyes at eve please relax ill let carmichael know youre here peabody walked over and poked at one of the floor cushions i guess you sink right in and it molds to your butt experimentally she reached back and patted a hand over her ass that could be embarrassing that music is making my teeth ache eve ran her tongue around them then turned as carmichael smith made his entrance he was tall about six three with a welltoned body he was currently showing off in a fluid white vest that left his pecs and abs on display his pants were black and snug so he could display his other attributes his hair was dramatically streaked black and white and worn back in a queue to leave his face wide highboned and narrowed to a sharp pointed chin unframed his eyes were deep meltedchocolate brown his skin the color of coffee light ah lieutenant dallas or do i call you mrs roarke eve heard peabodys smothered snort ignored it you call me lieutenant dallas of course of course he strode in vest streaming and took the hand shed yet to offer in both of his its just that i only made the connection this morning he gave her hand an intimate squeeze then turned his charm on peabody and who might you be my aide officer peabody i have some questions mr smith more than happy to answer them he took peabodys hand as he had eves please please sit lis bringing us some tea i have a special morning blend for energy its simply fantastic call me carmichael he lowered smoothly to a peachcolored cushion and took the little cat into his lap there now snowdrop did you think daddy had forgotten you she didnt want to sit on one of the cushions nor did she want to remain standing and towering over him so she sat on the table can you tell me where you were early yesterday morning between midnight and three a m like the cat he blinked well that sounds very official is there some problem yes the murder of a woman in chinatown i dont understand such negative energy he breathed deep we try to keep a positive flow in this house yeah im sure jacie wooton found being sliced up a pretty negative experience can you verify your whereabouts mr smith li he said as the black woman in flowing white streamed in do i know anyone named jacie wooton no do we know where i was night before last between midnight and three yes of course she poured pale gold tea from a pale blue pot into pale blue cups you were attending the dinner party hosted by the rislings until ten you escorted ms hubble home had a nightcap with her in her apartment and returned here about midnight you spent twenty minutes in your isolation tank to eliminate any negativity before retiring you were in bed by onethirty and had your usual wakeup call at eight the following morning thank you he picked up the teacup shed set on the table its difficult for me to keep all those details in my head id be lost without li id like the names and addresses of the people you were with to verify this information im feeling very unsettled about this its routine mr smith when i confirm your alibi i can move on li will provide you with anything you need he made a gesture with his hand its important to my wellbeing to my work to keep my senses stimulated by the positive by love and by beauty right you have a standing order from whittiers in london for a certain type of stationery your last purchase of it was four months ago no i never purchase anything i cant go into shops you see my fans are so enthusiastic i have things brought in to me or li or one of my staff goes into the shops i do enjoy good stationery i feel its important to send personal notes on good paper to friends or those whove made some contribution creamcolored heavyeight bond unrecycled unrecycled he ducked his head smiling into his cup like a small boy caught with his hand in the cookie jar im ashamed to say i have been using something like that not very green of me but its gorgeous paper li does my writing paper come from london i can check shell check fine id like a sample of it too if you dont mind and the names of any staff members who were authorized to make purchases for you in london ill take care of that li glided out again i dont quite understand how my writing paper could interest you there was a note written on that style of paper left with the body please he lifted both hands drawing them up his own body as he breathed in pushing them outward as he exhaled i dont want that sort of image corrupting my senses thats why i listen only to my own music i never watch the media reports except for specially selected features on entertainment or society theres too much darkness in the world too much despair tell me about it when eve left she had a sample of his writing paper and the names of his staffers in london hes weird peabody commented but hes built and he just doesnt seem like the type whod go hunting lcs he likes to have multipartner sex occasionally with minors oh peabody wrinkled her nose as she glanced back toward the house so much for my instincts on this one maybe he figures underage groupies have less negativity sexually speaking than any grown woman who could listen to that crap he plays and not run screaming after five minutes she got into the car slammed the door if that stinking love lights the world sticks in my head im coming back here and beating him with a club now thats positive peabody decided chapter knowing the security at the un was tight eve decided to avoid a possible pissing match with guards and parked in a secondlevel street ramp on first avenue the little crossblock hike would help work off the doughnuts they still allowed tours shed checked but they were stringently regulated with the threat of terrorism always a thunderhead ready to storm but nations throughout the world and the recognized offplanet factions had their meetings and assemblies their votes and their agendas inside the huge white building that dominated its sixblock stretch the flags still waved a colorful symbol eve supposed of mans willingness to get together and talk about the problems of humanity and occasionally do something about them even with their names on the visitors list she and peabody went through a series of checkpoints at the first they surrendered their weapons a requirement that always made eve twitchy their badges were scanned their fingerprints verified peabodys bag was scanned then handsearched all electronics including links ppcs and communicators were taken through analysis they passed through a metal detector an incendiary device detector a weapon identifier and a body scanner all before being cleared through entry level okay eve declared maybe theyve got to be careful but im drawing the line at a cavity search some of these security levels were added after the cassandra incident peabody stepped with eve and a uniformed guard into a bombproof elevator next time we need to talk to renquist he comes to us they were escorted off the elevator and directly to another checkpoint where they were scanned analyzed and verified again they were passed from the guard to a female aide who was equally military in bearing the aides retina scan and voice command unlocked a bomb door through it they moved from paranoid security to daily business it was a hive of offices but a very big hive with very efficient chambers here the highlevel drones wore conservative suits and headsets with heels that clicked briskly on tiled floors the windows were triplesealed and equipped with airtraffic detectors that would slam down impact shields at any threat but they let in the light and a decent view of the river a tall thin man in unrelieved gray nodded at the aide smiled at eve lieutenant dallas im thomas newkirk personal assistant to mr renquist ill escort you from here some security youve got here mr newkirk she spotted cameras and motion sensors along the corridor eyes and ears everywhere she thought who could work that way he followed the track of her gaze you stop noticing just a price to be paid for safety and freedom uhhuh he had a square face a jaw so sharp and straight it might have been sliced off with a sword very pale very cool blue eyes and a ruddy complexion under short bristly sandy hair he walked very erect with a purposeful stride his arms straight at his sides you former military captain raf mr renquist has a number of former military on staff he used a key card to access another door and renquists suite of offices just one moment please while she waited eve studied the area another warren of rooms most separated by glass panels so that the staffers were exposed to each other and the cameras it didnt seem to bother them as they worked away at keyboards or headsets she glanced in the direction newkirk had taken and saw that it ended in a closed door with renquists name on it it opened and newkirk stepped out again mr renquist will see you now lieutenant it was a lot of buildup for an ordinary man which was her first impression of renquist he stood behind a long dark desk that might have been wood might have been old with an east river view at his back he was tall with the kind of build that told her he used a health center regularly or paid good money to a body sculptor she also figured his build was wasted in the dull gray suit though the suit had probably cost him a great deal he was attractive enough if you went for the polished and distinguished type he was fairskinned fairhaired with a prominent nose and a wide forehead his eyes a kind of sooty gray were his best feature and met hers directly his voice was clipped and ohsobritish she expected crumpets whatever the hell they were to come popping out of his mouth along with the words lieutenant dallas im very pleased to meet you ive read and heard quite a bit about you already he held out a hand and she was treated to a firm dry politicians shake i believe we met once some time back at a charity function so im told please have a seat he gestured and sat behind his desk tell me what i can do for you she sat in a sturdy cloth chair not a comfortable one she noted busy man cant have people sitting around in his office taking up too much of his time his desk was another hive of industry the data and communication system with the screen blinking on hold a short stack of discs another stack of paper the second link among the work was a duet of framed photographs she could see a slice of a young girls face and curly hair both fair like her fathers and assumed the other shot would be of his wife she knew enough about politics and protocol to at least start out playing the game id like to thank you for myself and on behalf of the nypsd for your cooperation i know youre extremely busy and appreciate you taking the time to speak with me i believe strongly in assisting the local authorities wherever i am the un is on an elemental level the worlds police force in a way were in the same profession you and i how can i help you a woman named jacie wooton was murdered the night before last im the primary investigator yes i heard of the killing he leaned back but his eyebrows lowered a licensed companion in the chinatown district yes sir in the course of my investigation ive had reason to research and trace a certain brand of stationery you purchased this brand of writing paper six weeks ago in london i was in london this summer for a few days and did indeed buy stationery several different types as i recall some for personal use some for gifts am i to understand that this purchase makes me a suspect in this womans death he was cool she thought more intrigued than worried or annoyed and if she wasnt mistaking that faint curve of mouth he was a little amused in order to expedite my investigation i need to check all the names of purchasers and verify their whereabouts on the night in question i see lieutenant can i assume this line of investigation is secure and discreet having my name linked however loosely with a licensed companion and a murder would generate considerable unwanted media attention on myself on delegate evans the name wont be made public all right night before last between midnight and three he didnt reach for his book but instead steepled his fingers watched eve over the tips my wife and i attended the theater a production of six weeks by william gantry a british playwright at lincoln center we were in the company of two other couples left the theater at about eleven then had a posttheater drink at renoirs i believe we left there my wife and i around midnight wed have been home by twelvethirty my wife went to bed and i worked in my home office for perhaps an hour it mightve been a little longer following habit i would have watched about thirty minutes of news then retired for the night did you see or speak with anyone after your wife went to bed im afraid i didnt i can only tell you that i was home tending to my work when this murder took place im confused how buying this paper connects me to this woman or her death her killer wrote a note on that stationery a note now renquists eyebrows lifted well that was rather arrogant of him wasnt it hes not really covered for the time of the murder either peabody pointed out as they walked back to the car thats the problem when somebody buys it at two in the morning most of the suspects are going to claim they were home innocently tucked into their own beds they got their own security or a way around hotel or apartment security its tough to call them a stinking liar do you think he is a stinking liar its early yet she tracked elliot hawthorne down on the eleventh hole of a private club on long island he was a sturdy tough man with a shock of white hair fluttering around under a tan cap matched by the luxurious white mustache that set off his tanned face there were lines scored around his mouth fanned out from his eyes but the eyes themselves were sharp and clear as he drove the ball off the tee he passed the driver back to his caddy hopped in a small white cart then signaled for eve to join him talk fast was all he said as he sent the cart zipping forward she did giving him the details as peabody and the caddy followed on foot dead whore fancy writing paper he gave a little grunt as he stopped the cart used whores from time to time never kept track of their names he jumped out circled his ball studied the lay got a young wife dont need whores now dont remember the paper you got a young wife you buy all sorts of useless shit london yes august london paris milan i still got my fingers in some business and she likes to shop if you say i bought the paper i bought the paper so what its tied to the murder if you could tell me where you were between midnight and three night before last he let out a bark of laughter stood from where hed crouched by the ball and gave her his full attention young lady im more than seventy im fit but i need my sleep i play eighteen holes every morning and before i do i have a good breakfast read the paper and check the stock reports im up every morning at seven im in bed every night by eleven unless my wife drags me out to some shindig night before last i was in bed by eleven and after making love to my wife a process that doesnt take as long as it once did i was asleep cant prove it of course he brushed her back turned to the caddy gimme the seven iron tony she watched him set sight then smack the ball into a pretty arch it bounced on the green and rolled to within about five feet of the cup from hawthornes wide grin she assumed it was a good shot id like to speak with your wife he shrugged handed the club back to the caddy go ahead shes over at the courts got a tennis lesson today darla hawthorne was dancing around on a shaded court in a candypink romper with a flippy skirt she was doing more dancing than actual connecting with the ball but she looked damn good doing so she was built like a teenagers wet dream lots of soft jiggling breast barely contained and long long legs shown off by the little skirt and matching pink shoes she was so evenly tanned she might have been painted her hair which must have hit her waist when unrestrained was tied back in a ribbon pink natch and scooped through the hole in her little pink visor it swung happily back and forth as she pranced over the court and missed the bright yellow ball when she bent over to retrieve it eve was treated to the sight of her heartshaped butt in tight highcut panties under the skirt her instructor a hunky guy with lots of streaky hair and white teeth called out direction and encouragement at one point he came over to stand behind her nuzzling her back against him as he adjusted her swing she sent him a big lashfluttering smile over her shoulder mrs hawthorne before the balls could start flying again eve stepped onto the court tennis guy immediately rushed forward boots you cant walk on this surface without the proper foot attire im not here to whack balls she held up her badge i need a moment with mrs hawthorne well you have to take those off or stand on the sidelines we have rules whats the problem hank theres a policewoman here mrs h oh darla bit her lip and patting her heart walked over to the end of the net if this is about that speeding ticket im going to pay it i just im not traffic can i have a minute oh sure hank i could use a break anyway getting all sweaty she walked with a lot of swinging hip to a bench opened a pink bag and took out a bottle of designer water could you tell me where you were night before last between midnight and three what beneath the glow on her perfect oval face darla paled why its just a routine stop in a matter im investigating sweetie knows i was home her eyes mermaidgreen began to swim i dont know why hed have you investigating me im not investigating you mrs hawthorne hank walked over handed her a small towel any problem mrs h no problem here go flex your muscles someplace else dismissing him eve sat beside darla midnight and three night before last i was home in bed she shot eve a defiant look now with sweetie where else would i be good question eve thought she asked about the writing paper but darla shrugged it off yes theyd been in europe in august and she bought a lot of things why shouldnt she how was she supposed to remember everything shed bought or that sweetie bought for her dallas circled around for another few minutes then stood so darla could walk back and be comforted by hank he shot eve a nasty look before leading his student toward what eve assumed was the clubhouse interesting eve stated aloud looks like our darla was out practicing on hanks balls during at least part of the time in question definitely getting more than instruction on her backswing peabody agreed poor sweetie if sweetie knows his wifes playing singles with her tennis pro he couldve used the time she was out pulling his racket to get downtown do wooton you got a wifes running crosscourt on you it pisses you off so you not only kill a whore and whats your young unfaithful wife but a whore but you use the cheating bitch as your alibi game set match very neat yeah and i liked your tennis metaphors too we do what we can anyway its a theory lets go see what else we can dig up on hawthorne hed been married three times as roarke had stated with each successive spouse younger than the preceding one hed divorced both former mrs hawthornes and had nipped them off with the lowest possible financial package as arranged through a premarital agreement an ironclad one from the results eve mused the man was no fool would such a careful and canny man be oblivious to his current wifes activities he had no criminal record though hed been sued a number of times in civil court for various financial deals a quick scan told her most of them were nuisance suits brought by unhappy and unlucky investors he owned four homes and six vehicles including a yacht and was associated with numerous charities his reported worth was just under a billion golf according to the various media articles and features she scanned through appeared to be his god every name on her list had an alibi corroborated by a spouse or partner or employee which meant none of them held much weight sitting back eve propped her feet on her desk closed her eyes and took herself back into the chinatown alley she walks in ahead of him she leads the john her feet hurt shes got a bunion shoes are killing her two in the morning hot airless not much business tonight only two hundred in her cash bag gives her four maybe five johns on this circuit depending what they wanted been in the game a long time knows to get payment upfront did he take it back or didnt he give her a chance to take it no chance she decided hed want to move fast spins her around wants her facing the wall does he touch her run his hand over her breast her ass slide it over her crotch no no time for that not interested in that especially after the blood gushes out on his hands warm blood thats what got him off against the wall tug her head back by the hair left hand slice the scalpel over her throat with the right left to right slight downward path blood gushes splashes on the wall splashes back at her face her body his hands shes alive for a few seconds just a few shocked seconds when she cant scream and her body jerks a little as it dies lay her down head toward the opposite wall get out your tools a light some sort of light cant do that sort of precision work in the dark laser scalpel use the light from the laser scalpel to guide the way put what you came for in a leakproof bag clean off your hands change your shirt or take off what you were wearing over it everything in a bag or case now check yourself make sure youll pass on the street take out the note smile at it amuse yourself place it carefully on the body walk out of the alley fifteen minutes maybe no more than fifteen and youre walking away carrying your prize back to your car excited but controlled need to drive carefully cant risk a routine stop when you smell of death and have that part of her with you back home reset security shower dispose of your clothes you did it youve imitated one of the great killers of the modern age and no ones the wiser she opened her eyes stared up at the ceiling if it was one of her five current candidates hed have to dispose of the body part as well or have a very secure place to keep it as a souvenir would a regular household recycler handle that sort of thing or would you need something that handled medical waste shed need to check on that bringing up a map onscreen she calculated time and distance from the murder site to each of the suspects residences giving fifteen minutes in the alley the time to hunt the victim likely scoped out at some point earlier clean up drive home any of them could have done the job in under two hours straightening up she began to type up a report hoping inspiration would strike when it didnt she read over the facts finished it off and filed it she spent another hour learning about recyclers and the availability of laser scalpels and decided to go back to the scene the street did a decent business during the day a couple of bars a storefront eatery a market and a money exchange were the closest businesses to the alley only the bars had been open after midnight and both of them were at the far ends of the block though the neighborhood had already been canvassed she swung through each place again running the routine asking the questions coming away empty she ended up standing at the mouth of the alley again with the beat cop the neighborhood security droid and peabody like i said the cop named henley told her i knew her the way you know the local lcs she never caused any trouble technically theyre not supposed to use the alley or any public access for work but most of them do we roust them now and again for it she ever complain about any john getting rough or hassling her wouldnt have henley shook his head she steered clear of me and the droid give me a little nod if we passed each other on patrol but she wasnt the friendly sort we get some rough stuff in this sector johns and janes slapping an lc around you got some mopes coming through mugging them and sometimes they wave a sticker around had some use em but not like this never had anything like this i want a copy of any reports where they used a sticker any kind of blade i can get that for you lieutenant the droid told her how far back do you want to go give me a full year keep it to attacks on women with lcs the priority maybe he practiced first yes sir where should i transmit send it to me at central henley wheres the safest place to park in this area street or underground not a surface lot or port well you want quiet lower crime probably youd go west maybe lafayette you want busy so theres too much going on for anybody to mess with your ride you could hike it up the other side of canal into little italy restaurants stay open late okay were going to try this one of you take from here to lafayette the other head north ask residents merchants who might have been around at that time of night if they noticed a guy alone carrying a bag some kind of bag goodsized one hedve been moving along pretty quick no meandering and going for a car talk to the lcs she added one of them may have tried to hustle him and got brushed off long shot sir peabody said when theyd split off again somebody saw him they dont know it but they saw him we get lucky jog a few memories she stood on the sidewalk baking in the heat as she scanned the street were going to have to see how much we can stretch the budget for added security and surveillance for a square mile around this scene hell stick to the mile stick to the script and it played too well for him the first time hes not going to want to wait too long before act two chapter it was a difficult meeting for him to take it had to be done and roarke could only hope that some of the weight he was carrying at the base of his skull would lift once it was over hed put it off too long already and that wasnt like him then again he hadnt felt completely like himself since hed met moira obannion and shed told him her tale his mothers story life he thought as he stared out the wide window wall of his midtown office could take a big chunk out of your ass when you were least prepared for it it was after five already and his timing had been deliberate hed wanted to meet with moira at the end of the day so that there was no business to be done afterward so that he could go home and try to shift it all aside with an evening out with his wife his interoffice link beeped and damn him he nearly jolted yes caro ms obannions here thanks bring her back he watched the traffic air and sky and thought idly that the trip home would be a bit of a bitch just now the commuter trams were already loaded and from his lofty perch he could see dozens of tired irritable faces packed together like rowers on a slave ship for the hot journey home on the street below buses were chugging cabs standing like a clogged river and the walks and people glides were mobbed eve was down there somewhere he expected no doubt having an annoyed thought at the prospect of having to dress up and socialize after a day of chasing a killer more than likely shed rush in flustered with minutes to spare and struggling to make that odd transition from cop to wife he doubted she had any idea how it thrilled and delighted him to see her make that slippery change at the knock on his door he turned yes his admin brought her in so that he found himself amused for a moment at the sight of two neat trim welldressed women of a certain age stepping into his office thank you caro ms obannion thank you for coming wont you have a seat would you like anything coffee tea no thank you he took her hand felt hers tremble lightly as he shook it he gestured to a chair knowing his manner was smooth practiced cool he couldnt quite help it i appreciate you making the time for me he began especially so late in the day its not a problem he could see her taking in his office the space of it the style the art the furniture the equipment the things he was able to surround himself with needed to surround himself with i thought to come to dochas but it occurred to me that having a man around the shelter too often may make some of the women the children nervous its good for them to be around men men who treat them as people and wish them no harm she folded her hands in her lap and though she met his eyes levelly he could almost hear the quick beat of her heart part of breaking the cycle of abuse is overcoming fear and reestablishing selfesteem and normal relationships i wouldnt argue that but i wonder if siobhan brody had had more fear would she have survived i dont know precisely what to say to you he continued before she could speak or precisely how to say it i thought i did first i want to apologize for taking so long to meet with you again ive been waiting to be fired like his her voice carried ireland in it in wisps and whispers is that why you brought me here today its not no im sorry i shouldve realized youd be concerned after the way i left things i was angry and distracted he gave a short laugh and had to stop himself from raking a hand through his hair nerves he thought well she wasnt the only one dealing with them thats one way to put it you were furious and ready to boot me out on my ass i was i told myself you were lying his eyes stayed on hers level and serious had to be had to be some angle in there for you telling me this girl you knew back in dublin was my mother it was counter to everything id known believed my whole life you see yes i do see it there have been others from time to time whove wormed their way to me with some story of a relation uncle brother sister what have you easily refuted ignored dealt with what i told you wasnt a story roarke but gods truth aye well he looked down at his hands and knew in their shape the width of palm the length of fingers they were his fathers hands i knew that somewhere in the belly i knew it it made it worse almost unbearable really he looked up again met her eyes again youve a right to know i checked on you deeply i expected you would and i checked on her on myself id never done so before not carefully i dont understand that i wouldnt have told you the way i did if i hadnt thought youd know some of it a man like you would know whatever he needed to know it was a point of pride to me that it didnt matter wouldnt matter particularly when i believed my mother was meg roarke and i was as glad to see the back of her as she was of me moira let out a long breath i said no to coffee before because my hands were shaking i wonder if i might trouble you for some after all of course he rose and walked over to open a panel in the wall inside was a fully equipped minikitchen when she laughed he turned in the act of programming coffee ive never seen the like of this office so posh my feet nearly sank to the ankles in the carpet youre young to have so much the smile he sent her was more grim than amused i started early so you did my stomachs still jumping she pressed a hand to it i was certain you were bringing me in to fire me maybe to threaten legal action of some sort i didnt know how i was going to tell my family or the guests at dochas i hated thinking id have to leave ive gotten attached as i said i checked on you theyre lucky to have you at the shelter how would you like your coffee plenty of cream if you dont mind is this whole building yours then it is its like a great black spear powerful and elegant thanks she accepted the coffee and took the first sip her eyes widened then narrowed as she sniffed the contents of the cup is this real coffee and that weight at the base of his skull vanished with a quick appreciative laugh gone at last it is yes ill send you some the first time i met my wife i gave her coffee and she had a similar reaction i sent her some as well might be why she married me i doubt that very much she kept her gaze steady on his now your mother is dead and he killed her didnt he patrick roarke murdered her as i always believed yes i went to dublin and verified it will you tell me how beat her to death he thought beat her bloody and dead with hands so much like my own then threw her away in the river threw away the poor dead girl whod loved him enough to give him a son no i wont only that i tracked down a man whod been with him in those days and who knew of it knew her and what happened if only id had more experience and less arrogance moira began it wouldnt have mattered if shed stayed in the shelter in dublin or gone back to her family in clare or run as long as shed taken me it wouldnt have mattered for whatever reason pride meanness bloodymindedness he wanted me the knowledge of that would haunt him for all of his days maybe it was meant to and hed have found her thats the kindest thing you could say to me she murmured its just truth and he needed to get past it as best he could i went to clare i saw her family my family did you she reached out laid a hand on his arm oh im so glad im so glad for that they were extraordinary my mothers twin sinead she opened her home to me just like that well west county folks theyre known for their hospitality arent they im still baffled and grateful im grateful to you ms obannion for telling me i wanted you to know that shed have been pleased dont you think not only that you know but that youve taken these steps i think shed be very pleased she set her coffee aside opened her purse you didnt take this when you were in my office before will you have it now he took the photograph of a young woman with red hair and pretty green eyes holding the darkhaired little boy thank you id very much like to have it a guy in a white suit sang about love being quiet and tricky eve sipped champagne and had to agree at least about the tricky part why else was she struggling to take her mind off murder and pretending to do something more than taking up space in a philadelphia ballroom god knew love and she would kick roarkes ass later for deserting her was the only reason she was standing here while some woman in lavender silk rambled on and on and on about fashion designers yes yes yes she knew leonardo personally jesus he was married to her oldest friend and she couldve used a good dose of mavis at the moment yes for gods sake hed designed the dress she was wearing so the fuck what it was clothes you put them on and you werent naked or cold love obliged her to edit her thoughts so her part of the conversation when she could shove a word through the wall of noise the woman built around her went something like yes ah theres the most striking woman in the room excuse us wont you charles monroe smooth and handsome beamed a smile at eves tormentor i simply have to steal her kill me eve muttered as charles drew her clear take my weapon out of my bag press it to the pulse in my throat and fire end my torment he only laughed and swung her to the dance floor when i spotted you i thought you might be on the point of drawing that weapon and blasting the woman between the eyes i imagined ramming it into her mouth it was never shut anyway she gave a quick shudder anyway thanks for the rescue i didnt know you were here running a bit late only just arrived working charles was a toplevel lc im with louise oh and because he was a man who made his living selling himself eve couldnt quite figure how he and the dedicated dr louise dimatto developed and maintained a relationship took all kinds she reminded herself i was going to get in touch with you he continued about jacie wooton the cop shifted back to the forefront you knew her i used to not well really i dont think anyone knew jacie well but we ran in similar circles so wed bump into each other now and then or did before she got busted lets find a corner somewhere i dont know that this is the time works for me taking charge she pulled him from the dance floor scanning the little packs of people the tables and decided to take it outside there was a terrace festooned with flowers scattered with more tables more people but it was quieter tell me what you know next to nothing he wandered to the edge of the terrace looked out over the lights of the city she was wellestablished before i got into the life she liked everything top drawer the best clothes the best venues the best clients the best dealer then i dont know about her dealer i dont he insisted im not going to claim i dont know anything about that end of the business but i stay clean spotless now that im dating a doctor he added with a smile jacies busts took everybody by surprise if she was an addict she hid it well if i knew anything dallas id tell you no hesitation no bullshit as far as i know she didnt have friends not real friends or enemies she was the job okay she started to slip her hands into her pockets remembered the little coppercolored number didnt have any if something occurs to you however small or remote i want to hear about it thats a promise its shaken me the way it happened the rumors im hearing louise is worried he glanced back toward the terrace doors she hasnt said anything specifically but shes worried when you love someone you can tell when theyre carrying stress yeah i guess so youre going to want to be careful charles you dont fit the vic profile on this but youre going to want to be careful always he replied she didnt say anything to roarke about the conversation on the shuttle ride home but she turned it over in her mind replayed it considered it when they were back in their bedroom and she was shimmying out of the tiny dress she ran it by him doesnt sound like hell be much of a source on this roarke commented no but thats not what im thinking about after we went back in i watched him and louise together theyre practically like turtledoves or something you know theyre going to roll around naked tonight naked turtledoves no not an attractive visual let me think of another haha what im saying is how can she roll naked with him tonight knowing hes going to be doing the same deal with however many clients are on his book tomorrow because its not the same he flipped down the bedspread ones personal ones professional its his job oh thats just bullshit thats just a bullshit rationalization and if its not can you stand there and tell me if i was a sex pro youd be perfectly fine just iced with me riding some other guys stick you have such a way with words he looked at her standing with the glittery dress in one hand she wore nothing but a matching triangle over her crotch too small to be called panties a triple chain of multicolored stones shed yet to remove and high backless heels and an annoyed scowl no i wouldnt be fine with it or iced or anything remotely like it but then i dont share christ you look sexy why dont you come over here and well roll around naked as turtledoves were having a conversation you are he corrected as he stepped off the bed platform and toward her and speaking of conversations she evaded nipping neatly behind the sofa i still have to beat you brainless for leaving me with that woman the one who looked like a skinny purple tree i was unavoidably detained my ass oh darling eve im thinking very fondly of your ass he feinted she countered and they circled the sofa better run he said softly and with a quick whoop she did when they were both breathless she let him catch her she had nothing no breaks no fresh leads no old ones that looked promising she juggled her list of suspects and possibles looked for openings she recanvassed the area around the crime scene studied lab reports she ran the elements through ircca searching for similar crimes and found one in london more than a year before that could fit still open it wasnt exact she mused messier sloppier practice session there was no note on elegant stationery just the mutilated body of a young lc not the same type as wooton eve acknowledged and wondered if she was grasping at straws there were plenty of sliceanddice a number of lcs especially on street level whod been assaulted even killed by clients or wouldbe clients but nothing that matched the barbaric elegance of jack she spoke with neighbors coworkers associates of those on her possible list keeping the interviews informal and discreet pushing poking for that crack but nothing broke she faced her sunday off with annoyance and irritability hardly a picnic of a mood her only hope of getting through it eve decided was to get mira in some quiet spot and pick her brain maybe you should give her brain and your own a day off she frowned over at roarke as they crossed the sidewalk to miras pretty house set in her pretty neighborhood what youre muttering out loud he patted her shoulder supportively i dont know as talking to yourself when knocking on the door of a shrink is the best of behaviors were only staying a couple of hours remember we agreed on that mmm with this noncommittal sound he pressed his lips to her forehead and the door opened hello you must be eve and roarke im gillian charlotte and dennis daughter it took her a beat as she rarely thought of mira by her given name but mira was stamped clearly on her daughters face though her hair was longer well past her shoulders and curling it was the same rich sable her eyes were the same mild and patient blue but they were homed in on eves looking deep her frame was longer lankier like her fathers and shed draped it in some loose airy top and pants that stopped inches short of her ankles one of those ankles carried a tattoo a trio of connecting chevrons bracelets jangled on her wrists rings jingled on her fingers her feet were bare with the toes painted a pale pink she was wiccan eve recalled and responsible for a couple of miras grandchildren its lovely to meet you roarke was already taking gillians hand and smoothly stepping between two women who were obviously taking each others measure you favor your mother who ive always considered one of the worlds loveliest of women thanks mom said you were very charming please come in were spread out she glanced back to where a babys strong wails poured down the stairs as you can hear but most of us are in the back well fix you a drink so youll be braced for the onslaught of a day at the miras there were a considerable number of them there already gathered in the kitchen activity room that was as big as a barn and nearly as noisy through the twostory glass wall of the back others could be seen on a wide patio decked with chairs and tables and some sort of large outdoor cooking device that was already smoking she could see dennis miras delightful and absentminded husband manning it with a long fork of some kind he had a mets cap over his explosion of gray hair and baggy shorts nearly down to a pair of knobby knees eve found secretly adorable another man was with him his son maybe and they seemed to be holding an intense and spirited debate with a lot of laughter and beerswilling from bottles there were kids of various ages milling or running around and a girl of about ten who sat on a stool at the big work counter sulking food was spread out all over and urged on them while introductions were made someone pushed a margarita in her hand when he opted for beer roarke was told hed find them outside in a cooler a young boy eve was already losing the names as they came at her like grapeshot was given the task of escorting roarke out and introducing him to the rest with the boys hand clasped on his roarke looked over his shoulder shot a wicked grin at eve and strolled outside it looks chaotic now but itll get worse with a laugh mira took a bowl of yet more food out of an enormous refrigerator im so glad you came lana stop pouting and run upstairs see if your aunt callie needs any help with the baby i dont see why i have to do everything but the kid scooted down and away shes irritable because she broke the rules and cant have screen or comp privileges for a week gillian commented oh her life as she knows it gillian said as she bent to pick up a toddler sex undetermined for eve from the floor is over a weeks an endless stretch of time when youre nine gilly taste this coleslaw i think it could use a bit of dill obediently gillian opened her mouth accepted the bite her mother held out on a fork bit more pepper too so um eve already felt as if shed entered a parallel universe youre expecting a lot of people we are a lot of people mira said chuckling mom still thinks we all have the appetites of teenagers gillian rubbed a hand absently over miras back she always makes too much food makes it you made all this hmm i like to cook when i can especially when its for family her cheeks were pink with pleasure her eyes laughing as she winked at her daughter and i drag the girls into helping out its shamefully sexist of course but none of my men are worth two damns in the kitchen she glanced out the window wall give them a big complicated smoking grill however and theyre right at home all our men grill gillian gave the toddler a little bounce on her hip does roarke you mean like food eve looked out to where he stood apparently enjoying himself picnic casual in jeans and a faded blue tshirt no i dont think he has one of those there were soy dogs and burgers the potato salad of roarkes fantasy cold pasta big chunks of fruit swimming in some sweetened juice fat slices of tomatoes the slaw and deviled eggs bowls platters trays of those and more were shuffled around the beer was cold and the margaritas kept coming she found herself in a conversation with one of miras sons about baseball and to her frozen shock had a small blond child climb up her leg and into her lap want some he burbled at her and grinned with his ketchupsmeared mouth what she looked around in mild panic what does he want some of whatever youve got mira patted the boys head as she passed by to take the baby from her daughterinlaw and cuddle it okay here eve offered her plate with the hope the boy would take it and go back about his business but he just dipped his fat little fingers into her fruit salad and came out with a slice of peach like it he took a bite then generously offered her the rest no you go ahead off you go bryce gillian hefted him off eves lap and instantly became her new best friend see what granddads got for you then she plopped down beside eve arched her eyebrows at her brother go away she told him girl talk he ambled away goodnaturedly amiability eve thought appeared to be a common trait for the men in this family youre feeling overwhelmed and just a little out of place gillian began eve picked up what was left of her burger bit in is that an observation or the result of a psychic scan a little of both and a little of being the daughter of two observant and sensitive people large family gatherings can be odd for those who dont have one of their own your roarke adjusts more seamlessly she glanced around to where he sat with dennis and bryce hes more a social animal than you and part of its from the work he does parts just his nature gillian took a forkful of pasta salad there are a couple of things i feel compelled to say to you i hope you wont be offended i dont mind offending people but i prefer to do it deliberately and this wouldnt be deliberate i dont bruise easy no i dont suppose you do she switched her food for her margarita well first i have to say that your husband is without question the most magnificent piece of work ive ever seen in real life im not offended by that as long as you remember the mine part i dont poach and if i did and there was anything left of me after youd got done he wouldnt even notice added to that im very much in love with my husband weve been together a decade now we were young and it concerned my parents but it was right for us she nibbled on a slice of carrot we have a good and satisfying life three beautiful children id like to have another another what gillian laughed turned back another child im hoping to be blessed with one more but ive wandered from my purpose and i doubt this group will give me much more time alone with you ive been jealous of you eves eyes narrowed flicked back in the direction where roarke sat then back when gillian let out a low almost purring laugh no not because of him though one could hardly be blamed there jealous of you and my mother you lost me she loves you gillian said and watched something like embarrassment pass over eves face she respects you worries about you admires you thinks of you all the things she does for and about me and this relationship well annoyed me on some primal level its not at all the same eve started to say and gillian shook her head its very much the same im the daughter of her body her heart and spirit youre not of her body but you are without question of her heart and her spirit i was of two minds when she told me you were invited today she licked salt from the rim of her glass as she studied eve the first was purely selfish why is she coming youre my mother the other was rampant curiosity at last ill get a good look at her im not in competition with you for miras affections gillian finished with a little smile no youre not and it was my flaw my selfabsorption that caused those unattractive and destructive feelings in me shes the most extraordinary woman ive ever known wise compassionate strong smart giving i didnt always appreciate it you dont when its yours but as ive gotten older had children of my own ive come to treasure everything about her her gaze swept the patio then stopped held on her own daughter i hope one day lana will feel that way about me in any case i felt you were stealing little bits of my mother from me i was prepared to dislike you on sight an attitude that is in direct opposition to what i believe to what i am but there you are she lifted her glass in a little toast sipped i just couldnt pull it off gillian picked up the pitcher of margaritas poured more in each of their glasses you came here today for her probably with a little persuasion from your gorgeous husband but primarily youre here for her she matters to you on a personal level and i noticed the way you look at my father with a kind of charmed affection it tells me youre a good judge of character and i know from my mother whos one as well that youre a good cop a good woman it makes it easier for me to share her with you before eve could think of a response mira walked over carrying the now sleeping baby on her shoulder did everyone get enough more than gillian assured her why dont you give him to me ill take him upstairs no hes fine i dont get to hold him nearly often enough agilely she sat lightly patting the babys back eve i should warn you dennis has convinced roarke he cant live without a grill well he has everything else she polished off her burger and it works great dennis would tell you its all in the cook not the cooker which ill claim when youve tasted my strawberry shortcake and peach pie pie you made pie obviously eve realized there was a great deal to be said for family cookouts after all i could probably eves communicator beeped her face closed down miras cheerful smile vanished im sorry excuse me a minute she rose pulling it out of her pocket as she walked back inside the kitchen back into the quiet what is it gillian demanded whats the matter her work mira murmured thinking of how eves eyes went cool and flat death take the baby gilly she was rising when eve stepped back out i have to go eve began then lowered her voice as mira walked over took her arm im sorry i have to go is it the same no its him but its not the same ill get you the details as soon as i can damn brains a little sloshy too many margaritas ill get you some soberup appreciate it she nodded to roarke when he joined her you can stay this is going to take a while ill take you and if need be ill get myself home and leave you the car another lc she shook her head later she took a breath studying the patio with its family sprawl its flowers and food lifes not always a goddamn picnic is it chapter drop me off on the corner you dont have to go down the block roarke ignored her and breezed through the light but your associates would miss the opportunity to witness your arrival in this particular vehicle the vehicle was a shiny silver jewel with a smoked glass retractable top and a snarling panther of an engine it mortified her they both knew for other cops to whistle and hoot about her connection with roarkes fancy toys she sucked it up yanked off her sunshades they were new one of the items that habitually and mysteriously appeared among her things she suspected they were stylish knew they were ridiculously expensive to save herself a little grief she stuck them in her pocket theres no reason for you to hang i dont know how long ill be ill stick around a while and stay out of your way he eased in behind a blackandwhite and an emergency services vehicle that is some ride lieutenant one of the uniforms said even as she climbed out bet it burns on a straightaway button it frohickie whatve we got here sweet he murmured sliding a hand over the gleaming hood female vic strangled in her apartment lived alone no sign of forced entry names lois gregg age sixtyone son became concerned when she didnt show up at a family event or answer her links came over let himself in found her he spoke briskly though he did shoot one more look over his shoulder at the car as they trooped into an apartment building strangled yes sir definite signs of sexual assault with object fourth floor he said when they were in the elevator looks like he used a broomstick on her its pretty bad she said nothing letting the new data filter through he left a note frohickie said addressed to you bastard stuck the envelope between her toes desalvo she muttered good christ then she blanked it out blanked it all out so she would walk into the scene with no set images or preconceptions in her head i need a field kit and a recorder brought them up when we got word you were tagged away from home she forgave him for his comments about the car scenes secured she questioned yes sir weve got the son in the kitchen with a uniform and an mt hes in bad shape he says he didnt touch her my aides on her way send her in when she gets here you have to stay out she said to roarke understood but he felt a quick wrench that he would remain closed out while she walked into what was going to be another nightmare she marched in the open door noted there were no signs of forced entry nor of struggle in the neat simple living area there were plain blue curtains at the window sheer enough to let in the light no privacy screens were engaged she squatted down to examine a few drops of blood on the edge of an area rug she could hear weeping from another room the son in the kitchen she thought then blocked it out rising she gestured the other cops back sealed up fixed on her recorder then went into the bedroom lois gregg lay on the bed nude still bound with the sash that had strangled her around her neck tied just under her chin in a festive bow the creamy envelope with eves name printed on the front was stuck between the toes of her left foot there was more blood not as much as wooton on the plain white sheets on her thighs on the broomstick hed left on the floor she was a small woman probably no more than a hundred and ten pounds with the caramel complexion that indicated mixedrace heritage broken capillaries in her face in her eyes the distended and swollen tongue were signs of the strangulation the body fought back eve thought even after the mind went dark the body fought for air for life eve spotted the long green robe beside the bed hed used the robe sash to strangle her hed have wanted you conscious when he hurt you hed want to see your face the pain the horror the terror yes hed want that this time hed want to hear you scream nice building like this ought to have decent soundproofing hed checked it out checked you out before today did he tell you what he was going to do to you or did he work in silence while you begged she recorded the scene documenting the position of the body the placement of the robe the broomstick the carefully drawn curtains then she took the envelope opened it and read hello again lieutenant dallas isnt it a gorgeous day a day that just begs for heading down to the shore or strolling through the park i hate to interrupt your sunday but you seem to enjoy your work so much as i do mine that i didnt think youd mind im a little disappointed in you however for a couple of reasons first tsk tsk on stonewalling the media reports on me i was really looking forward to the buzz then again youre not going to be able to keep a lid on the barrel too much longer second i thought youd be giving me just a bit more of a challenge by this point hopefully my latest offer will inspire you best of luck al selfimportant bastard arent you she stated aloud then sealed the note and envelope before opening the field kit shed completed the preliminary exam when peabody came in lieutenant im sorry we were in the bronx what the hell were you she broke off what is that what are you wearing its a um ah its a sundress flushing a little peabody brushed a hand over the poppypink skirt it took us so long to get back i thought i should come straight here instead of heading home to change into uniform huh the dress also had skinny little shoulder straps and a very low bodice it demonstrated what mcnab was fond of saying peabody sure was built peabodys rulerstraight hair was covered by a widebrimmed straw hat and she was wearing lip dye that matched the sundress how are you supposed to work in that getup well i you said we you brought mcnab yeah yes sir we were at the zoo in the bronx thats something anyway tell him to go check the outside security and the discs for the lobby level and elevators this building should have them yes sir she went out to relay the order as eve walked into the adjoining bath he couldve washed up after she figured but there was no sign of it the bath was tidy the towels looked fresh lois hadnt liked fuss eve mused or clutter must have brought his own soap and towel too or took some away with him well want the sweepers to check the drains might get lucky she said as peabody came back in i dont get it this isnt like wooton nothing like wooton different type of victim different method there was another note yeah its sealed peabody studied the scene tried to commit it to memory as the recorder did she noticed as eve had the little vase of flowers on the nightstand the square catchall box on the dresser that said i love grandma in pink swirly letters on the top and the framed photos and holos that stood on the dresser the nightstand the small desk by the window it was sad she thought it was always sad to see those bits and pieces of a life when the life was over but she tried to shake it off dallas would shake it off she knew or bury it or use it but she wouldnt let herself be distracted by the pity peabody looked again making the deliberate shift from woman to cop do you think theres more than one killer a team no theres only one eve lifted one of the victims hands no polish she noted short nails no rings but a faint pale circle where one had been and habitually third finger left hand hes just showing us how versatile he is i dont understand i do see if you can find where she kept her jewelry im looking for a ring band style peabody started on the dresser drawers maybe you could explain what you understand so i can victim is an older woman no sign of forced entry or struggle she let him in because she thought he was okay he was probably suited up as maintenance or repair she turns her back and he hits her over the head shes got a laceration on the back of the skull and theres some blood on the living room rug was she an lc doubtful got her jewelry peabody lifted out a clearsided box with insets of varying sizes she liked earrings got a few rings too she brought the case over holding it while eve poked through exposure to roarke and his propensity for dumping glitters on her had taught her to spot the real stuff from the costume loiss body adornments were mostly costume but there were a few good pieces as well he hadnt bothered with those unlikely hed even looked no i dont think so i think she was wearing a ring a kind of wedding ring and he took it off her finger a symbol a souvenir i thought she lived alone she did another reason he picked her she turned away from the box of pretty stones and metal looked back at lois gregg he carries her in here hes got his equipment again likely in a toolbox this time restraints for her hands and feet strips off her robe ties her up finds what he wants to use to rape her hes going to wake her up then he didnt get to play with the other but this ones different why peabody set the jewelry box back on the dresser why is she different because thats what hes looking for variety she screams when she comes around and realizes when it comes into her like a flood whats happened and what will happen even though part of her rejects it refuses to believe she screams and struggles and begs they like it when you beg when he starts on her when the pain spurts into her hot cold impossible she screams more hed get off on that eve lifted one of loiss hands again then moved down to her feet she bloodied her wrists and ankles trying to get free straining and twisting against the restraints she didnt give up hed have enjoyed that too its exciting for them when you fight makes their breath come fast in your face makes them hard it gives them power when you fight and cant win dallas peabody kept her voice low laid a hand on eves shoulder as her lieutenant had gone pale and clammy eve shrugged carefully took a step back she knew everything lois gregg had felt but it wouldnt take her down not now into the memory into the nightmare the blood and the cold and the pain her voice was level and cool when she continued when hes done raping her he takes the sash from her robe shes incoherent now from the pain and the shock he gets on the bed straddles her looks into her eyes when he strangles her listens to her fight to breathe feels her body convulsing under his in that sick parody of sex thats when he comes when her body bucks under his and her eyes bulge thats when he gets his release when he comes back to himself he ties the sash into a bow wedges the note between her toes he takes the ring off her finger amused by it such a female thing to wear the symbol when theres no man to go with it he slips the ring in his pocket or puts it in his toolbox then checks how it all looks and hes pleased just as its supposed to an excellent imitation of what of who eve corrected albert desalvo the boston strangler she stepped out into the hallway where cops were milling around doing what they could to keep people from the neighboring apartments inside and there was roarke she thought there was a man with more money than god sitting crosslegged on the hallway floor his back supported by the wall as he worked with his ppc and would probably be content to do so for reasons she could never understand for hours she moved to him squatted down so their eyes were level im going to be here a while you ought to go on home i can catch a ride into central bad is it very ive got to talk to the son and hes she let out a long breath they tell me the mt gave him something but hes still pretty messed up one is when their mothers murdered despite the presence of other cops she laid a hand over his roarke demons dont die eve we just learn to live with them weve both known that all along ill deal with mine in my way she started to speak again then looked up when mcnab came off the elevator lieutenant no disc run since eight this morning nothing from the outside unit elevator or the hall on this floor best i can tell he jammed it by remote from outside before entering the building i could verify but i dont have any tools on me he held out his hands a halfass smile on his face to indicate his baggy red shorts blue cinch vest and toeless airsneaks then go get some she began i happen to have a few things in the car that might help with that roarke interrupted why dont i give you a hand ian that would be mag its pretty decent security so i figure if he went remote it had to be policeissue level or above cant tell unless i can get into the panel and check the board eve straightened then held out a hand roarke grasped her forearm and she his to help him to his feet go ahead get me best guess on what he used oh eight hundred for entry she thought with the time of death shed established hed spent no more than an hour on lois gregg more time than wooton more time to play but still fast she went back in walked to the kitchen jeffrey gregg wasnt weeping now but the tears already shed had wrecked his face it was red and swollen much like his mothers he sat at a small laminated table his hands cupped around a glass of water his brown hair stood up in tufts from where she imagined hed pulled at it raked his fingers through it in his grief she judged him to be somewhere in his early thirties and dressed in brown shorts and a white tshirt for a casual summer sunday she sat across from him waited until those damaged eyes lifted to hers mr gregg im lieutenant dallas i need to talk to you they said i couldnt go in and see her i should go in when i when i found her i didnt go in i just ran out again and called the police i shouldve gone in something covered her up no you did exactly the right thing you helped her more by doing just exactly what you did im sorry mr gregg im very sorry for your loss useless words she knew goddamn useless words she hated saying them hated not being able to count the number of times theyd forced themselves out of her mouth she never hurt anybody he managed to lift the glass to his lips i think you should know that she never hurt anybody in her life i dont understand how somebody could do this to her what time did you come here today she knew already but would take him through the details the repetition i ah came over about three i think maybe closer to four no nearer to three im so mixed up we were supposed to have this afternoon cookout at my sisters in ridgewood my mother was supposed to come by our place were over on th we were all going to take the train over to new jersey she was supposed to be at our place by one he gulped some water she runs late a lot we tease her about it but when it got to be like two i started calling to move her along she didnt answer so i figured she was on her way but she didnt show i called her pocket number but that didnt answer either my wife and kid were getting restless and annoyed me too i was getting pissed off remembering that he began to cry again i was really steamed that i had to come over here and get her i wasnt worried so much not really i never thought anything had happened to her and all the time she was when you got here eve prompted you let yourself in you have a key yeah i got access to the outside door and her apartment i was thinking something wrong with her links thats all she forgets to bump them sometimes and they go out somethings wrong with her links and shes lost track of time thats what i was thinking when i let myself in i called out to her like mom damn it mom we were supposed to leave for mizzys two hours ago and when she didnt answer i thought oh crap shes on her way to my place and im over here and this is so irritating but i walked to the bedroom door anyway i dont even know why and she was god god mom he broke down again and eve shook her head at the mt before he could move in with a tranq mr gregg jeff you have to hold it together you have to help me did you see anyone near the apartment anyone outside i dont know he mopped at his streaming face i was irritated and in a hurry i didnt see anything special did your mother mention being uneasy about anything noticing something someone who worried her no shes lived here for a dozen years its a nice building secure he took deep breaths to steady his voice she knows her neighbors leah and me were only ten blocks away we see each other every week shedve told me if something was wrong how about your father they split god twentyfive years ago he lives out in boulder they dont see each other much but they get along okay jesus jesus my father wouldnt have done this the hitch came back in his voice and he began to rock himself youd have to be crazy to do this to somebody its just routine was she involved with anyone nobody special now she had sam they were together for about ten years he was killed in a tram wreck about six years ago he was the one for her i guess there hasnt been anybody else special since did she wear a ring a ring he looked at eve blankly as if the question had been posed in some strange foreign language yeah sam gave her a ring when they moved in together she always wore it can you describe it for me um it was gold i think maybe with stones on it god i cant remember its okay hed had enough she judged and this line was a dead end one of the officers is going to take you home now but isnt there something shouldnt i do something he stared beseechingly at eve can you tell me what im supposed to do just go home to your family jeff thats the best thing you can do for now im going to take care of your mother she walked out with him turning him over to a uniform for escort home tell me something she demanded of mcnab definitely a remote zap he has to have a superior skill with electronics and security or enough money to buy a jammer and were talking mucho blackmarket buckaroos for a unit like this why she wanted to know a building like this securitys good but its not top level okay its not that it jammed security its how it jammed he pulled a pack of gum from one of his many pockets offered eve some then folded a cube into his mouth when she shook her head it shut everything down securitywise without messing with other ops lights climate control home and personal electronics werent touched except busily chewing he pointed to the living room lamps in here this apartment unit and this specific room lights on he ordered and eve nodded when the lamps stayed dark yeah that fits sorry to bother you maam but weve had reports of electronic malfunction in the building hes dressed like a workman id make book hes got a toolbox a big helpful smile maybe he even tells her to try the lights and when they dont work she opens the door mcnab blew an impressive purple bubble snapped it plays for me check out the links lets be thorough you find anything im at central peabody with you sir not while youre wearing that stupid hat lose it eve ordered and strode out i like the hat mcnab kept his voice low sexy mcnab you think bricks sexy peabody replied but with a quick check to see if the coast was clear she gave his ass a fast squeeze maybe ill wear it later you know just the hat shebody youre killing me he took a quick peek saw eve was gone then dragged peabody close for a sloppy kiss blueberry amused she blew a purple bubble with the gum hed passed to her then hurrying after eve she pulled the hat off her head she found eve outside standing beside the totally iced vehicle with the totally iced roarke no point in it eve was saying well hitch in a blackandwhite if im going to be really late ill let you know let me know regardless and ill have transpo arranged to bring you home i can arrange my own transpo this isnt transpo peabody gave a feline purr as she stroked the car this is a total ride we could easily squeeze in no eve cut roarke off were not squeezing anywhere suit yourself peabody you look delicious he took the hat from her hand arranged it back on her head absolutely edible oh well golly under the hat her head went wonderfully light wipe that ridiculous look off your face lose the hat and get us a ride to central eve snapped huh she let out a long sigh oh yes sir doing all that do you have to do that eve demanded of roarke when peabody walked dreamily away yes when she makes detective im going to miss seeing our girl in uniform but it should be interesting to see how she suits up otherwise ill see you at home lieutenant and not caring if it annoyed her he caught her chin in his hand pressed his lips firmly to hers you are as always delicious yeah yeah yeah jamming her hands in her pockets she stalked away it was dark when she got home whether it was bullheadedness or not she hadnt tagged roarke for transpo even after realizing she didnt have cab fare on her but she had dug up subway tokens and found the underground ride jammed with people going home after a sunday out on the town she opted to stand swaying with the rhythm of the train as it headed uptown she didnt ride the subway enough anymore eve thought not that she missed it half the ads were in languages not her own half the passengers were zoned or irritated and there would always be one or two who smelled as if they had a religious objection to soap and water such as the wizened toothless beggar with his license around his grubby neck who gave her a gummy grin still it only took one steely stare to have him looking elsewhere she supposed shed missed that just a little she shifted whiling away the trip by studying the other passengers students buried in their disc books kids heading out to the vids an old man snoring loud enough to make her wonder if hed slept through his stop already some tiredlooking women with children a couple of tough guys looking bored and the skinny geeky guy in the unseasonable trench coat currently masturbating at the far end of the car oh for christs sake she started over but one of the tough guys spotted the geek and obviously taking exception to the activity smashed a fist into the whackers face blood spurted several people screamed though his nose was now a fountain the geek kept himself in hand break it up eve surged reached down to grab tough guy number one when a fellow passenger panicked sprang to his feet and knocked eve into the fist of tough guy number two goddamn it to hell she saw a couple of shooting stars shook her head clear im the frigging police with her cheek throbbing she smashed her elbow into tough guy number one to stop him from pounding on the giggling pervert still whacking off on the floor of the car then stomped her foot on the instep of tough guy two when she hauled up the geek snarled everyone else stepped back something about the glint in her eye did what the tough guys fist hadnt the geek went limp she glanced down as he deflated and let out a sigh put that thing away she ordered screw the subway she grumbled as she strode up the long drive toward home the ride had given her a sore jaw and a headache and cost her the time it had taken to get off the damn car and turn the idiot over to the transit authority she didnt much care that there was a nice breeze stirring up an almost balmy one or that it carried hints of something sweet and floral into the air she didnt care that the sky was so clear she could see a threequarter moon hanging in it like a lamp okay it looked nice but hell she stomped inside and after a terse inquiry was told by the house system that roarke was in the family media room which was opposed to the main media room she thought where the hell was it again because she wasnt entirely sure and the hike from the subway stop to the front door had been considerable she went into the elevator family media room she ordered and was whisked up and east the main media room was for parties and events she remembered it could fit more than a hundred people in plush chairs and offered a wall screen as wide as a theaters but the family media room was she supposed hed say more intimate deep colors she recalled cushy seats two screens one for vids one for games and the complex and complicated sound system that could play anything from the oldfashioned clunky vinyl records roarke liked to fiddle with on occasion to the minute sound sticks she stepped into the room to a blast of sound that seemed to come from everywhere her eyes widened in reaction to the fastmoving space battle being waged over the wall screen roarke was kicked back in a lounge chair the cat in his lap a glass of wine in his hand she should go to work she told herself do more research on the boston strangler keep digging for a connection between wooton and gregg though she was dead sure there would be no connection she should hound the sweepers the me the lab none of whom she knew would pay much attention to her at nearly ten on a sunday night but she could harass them anyway she could run probabilities go over her notes her suspect lists stare at her murder board instead she walked over plucked the cat off roarkes lap youre in my seat she told him and set him on another chair she slid into roarkes lap took his wine whats this one about it seems water is the commodity in fashion this particular planet in the zero quadrant there isnt any zero quadrant its fictional my darling literalminded eve he snuggled her in pressing an absent kiss to her head as he watched the action anyway this planets all but out of water potable water and theres a rescue attempt being made to get the colony there a supply and the means to clean up what they have but theres this other faction who wants the water for themselves thereve been a couple of bloody battles over it already something exploded onscreen a shower of color an earsplitting boom of sound nicely done roarke commented and theres a woman head of the environmental police the good guys whos reluctantly in love with the rogue cargo captain whos helping deliver the goods for a price its about thirty minutes in i can start it over no ill catch up she intended to sit with him for a few minutes only let her mind rest but she got caught up in the story and it was so nice so simple to stay stretched out in the chair with him while fictional battles raged and good overcame evil not bad she said when the credits began to roll im going to get another hour or two of work in are you going to tell me about it probably she climbed out of the chair stretched then blinked like an owl when he turned on the light well damn it eve what have you done to your face now it wasnt my fault sulking a little she touched fingers gingerly to her jaw somebody knocked me into this guys fist when i was trying to stop him from beating this other guy who was whacking off in the subway to a bloody pulp i couldnt blame the guy the guy with the fist because he wasnt aiming it at me but still my life roarke said after a moment was gray before you walked into it yeah im a rainbow she wiggled her jaw my face anyway you up for some drone work i might be persuaded after we put something on that bruise its not so bad you know the transit cop told me that guys a regular on that line they call him willy the wanker thats a fascinating bit of new york trivia he pulled her toward the elevator it makes me yearn to ride the subway chapter in peabodys cramped apartment mcnab ran her through a series of intense computer simulations hed proven himself peabody had discovered in the last few weeks a strict and fairly irritating instructor with her shoulders hunched she carefully picked her way through a murder scene selecting her choices and options in a field investigation of a double homicide and cursed when her selection resulted in a blasting buzz mcnabs personal addition to the sim and a sternfaced figure of a robed judge shaking his finger at her ahahah improper procedure scene contamination evidence suppressed suspect gets a free walk due to detective investigators screwup does he have to say that cuts through the legal mumbo mcnab pointed out and stuffed potato chips in his face digs down to the point i dont want to do any more sims her face fell into a pout that had mcnabs libido jiggling my brains going to leak out of my ears in a minute he loved her enough to mostly ignore the image of peeling her out of her clothes and doing her on the rug look youre aces on the written youve got a memory for details and points of law blah blah you get thumbsup on the oral once your voice settles down from a squeak it does not squeak sort of like how it does when i bite your toes he grinned toothily when she scowled at him and while i like how it sounds myself the test teams going to be less romantically inclined so youre going to want to oil the squeaks she continued to pout then her mouth dropped open in shock when he slapped her hand away from the bag of chips none for you until you get through a sim jesus mcnab im not a puppy performing for a biscuit no youre a cop who wants to make detective he moved the bag out of her reach and youre scared im not scared im understandably anxious about the testing process and proving myself ready to she hissed out a breath as he merely studied her with patient green eyes im terrified because his arm came around her she snuggled into his bony shoulder im terrified ill blow it and ill let dallas down and you and feeney the commander my family jesus youre not going to blow it and you wont let anyone down this isnt about dallas or anybody else its all about you she trained me she put me up for it so she must figure youre ready it aint no snap shebody he gave her cheek a quick nuzzle its not supposed to be but youve got the training youve got the field time the instincts the brains and honey youve got the guts and heart too she turned her head to look up at him thats so damn sweet its a fact and heres another one heres what you dont have right now you dont have the balls her gooey affection toward him transformed into brittle insult hey and because you dont have the balls he continued calmly youre not trusting your gut or your training youre secondguessing yourself instead of going with what you know you keep wondering what you dont know and thats why you keep messing up on the sims shed pulled away from him her breath hissed out i hate you for being right nah you love me because im so damn goodlooking asshole fraidy cat fraidy cat her lips twitched into a reluctant smile jeez okay set up another one make it tough and when i nail it i not only get the chips but her smile widened you wear the hat youre on she rose to pace and clear out her head while he programmed the sim shed been afraid she admitted afraid she wanted it too much so she hadnt used the hunger but had let it eat away at her confidence that had to stop even if her palms were damp and her stomach in knots it had to stop dallas never let nerves get in the way she thought and she had them nerves and something deeper darker it had peeked through on the gregg scene for just a moment that afternoon now and again on a sexual homicide it peeked through it turned her lieutenants cheeks pale took her back peabody was sure to something horrible something personal rape peabody was sure just as she was sure it had to have been brutal and shed have been young before the job peabody had studied eves career with the nypsd like a template but thered been no report of a sexual assault on dallas so it had been before before the academy when she was a teenager or possibly younger in automatic sympathy peabodys stomach roiled it would take guts and balls to face that to revisit whatever had happened every time you walked into a scene that reverberated with sexual violence but to use it instead of being used by it that took more peabody determined it took what she could only define as valor ready here mcnab told her and its a doozy she sucked in a breath squared her shoulders im ready too go in the bedroom or something okay i want to do it on my own he looked at her face saw what hed hoped to see and nodded sure nail the bad guy shebody damn right she sweated through it but stayed focused she stopped asking herself what dallas would want her to do even after a point what dallas would do and just concentrated on what needed to be done preserve and observe collect and identify question report investigate it began to click for her the pattern emerging she waded her way through conflicting witness statements shaky memories facts and lies forensics and procedure she built she realized with rising excitement a case though she wanted to hesitate on the final stage the arrest she bore down and selected and was rewarded with the graphic of a prosecuting attorney pick him up murder one yes she popped up from the chair did her little victory dance i got an arrest nailed the murdering bastard hey mcnab bring me those damn potato chips sure he stepped out grinning he carried the bag in one hand and was naked but for her summer straw hat since it was perched jauntily at his crotch she assumed her success made him as happy as it made her she laughed until she thought her ribs would crack youre such a moron she managed and jumped him for eve it was a matter of merging bare facts with educated speculation he had to know their routines which means he knew them doesnt mean they knew him doesnt connect them but he knew hes too cocky for them to have been random he trolled first thats the usual pattern isnt it roarke cocked his head at her look if my one true love was a dentist id study up a bit on the latest thoughts on dental hygiene and treatments dont say dentist eve warned automatically running her tongue warily over her teeth by all means lets stick with bloody murder and knowing there was no talking her out of another cup of coffee at midnight had another himself the trolling the selecting the stalking the planning they are all essential parts of the whole for the typical if the word can be used serial killer theres a rush in it the control the power the details shes alive now because i allow it shell be dead because i want it its clear he admires the serial killers who made names for themselves jack the ripper the boston strangler so he emulates them but hes very much his own man better than they were because hes versatile and he wants you pursuing him because he admires you in his own sick way he wants the buzz it isnt enough to kill that doesnt heat the blood enough the hunt being both hunter and prey that does it for him he hunted these women she turned to the board shed set up in her home office with pictures of jacie wooton and lois gregg alive and dead he watched them learned their routines and patterns he needed a prostitute for the ripper imitation and a certain type of lc she fit the mold he expected her to walk along that street at that time it wasnt chance just as lois gregg fit his need for a strangler vic just as he knew shed be home alone on a sunday morning and knew someone would find her before the end of the day yeah sipping coffee she nodded quicker gratification that way more and more likely he called in the anonymous nineoneone wanted wooton found as soon as possible so the adulation and horror could begin which tells me he feels very safe very safe eve agreed very superior if gregg hadnt had family or friends who were bound to check on her in a few hours hed have to wait to get the next kick or risk another nineoneone so he targeted these women specifically just as hes targeted the next she sat rubbed her eyes hell imitate someone else but itll be someone who created a stir and who left bodies where they could and would be found we eliminate historic serial killers who buried destroyed or consumed their victims such a fun group too oh yeah hes not going to copy someone like chef jourard that french guy in the twenties this century kept his victims in a large freezer didnt he where he carved them up cooked them up and served them to unsuspecting patrons of his fancy bistro in paris took them nearly two years to catch him and he was famed for his sweetbreads she gave a quick shudder anybody who eats internal organs of any species baffles me and im off the track he trailed a hand down her arm because youre tired maybe hell stay more straightforward wont go for a play on someone like jourard or dahmer or that russian maniac ivan the butcher but people being what they are hes got plenty of others to work with hell stick with women she walked back to the board when you kill women the way he did these two youve got a problem with them but hes not connected to the actual victims ill go back and push the paper the note see if anyone on the list has a particular interest in celebrity killers theres another you might want to speak with roarke suggested thomas a breen hes written what some consider the definitive book on twentiethcentury serial killers another on mass murderers throughout history ive actually read some of his work as the subject matter is of some interest to my wife breen thomas a i mightve read some of his stuff sounds vaguely familiar he lives here in the city i looked up the particulars when you were at central as i thought you might want a word with him smart guy this time when she reached for the coffeepot he laid a hand over hers to stop her smart enough to know youve had over your quota of coffee for the day and despite it youre starting to droop i just want to run a couple of probabilities set them up then and they can run while youre sleeping youll have the results in the morning shed have argued but she was too damn tired instead she did as he suggested and still her gaze was drawn back to the board back to lois gregg she could hear the way the womans son a grown man had sobbed she could see the utter devastation on his face when hed pleaded with her to tell him what he should do mom hed said the way she imagined a child would though over thirty hed said mom with a little boys helpless loss she knew roarke had felt some of that same helplessness that young boys lost grief when hed learned the mother hed never known had been murdered dead for three decades still he grieved and just that afternoon a grown woman had studied her with suspicion and resentment over a relationship with her mother what was it that bound the child so inexorably with the mother was it blood she wondered as she stripped down for bed was it imprinted in the womb or something learned and developed after birth killers of women lust killers were often bred due to their unhealthy feelings or relationships with a mother figure just as she supposed saints were bred from healthy ones or all the normality of the human race between the extremes had this killer hated his mother abused or been abused by her was he killing her now and thinking of mothers she slipped into sleep to dream of her own it was the hair golden hair so shiny and pretty so long and curly she liked to touch it though she knew she wasnt supposed to she liked to pet it as shed seen a boy pet a puppy dog once nobody was home and it was all quiet the way she liked it best when they were gone the mommy and the daddy nobody yelled or made scary noises or told her not to do everything she wanted to do nobody slapped or hit she wasnt supposed to go into the room where the mommy and daddy slept or where the mommy sometimes brought other daddies to play on the bed without their clothes but there were so many things in there like the long golden hair or the bright red hair and the bottles that smelled like flowers she tiptoed toward the dresser a thin girl in jeans that bagged and a yellow tshirt that was stained with grape juice her ears were keen as the ears of prey often were and she listened carefully prepared to dart out of the room at any moment her fingers reached out and stroked the yellow curls of the wig the pressure syringe tossed carelessly beside it didnt interest her she knew the mommy took medicine every day sometimes more than once a day sometimes the medicine made her sleepy sometimes it made her want to dance and dance she was nicer when she wanted to dance even though her laughing was scary it was better than the yelling or the slapping there was a mirror over the dresser and she could just see the top half of her own face if she strained up high on her toes her hair was ugly brown and straight and short it wasnt pretty like the mommys play hair unable to resist she put the wig over her own hair it fell all the way to her waist and made her feel pretty made her feel happy there were all sorts of toys on the dresser for painting faces with color once when the mommy had been in a good mood shed painted her lips and cheeks and said shed looked like a little doll if she looked like a doll maybe the mommy and daddy would like her better they wouldnt yell and hit and she could go outside and play humming to herself she painted on lip dye rubbing her lips together as shed seen the mommy do she brushed on cheek color and clumsily fit her feet inside the highheeled shoes that were in front of the dresser she teetered on them but was able to see even more of her face like a little doll she said pleased with the golden curls and the smears of color she began to use more with enthusiasm and was so intent on the game on the fun she failed to listen you stupid little bitch the scream had her stumbling back tripping out of the shoes she was already falling when the hand slapped across her face it hurt where she banged her elbow but even as the tears spurted out in response the mommy was grabbing her by her sore arm and yanking her to her feet i told you never to come in here i told you never to touch my things the mommys hands were white so white and painted red on the nails like they were bleeding she used one to slap and it stung the little painted cheek the girl opened her mouth to wail as the hand raised up to strike again goddamn it stel the daddy burst in grabbing the mommy shoving her away and onto the bed the soundproofing in heres next to nothing you want to bring the fucking social workers down on us again the little shits been into my things the mommy jumped off the bed curling those bloody fingertips into claws look at the mess she made im sick and tired of having to clean up after her and listening to her whine on the floor curled up tight with her arms over her head the child struggled not to make a sound not any sound at all so theyd forget she was there so shed be invisible i never wanted the brat in the first place there was a bite in the mommys voice like sharp teeth snapping the child imagined them snapping down on her fingers her toes terror made her mewl like a cornered kitten and press her hands to her ears to block the sound having her was your idea you deal with her ill deal with her he scooped the child up and though she feared him feared him on a deep and instinctual level at the moment she feared the mommy more with her words that bit and her white hands that slapped so she curled herself into him and shuddered when he stroked a hand over the wig that had fallen over her eyes and down her back over her rump have a hit stella he said youll feel better i get this deal through well buy a droid to look after the kid yeah right about the same time well have that big house and the fleet of fancy cars and all the other shit you promised me the only thing i got out of you so far rick is that whiny brat an investment in the future shes going to pay off for us one day arent you little girl have a hit stella he said again as he started out of the room with the child on his hip ill clean the kid up the last thing the child saw as he left the room with her was the mommys face and the eyes brown eyes painted gold on the lids that were like the words full of teeth and hate eve woke not with the strangled panic of the nightmares that plagued her but with a kind of cold dull shock the room was dark and she realized shed rolled herself to the far edge of the bed as if shed needed privacy for the dream shaken vaguely ill she rolled back curled herself against roarke his arm came around her drawing her in circled in his warmth she pretended to sleep again she said nothing to roarke of the dream the next morning didnt know if she should or could she wanted to lock it away but she felt it pushing at her as she went through her morning routine it was a relief that roarke had a morning full of meetings and she could slip around him and out of the house with little conversation he read her too well and too easily a talent that was both a wonder and an irritation to her and she wasnt ready to explore what shed remembered her mother was a whore and a junkie and had never wanted the child shed made more than not wanted had despised and abhorred what difference did it make eve asked herself as she drove downtown her father had been a monster was it any worse to know her mother had been the same it changed nothing she parked at central made her way up to her office with every step inside the busy hive of central she felt more herself the weight of her weapon comforted her as did the knowledge that her badge was in her pocket roarke had called them her symbols once and so they were symbols of who and what she was she walked through the bullpen where the morning shift was settling in she detoured by peabodys cube just as her aide was knocking back the last of a glidecart coffee thomas a breen eve began and rattled off an east village address contact him set up a meeting asap well go to him yes sir rough night at eves silent stare peabody shrugged dont look like you got much sleep thats all neither did i cramming for the exam its coming up soon you want regular eight straights you dont pick up the badge set up the interview then were doing followups on the list starting with fortney she started to walk away then turned back you can overstudy you know i know but i was really blowing the sims i nailed two last night thats the first time i felt like i had a handle good eve stuck her thumbs in her pockets drummed her fingers good she repeated and headed to her office to nag the lab for updates on gregg the bickering with dickhead put her in a cheerier mood as she read over the mes reports morris was going with surgical grade on the weapons used on wooton her tox screen confirmed that her system was clear of chemicals since she wasnt using spending time trying to find her former dealer wasnt priority the canvasses of chinatown and the surrounding areas had come up zero one more time no trace of semen with gregg eve told peabody as they headed to the village me findings indicate she was raped and sodomized with the broomstick only no prints onscene other than hers family members and two neighbors whore clear hair fibers manmade dickhead thinks wig and mustache but isnt ready to commit so we think he wore a disguise in case he was seen around the neighborhood he had to keep tabs on her a few weeks id say solidify her sunday routine howd he pick her though out of a fucking hat how does he target this particular lc this particular woman maybe theres some connection a place they shopped ate did business a doctor a bank possible and its a good line for you to tug im more inclined to think it was the area first neighborhood select the setting then the character then put on your play speaking of neighborhoods this is really nice peabody gazed out at shady sidewalks large old houses pretty urban gardens planted in window boxes or pots i could go for this one day you know when i settle down start thinking family and stuff you ever think about that kids and all eve thought of the hatefilled eyes staring at her out of a dream no tons of time and all i figure maybe to think about it in six eight years anyway definitely going to be taking mcnab on a long test drive before i commit to more than cohabbing hey your eye didnt twitch because im not listening to you are too peabody muttered when eve pulled to the curb hes been really great working with me for the exam it makes a difference having somebody rooting for me he really wants it for me because i want it thats well thats just solid mcnabs a moron the majority of the time but hes in love with you dallas peabody shifted in her seat so sharply her cap tipped over one eye you said the l word and mcnab in the same sentence voluntarily just shut up happy to with a happy smile she squared her cap im just going to savor in silence they walked three houses down to a threestory home that eve imagined had once been a multifamily dwelling writing about killers was obviously profitable if breen could afford something this upmarket she went up a short flight of flagstoned steps to the main entrance noted the full security system that must have made the man confident enough to keep the etched glass panes on either side of the front door there was a wife as well she knew from her quick background check and a twoyearold boy breen collected partial professionalfather pay from the government as primary athome parent while his wife earned a substantial salary as a vp and managing editor of a fashion rag called outré a nice tidy setup eve mused as she rang the bell and held up her badge for scan breen answered the door himself with his son sitting astride his shoulders the boy was holding on to breens blond hair like the reins on a horse go ride the boy shouted and kicked his feet only this far partner breen hooked his hands around the boys ankles either to anchor him eve thought or to stop the busy little heels from digging holes in his armpits lieutenant dallas thats right i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me mr breen no problem always happy to talk to the cops and ive followed your work im hoping to do a book on new york murders eventually and figure youll be one of my prime sources youll have to talk to public relations at central about that can we come in oh yeah sure sorry he stepped back he was in his thirties of strong medium build from the definition in his arms eve doubted he sat at a computer all day he had a good face handsome without being soft blaster the boy called out as he spotted eves weapon under her jacket zappit breen laughed flipped the child off his shoulders in a rapid and smooth move that had the kid squealing in delight jed heres a little bloodthirsty runs in the family im just going to set him up with the droid then we can talk no droid the kids face went from angelic to mutinous in a heartbeat stay with daddy just for a little while champ then well go out to the park he tickled the boy into giggles as he charged up the steps with him nice to see a guy handle a kid that way and enjoy it peabody commented yeah wonder what a guy a successful guy thinks about pulling in a professionalfather stipend dealing with an offspring while the mothers being a busy exec at a major firm every day some guys would resent that some might think the little ladys pushy domineering maybe his mother was the same breens mother is a neurologist and his father went the professionalparent route you know eve added looking up the stairs some guys would build up a nasty little resentment of women over that kind of setup thats really sexist yeah it is some people are peabody frowned up the steps its some brain that could take a nice homey scene like we just witnessed and turn it on its head into a motive for murder just one of my naturalborn talents peabody chapter breen set them up in a roomy office just off the kitchen two large windows faced the rear where they could see a kind of tidy patio skirted by a low wall behind the wall were leafy trees with the view they might have been in some quiet suburb rather than the city someone had put pots of flowers on the patio along with a couple of loungers there was a small table shaded by a jaunty blueandwhitestriped umbrella a couple of big plastic trucks lay on their sides along with their colorful plastic occupants as if there had been a terrible vehicular accident why eve wondered were kids always bashing toys together maybe it was some sort of primitive cavedweller instinct that if things went well the kid outgrew or at least restrained into adulthood jeds father looked civilized enough sitting in his roily chair that hed scooted around from his workstation then again he made the bulk of his living writing about people who restrained nothing and rather than outgrowing any destructive instincts had bumped it up from plastic toys to flesh and blood it took eve was very aware all kinds so how can i help youve done considerable research into serial killers eve began historical figures primarily though i have interviewed a few contemporary subjects why is that mr breen tom why he looked surprised for a moment its fascinating youve been up close and personal with the breed dont you find them fascinating i dont know if thats the word id use he leaned forward but you have to wonder what makes them who they are dont you what separates them from the rest of us is it something more or something less are they born to kill or does that need evolve in them is it a single instance that turns them or a series of events and really the answer isnt always the same and thats fascinating one guy spends his childhood in poverty and abuse he tapped his index fingers together and becomes a productive member of society a bank president faithful husband good father loyal friend plays golf on the weekend and walks his pet schnauzer every night he uses his background to springboard himself into something better higher right and another uses it as an excuse to dive into the muck yeah i get it why do you write about the muck he sat back again well i could give you a lot of jive about how studying the killer and the muck he wades in gives society insight into how and why and understanding information is power against fear it would be true he added with his quick and boyish smile but on another level entirely its just fun ive been into it since i was a kid jack the ripper was the big one for me i read everything about him watched every vid ever produced surfed the web sites made up stories where i was a cop back then and tracked him down along the way i expanded studied up on profiling and types the steps and the stages you know trolling hunting the rush and the kill he shrugged now i went through a phase where i thought id be a cop chase the bad guys but i got over that one considered going into psychology but it just didnt suit me what i really wanted to do was write and thats what i was good at so i write about my lifelong interest i hear some writers need to experience the subject theyre writing about need that handson approach before they can put it down in words amusement bloomed on his face so youre asking if ive gone out and carved up a couple of street lcs in the name of research his laughter rolled out then stopped like a wave hitting a wall as eve only continued to watch him he blinked several times then swallowed audibly holy shit you really are im a suspect the healthy color in his face had drained away to leave it pale and shiny for real id like to know where you were on september second between midnight and three a m i was home probably i dont he lifted both hands rubbed the sides of his head man my brains gone fuzzy i figured you wanted me to consult was pretty juiced about it ah i was here jule julietta my wife had a late meeting and didnt get home until about ten she was whipped and went straight up to bed i put in some writing time with jed the only time the house is really quiet is the middle of the night i worked until one maybe a little after i can check my disc log he opened drawers in his workstation began to root around i ah jesus did the manofthehouse routine i go through it every night before i turn in check the security make sure everythings locked up look in on jed thats it how about sunday morning this sunday he glanced up over my wife got up with jed he paused and eve could see the change taking place the shock was ebbing and the interest the enjoyment even the pride in being considered a murder subject was rolling in most sundays i sleep in and she takes over she doesnt get as much oneonone time with him as i do she took him to the park they go out early and have a picnic breakfast if the weathers good jed loves that i didnt surface till close to noon whats sunday im not following then he did she could see it click the woman who was found strangled in her apartment on sunday middleaged woman living alone sexual assault and strangulation his eyes were narrowed now his color back the media reports were sketchy but strangulation and sexual assault thats not ripper style an older woman at home in her apartment thats not ripper style either whats the connection at eves steady stare he scooted forward in the chair listen if im moonlighting as a killer i already know so you wont be telling me anything if im just an expert on serial killers giving me some details might let me help either way how can you lose shed already decided what she would and wouldnt tell him but held his gaze another moment the sash of the victims lounge robe was used as the murder weapon and tied in a bow under the chin boston strangler that was his signature he snapped his fingers and began to push through the piles of discs and files on his desk ive got considerable notes on him wow youve got two killers imitating the famous teamwork like leopold and loeb or he paused took a long breath not two just one one killer working his way down a list of his heroes thats why youre looking at me youre wondering if the people i write about are heroes to me and if im mixing up my work and my life if i want to be one of them he pushed to his feet pacing with what looked to eve to be energy rather than nerves this is fucking amazing hes probably read my books thats sort of creepy but icy in a strange way too desalvo desalvo different type from jack breen mumbled blue collar family man a sad sap jack was probably educated likely a member of the upper class if the information i just gave you finds its way to the media ill know where it came from eve paused until breen stopped pacing and looked at her ill make your life hell why would i give it to the media and let somebody write about it first he sat again this has bestseller written all over it i know that sounds cold but in my line of work i have to be as detached as you do in yours ill help however i can ive got mountains of research and data accumulated on every major serial killer since the ripper started it all and a few interesting minor ones ill make it all available to you pitch in as a civilian consultant and waive the fee and when its over ill write it ill think about it eve got to her feet and saw under the mess hed made of his desk a box of creamcolored stationery fancy writing paper she commented stepping over to pick up the box hmm oh yeah i use it when i want to impress somebody is that so her eyes flashed to his like lasers who did you want to impress lately hell i dont know i think i used it a couple weeks ago when i sent what my dad always called a breadandbutter note to my publisher a thanks for a dinner party thing why whered you get it the paper jule mustve bought it no wait he rose himself looking baffled as he took the box from eve thats not right it was a gift sure i remember now came through my publisher with a fan letter readers send stuff all the time a token from a reader to the tune of about five hundred dollars youre kidding five hundred wow he was watching eve more carefully now as he set the box back on his desk i should be more careful with it ill want a sample of that paper mr breen it matches the type left at both homicides im investigating this is just too fucking weird he sat heavily take it several emotions seemed to run across his face as he scooped a hand through his luxurious hair he knows about me hes read my stuff what the hell did the note say i cant remember just something about how he appreciated my work my attention to detail or something like that and my what enthusiasm for the subject do you have the note no i wouldnt keep it i answer some of the mail personally have a droid do the bulk if its snail mail we recycle the paper after its answered hes using my work as research dont you think thats horrible and really flattering at the same time eve passed one of the sheets and envelopes to peabody to seal into evidence give him a receipt for it she ordered i wouldnt be flattered if i were you mr breen this isnt research or words in a discbook im part of it now not just an observer this time but part of something ill write about she could see he was more pleased than appalled i plan to stop him and soon mr breen things go my way youre not going to have much of a book i dont know what to think about him peabody said when they were outside she turned back studied the house and imagined the goodlooking breen swinging his handsome son onto his shoulders and taking him to the park to play and dreaming of fame and fortune written in blood the stationery was right out of the blue he didnt try to hide it wheres the excitement if we dont find it i get that and he likes the rush no question but his story sounds solid especially if the killer has read his stuff he cant prove where it came from and we have to waste time trying to trace it and breens juiced by it i guess its the sort of thing thatd juice him his jobs on the sick side sos ours surprised peabody hiked with eve to the car you liked him i havent made up my mind if hes no more than he claims to be ive got no problem with him people like murder peabody they jive on it when its got at least one of those degrees of separation reading about it watching vids about it turning on the evening news to hear about it as long as it isnt too close we dont pay to watch a couple of guys hack each other to death in an arena anymore but weve still got the bloodlust we still get off on it in the abstract because its reassuring somebodys dead but were not she remembered as she climbed into the car out of the vicious heat how that thought raced through her head again and again when shed huddled in the corner of that frigid room in dallas and looked at the bloody waste of the thing that had been her father you cant feel that way when you see it all the time when you do what we do you cant eve said as she started the car some can not all cops are heroes just because theyre supposed to be and not all fathers are good guys just because they give their little boys a ride on their shoulders whether i like him or not his lack of alibi his line of work and his possession of the notepaper put him on the list were going to do a very careful check on thomas a breen lets run the wife too what didnt we hear from him in todays conversation peabody im not following you he told us she came home from a late meeting she went to bed he worked he slept in she took the kid to the park but i never heard anything about we my wife and i jule and i me and my wife and jed thats what i didnt hear and what impression do you suppose i get from that youre thinking the marriage isnt good that theres friction or disinterest between breen and his wife yeah i can see that but i can see how with two careers and a kid a couple could get into a routine that revolves around work and pass the toddler maybe doesnt seem much point in being together if you never are though does there goodlooking guy like that might start getting resentful and frustrated with that sort of routine especially if he sees it as a repeat of his own childhood a guy doesnt want to look in the mirror at thirtysomething and see his father looking back at him well take a good close look at thomas a breen she repeated and see what we see eve decided her next stop would be fortney but it was time to play it and him a different way i want to nudge fortney on the second murder revisit the first his alibis bullshit and since i tend to get cranky when people lie to me im not going to be particularly friendly as you are the epitome of cheer and goodwill by nature sir this will be somewhat of a stretch i smell the distinct aroma of lameass sarcasm in this vehicle well have it fumigated but fortunately im the epitome of cheer and goodwill and will not rub your nose in it at this time a few minutes into my unfriendly conversation with fortney im going to get a tag on my pocket link as im in awe of you in all ways im unsurprised by this sudden psychic ability ill be annoyed but will have to take the communication thereby passing the interview to you do you also know wholl be tagging what to me that eve thought had wiped the sassy little smirk off her aides face youll pick it up as good cop the longsuffering somewhat inexperienced and apologetic underling play that up fumble around sir dallas i am the longsuffering somewhat inexperienced and apologetic underling i dont have to play it up or pretend to fumble around use it eve said simply make it work for you let him think hes leading you hell see a girl cop in uniform who takes orders from me secondstring he wont see past that to what youre made of i dont know what im made of peabody thought but drew a deep breath i can see how it could work make it work eve said again and parked outside the office building to set the timer on her link eve bullied her way into leo fortneys office and set the mood enjoyed setting it she admitted she put a little swagger in her step as she broke in on his holoconference with a video producer youre going to want to reschedule your little confab leo she told him or let hollywood here in on our conversation you have no right pushing your way in here throwing your weight around she flipped out her badge so the images in the room had a clear view bet fortneys color was edging toward magenta im sorry thad i need to take care of this disturbance ill have my assistant reschedule at your convenience he shut the hologram down before thad could do more than raise two thin eyebrows into sharp questioning points i dont have to tolerate this kind of ambush his magenta hair was pulled severely back from his face today and the sleek tail of it whipped wildly as he flung out his arms im calling my lawyer and ill see youre reprimanded by your superior you do that and well take this to central where you can explain to me your lawyer and my superior why you handed me a pile of bullshit as an alibi eve toed in and punched a finger toward his chest lying to a primary during a homicide investigation doesnt earn you any points leo if you think you can insinuate that im covering up some crime im not insinuating anything she got right up in his face as she spoke and enjoyed that as well im saying it flat out your meal ticket didnt back you up pal you did not as you claimed retire with her on the night in question she went to bed alone and assumes you joined her at some point assume aint dick so lets start this over your place or mine it doesnt mean a damn to me how dare you he lost all color now insult and temper robbing his cheeks if you think im going to stand here and be insulted have the woman i love insulted by some twobit dyke bitch cop whatre you going to do about it take me out like you took out jacie wooton and lois gregg youre going to find it tougher im not a usedup lc or a sixtyyearold woman his voice piped out now like an adolescent boys threatening to crack i dont know what the hell youre talking about couldnt get it up could you leo she was careful to keep her hands off him though shed have liked to have given him a couple of mild shots even when you had her tied up and helpless you couldnt get the wood on get away from me youre crazy little darts of fear shone in his eyes now as he danced behind his desk youre out of your mind youre going to see just how crazy if you dont tell me where you were on the night of september second and the morning of september fifth shuffle me again leo she said and slapped her hands on the desk and youll see how crazy on cue her link beeped with a snarl she ripped it out of her pocket text only she snapped waited a few beats as if reading goddamn it she muttered it then rounded on peabody get the goddamn information from this asshole ive got to take this and i dont have time to waste five minutes leo she said over her shoulder as she marched to the door then im coming back for the next round he sat heavily when the door slammed behind eve that woman is a menace she was going to strike me sir im sure youre mistaken but peabody cast an uncertain eye toward the door still shuddering on its hinges my lieutenant is its been a difficult few days mr fortney and lieutenant dallas is under a great deal of stress im sorry she lost her temper can i get you some water no no thank you he pressed a hand to his brow i just need to settle down im not used to being treated that way shes very colorful peabody tried a half smile when he looked up im sure we can straighten this all out before she gets back there were some discrepancies in your earlier statement sir its easy to get confused or mix up times and dates when youre not expecting to have to remember your movements well of course it is he said with obvious relief i certainly wasnt expecting to be questioned about a murder for gods sake i understand that and it seems to me if youd killed ms wooton or ms gregg youd have arranged a solid alibi youre obviously an intelligent man thank you officer its peabody sir if i could take out my notebook we could try to put things together for the times in question she smiled at him with whiffs of sympathy and nerves may i sit down yes yes that womans shaken my manners loose i dont see how you stand to work with her its really for her sir im in training i see he was relaxing peabody could see just as she could see his amusement at thinking hed escaped the lion and gotten himself a pussycat have you been with the police long not very i do mostly administrative work the lieutenant hates paperwork she started to roll her eyes seemed to catch herself and worked up a blush fortney laughed your secrets safe with me still i wonder what an attractive woman like you is doing in such a difficult field men still outnumber women on the job she heard herself saying and felt the quick flirtatious smile curve her lips that can be a pretty strong incentive id just like to say how much i admire your work im such a fan of musical theater and youve been involved in wonderful projects it seems so glamorous and exciting to someone like me it has its moments maybe youd like me to give you a tour of the theater backstage where the action really is that would be she trailed off breathlessly id just love it she glanced back at the door again im not supposed to do something like that you wont say anything he mimed zipping his lip and made her giggle if i can just clear up some of these discrepancies before she gets back otherwise shell skin me sweetheart you cant really believe id kill anyone oh no mr fortney but the lieutenant he got up from the desk came around and sat on the corner of it im not interested in the lieutenant the fact is pepper and i well our relationship has devolved you could say were really just business partners at this point keeping up appearances for the public i dont want anything to damage her while shes working so hard in this play i have a great deal of affection and respect for her even though even though things arent what they were between us he gave peabody a puppydog look and she did her best to respond with one of sympathy even as she thought putz do i look that green it must be awfully hard for you show business is a demanding mistress on both sides of the curtain i did tell nearly the truth about that night i didnt mention that pepper and i didnt really speak or have contact with each other when she came back from the theater i spent that night as ive spent far too many of them alone so you have no one to corroborate your whereabouts im afraid i dont not directly though pepper and i were in the same house together all night it was just another lonely night and to be frank they blur together now i wonder maybe you and i could have dinner ummm privately he added i cant be seen having dinner with a beautiful woman while pepper and i still have to keep up this pretense gossip would hurt her and shes so temperamental she needs to focus on the play i have to honor that thats so the words that ran through her head were anything but flattering but she choked out an alternative so brave id love to if i can get the time off these murders have the lieutenant working practically and when she works i work murders for a moment he looked genuinely puzzled is that what all this business about this gregg person is another prostitutes been killed there was another attack peabody evaded it would help me out a lot if you could tell me where you were sunday morning between eight and noon that would cover you and i could probably smooth things out with lieutenant dallas so she wont bother you again she tried a simper but didnt think it was her best look sunday morning sleeping the sleep of the just until tenish i indulge myself on sundays pepper would have been up and out early dance class she never misses i would have had a light brunch lingered over the sunday paper i doubt i was even dressed until noon and alone again he gave a sad crooked smile afraid so pepper would have gone directly to the theater after class sunday matinee i did go to the club but not until at least one for a swim a steam a massage he lifted his hands let them fall im afraid i did nothing of any interest all day now if id had a companion someone simpatico wed have taken a leisurely drive in the country stopped at some charming little inn for a champagne lunch and whiled away our sunday in a much more entertaining fashion as it is i have nothing but work illusion and solitude could you tell me the name of your club then i can give lieutenant dallas something solid i use the gold key on madison thanks she rose ill see if i can head her off he took peabodys hand looking into her eyes as he brought it to his lips dinner it sounds mag ill contact you as soon as i know when im clear she hoped she had one more blush in her leo she said shyly she hurried out and straight to where eve stood with her link i cant break character yet peabody reported he might ask one of his bimbos what went on out here so you should look annoyed and doubtful and like you could ream my ass at any moment fine then i dont have to break character either as thats the one i walk around in on a daily basis hes a total sleaze and he doesnt have a solid for either murder hard for me to see somebody that slimy being our guy but hes not covered she looked down at her shoes studying the shine and hoping the body language looked subservient he also cheats on pepper regularly by my take he hit on me and it seemed like a natural rhythm guys got more tired lines than an afternoon soap and less talent at selling them you hit back enough to keep the rhythm up not enough to get me a reprimand should there be an official inquiry maybe you could stomp off to the elevator now its getting hard to keep looking naive and subservient eve obliged and timed it so peabody barely had time to nip in with her before the doors shut i thought that was a good touch good thing my butt isnt any bigger than it already is hes shifting his story for the night of the wooton murder says he and pepper are just business partners now and keeping up the pretext of otherwise so there isnt any negative publicity through the run of the play still says he was at home all night though and home all sunday morning alone the original lonely guy what kind of moronic female falls for that crap eve wondered lots i guess depending on the delivery she moved her shoulders his wasnt bad actually but it was too quick and too obvious anyhow he claims he went to the gold key on madison about one on sunday i say hes twinking at least one of those bimbos on the side hes not the type for an lc isnt going to pay for it when he can bullshit and brag his way into it and id say itd be news to pepper that theyre just business partners now id also say he doesnt think much of women as a species go peabody eve thought and leaned back against the elevator wall as her aide ran it through thinks about them because he probably imagines fucking any woman whos remotely attractive but he doesnt like them he kept calling you that woman never referred to you by name or rank and there was a lot of passion in the way he said it good job i dont know that i found out anything really useful except now that i think about it i can see him doing the murders you found out hes lying to his lover and if he isnt actively cheating which he likely is hes open to cheating you found out that he had the opportunity to commit both murders so hes a liar and a cheat doesnt make him a murderer but hes a liar and a cheat with opportunity with access to the stationery found at both crime scenes and that he has an attitude toward women thats not bad for the day carmichael smith was in the studio in new la so she gave him a pass for the day she found niles renquist so heavily wrapped in red tape that she decided to do an end run around him and aim for his wife the renquists new york home wasnt breens upwardly mobile family neighborhood or carmichaels trendy loft it was all dignity and restrained grace in faded brick and tall windows the entrance hall where they were admitted with considerable reluctance and disapproval by a uniformed housekeeper who could have given summerset a run for his money was done in creams and burgundies and the subtle sheen of religiously polished antiques lilies white and burgundy in a crystal vase sat on a long narrow table along the staircase and scented the air along with it was an echoing hush she associated with empty houses or churches its like a museum peabody said out of the corner of her mouth you and roarke have all this cool richpeople stuff but its different people live there before eve could respond there was the female sound of heels on wood people lived here too eve thought but she had a feeling they were a different type altogether the woman who walked toward them was as beautiful as dignified and as quietly elegant as the home shed made her hair was a soft blonde carefully coiffed into a short bob that caught the light her face was pale and creamy with a hint of rose on cheeks and lips this one eve thought never left the house without sunscreen top to toe she wore widelegged pants killer heels and a blousy shirt with a faint sheen all in cream lieutenant dallas there was a hightoned drift of england in her voice and the hand she offered was cool pamela renquist im sorry but im expecting company shortly if youd contacted my secretary im sure we could have arranged an appointment at a more convenient time then ill try to keep the inconvenience short if this is about the stationery your time would be of more use speaking with my secretary she handles the bulk of my correspondence did you buy the stationery mrs renquist quite possibly her face never changed held its mildly pleasant expression as she spoke with the kind of undiluted politeness eve always found insulting i enjoy shopping when in london but i rarely keep track of every little purchase we certainly have the paper so it hardly matters if i bought it myself or niles or one of our assistants made the purchase for us i was under the impression my husband had discussed this with you he did there is considerable repetition and overlap in a homicide investigation could you tell me where you and your husband were on the night we were precisely where niles has already told you we were on the night of that unfortunate persons murder her tone became frigid and dismissive my husband is a very busy man lieutenant and i know hes already taken the time to speak with you regarding this matter i have nothing to add to what hes already told you and im expecting guests not so fast sweetheart i havent yet spoken to your husband regarding a second murder id like you to tell me where you both were on sunday between eight and noon for the first time since the woman had walked down the hall she looked flustered it was momentary just a slight heightening of color on that creamy skin a slight frown around the rosy mouth then it was smooth and pale again i find this very tedious lieutenant yeah me too but there you go sunday mrs renquist pamela drew air sharply through her chiseled nostrils we have brunch on sundays at tenthirty prior to that my husband would have enjoyed a welldeserved hour in our relaxation tank as he does every sunday when schedule permits between nine and ten while he was doing so i would have joined him in our home health center for my own sunday morning hour of exercise at eleventhirty after brunch my daughter would have gone with her au pair to a museum while my husband and i prepared to go to the club for a doubles match with friends is that detailed enough lieutenant she said lieutenant as another woman might have said nosy insolent bitch eve had to give her credit for it you and your husband were home on sunday from eight until noon as ive just said mummy they both turned and looked at the young girl gold and pink and white as pretty as a frosted cake on the stairs a woman of about twentyfive with a spill of black hair clipped back neatly at her nape held the girls hand not now rose its impolite to interrupt sophia take rose back upstairs ill let you know when the guests have arrived she spoke to her daughter and the woman in the same polite and distant tones yes maam she gave the girls hand a little tug eve saw it and the slight resistance of the child before the girl went obediently back up the stairs if theres nothing more lieutenant youll have to make an appointment with either myself or my husband through our offices she walked to the door opened it i hope you find who youre looking for soon so this can be put to rest im sure jacie wooton and lois gregg feel exactly the same way thanks for your time chapter with the help of lois greggs daughterinlaw eve mapped out the daily routine of the victims life leah gregg served iced tea in the compact nook off her compact kitchen she wanted to keep her hands busy eve could see and her mind occupied more eve saw a woman who wanted to take some active part in standing for her husbands mother we were close actually lois was closer to me than my own mother mine lives in denver with my stepfather we have issues she smiled when she said it a tightlipped grimace that indicated they were big issues but lois was the best some of my friends have trouble with their inlaws unwanted advice little digs interference she shrugged and sat across from eve at the narrow service bar then she nodded at the ring on eves left hand youre married so you know how it can be especially with mothers of sons who dont want to let go of their baby boy eve made a noncommittal sound there was no point in saying no she didnt know how it could be her husbands mother had been forced to let go of her baby boy a long long time ago but i didnt get any of that from lois not that she didnt love her kids she just knew how to keep it all balanced she was fun and smart and had a life of her own she loved her kids she loved the grands she loved me leah had to take a long calming breath jeff and his sister all of us really are just flattened by this she was young and healthy vital and active the sort of woman you expect to live forever i guess to lose her this way its just cruel but well she took another breath i guess you know that in your line of work and its not why youre here i know this is hard mrs gregg and i appreciate you taking the time to talk to me ill do anything absolutely anything to help you find the bastard who did this to lois i mean that eve saw that she did i take it you talked to her often two three times a week we got together very often sunday dinners shopping sprees girl days we were friends lieutenant lois and i she was i guess ive just realized she was my best friend oh shit she broke off pushing off to grab some tissue im not going to lose it it wont help her or jeff or the kids for me to lose it just give me a second take your time were having a memorial tomorrow she didnt want anything formal or depressing she used to joke about it when my time comes shed say i want you to have a nice tasteful memorial service and make it short then break out the champagne and have a party celebrate my life thats what we want to do we will do because she wanted it but it wasnt supposed to be now it wasnt supposed to be like this i dont know how well get through it one minute at a time i guess she sat again breathed again okay i know what was done to her jeff told me he tried not to but he fell apart and it all came pouring out so i know what was done to her you dont have to be delicate with me she mustve liked you a lot it was the first time peabody had spoken and the comment had leahs eyes tearing again thanks now what can i do she wore a ring third finger left hand yes she considered it her wedding ring though she and sam never made it formal sam was the love of her life he died a few years ago in an accident and she continued to wear his ring can you describe it sure gold band channel set with little sapphires five little sapphires because he gave it to her on their fifth anniversary very classic very simple lois didnt like flashy jewelry she paused a moment and eve could see it sink in he took it he took her ring the bastard the filthy son of a bitch that ring mattered to her the fact that her killer took the ring may help us find and identify him when we find it and him youll be able to positively identify it that will help us build our case all right all right thanks i can think of it that way now think of it as a way to lock him up that helps did she mention anything however casually eve began about meeting someone seeing someone hanging around the neighborhood no her kitchen link beeped and she ignored it you can get that eve told her we can wait no its someone calling with condolences everyone who knew her is calling this is more important now eve angled her head officer peabodys right she mustve liked you very much shed have expected me to handle this the way she wouldve handled it so i will think carefully then any mention of anyone she mightve met or seen in the last few weeks she was friendly the sort who talks to strangers on line at the market or strikes up conversations in the subway so she wouldnt have mentioned anything like that unless it was out of the ordinary for her take me through the places shed go the routes shed take daily business sort of thing im looking for repetition and habit the kind of thing someone who was tracking her could use to determine shed have been alone in the apartment sunday morning okay leah began to outline lois basic routines as eve took notes it was a simple life if an active one fitness classes three times a week biweekly sessions at a salon market on fridays thursday evenings out with friends for a meal and a vid or play volunteer work monday afternoons at a local daycare center her parttime job at a ladys boutique on tuesdays wednesdays and saturdays she dated once in a while leah added but not so much recently and nothing serious as i said sam was it for her if shed been seeing anyone even very casually id have known about it customers in the shop men sure shed tell us about some of the guys whod come in and throw themselves on her mercy looking for something for a spouse or girlfriend nothing lately not that she mentioned wait her back went steelstraight wait i remember her saying something about a man she ran into when she was shopping for produce a couple of weeks ago said he looked sort of lost over the tomatoes or something as if to nudge the memory clear leah rubbed her temples she helped him pick out some vegetables and fruit that was just like her she said he was a single father just moved to new york with his little boy he was worried about finding good day care so she told him about kid time thats the place she volunteers gave him all the information being lois she pumped him for personal information she said he was a goodlooking guy concerned father looked lonely and she was hoping he checked out kid time so she could maybe fix him up with a woman she knew who worked there god what did she say his name was ed earl no no al thats it al eve repeated and felt it hit her gut she said he walked her part of the way home carried her bags said they talked kids for a few blocks i didnt pay much attention it was the kind of thing she did all the time and knowing lois if they talked kids she talked about hers about us she probably said how we got together sunday afternoons and how she looked forward to it about how she knew what it was like to raise kids alone did she tell you what he looked like she just said he was a goodlooking boy that doesnt mean anything damn it shed call any guy under forty a boy so thats no help yes it was eve thought it eliminated elliot hawthorne as her own instincts already had she was a born mother so if she saw this guy puzzling over tomatoes shed have automatically stepped up to give him a hand and talk to him try to help him out with his problems southern leah said on a rise of excitement thats what she said a goodlooking southern boy she was a jewel you know what im saying rico vincenti proprietor of the familyrun market where lois gregg did her weekly shopping unashamedly wiped his tears with a red bandanna then stuffed it away in the back pocket of khakis that bagged over his skinny butt he went back to stacking a fresh supply of peaches in his sidewalk bin thats what im hearing eve said she came in here regularly every friday sometimes shed come by other times pick up a couple things but she was in every friday morning ask me about my family give me grief about prices not bitchy he said quickly friendly like some people they come in here never say a word to you but not mrs gregg i find the bastard he made an obscene gesture finito you can leave that part to me you ever notice anybody hanging around look like he was watching her i see somebody bothering one of my customers even if it aint a regular i move em along he jerked his thumb over his shoulder like an umpire calling out a base runner i been here fifteen years this is my place there was a man a couple of weeks ago she helped him pick out some produce struck up a conversation just like her he pulled out the bandanna once more he went out with her carried her bags nicelooking guy probably under forty mrs gregg she was always talking to somebody in here let me think he raked his hands through his thatch of saltandpepper hair screwed up his narrow face yeah couple fridays back she took this guy under her wing picked out some nice grapes for him some tomatoes head of romaine radishes carrots got a pound of peaches can you tell me as much about him as what he bought vincenti cracked his first smile not so much she brought him up with her i always checked mrs gregg out and she says now mr vincenti i want you to take good care of my new friend al when he comes in here by himself hes got a little boy who needs your best produce i say something like i got nothing but the best what did he say dont recall that he did smiled a lot had on a ball cap now that i think and sunshades this heat most everybodys got on a cap and shades tall short ah damn me he mopped at his sweaty face with the bandanna now taller than me but who the hell isnt i top out at five six we were busy and i wasnt paying much attention she was doing all the talking like always she asked me to put some peaches aside for her the next week she was going to her daughters in jersey sunday next whole family deal and she wanted to take her some peaches cause her girl had a fondness for them she come in for them sure this past friday five pounds i put them in a little basket for her let her take them home in it cause shes a good customer the guy who went out with her has he come back i havent seen him again i dont come in on wednesdays like to golf on wednesdays so he coulda come in and i wouldnt know but if hed come back any other day im here you think thats the guy you think thats the sick prick who killed mrs gregg just covering the ground mr vincenti i appreciate the help you need any more you need anything you come see me she was a jewel you think he might be the killer peabody said as they walked the neighborhood following the route leah had outlined for them i think he was being a smartass introducing himself with the name al albert desalvo the method he planned to use for her murder i think it would have been a very smart way to feel her out coming to the market putting on the baffled singledaddy routine if hed scoped out the area looking for a woman a single woman of her age group spotted her considered her while he was trolling hed have watched her routine gotten her name looked up her data so hed know she volunteered at a kid care place he knew how to research eve thought knew how to take his time get the data digest it before he made a move a woman does time in daycare voluntarily shes into kids so he tells her hes got a kid when he makes his first contact she nodded as she spoke as she studied the neighborhood it was smart it was simple good place to make that contact is the market ask her for advice give her a story about having a kid needing daycare walk her part of the way home not all the way he doesnt have to he knows where she lives just like he knows her plans for sunday not the next sunday the following so he can have plenty of time to watch her get it all down plan it out enjoy the anticipation she stopped on the corner watched people walk by most with the native new york stare that stopped well short of eye contact not a tourist sector she acknowledged people lived and worked here went about their business shed have strolled though eve said aloud strolled along with him chatting giving him what seemed like harmless little details of her life peaches for her daughter but there wasnt a basket of peaches in the apartment on sunday he took them a nice edible souvenir to go with the ring walked out of her place after he did what he did carrying a little basket of fruit i bet he got a real kick out of that really enjoyed taking a big juicy bite feet planted she hooked her thumbs in her pockets too intent on what she was seeing in her head to notice the quick and wary glances tossed her way when her stance revealed her weapon but thats a mistake a stupid cocky mistake people might not notice some guy walking out of an apartment building with a toolbox but they might just might notice one walking out with a basket of peaches and a toolbox she crossed the street stood on the next corner and judged the ground glidecarts arent going to be up and running that early on a sunday not around here but the newsstands the coffee shops the delis they would be i want them canvassed i want to know if anyone noticed a man in maintenance wear carrying a toolbox and a friggin basket of peaches yes sir lieutenant i just want to say its a real pleasure to watch you work whatre you angling for peabody no seriously its an education to watch you see what you see and how you see it but now that you mention it its pretty hot maybe we could since they are up and running this time of day get a drink from the glidecart there im doing a wicked witch of the west here a what you know im melting with a halfsnort eve dug credits out of her pocket get me a tube of pepsi and tell him if its not cold im going to come over there and hurt him while peabody clomped off eve stood on the corner her imagination running hed have left her here she decided most likely here a couple blocks short of the apartment had to part ways on a corner makes the most sense probably told her he lived nearby what he did for a living little stories about his kid lies all of them if this was their man and every cell of the cop told her it was southern she thought had he told her he was from the south most likely used an accent or had one used she decided just another little flourish peabody came back with the drinks a scoop of fries and a veggie kabob got you the scoop heavy on the salt so you wouldnt sneer at my kabob i can still sneer at a kabob ill always sneer at veggies on a stick but she dug into the scoop well head down this way swing into the dress shop maybe he paid a visit there too there were two clerks on duty at the boutique and both began to weep openly the minute eve mentioned lois name one of them went to the door put up the closed sign i just cant take it in i keep expecting her to walk in and tell us it was some sort of horrible joke the tall clerk with her greyhounds lithe body patted her companions back as the younger woman sobbed into her hands i was going to close the shop for the day but i dont know what wed do with ourselves this your place eve asked yes lois worked for me for ten years she was great with the staff with the customers with the stock she couldve run the place singlehandedly if shed wanted im going to miss her so much she was like a mother to me the sobbing woman lifted her head im getting married in october and she was helping me with so much of it we were having the best time with all the plans and now now she wont be there i know this is hard but i need to ask you some questions we want to help dont we addy anything the woman got her sobbing under control absolutely anything eve took them through the usual questions wound her way around to the man vincenti had described i dont remember anyone like that coming in recently addy no at least not by himself we get men who come in with their wives or girlfriends and the occasional solo but nobody like that in the past few weeks no one lois helped or talked to while i was working how about someone who came in asked about her there was that man last week no the week before remember myra he had on a totally mag suit carried a mark cross briefcase yes i remember he said lois had helped him the month before on some gifts for his wife and they were such a big hit hed stopped by to thank her what did he look like mmm late thirties tall nicely built neat little goatee and wavy brown hair on the long side he wore it tied back he never took off his sunshades pradas continental style addy added i bought my fiancé a pair for his birthday they cost a mint he smelled like money and had a clipped yankee accent ivy league type i thought i tried to steer him to accessories because he looked like he could afford to drop a bundle and weve got some terrific new handbags but he wasnt biting just said hed hoped to give his thanks and regards to mrs gregg i said i was sorry she wasnt working today because shed have appreciated that if he wanted to stop by again he should shoot for tuesday wednesday or saturday and gave him her hours oh god her face went sheetwhite was that wrong no this is just routine do you remember anything else no he just said hed try to come by again if he was in the area and left i just thought how nice that was because customers dont usually bother and the men sure dont they followed leahs list and found that at every point there was someone who remembered a man of subtly varied descriptions whod made some casual inquiry about lois gregg he stalked her eve said gathering data taking his time had a couple of weeks for it anyway he was going to do wooton first and she was easy all you have to do to pick an lc at her level is wander around and watch the stroll zero in on one who fits your requirements you dont have to worry about getting her alone because thats her job but with lois it had to be in her place to fit the imitation she had to be home she had to be alone and not expecting anyone he had to have plenty of time peabody pointed out had to be able to hit the market on friday the boutique the daycare the fitness center all on weekdays all during regular work hours doesnt sound like hes a ninetofiver no and if we go back to our own list anyone on it so far has the flexibility shed tagged baxter and trueheart out to do the neighborhood canvass and was hoping to get a call any minute telling her theyd found someone whod seen the killer with his souvenir basket of peaches meanwhile she had to keep it moving hed killed twice and she was certain hed already selected his next victim she left peabody to do the deeper runs on breen and his wife and headed out to beg or bribe a short consult with mira she had to wait and pace the outer office and ask herself yet again who their deadly mimic might imitate next so far hed picked two notorious and deceased killers and she was willing to bet hed stick to pattern no one she thought who was still among the living the ripper had never been caught desalvo had died in prison so capture and incarceration were okay that left the field pretty wide even excluding anyone whod destroyed or hidden or consumed their victims her communicator beeped as she was staring holes through miras door and willing it to open dallas baxter i think weve got one for you dallas a witness from the neighboring building who was heading out to church and saw a guy in a city maintenance uniform or so she believes walking out of the vics building carrying a toolbox and a plastic fruit basket time right its deadon our witness knew gregg she insists on coming downtown and talking to the primary personally bring her on were heading back ill meet you in the break room my office break room he insisted some of us havent eaten our lunch as yet she opened her mouth to protest and heard the click of miras door fine im in a meeting ill be there as soon as im clear before miras assistant could repeat the fact that the doctor had only a scant ten minutes free mira was stepping out gesturing eve inside im glad you found the time to come in ive read all the available data i have more eve told her i need something cold cool enough in here mira said as she went to the minifridge but just knowing what its like outside makes me feel hot mind over matter she took out a container of juice poured two glasses i know you live on caffeine in one form or another but this is better for you thanks the two vics are distinct types very distinct yes mira sat the first a recovering junkie lc busted down to street level a lifer with no friends family or support group though it appears her own choice he wasnt concerned about who she was but what she was a street whore working the dingier section of chinatown but the second was a who and what tell me about the second a single woman living alone in a nice neighborhood a woman whod raised her family and kept close ties with them active in her community friendly wellliked by everyone more wellliked than i think he understood because he doesnt get that he has no strong feelings for anyone but himself so he doesnt relate to those who do doesnt understand the circle mira nodded it was her situation living alone age neighborhood and the fact that she would be found quickly thats what drew him to her but it was a mistake because she had impact on everyone she was associated with people liked her loved her and theyre not just willing to cooperate with the police theyre eager to she isnt going to be forgotten like wooton not ever everyone ive spoken to had something specific to say about her something personal and positive its like what i imagine people would say about you when you she caught herself coughed but it was too late jesus that sounded creepy i meant it didnt mira cocked her head and quite simply beamed what a nice thing to hear why do you say it she wished to hell and back she hadnt but she was stuck now its just she downed the juice like medicine in one huge gulp i ah interviewed greggs daughterinlaw earlier and it reminded me thats all of the way your daughter talked about you there was this real bright connection a total bond and i got that same sort of thing from the guy at her market the people she worked with everybody she left her mark so do you its that he wasnt considering the way people would rally for her stand for her youre right hed have expected the event itself to be the big story meaning hed be the story she beyond her convenience for him was incidental though the first victim made her living through sex and the second was sexually brutalized the killings arent a sexual act but a rage against sex against women and this act makes him powerful and makes them nothing he stalked gregg eve said and led mira through it hes very careful meticulous in his way despite the fact that both killings were messy his preparation is precise as his imitations are each time he succeeds he proves not only that hes more powerful more important than the women he kills but more than the men he emulates he doesnt have to stick with a pattern or so he tells himself because of course there is a pattern he believes himself capable of any sort of murder and the getting away with it the outwitting you the female hes chosen deliberately chosen to play against he beats you a woman and proves youre less than him every time he leaves you a note the notes theyre not his voice it doesnt fit with everything else youre saying theyre broad and jokey hes not another disguise mira agreed another persona hes making himself sound different in them the way he made himself sound different to the people he spoke with when stalking gregg mr versatility again its important to him that he not be pegged labeled pigeonholed its very likely that he was just that during his upbringing and by the female authority figure he may maintain the illusion of the image she forced on him but its not how he sees himself it is the mother he kills eve the mother as whore with wooton and now the mother as nurturer with lois gregg whoever he mimics next the victim will be in his mind another form of mother ive run probabilities but even if i narrow down who hell copy i dont know how that leads me to the next victim before he gets to her hell need some time to prepare to assume the new face the new method not much eve replied he wont need much because hes already worked it all out he didnt start this last week quite true it began years ago some of his need would have manifested in childhood the typical route of tormenting or killing small animals secret bullying sexual dysfunction if his family or caregivers knew and were concerned there may have been some therapy or counseling and if they didnt if they did or didnt we know his needs and his acts escalated from the profile and your witness statements this man is in his mid to late thirties he didnt begin to kill at this age didnt begin with jacie wooton therell be others youll find them mira said and theyll create a path to him yes ill find them thanks eve rose i know you were squeezed and ive got a witness heading in she started to speak again then changed gears and thanks for the invitation for sunday sorry i had to duck out the way i did it was lovely to have you both there while you were mira got to her feet as well i hope youll tell me whats on your mind there was a time you wouldnt have or wouldnt have let me see there was something troubling you i thought we were past that now my ten minutes are up eve with that quiet word mira laid a hand on hers i had a dream the words came out fast as if theyd been waiting to be disgorged sort of a dream about my mother sit mira stepped to her desk buzzed her assistant ill need another few minutes here she said and clicked off before her assistant could respond i dont want to hold you up it wasnt a big deal it wasnt a nightmare exactly youve had no real memory of your mother up until this no you know just one time before i remembered hearing her voice yelling at him bitching about me but i saw her this time i saw her face i have her eyes fuck it she sat now just dropping down and pressing the heels of her hands against those eyes why is that goddamn it the luck of the gene pool eve youre too smart to think the color of your eyes means anything screw the science i hate it thats all i saw the way she looked at me with them she hated me gutdeep hate i dont get it i just dont get it i was im not good at judging ages of little kids three four maybe but she hated me the way you hate a lifelong enemy mira wanted to go over to enfold to mother but knew it wasnt the way and that hurt you i wondered i guess she drew in air let it out explosively i guess i wondered if even though i knew from what i remembered i wondered if maybe somehow he snatched me from her at some point beat the crap out of her maybe and took off with me i wondered if even though she was on the junk she had some feeling for me i mean you cart somebody around inside you for nine months you ought to feel something yes you ought mira spoke gently some people arent capable of love you know that too better than most i had this fantasy didnt even know i had it until it shattered on me that she was looking for me worried about me trying to find me all this time because under everything she loved me but she didnt there wasnt anything but hate in her eyes when she looked at me looked at the child you know it wasnt you she hated because she never knew you not really and her lack of feeling wasnt isnt your fault it was and is her lack youre a difficult woman eve she laughed a little jerked a shoulder yeah so a difficult woman often abrasive moody and demanding and impatient are you going to get to my good parts any time soon i dont have that much time but mira smiled pleased to hear the habitual sarcasm but your flaws as some might see them dont prevent those who know you from loving you respecting you admiring you tell me what you remembered eve blew out a breath and ran through it with the cool dispassion and attention to detail shed use in a police report i dont know where we were i mean what city but i know she whored for money and drugs and that was okay with him i know she wanted to ditch me and that wasnt okay with him because he had other plans for me for his investment they werent your parents im sorry they conceived you egg and sperm she incubated you and expelled you from her body when it was time but they werent your parents theres a difference you know there is i guess i do you didnt come from them you overcame them theres another difference let me say one more thing before my assistant chews through my door and punishes me for ruining her schedule youve also left your mark and had an impact on more lives than either of us can count remember that when you look in the mirror and into your own eyes chapter when eve walked into the break room baxter was chowing down on an enormous sandwich that smelled too good and looked too fresh to have come out of the facilitys autochef any of the vending machines or the takeout counter at the eatery it looked civilian and delicious beside him at the square table the sweetfaced trueheart was making neat work of a leafy salad topped with chunks of chicken across from them a woman who looked to have seen the dawn and dusk of a couple of centuries beamed goodwill over them there now she said in a reedy voice isnt that better than anything you can get out of a machine glump baxter responded over bread and meat in what was obviously delirious agreement trueheart who was younger nearly as green as his salad and whose mouth wasnt quite as full at the time scraped back his chair when he spotted eve lieutenant he shot to attention as baxter rolled his eyes in amusement over the rookie and adoration over his sandwich he swallowed jeez trueheart save the brownnosing until after i digest dallas this is the amazing and wonderful mrs elsa parksy mrs parksy maam this is lieutenant dallas the primary investigator you wanted to see thanks for coming in mrs parksy my duty isnt it as a citizen not to mention as a friend and neighbor lois looked after me when i needed it now ill look after her best i can sit down dearie have you had your lunch eve eyed the sandwich the salad and ignored the envy that swirled in her mostly empty stomach yes maam i told these boys id fix extra cant abide food out of a machine its not natural detective baxter you offer some of that sandwich to this girl shes too skinny im fine really detective baxter told me you saw a man leaving mrs greggs apartment building on sunday morning did i didnt talk to the police before as i went straight on to my grandsons after church and stayed overnight didnt get back home until this morning heard about lois on the news yesterday of course the countless wrinkles in her withered raisin of a face shifted in what eve took for sorrow ive never been so shocked and sad even when my fred god rest him fell under the number three train back in she was a good woman and a good neighbor yes i know she was what can you tell us about the man you saw hardly paid him any attention my eyes are pretty good yet got them fixed up again last march but i wasnt paying him much mind absently she pulled a pack of napwipes out of a cavernous handbag and passed them to baxter thank you mrs parksy he said in a humbled respectful voice youre a good boy she patted his hand then turned her attention back to eve where was i oh yes i was just coming out to wait for my grandson he comes by every sunday at ninefifteen to take me to church you go to church there was a quick and beady gleam in mrs parksys eyes causing eve to hesitate between the truth and a convenient lie yes maam trueheart spoke up his face solemn i like to go to mass at st pats when i can get into midtown on sunday otherwise i go to our lady of the sorrows downtown catholic are you yes maam well thats all right she patted his hand in turn as if it wasnt his fault you saw the man come out from mrs greggs building eve prompted said i did didnt i he came out just a minute after i stepped out my own front door across the street had on a gray uniform and carried a black toolbox had a blue plastic basket in his other hand like the kind they have down at the market couldnt see what was in it cause it was a ways and i wasnt staring at the man what can you tell me about how he looked looked like a repairman is all white man or maybe mixed hard to tell as the sun was blasting dont know how old not as old as me thirty forty fifty sixty thats all the same when you hit your century mark and i hit mine seventeen years ago last march but id say thirty or forty as a best guess congratulations mrs parksy trueheart said and she smiled at him youre a very nice young man this other he had a cap on uniform cap and sunglasses dark ones had mine on myself sun was blazing even though it was early he saw me couldnt see his eyes of course but he saw me as he sent me a bigaslife grin and gave me this little bow sassys what i call it and i just sniffed and looked the other way as i dont hold with sass sorry about that now wish id watched after him more which direction did he go oh he headed east spring in his step like a man pleased with his mornings work bad business bad business when a man can all but skip out the door and onto the sidewalk when hes killed a woman lois went to the market for me more than once when i was feeling poorly and she brought me flowers to cheer me up always had a minute to chat i wish id known what hed done when i saw him my grandson drove up just a minute or two later hes always prompt idve told him to run that murdering bastard down on the street as god is my witness i wouldve she worked mrs parksy until she was sure she had everything the woman could give her then passed her to trueheart asking him to escort her to a uniform for transport home baxter another minute here she dug in her pocket and discovered shed given peabody all her credits earlier got enough on you for a pepsi whats wrong with using your badge number you over your limit she gave him a disgusted look with a sulk right on the edges i plug in my badge number the machine will give me grief the one up by our squad hates me has a personal vendetta and they talk to each other baxter dont think they dont communicate he studied her for one long minute you need a vacation i need a friggin pepsi you want an iou he walked to the machine keyed in his badge number ordered the tube good afternoon you have ordered one eightounce tube of pepsi its iced have a safe and productive day and dont forget to recycle he tugged it out of the slot walked back and handed it to her my treat thanks listen i know youve got backlog i appreciate you taking the time for the canvass just put it in your report i could use the shine she gave a head nod toward the door so theyd walk and talk trueheart looks good he steady enough doc cleared him physically kids healthy as a horse shrink gave him thumbsup too i read the evals baxter im asking you truth is i think what happened to him nearly happened a couple weeks ago shook me more than him hes solid dallas hes gold gotta tell you i never figured on taking on a rookie or putting on a trainers hat but hes a gift baxter shook his head as they caught a glide kid loves the job hell he is the job like nobody i know except you he bounces in each shift raring i tell you he makes my fucking day satisfied eve headed down the hall with him speaking of trainees baxter continued i hear peabodys going to take the detectives exam in a few days nothing wrong with your hearing nervous mom she shot him a narrow look funny why should i be nervous he started to grin then they both turned at the highpitched howl a skinny guy in restraints broke away from the uniform escorting him sent another to his knees with a wellplaced groin kick then came flying toward the glide eyes wild spittle flying since her pepsi was in her weapon hand eve winged it it caught him between the eyes with an audible thud it surprised more than hurt him so that he stumbled righted himself then lowered his head and charged her like a battering ram she had just enough time to pivot she brought her knee up sharply connecting with his chin there was a nasty crunching sound that she figured was either his jaw snapping or the cartilage in her knee shifting in either case he went down hard on his ass and was immediately tackled by two uniforms and one passing plainclothes cop baxter reholstered his weapon scratched his head at the melee on the floor want another pepsi dallas what was left of hers was making a brown puddle on the floor goddamn it whos in charge of this asshole me sir one of the uniforms staggered up he was winded and bleeding from the bottom lip i was taking him to holding for officer why didnt you have control of your prisoner i thought he was controlled lieutenant he obviously you thought incorrectly it appears you need to refresh yourself on proper procedure the prisoner bucked and kicked and began to scream like a woman to demonstrate proper procedure for controlling prisoners eve crouched ignoring the twinge in her knee she grabbed the screamer by a hank of his long dark hair jerked his head until his crazed eyes met hers shut up if you dont shut up if you dont cease resisting immediately i will pull your tongue out of your mouth drag it around your neck and strangle you with it she saw from his eyes that hed been enjoying some chemicals but the threat got through or maybe it was the tone that warned him she meant it literally when he sagged eve rose and gave the uniform the same cold glare add resisting and assaulting an officer to our guests prize package today i want to see a copy of your report before you file it officer she deliberately scraped her gaze down and scanned his name tag cullin yes sir lose him again and ill use his tongue to strangle you move there was a scramble as a couple of uniforms moved in a show of solidarity to drag the prisoner up and haul him away baxter handed eve a fresh tube of pepsi figured youd earned this goddamn right she shot back and limped into homicide she wrote her own report and handcarried it to commander whitney he gestured her to a chair which she took grateful to get off her aching knee when shed finished her oral briefing he nodded is your block on the media going to fuel him or frustrate him with or without the media hes hunting again while his victims are random they are deliberate and the deliberation takes time as for the media ive fed a few statements through the department liaison theyre concentrating on the first murder its flashier than the rape and murder of a sixtyoneyearold woman in her apartment were not going to be pressed too hard on that end until one of them gets the connection they will eventually especially if he hits again but weve got some room youre misleading the media no sir im just not leading them ive given my statement to quinton post at rather than nadine furst as i felt that would cool any mumbling about favoritism hes sharp but still a bit green once nadine gets her teeth into this shell make the connection until then i dont have to answer what isnt asked good enough on another front sir i dont think despite his claims he cares overmuch about the media attention not at this time he wants my attention and he has it dr miras profile confirms his need to dominate and destroy women the female authority figure is his nemesis thats me thats why he picked me are you a target i dont believe so not as long as he sticks to pattern whitney grunted then steepled his fingers you should be aware that ive had complaints sir one from leo fortney whos crying harassment and threatening a suit against you and the department a second from the offices of niles renquist intimating displeasure at having the wife of a diplomatic figure interrogated by a member of the new york police and security department and a third from the representative of carmichael smith who ranted vigorously about the possibility of damaging publicity due to the hounding of his client by a what was it an insensitive abrasive hotshot with a badge that would be me leo fortney gave false information during initial questioning hes changed his story somewhat during subsequent questioning by my aide but it still reeks both niles renquist and his wife have been questioned not interrogated and while both were cooperative neither was forthcoming as for carmichael if anyone leaks his involvement in my investigation to the media it would be him you intend to pursue each of these individuals as suspects in this investigation yes sir i do all right satisfied he nodded i have no problem fielding the complaints but walk softly here dallas each of these people has considerable power in his own way and all of them know how to spin the media if one of them is a murderer ill make the case they can spin until they revolve to saturn and back but theyll do it from a cage wrap them up then carefully dismissed she got to her feet whitney lifted an eyebrow as she started out whats wrong with the leg its just the knee she said annoyed she hadnt remembered to control the limp on the way out so she smiled a little i ran into something stupid she said and closed the door behind her she left later than shed intended and got stuck in some bad traffic instead of fighting it eve waited it out using the time to think to review her notes to think some more she had suspects though she was thin on evidence she had threads that wove through both murders the notes the tone of them the imitation she had no dna no trace evidence and no evidence that led her to believe the killer had known his victims witness reports described a white or possibly mixedrace male of indeterminate age and coloring he used accents she thought because his voice was distinctive renquist with his british tones carmichael with his famous ones possible then again fortney ran his mouth to the media and the public often enough he might assume someone would recognize his voice or it could just be ego again and any one of them im so important everyone will recognize me if i dont disguise myself look for the female authority figure she told herself thats the core and thats the key what was the phrase cherchez la femme she thought that was right she stripped off her jacket on the way from the car to the house the air felt close heavy and just a bit electric maybe a storm coming rain couldnt hurt she thought and tossed the jacket over the newel a good bitch of a storm might keep her man inside and off the hunt before she went back to work back to her own hunt shed track down another man the home locator told her roarke was on the rear patio off the kitchen she couldnt figure out why hed be out in the nasty air when the house was blissfully fresh and cool and provided a room for any possible activity but she walked the long stretch of it and out the kitchen to find him then simply stood struck speechless ah good youre here we can get started he was wearing jeans not his usual aroundthehouse attire and a white tshirt he was barefoot and a little sweaty which appealed to her the fact was he would have appealed to her or any woman regardless of his attire or the fact that he was standing on a sunbaked patio on a september evening where the airquality index had simply waved the white flag and surrendered the field but at the moment she was more interested in the enormous shiny silver contraption beside him what is that thing its an outdoor cooking system warily relieved she was still wearing her weapon just in case she approached like a barbecue deal that and more he stroked one of his beautiful hands over the lid as a man might stroke a woman who bewitched him gorgeous isnt she just arrived an hour ago it was massive and the glare of the sun off its surface nearly blinding there was she noted more than one lid as it had extensions on either side and some doored compartment beneath the main unit there were countless buttons controls dials she wet her lips um it doesnt look exactly like the one the miras used newer model he opened the main lid and revealed another gleaming surface this one full of shiny bars with a bunch of silver cubes beneath and a side surface of solid metal no reason not to have the latest its really big you could almost live in it after a couple of practice runs i thought we might have a barbecue of our own in a few weekends perhaps by practice run i dont guess you mean youre going to drive it somewhere she gave one of its big sturdy wheels a quick testing kick totally under control he crouched opened one of the doors refrigerator unit weve got steaks potatoes some vegetables well put on these skewers we will its just a matter of shoving them on he assumed and a bottle of champagne to christen it though i thought wed drink it rather than whack the unit with the bottle i can get behind that part have you ever cooked a steak he sent her a mild look as he opened the champagne i read the tutorial and i watched how it was done at the miras its hardly rocket science eve meat heat okay she took the glass hed poured for her what happens first i turn it on then according to the timetable in the tutorial the potatoes would go first they take the longest while theyre cooking well sit in the shade the idea of him turning on the monster unit had her taking a cautious step back yeah well ill just get started on the sittingintheshade part several buffering feet away still she loved him so she prepared to leap to his defense if the machine got testy she watched roarke arrange two potatoes on some of the smaller sections of grill fiddle with controls whatever he did had a red light like a single unfriendly eye beam on apparently this pleased him as he closed the lid patted it then pulled a little tray of crackers and cheese out of the lower compartment he looked pretty cute she had to admit carrying the tray crossing the sunny patio in his bare feet with his hair tied back as he often did for serious work she grinned at him popped a cube of cheese in her mouth you put all this together i did very gratifying too he stretched out his legs sipped champagne i dont know why i havent fiddled about in the kitchen before this the umbrella over the table broke the blast of the sun and the champagne was icecold not she decided such a bad deal after a long day so how do you know when the potatoes are done theres a timer it also suggested we might want to jab them with a fork why something to do with doneness i assume itll be selfevident what did you do to your knee never missed a trick she thought some jerk in uniform let an asshole get away from him i used my knee to discourage said asshole from ramming me down the glide now hes crying because his jaw was dislocated and he has a mild concussion knee to jaw sensible howd he get the concussion he says it was from the tube of pepsi i pitched at him but thats bogus i figure he got it when a bunch of cops landed on him you threw your pepsi at him it was handy darling eve he picked up her free hand kissed it ever resourceful that may be but i had to waste time on more paperwork officer cullin is going to rue this day no doubt he poured more champagne and they drank it in the shade when she heard the distant rumble of thunder she lifted her eyebrows glanced toward the grill you may be rained out theres time yet ill just turn it up a bit and put on the steaks fifteen minutes later eve sipped champagne and watched a little burst of flame erupt from one end of the grill since it wasnt the first she was no longer alarmed by it instead she watched roarke fight his new toy curse it in two languages and eye it with frustration when jabbed the potatoes proved to be hard as stone inside their blackened skin the skewered vegetables were burned to a crisp and had been on fire twice the steaks were a sickly gray on one side and black on the other this isnt right he muttered it must be defective he stabbed one of the steaks lifting it off the grill to scowl at it this doesnt appear to be medium rare when the juice dripping from it sparked another pocket of flame he tossed it back on the bars more fire spurted and the machine as it had a number of times before issued a dour warning active fire is neither advisable nor recommended please reprogram within thirty seconds or this unit will go into safety mode as explained in the tutorial and shut down bugger it you bloody bitch how many times do you need to be reprogrammed eve took another hit of champagne and decided not to point out that bitch was inappropriate as the units voice mode was distinctly male men shed observed habitually termed the inanimate objects they cursed by uncomplimentary female names hell she did the same herself a couple of lightning bolts popped in the sky and the thunder rolled closer in one long menacing growl eve felt the first splat of rain in the rising wind she walked over to rescue the bottle of champagne while roarke stared at the grill im thinking pizza she said and started into the house its just a glitch roarke scraped what was left of the food into the units garbage disposal feature this isnt finished he grumbled to it and followed eve into the house ill have another look at it tomorrow he told her you know she crossed to the autochef which was in her opinion the sensible way to cook its sort of nice to see that you can screw up like the rest of us mortals get all sweaty and frustrated and curse out inanimate objects though im not convinced that thing outside is inanimate a factory defect no doubt but he was grinning now ill see to it tomorrow bet you will you want to eat in here thats fine we wont likely eat in the kitchen much after tonight with summerset due home tomorrow she stopped dead the glass halfway to her lips tomorrow that cant be right he just left five minutes ago tomorrow noon he walked over to flick a finger over the dent in her chin its been considerably longer than five minutes make him extend it tell him to he should take a trip around the world in a boat one of those boats you row by hand itll be good for him i offered him more time hes ready to come home well im not ready she threw up her hands he only smiled leaned in and kissed her forehead as he might a childs she huffed out a breath okay then okay but now we have to have sex on the kitchen floor i beg your pardon its on my todo list and we didnt get to it yet so well have to go for it now pizza can wait you have a todo list it was supposed to be spontaneous and uncontrolled but well have to go with what weve got she drained the glass of champagne set it down then released her weapon harness go on strip it off pal a sexual todo list amused fascinated he watched her dump her harness on the counter then start on her boots was that bout we had last week on the dining room table and the floor on your list thats right she pried off a boot kicked it aside let me see the list he held out a hand wiggled his fingers bent over for the second boot she lifted her head its what youd call a mental list she tapped her head all up here youre not stripping i love your mind yeah well lets just get this little chore ticked off then we can she broke off when he swooped her up then dumped her buttfirst on the kitchen counter taking her hair in two fists he yanked her mouth to his and ravished spontaneous enough for you he asked when she sucked in a breath it might be the words tumbled back down her throat when he ripped her shirt open hows that for uncontrolled it was a little hard to comment when her mouth was being assaulted again he yanked what was left of her shirt down to her wrists her hands were trapped tripping an instinctive panic that tangled messily with a spurt of excitement as he tugged the tattered material like a rope her hands were behind her back now and the blood was buzzing in her ears she couldnt seem to draw a full breath the champagne shed drank began to spin giddily in her head and her thigh muscles quivered my hands she managed not yet he was mad for her it seemed he spent his life mad for her the shape and the scent of her the taste and the feel of her and now the sound she made as his hand raced over her he feasted on her skin the lovely rise of her breast with her heart raging under his mouth she moaned again trembled losing herself he knew as he used his tongue his teeth let go there was nothing more arousing to him than when she let go she still couldnt breathe but no longer cared sensations were storming her too brutal too dark to be called something as mild as pleasure she let him take would have begged him to take more if shed had the words when he yanked her pants down her hips she opened for him and those hands those wonderful hands drove her over she cried out as she came as the orgasm flashed through her with such intense heat her head dropped weakly on his shoulder and she managed one word more always his lips were on her hair her cheek then on hers again always his arms came around her and once freed hers around him she locked her legs around his waist and struggled to speak as her breath came in short strained pants were not on the floor well get there he nipped at her shoulder her throat wondered how he could stop himself from simply eating her whole he hitched her off the counter taking her weight as their mouths fused again as heartbeat slammed against heartbeat her hands had worked their way under his shirt her short nails scraping over his damp skin then she tugged it up tugged it off and fixed her teeth on his shoulder god your body mine mine mine they were on the floor pulling at clothes pulling in air as lungs threatened to burst and this time when her legs locked around him he buried himself inside her hot so viciously hot she trapped him there rising up to take more of him dragging him down to follow her his hands slid off her slick skin then found purchase on her hips they dug in while he plunged chapter they were lying on their backs on the floor in a sweaty heap her throat was wild with thirst but she wasnt entirely sure she could swallow just breathing took all the energy she had left as far as spontaneous uncontrolled sex went she thought they had a winner she felt his fingers brush hers and gave him top marks for recovery is there anything left on your todo list he asked softly no her breath whistled in whistled out that cleans it up thank god we have to get up from here before noon tomorrow eve warned i think it has to be sooner im starving she thought it over so am i i dont suppose you could pull one of your macho routines and carry me i dont suppose i was hoping youd carry me well they lay where they were another full minute maybe we can try this together on three then he counted it off on three they managed to pull each other to sitting positions then just sat there grinning that was really good my idea she reminded him and one for the record books wed better try to stand up okay but lets not rush it they staggered to their feet swayed then held each other up like a pair of drunks wow id say i got a little trashed watching you lose a round to that grill but thats not it you trashed me appreciate it my pleasure he rested his head on hers just hold a minute until the blood starts circulating again your blood has a tendency to circulate straight to your dick and i need pizza and a shower she realized a shower then pizza because pal of mine we are a mess all right lets get whats left of these clothes she found the rag of her shirt what used to be her underwear and other assorted apparel together they carried the evidence out of the kitchen and dont think youre going to nail me again in the shower were done he nailed her again in the shower but only because shed brought it up in the first place they ate pizza in the sitting area of the bedroom by the time she was working on the third piece she felt the hollow in her belly might just fill again what did you do today she asked him about what she cocked her head every now and again i like to touch base with what it is you do it reminds me youre not just a pretty sex object ah i see i had meetings he lifted his shoulders as she continued to stare at him most often when i explain what it is i do you get this glassy look in your eye or fall into unconsciousness i do not well okay the glassy look maybe but ive never lost consciousness i had a meeting with my broker we discussed current market trends and i dont need every minute detail broker meeting stocks and bonds and blah blah check what else his lips twitched a conference regarding the olympus resort two new areas are ready to open im expanding the police and security force chief angelo sends her regards right back at her any trouble up there nothing major he washed down pepperoni pizza with champagne darcia wondered when we might be coming back for a visit the next time i pass out and can be dragged into a space shuttle she licked pizza sauce off her finger what else internal staff meeting a number of security checks routine discussion of preliminary reports on a sheep farm in new zealand im considering buying sheep baabaa sheep wool lamb cutlets and other byproducts he passed her a napkin and that made her think of mrs parksy i had an extended business lunch with a couple of developers and their rep whod like me to come aboard their project a massive indoor recreation center in new jersey will you doubtful but it was entertaining to hear them out and eat on their expense account is that enough for you that was just through lunch thats right youre a busy guy is it harder for you to handle all this stuff out of new york than it was when you traveled i still travel not like you used to it used to hold more appeal for me before i had a wife who invited me to nail her on the kitchen floor she smiled but he knew her too well whats troubling you eve she nearly told him about her dream her memory but pulled back from it the subject of mothers had to be sensitive for him yet instead she used work it wasnt an evasion work did trouble her my gut knows who he is already has from the first time i saw him but i cant see him so i dont know for sure not in my head he changes and hell change again so i cant see him not his type or even his mind because that changes too hes good at what he does because he changes because he assumes the personality of what he imitates i dont know if i can stop him isnt that what hes hoping for that hell frustrate you by assuming a different personality different method different victim type all of it so far mission accomplished im trying to separate him from lets say the cloak he wears to see him as he is so ill know if my guts right so i can move from instinct to evidence to arrest and what do you see arrogance intelligence rage focus he has excellent focus fear too i think im wondering if its fear that makes him imitate others instead of striking out in his own way but what does he fear capture failure i think its failure and maybe that fear of failure has its roots in the female authority figure i think you see him more clearly than you give yourself credit for i see the victims she continued the two hes killed already and the shadow of the one wholl be next i dont know who shell be or where or why hell choose her and if i dont figure it out hell get to her before i get to him her appetite was gone as was the euphoria of good sex youre a busy guy roarke she said got a lot on your plate i prefer that to an empty one so do you good thing for us i need to look into my list of suspects i need to find this female authority figure because when i do i find him i could use a hand he took hers squeezed it i happen to have one available the most practical way to begin she thought was alphabetically and though it still scraped the pride a bit to let roarke man the computer he may have gotten spanked by a barbecue grill but on a desk unit he was king well start with breen she told him i want everything i can get on thomas a breen and his wife without trampling on privacy laws he sent her a pained look as he sat at her desk now what fun is that keep it clean ace well then i want coffee and a cookie a cookie yes the cat leaped on the desk to bump his head against roarkes hand you have a cookie cache in here i want one she stuck her hands on her hips tapped her fingers how do you know i have a cache he stroked the cat and smiled at her unsupervised you forget to eat half the time and when you remember you go for the sugar she took some exception to the unsupervised remark but had another priority eyes slit she came closer watched his face as keenly as she would a prime suspect you havent been sneaking into my office at central and riffling my candy stash certainly not i can get my own candy you could be lying she said after a moment youre pretty slippery and so you said in the shower harhar but i dont see you skulking around central lifting my chocolate just to drive me buggy not when i can easily find more convenient ways to do so wheres my coffee okay okay thomas a breen she went into the kitchen off her home office felt the cat ribbon around her legs despite the fact hed had a slice of pizza she programmed a pot of coffee got down mugs then sending a cautious glance toward the office went to the small utility closet and dug into the space behind the cat food for the bag of triple chocolate chunk cookies she started to take one out for roarke decided she could go for one herself then thought what the hell he was helping her out theyd blow what was left in the bag sensing dessert galahad went into serious purrandrub mode she poured a handful of cat treats into his bowl watched him pounce on them like a lion on a gazelle as she loaded the coffee and cookies on a tray initial datas up though i assume you already have the basics roarke said mores coming why are you looking at breen first its standard to run anybody i interview during an investigation she set down the tray im going deeper because he flicked my switch dont know why exactly she walked toward the wall screen where roarke had already brought up the standard data thomas aquinas breen age thirtythree married one child male age two writer and professional father decent reported income he makes a solid living and appears to be on the track to making more one bust for illegals zoner age twentyone college smoke nothing surprising native new yorker nyu grad fine arts with postgrad work in criminology i like that one and creative writing earns his living writing magazine articles short stories and the two published nonfiction books to date both substantial bestsellers married five years both parents living and in florida sounds normal yeah but it wasnt eve thought it wasnt quite the pretty picture it presented got a nice house in a nice neighborhood couldnt afford it on what he made prior to the second hit book but the wife has a highpowered job so you assume they combined incomes as theyve lived there since their second year of marriage he deals with the kid she makes the more regular bucks he sampled a cookie his wife he thought as the chocolate exploded in his mouth had an unerring sweet tooth i have any number of employees with a similar setup there was just something off thats all hard to pin then you add that this guy spends his day thinking about murder reconstructing it with words reading about it imagining it really he poured coffee for both of them who would devote so much time and energy to murder i heard the sarcasm the difference is a murder cops supposed to find murder abhorrent this guy gets off on it not that big a leap between fascination and experimentation hes got the education the flexible schedule the knowledge and a motive if you figure over and above the thrill these murders once it hits the media big will juice up sales of his books his wifes a fashion exec and i bet she knows the value of publicity too studying the screen she rocked back and forth on her heels hes got the paper claims it was a gift from a fan one he doesnt remember no way to prove or disprove yet be interesting if i find out he or his wife bought it though that would be interesting i could smudge those privacy lines a bit see what i can dig up on that it was tempting but eve shook her head it wasnt charged to his or his wifes account not that weve found pushing that angle would mean more than a little smudge well stick to the bio for now spoilsport he has the paper and thats enough he has it and he let me see it thats interesting enough for now if hes your man wouldnt the wife know seems to me unless shes an idiot her bio doesnt read idiot to me julietta gates same age another nyu grad bet they met in college fashion and public relations double major she had her path mapped out and shes moved right along it minimal break for birthing then back to work made double what he did up until two years ago and still pulls in about the same annually and more regularly wonder how their financials are set up what are you looking for who runs the show moneys power right i bet she calls the shots in that household if thats the criterion i feel im not as fully in charge as i should be around here too bad for you i dont give a damn about your money i bet tom cares about hers she brought him the house the child the feeling of the home back into her mind needs her share to run that nice house raise the kid the way he wants until he rises up another level in his own line good clothes good toys good childcare droid as backup while he works at his own pace so he can take time off to play horsey with his son take him to the park and those marks of a good father make him a murder suspect as im following you im afraid that makes us a very cynical pair she glanced over her shoulder just to look at him cynical or not she reflected they were a pair he never talked about her as a partner or as one of the points of the family triangle you saw his stuff and the boys lying around toys shoes and so on but nothing of hers interesting thats all interesting that theyre not a unit bring up the parental data she scanned it filling in the blanks from the bare essentials shed studied earlier see the mothers the alpha dog here too important career the main wage earner father retired from his job to take over as professional parent and look here mom served as an officer including president of the international womens coalition and is a contributing editor to the feminist voice an nyu alum while dad went to kent state yeah thats interesting scenario being breen grew up in a femaledominant household controlled by a woman with strong ideas and a political bent while his father changed the nappies and so forth the mother pushed him to study at her alma mater or he did so to gain her approval and when choosing a mate he selected another strong personality who would control his world while he took the more historically typical female role of nurturer yeah which doesnt make him a whackedout psychopath but its something to consider copy and file the data here and to my unit at central he smiled as he did so it appears ive selected a strong personality as well what does that say about me i wonder please she added and remembering the cookies walked over to take one ill have a facetoface with julietta gates tomorrow meanwhile lets move on to fortney leo fortney was thirtyeight and had two marriages two divorces no offspring with roarkes quick work and his understanding of what she wanted she read that his first wife had been a minor vid star in the porn category the marriage had lasted just over a year the second was a successful theatrical agent theres some buzz here roarke added the juicy gossip sort from media reports you want them up or do you want the highlights start with the highlights it appears leo was a very bad boy roarke sipped coffee as he read from his own screen got caught with his pants down literally in a hotel suite in new la entertaining a pair of wellendowed starlets besides the two naked nubile starlets thats a quote by the way there were rumors that considerable chemical enhancements and appliances of a sexual nature were also involved obviously suspecting something of the sort his wife had a pi on him he was skinned to the bone in the divorce and endured considerable snickering publicity as several other women were happy to talk to the media about their experiences with the hapless leo one is quoted as saying hes a walking hardon always coming on and usually petering out at the sticking point ouch sexually promiscuous unable to maintain and embarrassed publicly by a woman got a sheet with a couple of sexual assaults and an indecent exposure i like it and look at his financials no way he can maintain the lifestyle he wants on what he pulls in he needs a woman currently pepper franklin to keep him i dont like him roarke muttered continuing to read she deserves better he hit on peabody he looked up now a dark gleam in his eye i really dont like him did he move on you nah hes scared of me at least he isnt completely brainless then what he is is an egosoaked liar who likes to take bimbos to bed peabody played up the bimbo angle on him and use stronger women to take care of him then cheat on them hes educated knows how to put on a polished front likes the good life including highdollar writing paper is theatrical enough to enjoy the imitation route and has the necessary freedom to troll and hunt what have we got on his parents family background onscreen you can see his mothers an actress largely supporting roles character parts i actually know some of her work shes good stays busy had leo with husband number two out of five ill say she stays busy so hes got a number of step and halfsibs fathers a theatrical broker same as leo somebody who puts projects together right mmm there you go there are snippets of gossip here too he was scanning quickly on this first pass looking for buzz words our man wouldve been six when his parents divorced both having very public affairs during the marriage and afterward his mother also claimed the father was physically abusive then again he claimed the same about her reading bits and pieces here it sounds as if the household was a war zone so add a violent childhood and potential parental neglect moms a public figure which makes her powerful they probably had household staff right maids gardeners fulltime childcare you could see what you could dig up on who looked after little leo while you display the renquists for me then im having another cookie she glanced back as he spoke ready to make some sarcastic comment but the look of him just the look of him sitting there at her desk his hair shining from the shower his eyes vivid and focused on the screen had her heart tripping ridiculous it was ridiculous she knew what he looked like and he could still turn her inside out without even trying he must have sensed her stare as he shifted his eyes met hers an absurdly handsome man with a cookie in his hand i think i deserve it her mind blanked what the cookie he said and took a bite then he cocked his head what nothing vaguely embarrassed she turned around again and ordered her heart to settle back down time she told herself to move to the next renquist niles she thought selfimportant snotty bastard but that was just personal opinion time for facts hed been born in london to a society deb who was half brit half yank fourth cousin to the king on her mothers side and tons of money on her fathers his father was lord renquist a member of parliament and a staunch conservative one younger sister whod settled in australia with husband number two renquist had the full british educational package the stonebridge school to eton eton to edinburgh university served two years in the raf as commissioned officer rank of captain fluent in italian and french and joined the diplomatic corps at age thirty the same year as his marriage to pamela elizabeth dysert she had a similar background and education wellplaced parents highclass education which had included six years at a boarding school in switzerland she was an only child and had considerable money of her own they were eve supposed what people of that class would call a good match eve remembered the little girl whod come to the steps while shed been questioning pamela renquist the little pinkandgold doll rose whod given the nannys hand one impatient tug before falling in no not nanny shed called her the au pair people of that ilk always had a fancy name for everything wouldnt renquist have had an au pair growing up his schedule daytime wasnt as flexible as the others but would an assistant or admin question him if he told them to block out a couple of hours she studied the id image of renquist onscreen and doubted it no criminal on him or the wife no little smudges as there had been with breen and fortney just a perfect picture all polished and shiny she didnt buy it he hadnt married until thirty she thought a reasonable age if you were going the till death route plus a man with political ambitions did better in the field if he presented the package of wife and family but unless hed taken a vow of celibacy thered have been other relationships before the marriage and maybe after it it might be worth having a conversation with the current au pair who knew family dynamics better than livein help she went back for more coffee you could shoot up the data on carmichael smith do you want that before the data on the fortney nanny youve got that already what can i say i earn my cookies fortney first smart guy lets keep it ordered difficult as it appears there were several childcare providers used it appears his mother chewed through them like gumdrops baby nurses au pairs whatever seven total over a period of just under ten years none stayed on the job longer than two years with an average stay of six months doesnt seem long enough to have any serious impact so my thought would be the mother remained the authority figure and from this data one assumes an incendiary one three of the former employees filed hardship suits against her all were settled out of court im going to have to take a closer look at the mother she paced back and forth in front of the screen while she ran it through her head leo has a mother whos an actress and his current lover is in the same profession he goes into a profession where hell deal with actors have some control over them be controlled i imagine by them that says something the killer is acting assuming a role and proving he can play the part better than the original and with more finesse when i run a probability with this data its going to come out high on leo she considered lets go down the list before we do another layer find me renquists nanny or whatever they call them over in england roberta janet gable roarke announced then smiled im multitasking usually do she replied then looked up at the image onscreen man eve gave a mock shudder scary this is current shed have been considerably younger when working for renquists mother but having anticipated her roarke called up the earlier photo still scary ill say she studied the splitscreen images of a thin face with dark deepset eyes and an unsmiling mouth the hair was brown in the younger gray in the current and in both cases pulled severely back the lines that bracketed the nononsense mouth on the earlier image had dug themselves into disapproving grooves on the older woman i bet nobody called her bobbie eve commented she started to struggle with the math and could only be grateful roarke had gotten there before her she took the job when renquist was two and held it until he was fourteen he didnt board at stonebridge but was a day student headed off to eton at fourteen and no longer required the services of a nanny roberta dont call me bobbie would have been twentyeight when she took the position and forty when she left it to take another position as private childcare provider shes now sixtyfour and has recently retired never married nor had any offspring of her own she looks like she pinches eve commented one of the providers at the state school was a pincher shes got all the credentials but so did that bitch who decorated my arms with bruises when i was ten born in boston and went back there when she retired yeah thats a new england bedrock face the kind that says shit like spare the rod spoil the child she could be an unfortunatelooking woman with a heart of gold who keeps sugarplums in her pocket to pass out to rosycheeked children looks like a pincher eve said again and sat on the edge of the desk financially solid i bet she saved her pennies and didnt squander them on sugarplums what is a sugarplum anyway he was thinking of eve at ten with bruises on her arms ill buy you some youll like them odds are i think well chat and see what she has to say about renquists early childhood training lets see the annoying mr smith come sit on my lap she tried a severe look but couldnt come close to roberta gables expression therell be no hanky or panky during a work session as there was hanky on the kitchen floor followed by panky in the shower i think we can shelve that activity come sit on my lap he sent her a persuasive smile im lonely she did it and tried not to soften too much when his lips brushed her hair carmichael smith he said but he was still thinking of the child shed been at the mercy of the system she now stood for and wanted more than anything to lavish her with everything shed done without especially love thirtyone my ass i bet he greased some palms to have that stat adjusted born in savannah but spent part of his childhood in england no sibs and his mother opted for professional parent status right up until his eighteenth birthday sealed juvie record here and abroad which might be worth the hassle of breaking not rolling in as much dough as he should be considering must have himself some high expenses or habits parents divorced father remarried and moved permanently to devon england right the last i checked yes no adult criminal but i bet theres something something paid off or expunged looks like hes done some time in a couple of snazzy rehab facilities lets have a closer look at the mother suzanne smith age fiftytwo young when he was born roarke commented and the marriage took place nearly two years later attractive woman yeah he looks like her some well lookie here mommy had an lc license for a while street level and shes got herself a sheet intrigued eve started to rise but roarke clamped his arms around her waist if you cant see the screen from here i can put the data on audio nothing wrong with my eyes looks like she did some grifting and got caught with illegals tried a little minor fraud pleaded them all down she added never served time rolled on somebody i bet held on to the license after she applied for pp status but claimed no income just kept it off the books thats all she was still turning why pay the fee if youre not going to turn tricks so little carmichaels sex education was likely early and handson she considered put herself in the scenario let me see his medicals she asked as far back as you can find am i smudging now she hesitated but her instincts were humming keep it to a minimum he gave her hip a little pat signaling her up so he could work while he did she poured the last of the coffee standard exams and inoculations as an infant roarke said he appeared to become accidentprone at about two yeah i see she scanned the various reports from various doctors different health centers stitches minor fractures one fairly serious burn dislocated shoulder a broken finger she knocked him around eve noted the abuse continued after the divorce and right up until he hit the teen years and probably got too big for her to risk it so it was the mother the female authority figure she moved around enough to get away with it relocating here and there in the states doing some time in england and look at her earned income roarke as opposed to her assets the first is all but nil while the second is very comfortable yeah id say shes still sucking on her little boy guys bound to resent that sort of thing maybe enough to kill chapter eve had very rational reasons for starting her shift in her home office it was quiet of course anything compared to the division at central including an arena ball match was quiet she needed more thinking time she wanted to set up a murder board here as well so she could stare at it and study it whenever she was in the room and the numberone reason for loitering there rather than heading straight downtown was the expected arrival of summerset she intended to be well away before noon but she wanted to brood just a while over the fact that once she left the house today he would have reclaimed the field upon her return so she set up her board sat put her feet up on her desk and drinking coffee studied it there were crimescene photos the chinatown alley the gregg bedroom there were maps and the notes left onscene victim photos before and after with them she pinned copies of the original crime scenes these were based on whitechapel and boston and two of those victims that most closely matched hers hed studied those too she thought stared at those old photographs read those old reports hed be studying others now refreshing himself preparing for the next act she had the lab reports the mes the sweepers she had statements from witnesses next of kin suspects neighbors she had the timelines she had her own notes her own reports and now a mountain of background data on those who remained on her short list she would go over them all again and she would do more legwork more interviews shed dig deeper wider but he would beat her to the next her gut told her hed beat her in the short run and someone else would die before she caught up hed made mistakes she sipped coffee and stared at the board the notes were a mistake that was pride and a kind of glee he had a need not only to toot his own horn but to do it with a flourish notice me see how smart i am see what excellent taste i have but the paper could be traced could give her a list of names to pursue the basket of peaches was another that was arrogance i can walk right out of here leaving the brutalized dead behind and eat a nice ripe peach there might be other mistakes she would pick everything apart until she found them he would make other mistakes because however smart he was he was cocky she looked toward the open door when she heard the sound of footfalls and her forehead creased hey she said as feeney walked in the neatly pressed shirt told her his wife had handed it to him out of the closet the brokenin shoes said hed gotten away from her before mrs feeney could nag him into putting on a less disreputable pair hed probably combed his hair but it was already frizzing out in its usual wiry thatch of ginger and silver there was a little nick on his chin because he claimed a man couldnt shave proper unless he used an actual razor got your message he said it was late thats why i dumped it to voice mail i didnt mean for you to come around this morning go out of your way its only out of my way if there arent any danishes back there probably are if not there somewhere else taking that as invitation he walked back to the kitchen she could hear him scanning the menu giving a grunt of approval as he found something that pleased him calling it up he came back in with a pastry and an enormous mug of coffee so he said and sat studying the board as she had hes two for two yeah and im batting zero clipped the ball a couple times but it keeps curving foul once he hits again the medias going to pick up the scent and well have a holy mess on our hands deadly mimic stalking new york chameleon killer baffles police they love that shit feeney scratched his cheek ate more pastry public does too sick bastards ive got a lot of data a lot of angles thing is i pull one line and six more drop down i can push whitney for more manpower but you know how it goes i keep it low profile and the budget only stretches so far once it breaks and people start screaming politics come into play and i can stretch it further edds got more manpower more funds he finished ive got no direct need for edd on this the research and runs are standard stuff nothing fancy ive got no links or security to probe but my boys can always use the practice feeney called his detectives and drones boys no matter how their skin was shaped id appreciate it it would free me up for interviews and fieldwork i started thinking last night this guy hes careful and hes precise look at the vic photos the old ones and his positioning basic build and coloring of the vics method of death everything theyre good copies careful copies so how do you get so good feeney polished off the danish gulped coffee you practice ill run that myself through ircca see if we get a pop it wont be exact she said grateful ive got a hit on the first and its not exact but when i did the run i was only looking for the one style now weve got two styles and the potential for others hes too careful for an exact match he might do it that way but hed change it after wouldnt leave the scene precisely as he intended to leave the ones hed make public doesnt want to show off until hes got it down to a science feeney said with a nod yeah any that were exact hed get rid of the bodies bury them dump them but hes not a kid not twenty hes mature and he didnt start killing with wooton hes been at this a while ill work both styles and whatever else you think he might go for everybody on my short list but one i havent pinned yet she said thinking of breen travels the states europe especially they get around and they get around well firstclass if hes on that short list the worlds been his fucking playground send me the files thanks i should tell you there are some sensitive names on my list weve got a diplomat a wellknown entertainer a writer making a name for himself and an asshole entertainment broker whos hooked up with a topname actress thereve already been complaints of police harassment and blah blah therell be more he grinned now this sounds like fun he pushed to his feet set his empty cup aside and rubbed his hands together lets get started once feeney left she organized the files sent them to his unit in edd noted the action in a memo to the commander she ran another spurt of probabilities toyed with some simulations but they were really no more than an exercise to let her mind work by the time she was done the computer and she agreed on a list of prototypes her killer might emulate next she eliminated any who had worked with a partner or targeted males any who concealed or destroyed the bodies and highlighted any whose notoriety had outlived them she was just beginning to wonder where peabody was when one of the domestic droids came to her door the droids always spooked her roarke rarely used them and she rarely saw them in the house she would have withstood any manner of hideous torture before admitting she actually preferred the fleshandblood summerset to the automated staff excuse me for interrupting lieutenant dallas the droid was female with a husky voice the dignified black uniform did nothing to disguise the fact shed been built to rival a porn star eve figured she didnt have to be a trained investigator to deduce her amused husband had activated this one purposefully just so she could compare the bigtitted blonde to the bonyassed summerset shed have to pay him back for this one eventually whats the problem there is a visitor at the gate a ms pepper franklin who wishes to speak with you are you available sure shes saving me a trip is she alone she has arrived in a private car with driver but she has no companion left fortney at home eve thought let her in shall i bring her up no show her into the what is it the front parlor would you care for refreshments ill let you know thank you lieutenant when the droid backed out of the room eve drummed her fingers for a moment she glanced at the door that adjoined her home office with roarkes probably just as well he was off doing what he did all day it would keep the social portion of this visit to a minimum deliberately she strapped on her weapon harness left the jacket where shed hung it over the back of her chair a notsosubtle way eve decided to let pepper know she was on the job then she finished off her coffee sat and hummed for another couple of minutes when she went down to the parlor pepper was waiting the actress was dressed in perfect summer style a breezy white blouse over a thin blue tank that matched the cropped pants shed added heeled sandals that made eves arches ache and had bundled her masses of gilt hair in some complicated updo eve caught her scent something cool and floral as she crossed the room i appreciate you seeing me pepper flashed her professional smile and so early in the day im homicide my day starts when yours ends at peppers blank look eve shrugged sorry little cop joke what can i do for you i take it roarkes not home no if you want to see him you might be able to catch him in midtown no no actually id hoped to catch you alone could we sit sure eve gestured to a chair took one of her own pepper rested her hands on the arms of the deep chair sighed as she scanned the room this remains the most incredible home ive ever seen such wonderful style but then it would have to be since its roarkes keeps the rain off pepper laughed its been some time since ive been here but i recall a formidable manservant rather than the splashy domestic droid who let me in summerset hes on vacation hell be back later today unless hes captured by desperados and held for ransom or falls madly in love with a young nudist and moves to borneo summerset yes of course youre not here to see him either no pepper nodded my motive for coming is a womantowoman thing i know you saw leo again yesterday he was very upset by it feels hounded and that you have some sort of personal grudge against him i dont have a personal grudge against him even if hes a killer it wouldnt be personal its my job to hound people maybe it is but the fact is there is a personal connection here through me through roarke i wanted to address that frankly with you go ahead eve invited pepper sat a bit straighter in her chair folded her hands neatly in her lap youre aware im sure that roarke and i had a relationship at one time i can certainly understand how you might feel uncomfortable or irritated by this but it was several years ago before he met you id hate for any annoyance or resentment however understandable it might be to influence your attitude toward leo eve let the silence hang for a moment let me see if i have this straight youre wondering if because you and roarke rolled around naked a few years ago im personally pissed off and because im pissed off about it im giving the guy youre currently rolling around naked with a rough time pepper opened her mouth shut it again then delicately cleared her throat before speaking in a nutshell let me ease your mind on this score ms franklin if i were to get personally pissed off about every woman roarke banged id spend my life in a perpetual state of annoyance you were one of many eve lifted her left hand tapped her wedding ring with her thumbnail im the only you dont worry me for a moment pepper did nothing but stare then she blinked very slowly and the corners of her mouth twitched thats very sensible lieutenant and a very clever way to slap me back at the same time yeah i thought so but in any case there is no other case roarke and i were grownups when we met what happened before doesnt mean dick to me and if i let petty jealousies interfere with or influence my work i wouldnt deserve my badge i deserve my badge i bet you do pepper replied just as i bet you deserve roarke too hes the most fascinating man ive ever known just like his house full of color and style and surprises but he didnt love me and never pretended he did and leo does love you leo leo needs me and thats enough i have to say it sounds to me like youre selling yourself short thats nice of you but im no prize lieutenant im selfish and demanding she gave a light amused laugh and i like that about me i expect to be given my own time and space when i require it and any man in my life must understand that my work is the priority if he does and hes loyal needing me is enough leos weak i know that she continued with an elegant little shrug maybe i need a weak man maybe thats why i couldnt hang on to roarke for more than a few weeks leo suits me and being weak lieutenant is just one more reason he cant be the man youre looking for then neither of you have anything to worry about he lied during our initial interview someone lies to me im going to wonder why her face softened in a way that told eve whatever she said about need being enough she loved leo fortney you frightened him thats natural isnt it for someone to be frightened when theyre questioned by the police especially about a murder you werent pepper blew out a breath all right leo has trouble with the truth occasionally but hed never hurt anyone not seriously can you tell me where he was on sunday morning peppers lips firmed and her eyes stayed direct i cant i can only tell you where he said he was and hes already told you that lieutenant dont you think id know if i was living with sleeping with if i were intimate with a murderer i cant say you may want to tell him that if he wants to get clear of this he can start being straight with me as long as he has trouble with the truth im going to keep looking at him ill talk to him she got to her feet thanks for seeing me no problem eve walked her to the door and opening it saw the waiting car and her aide huffing down the drive on foot officer what was her name pepper asked peabody oh yes officer peabody looks to have had a difficult morning already that storm last night cooled things off a bit but not enough not nearly enough yet last gasp of summer in new york what else can you expect teach me to stay in london she offered her hand id still love for you and roarke to come to the play just contact me anytime and ill arrange for seats soon as things cool off for me a bit well take you up on it she watched the driver get out open the rear door of the small town limo and waited until a breathless and sweaty peabody rushed up the steps sir sorry overslept then the subway breakdown shouldve contacted you but didnt realize inside before you fall over with heatstroke i think im a little dehydrated peabodys face was lobsterred and starting to drip can i have a minute splash some water on my face go christ next time take a cab she called out as she jogged upstairs to get her jacket and what she needed for the day she grabbed two bottles of water from her kitchen and met peabody coming out of the powder room her aides color had calmed down her uniform was straightened her hair neatly combed and dry again thanks peabody took the water and glugged at the bottle to add to the water shed slurped up in the powder room hate to oversleep i was up late studying didnt i tell you that you can overstudy you wont do yourself any good going into the exam burned out i just gave it a couple hours wanted to make up the time i took checking out apartments with mcnab i didnt realize we had a meet with pepper franklin we didnt she stopped by to defend fortney eve headed out the door and around to the garage she hadnt thought to tell one of the droids to have her car brought out in front summerset did it without her asking the fact that it was the sort of detail that slipped her mind and never slipped his just annoyed her well at least i know im not losing my mind peabody managed as she quickened her pace to match eves so much going on right now jesus dallas we signed a lease its a good space got an extra bedroom we can set up as a shared office and its close to central its in your old building so mavis and leonardo will be neighbors and thats mag and it was really great of roarke to put us on to it but but what i signed a lease with mcnab its like huge were going to be moving in together in thirty days eve coded into the garage waited for the doors to open i thought you were already cohabitating yeah but informally real informally he just hangs at my place most of the time this is the real deal i got the jitters she pressed a hand to her stomach as she walked to eves police issue so i dove into studying as soon as we got back then i got the jitters from that then i couldnt sleep because of the jitters so i jumped mcnab to sort of remind myself why im doing this and that took a while because you know i was pretty jittery i dont want to hear that part right well i didnt settle down until pretty late and was so conked i mustve deactivated the alarm before i was fully awake next thing i knew it was an hour later if you got up an hour late why are you only she checked her wrist unit fifteen minutes behind i skipped some of my usual morning stuff was okay until the subway breakdown that threw me off and now ive got the jitters again you can just forget about jumping me to take your mind off them look peabody if youre not prepped for the exam by now youre not going to be that doesnt do a lot to calm me down she brooded out the window as eve drove through the gates i dont want to tank embarrass myself you shut up youre giving me the damn jitters youre not going to embarrass anybody youre going to do your best and its going to be good enough now pull yourself together so i can brief you on smith before we talk to him again listening making her own notes peabody shook her head none of this stuff is in his official biographical data or on any of the unofficial fan sites i dont get it guys a total publicity hound and he likes to go for the heartstrings so why not play up how he came from an abusive home overcame it and believes in the power of love chachacha chachacha eve repeated i can think of a couple reasons first it doesnt fit his image strong handsome romantic male of the socleanisqueak variety doesnt mesh with the poverty level physically abused son of a parttime lc whos still tapping him for money i get that but you could play that angle and sell discs out the yang yang does that go with chachacha eve wondered okay yeah it might make some women feel sorry for him even respect him and plunk down the price of a disc but thats not what he wants what does he want peabody asked though she thought she was beginning to connect the dots its not money thats just a handy byproduct he wants adulation hero worship and fantasy he boinks young groupies because theyre less likely to be critical and he plays to older women because theyre more forgiving and he surrounds himself with female staff because he needs to be taken care of by women because he wasnt taken care of by the woman who should have done so when he was a kid thats how it shakes for me eve turned a corner and swung around a maxibus that was lumbering its contingent of commuters to their hives and cubes the public image doesnt want to have to overcome anything but just to be the man of your dreams isnt some kid who got knocked around by his mother after she turned a trick or i should say his view of the man of your dreams isnt hes built himself into an image and he has to stick with it so theoretically the pressure of concealing all that his resentment and the cycle of violence could have caused him to snap and snapping he killed two parts of the person who abused him the lc and the mother now youre thinking it was kind of like a sim peabody thought she was a little slow but she hoped she was picking her way through it you said a couple reasons whats another another is he just wants to bury it put it away this isnt relevant to his life now thats what he tells himself hes wrong its always part of the whole but its private its one thing he doesnt want chewed over by a lipsmacking public peabody slid her gaze toward eve but there was nothing to read on her lieutenants face so he could just be an abuse survivor whos made a successful life for himself despite all the trauma and the violence youre feeling sorry for him yeah maybe not enough to spring for a disc she added with a chuckle but maybe some he didnt ask to be hurt and by the one person who should have been looking out for him most of all i dont know what its like to have a parent turn on you like that mine well youve met mine my mom she can pin your ears back with a look but shed never have hurt any of us and my parents may be nonviolent new agers but you can believe theyd have ripped into anybody who tried to hurt us thats what i know peabody added but its not all i know because ive seen the other side handling double ds before i transferred to you just being on the streets in uniform and what ive worked on since ive been in homicide nothing wipes the allamerican family image out of a cops head faster than their first couple of domestic disturbances one of the best reasons to be off patrol peabody agreed with feeling what im saying is ive seen what it can be like and its toughest on the kids everythings always toughest on the kids some get over it under it through it others dont and another theory on smith is he feeds on the female adulation in one part of his life and revels in it meanwhile he considers them whores and bitches and he kills them in the most vicious and theatrical way he can devise i guess thats a pretty decent theory either way hes not going to like me throwing his background up in his face so be ready taking eve at her word peabody rested a hand on her stunner as they walked from the vehicle to smiths front door not that ready peabody lets try to play nice first they were admitted by the same woman and walked into the same music at least eve thought it was the same how could you tell she wondered when everything the guy sang had the same sugar rush to it before they could be led into the room with floor cushions and the fluffy white kitten eve laid a hand on the womans arm any place in here have actual chairs lis mouth turned down in disapproval but she nodded of course come this way please she showed them into a room with wide deep chairs done in pale gold accented with tables of clear glass on one table was a small fountain where blue water burbled over smooth white rocks another held a white box filled with white sand where some linear patterns had been drawn with eve assumed the little rake that lay beside it the curtains were closed but when they entered the room the rim of the tables illuminated please be comfortable li gestured to the chairs carmichael will be with you in just a moment ignoring her eve studied a mood screen soft pastels dripped down in this one melting from pinks into blues into golds into pinks again smiths voice crooned in the background i already feel queasy eve muttered i shouldve pressed to have him come into central where things are normal i heard you dislocated some mopes jaw yesterday peabody kept her face sober some people dont consider that actually normal in the daytoday some people dont know diddly she turned back as smith made his entrance how nice to see you both again he made a flowing movement with his arms to indicate chairs it had the wide sleeves of his shirt fluttering were having something cool and citrus i hope youll enjoy it he arranged himself in a chair as one of his staff placed a tray on a long glass table im told youve been trying to get in touch he continued as he poured liquid from pitcher to glasses i cant imagine why but must apologize for being unavailable your rep called my commander eve said so i imagine you have some idea another apology forthcoming he picked up one of the glasses held it in both of his handsome hands my agent is overprotective which naturally is his job just the idea that the media could get wind that id spoken to you regarding such a terrible matter worries him i told him i trusted you to be absolutely discreet but he shrugged elegantly sipped im not looking for publicity im looking for a murderer you wont find one here this is a place of peace and tranquility peace and tranquility eve nodded watching his face id guess that sort of things important to you vital as it should be to everyone the world is a canvas and on it is painted great beauty all we have to do is look peace and tranquility and beauty are more vital to someone who grew up without them to a man who was systematically and regularly abused as a child battered and beaten do you pay your mother to keep quiet about it or just to keep her away the glass in smiths hand shattered and a thin line of blood dripped down his palm chapter shards of glass hitting the floor had in eves opinion a more interesting musical note than the continued coo of smiths recorded voice she doubted any of his fans would recognize him now with all the negative energy twisting his face his bloody hand still clenched the shattered drinking glass she could hear his labored breaths before he sprang to his feet she got to her own slowly and prepared to deflect any assault but he simply threw his head back like a great dog about to bay and howled out for li she came on the run bare feet slapping the floor and filmy robes flapping the air oh carmichael oh you poor thing youre bleeding should i call the doctor should i call an ambulance she patted her own cheeks in rapid tattats while tears welled in his eyes he held out his bleeding hand do something jesus eve stepped forward grabbed his injured hand twisted it over to take a look at the cut get a towel some water antiseptic bandages its not deep enough to worry the mts but his hands his beautiful hands carmichael is an artist yeah well hes an artist with a cut across his palm no puncture peabody got a handkerchief right here lieutenant taking it eve wrapped the cut while li raced off probably to call up a cosmetic surgeon sit down carmichael youre barely scratched you have no right no right to come into my home and upset me this way no right no decency you cant come here upset the balance threaten me i dont recall threatening you and ive got a pretty good memory for that kind of thing officer peabody did i threaten mr smith no sir you did not you think because i live an ordered and privileged life i dont know the darker corners his lips curled now and he held his injured hand to his heart in a loose fist you want to extort money from me payment to keep quiet about matters that are none of your business women like you always want to be paid women like me you think youre better than men you use your wiles or your sex to control them to suck them dry youre nothing but animals bitches and cunts you deserve to deserve to what eve prompted when he stopped himself when she watched the war for composure rage over his face to suffer to die to pay you wont put words in my mouth he collapsed in the chair again holding his hand by the wrist and rocking as if for comfort li rushed back in carrying a fluffy white towel a bottle of water and what looked to be enough bandage to wrap an entire squadron after a bloody battle let my aide take care of it eve told him shes just going to mess it up and hurt you considerably while shes at it smith nodded curtly and turned his head away from peabody and the blood li please go out now close the door but carmichael i want you to go she blinked at the slap in his voice and fled how did you learn about her he asked eve its my job to learn about things it could ruin me you know my audience doesnt want to know about that sort of they dont want the unseemly the unattractive they come to me for beauty for romantic fantasy not for the ugliness of reality im not interested in your audience or in making any information public until and unless it applies to my case i told you im not interested in publicity everyone is he retorted think what you like it doesnt change why im here your mother was an lc she was abusive to you yes you support her financially as long as shes taken care of she stays away and out of my life shes smart enough to know that coming forward selling her story might net her some quick money but it would kill the golden goose if my income suffers so does hers i explained this to her very carefully before the first payment was made your relationship with your mother is adversarial we dont have a relationship i prefer not to think of the connection it unbalances my chi jacie wooton was an lc who wooton the woman who was murdered in chinatown it has nothing to do with me more composed now he waved it all away with his uninjured hand i also choose not to dwell on the darker shades of the world a second woman was murdered on sunday the mother of a grown son he flashed her a look now and there was a hint of fear in it that doesnt have anything to do with me either i survived violence i dont perpetuate it victims of abuse often become abusive children who were beaten often become violent adults sometimes a killer is born sometimes he is made a woman hurt you a woman who had control over you authority over you she hurt you for years when you were helpless to stop her how do you make her pay for that pain for that humiliation for all the years you lived in fear i dont shell never pay her type never pays she wins again and again every time i send her money she wins again tears tracked down his cheeks now she wins because youre standing there pushing her into my head again my life is not an illusion because i made it i created it i wont let you come into it and try to shatter it to smear it empathy rolled into her stomach his words the passion behind them could have been her own you have a home here and one in london yes yes yes what of it he jerked his hand and glanced down at the tug of peabodys when his gaze landed on the bloody cloth his face went white as bone go away cant you go away tell me where you were sunday morning i dont know how can i remember everything i have people to take care of me im entitled to be taken care of i give pleasure i take pleasure i deserve it sunday morning carmichael between eight and noon here right here sleeping meditating detoxifying i cant live with stress i need my quiet times were you alone im never alone shes in every closet under every bed waiting in the next room to strike out i lock her away but it doesnt mean she isnt waiting she hurt looking at him understanding the words she hurt did you leave the house on sunday morning i dont remember did you know lois gregg i know so many people so many women they love me women love me because im perfect because i dont threaten them because they dont know that i know what they are under it all did you kill lois gregg i have nothing more to say to you im going to call my attorneys now i want you to leave my home li he put his injured hand behind his back as he rose swaying a little he stepped carefully to the side away from the bloodsmeared towel li make them go away he ordered as she hurried into the room again make them leave i have to lie down now i dont feel well i need my quiet room there now there cooing she put an arm around his waist took his weight ill take care of everything dont you worry poor baby dont you worry she shot a vicious look at eve over her shoulder as she led smith from the room i want you gone when i get back if not your superior will hear about this eve pursed her lips listening to lis voice fade as she cooed smith away guys got some serious problems peabody commented yeah maybe he thinks he can cover it up with meditation herb drinks and mindnumbing music eve shrugged maybe he can he couldnt look at the blood she added studying the towel made him sick to see blood hard to do what was done to those two women if blood makes you sick then again maybe its just the sight of his own blood that does it she checked the time as they left the house were running a little early yeah peabody perked right up then maybe we could hit a cart or a i missed breakfast not that early when peabodys face fell eve sighed you know i hate that kickedpuppy look whatever we pass first and you have one minute to do the transaction which will include getting me coffee deal they hit a cart so peabody settled for a scrambled egg wrap that eve assumed tasted better than it smelled the coffee didnt but that was par were going to talk to breens wife i got a hassle when i called her office for her schedule so i pulled in the reserves peabodys response was an eggsubstitutefilled mumble she swallowed im supposed to arrange the appointments youre going to bitch because i cut you a break no but she had to fight the pout i dont want you to think i cant fulfill my duties because ive got all this stuff going on if i have a complaint about your work peabody youll be the first to know thats a given peabody muttered and took a slug of her orangeflavored energy drink you said reserves julietta does fashion i happen to know somebody in the fashion forefront ms gates schedule miraculously cleared when she got a call from leonardos main squeeze you tagged mavis mag its not a girl outing peabody its a murder investigation silver linings sir i like a nice silver lining peabody washed down egg substitute with reconstituted citrus product i cant wait to tell her were going to be neighbors at least until she has the baby i guess theyre going to want a bigger place why how much room could a baby take up its not the baby so much its all the stuff you got your crib your changing table your activity center your diaper unit your never mind jeez it gave her the mild weirds just to think about it it was really smart to horn in using mavis i have my moments of course you couldve just told them you were mrs roarke and theyd have bowed to you i dont want them to bow to me i just want a damn interview and dont call me mrs roarke just saying cheerful now peabody polished off the wrap boy nothing like a good breakfast to lift your mood its not such a big deal getting a place with mcnab its just another step in an evolving relationship right how the hell do i know fastidiously peabody dug out a wipe for her fingers and made a mental note to replace the bloody handkerchief shed left at smiths well when you moved in with roarke you didnt get all stupid and nervous and knotted up there was a long pause a long silence you did peabodys head thunked back on the seat thats so great it makes me feel so much better if you can get all screwed up over moving in with the god of men into that palace its okay for me to get wigged about moving to an apartment with mcnab its okay now that weve solved that thorny dilemma maybe we can concentrate on the case i just have one more question when did you get over it i mean how long did it take for you to feel normal about hooking up with roarke living in the same space and all that ill let you know when it happens wow thats she thought it over and a dreamy smile bloomed on her face thats sweet please shut up before i have to hurt you dallas you said please youre mellowing insults eve grumbled all i get are insults mrs roarke sweet mellowing well see how mellow i am when i stuff your head up your ass and shes back peabody announced and rode in contented silence you could always count on mavis eve thought for a favor for a laugh for a shoulder and most of all for sheer surprise being four months pregnant hadnt depleted her energy or affected her bent for fashion risks at least eve assumed they were risks as nobody absolutely nobody looked quite like mavis freestone shed gone for summer pastels for her hair in any case and had swooped it up in some sort of snaky twists that twined gleaming hunks of blue and pink and greens together they were anchored here and there with lavender pins in the shapes of what eve took for tiny flowers until she got a closer look and realized they were naked babies curled into the embryonic position talk about the weirds a dozen thin chains of gold and silver dangled from each ear on each chain colorful balls hung that clanged together every time she moved which meant constantly her tiny body was decked out in a skirt the size of a table napkin matched with a swingy vest both in white and both covered with tiny question marks that echoed the hues of her hair she wore shoes with one clear strap the thick soles and clunky heels were filled with more little balls that jingled with each step her toenails were painted in every color of the rainbow for mavis it was business attire this is absolutely magalicious mavis claimed outré is like the cutting edge it was my bible of style before i met my honeybear i still go through it every month but now i never have to think how im going to afford all the friggin clothes leonardo is the ult i need five minutes with her its a dunk dallas if she couldve kissed my ass over the link id have lip dye smears on my butt just watch they crossed the wide lobby it was done in sharp geometric patterns of white red and black fanning out from the central data desk were pathways that led to boutiques a fancy café and a home decor center between them on the walls were screens on which elongated models walked runways in outfits that might have been designed by a mental patient on pluto fall fashion shows mavis told her new york milan paris and london she let out a squeal and pointed see that thats my babycakes designs nobody comes close eve studied the ensemble of skintight red stripes that boasted an explosion of gold tail feathers and a transparent skirt that glowed with little white lights at the hem how could she argue mavis marched by the data center to the security station that guarded a bank of glossy red elevators mavis freestone to see julietta gates yes ms freestone youre to go right up to thirty someone will meet you the guards hand came up to stop eve and peabody only ms freestone is cleared for thirty you dont really think i travel alone do you mavis spoke in icy tones before eve could work up a snarl if my entourage isnt welcome neither am i i beg your pardon ms freestone i just need to check upstairs quickly mavis shot her little nose in the air im a very busy woman she made a show out of tapping her foot examining her nails in the twenty seconds it took the guard to clear them you and your entourage are cleared for thirty thank you for your patience mavis maintained the diva mode until the elevator doors shut behind them subzero i could eat that with a spoon you and your entourage are cleared for thirty is that hot shit or what she did a quick buttwiggling dance then patted her belly i only said entourage because i thought you might punch him i was thinking about it im keeping the baby away from displays of violence not even watching much screen i heard how serenity and positive energys really good for brewing babies with some trepidation eve glanced down at mavis belly could the thing hear in there ill try not to punch anybody when youre around thatd be good mavis shut off her beaming smile as the doors opened the diva was back she lifted her eyebrows at the woman who waited for them ms freestone such a pleasure to meet you im an enormous fan of yours and of leonardos of course of course mavis extended a hand if youll just come with me ms gates is very anxious to see you i dig this to china mavis said out of the corner of her mouth as they walked through another generous lobby in this one clear cubes were set up for busy drones headsets and keyboards were fully manned by a troop that had obviously watched the fashion shows and tried to outdo them the space once again fanned out and at the far curve were double doors in what eve now assumed was outrés signature murderred their escort hurried along in a skirt snug as a bandage on heels sharp as scalpels she pressed a button at the center of the left door seconds later a brisk impatient voice snapped yes ms freestone is here to see you ms gates rather than a response the doors slid back into the wall revealing an enormous office ribboned with privacyscreened windows the blackandwhite theme continued here black carpet white walls a massive white workstation wide chairs were covered in thin blackandwhite stripes the red came from the scarlet roses massed in a tall black vase and from the sharp powerful business suit that decked juliettas impressive body she was tall curvy with a simple sweep of honey blonde hair that swung around a diamondshaped face keen cheekbones keen chin keen nose with a mouth just a shade too thin for beauty but the eyes a deep deep brown pulled the attention away from the minor flaw she was crossing the room as the doors opened her hand extended a delighted expression on her face mavis freestone what a pleasure im so glad you got in touch ive been wanting to meet you for the longest time of course ive known leonardo forever hes such a sweetheart hes certainly mine please sit down what can i offer you iced coffee perhaps im dodging caffeine these days mavis remained standing patted her belly yes of course congratulations when are you due february what a nice valentines present ignoring eve and peabody she drew mavis toward a chair get off your feet and well have a cold sparkling juice wed love one got time for a drink dallas i can make time since ms gates found an opening in her busy calendar resting an arm on the back of mavis chair eve cocked her hip my questions shouldnt take long im afraid i dont understand lieutenant dallas nypsd eve took out her badge my aide officer peabody now that we all know each other and were all cozy maybe you could answer some questions i repeat julietta walked around her desk to assume a position of command i dont understand i agreed to see ms freestone wed very much like to do a major article on you mavis with a photo layout sure we can talk about that after dallas is done dallas and i go way back she added with a wonderfully guileless smile when she mentioned she was having trouble getting an interview i said i was sure it was just a communication glitz and youd make time supporting our local police is a really important issue with me and leonardo cleverly done julietta replied i thought so eve stayed on her feet as julietta sat down if youre not comfortable im sure mavis wouldnt mind waiting outside the office until were finished no need for that julietta leaned back swiveled in her chair youve already spoken to tom i dont know what i can possibly add i dont get involved in his work and he doesnt get involved in mine how about each others lives her tone remained perfectly pleasant which area of our lives do you have in mind when was the last time you were in london london her brow creased i dont see what that has to do with anything humor me i was there a few weeks ago on business with the annoyance still creased between her eyebrows she picked up a small pocket calendar keyed in for the date july eight and nine and ten alone there was a quick flicker in her eyes before she set the calendar down yes why your husband ever go over with you we went in april tom thought the experience would be fun for jed i had business and he wanted to do some research we took an extra two days for a family holiday buy any souvenirs what are you getting at i guess you travel to europe pretty regularly eve said changing tack for your business i do for fashion shows for events to meet with my counterparts in our european offices just what does this have to do with tom helping you in an investigation its part of my investigation i dont she broke off when her pocket link rang excuse me thats my private line i need to get this she shifted it to privacy mode slid on a miniheadset and angled away so eve couldnt see the links view screen julietta gates yes her voice warmed several degrees and that justalittletoothin mouth tipped up in a smile absolutely i have it on my calendar one oclock mmmhmm yes im in a meeting there was a long silence as she listened and eve noted the faint flush that rose to her cheeks ill look forward to that yes i will goodbye she disconnected slipped off the headset sorry afternoon meeting now can you tell me where you were sunday morning oh for heavens sake she let out a huff of breath sundays i let tom sleep in and take jed to the park or to some other activity im trying to be cooperative lieutenant since mavis has asked me to but im finding this very annoying almost done how about the night of september second between midnight and three julietta snatched up her calendar again keyed in again eve saw the slight change cross her face i had a meeting with an associate i cant tell you precisely when i got home as i didnt make note of it but i think it was after nine maybe close to ten i was tired and went straight up to bed since tom was working so he was home the entire night why wouldnt he be he was working i took a pill and went to bed i told him i was going to so hed hardly have left the house because of jed toms completely devoted and somewhat overprotective of jed what is this thats it for now thanks for the time i think im entitled to some sort of if you still want we can talk about that article mavis popped to her feet i just need a minute first she scooted out of the office with eve then dropped her voice to a whisper so did she kill somebody or what doubtful the worst i figure shes done is cheat on her husband with whoever called her on her private link she did she is how do you know plenty of tells look if you dont want to deal with her you can leave with me and peabody well get you home no its chilly a spread in outrés like my fantasy and itll give a boost to my disc sales wont hurt leonardos biz either it cooks for all of us we did good right we did good night or day day or night hey what do you think about vignette or vidal what are they my baby vignette for a girl vidal for a boy theyre french were experimenting with french names and i ditched fifi i mean who names a kid fifi eve didnt know who might name a kid vignette either but made a noncommittal mouth noise somebody will call her viggy peabody said which rhymes with piggy so shell be piggy viggy in school mavis looked horrified you think deepsix vignette she gave her belly a comforting rub plenty of time to come up with something else catch you later she swung back into juliettas office impressions peabody eve asked as they rode down she looks great and shell come up with something better than vignette or vidal about julietta gates you moron i know i just wanted to annoy you sir she added when eve looked at her used to running the show and likes it dresses for power even more than style ambitious shed have to be to have gotten where she is at her age strikes me as a little coldblooded theres no zing when she talks about her kid that was a good catch with the extramarital blew right by me then when you said it and i played it back it was right there the way her voice changed the body language and from the way her face flushed up id say the voice on the other end was letting her know a few games theyd be playing at their oneoclock today im going to want to confirm the dish on the side in case we need to push on her later we going to surveil no dont want to risk her spotting either one of us this close to our little interview ill see if baxter can handle it how much does a kid like hers talk at that age they rarely shut up hardly anybody but immediate family can understand them but it doesnt stop them from talking she met her side piece on sunday you can take that to the vault and she had the kid with her wouldnt he tattle to daddy she probably told him it was a secret huh this was foreign territory so she took peabody at her word kids keep secrets no but she doesnt strike me as the type who knows her own kid very well and the boy seems pretty tight with his dad my best guess is he kept the secret until she was out of hearing then blabbed daddy me and mommy and uncle side dish played on the swings but its a secret eve let it play in her head and nodded and i doubt its the first time daddy knows whats going on and wouldnt that irritate him wouldnt he be a bit put out here he is staying at home watching the kid taking care of the house while shes running around town and europe with some other guy playing with some other guy with his son in tow yeah thats a real pisser mother and whore she said as they got back into the vehicle we keep coming back to that no problem for him to get out of the house for either murder and he mightve picked up the writing paper paying cash on his spring trip to london hell the paper couldve been a gift from a fan for that matter and he decided it fit the bill he knows the prototype murders as well as the initial killers means motive opportunity yeah thomas a just jumped to the top of our list chapter eve had barely disconnected with baxter when her communicator signaled whitneys face filled the screen hell see you at ten fortyfive make it good yes sir thank you peabody studied eves satisfied smile a persons fifteen minutes late one time and shes out of the loop get me some data on sophia dicarlo the renquists au pair and ill fill you in on the way to the un were going back to the un to renquist and not risking federal imprisonment were going back to apologize grovel and eat massive portions of crow you dont know how to do those things peabody looked mournful were going to the pen just get the data if i dont know how to apologize grovel and eat crow its because its rarely appropriate for me to do so you have to be wrong first when there was silence eve glanced over no smartass comment my grandmother always says if you cant say something positive about someone keep your trap shut yeah like you listen to her renquist is pissed his wife is pissed and theyre in the position to crimp the investigation nobody knows how to tie up red tape like a politician and since my impression of them is that they are pompous assholes i figured slathering on the im just a public servant ergo a bonehead line might get me in you said ergo it goes with pompous sophia dicarlo twentysix and single citizen of italy with green card and work permit parents and two sibs reside in rome aha parents are domestics employed by angela dysert bet its a relation to mrs pompous asshole sophias been employed by the renquists as domestic childcare position for the past six years no criminal on record okay the girl renquists girl shes old enough for school right see what you can find on that its touchy getting data on minors dallas especially foreign nationals without more clearance get what you can peabody went to work while eve drove across town overhead in the hazy sky ad blimps and tourist trams moved sluggishly inside the relative cool eve practiced groveling in her head even telling herself it was for the greater good it rankled theyve got the kids privacy blocked thats pretty standard peabody told her especially with more upscale family types you dont want kidnappers and unsavory types knowing stuff about your kids youre not going to get anything without clearance cant ask for clearance i dont want the renquists to know im looking at them doesnt matter the au pairs bound to take the kid out sometime or better go out on her own has to have a day off eve tucked her thoughts away as they approached the un and prepared to go through the multiple security checks it took twenty minutes to get through to renquists outer office it was his admin who greeted them and invited them to wait eve figured the extra twenty renquist kept them cooling their heels was just his way to show who was in charge crow was already sticking in her throat when they were admitted please make it brief renquist said immediately ive made time for you out of a very busy day only due to the direct request of your chief of police youve already infringed on my time here and my wifes yes sir im very sorry to have intruded on you and on mrs renquist in my zeal to further my investigation i overstepped i hope neither you nor mrs renquist will take this offense personally nor let it reflect on the department he arched his brow and the surprise the satisfaction was obvious in his eyes being considered a suspect in a murder is hardly usual for me and could hardly be anything but personally offensive i regret that i gave the impression you were a suspect investigative procedure demands that i pursue any and all possible connections i she tried a little fumble wished she could work up a flush i can only apologize again sir and tell you frankly that my own frustration in being unable to clear this case may have made my demeanor less than courteous to both you and mrs renquist in actuality im only seeking to remove your name from any list as applies to this investigation my interview with mrs renquist however illadvised did serve to confirm your whereabouts at the time of the murders my wife was very distressed that the subject came up in our home with guests on the point of arriving i realize that i apologize again for the inconvenience you schmuck i hardly see why my name should be on any sort of a list merely because i may have some writing paper in my possession she lowered her eyes its the only lead i have the killer has taunted me with these notes its very upsetting but that doesnt excuse my disturbing your wife at home please convey my apologies to mrs renquist he smiled now thinly i will do so however lieutenant i have the impression that you wouldnt be here offering this apology had your superiors not insisted you do so she lifted her gaze met his and let a hint of the resentment show through i was doing my job as best i know how i dont play politics well im just a cop and i follow orders mr renquist he nodded i can respect someone who follows orders and give some leeway to a public servant who allows her zeal for duty to cloud her judgment somewhat i hope you werent reprimanded too harshly no more than my actions warranted and you remain as primary in this investigation yes sir i do then ill wish you luck with it he rose and offered a hand and hope that you identify and arrest the person responsible quickly thank you eve took his hand held it and his eyes i intend to put him into a cage personally very soon he cocked his head confidence lieutenant or arrogance whatever works thank you again sir for your time and your understanding i take it back peabody said when they were clear of the building youre good frustrated apology with just a hint of resentment the foot soldier whod tried to do her job and got shafted by her superiors forced to eat that crow and swallowing it down stoically you really sold it wasnt that far off he could turn up a lot of heat under the department hes got both political and media connections nobody ordered me to apologize but nobodys going to be sorry i did either fucking politics you make rank youve got to play them sometimes eve merely shrugged and climbed back into the car dont have to like it dont have to like him either in fact every time i see him i like him less its the snooty factor peabody explained its really hard to like somebody who has a high snooty factor and his is top of the scale she looked back at the glossy white building the shining tower the waving flags i guess dealing with diplomats and ambassadors and heads of state every day makes a high snooty factor a prerequisite diplomats ambassadors and heads of state are supposed to represent the people which makes them no different than us renquist can take his snooty factor and shove it she drove away from the white walls and flags toward the heart of the city wouldnt hurt my feelings a bit if it turns out to be him im going to lock the cage on this son of a bitch personally i meant that and i wouldnt mind seeing renquists snotty face on the other side of the bars when i do she hunkered down at central and used the exercise of clearing her desk to let her thoughts brew she forwarded a dozen messages and demands from reporters to the media liaison and happily forgot about them she imagined there was a press conference in her future but she didnt have to think about it now she caught up on paperwork as much as she ever caught up on paperwork then made some calls of her own she took out the notes reread them searching for a rhythm phrasing word uses anything that clicked with the speech patterns of the people on her list it wasnt his voice she thought again deliberately not his voice he assumes and mimics and becomes who did he become when he wrote the notes her desk link signaled an incoming and wanting to avoid reporters she waited for the transmission location to flash on when she read feeney captain ryan edd she answered you work fast she said kid im a frigging rocket got a pop might be your guy case is cold vic was a fiftythreeyearold female schoolteacher found strangled in her apartment by a sister cooked for a few days first raped with a piece of statuary which he

and tell the wife were taking the whole herd to bimini for a week shell keel over shit yeah im interested but we dont have to play payback im not playing place is just sitting there he flipped a deal to peabody and mcnab a while back so i figure i can flip one to you especially since im going to ask you to keep an eye on things when i do some outoftown work sounds like im getting the shiny end of the deal data coming through she read it through and felt that quick little buzz in the blood a cop buzz she was looking at his work practice strokes not that sort of thing that merited a signature she thought but a building of style and skill he preferred not to add to his credits hed have been sloppier less cautious thered have been mistakes and though the trail was cold she might still find a shadow of them she took the time to organize the data before taking it to whitney for her pitch with her commanders goahead under her belt she made tracks back to homicide already formulating her next pitch in her head she breezed through the bullpen giving baxter a withme signal when he called out her name so you get a look at the guy shes boinking on the side shes not boinking a guy on the side the rush eve was still riding on drained gotta be damn it baxter she had big secret affair written all over her i could almost smell the sex please youre giving me a woody im just going to have some of your coffee and calm myself down if you couldnt keep a tail on her i kept a tail on her he ordered up an enormous mug two sugars splash of cream taking it he leaned back against her filing cabinet to enjoy the first jolt goddamn this is coffee speaking of tails which you were the blonde had a superior one take your woody and your idiot brain out of my office shes screwing somebody on the side did i say she wasnt he smiled sipped again and wiggled his eyebrows at eve over the rim she just aint driving a stick shes oh well well well this is interesting she lowered to the corner of her desk thought it through not just a side dish a girl side dish that has to be a real pisser for a guy and the dish was prime tall lanky black and beautiful the kind you just want to start slurping on from the toes up waste from my point of view two superior examples of the species and theyre sliding all over each other of course thinking about them sliding all over each other is entertaining i had a good time with that and have to thank you for the duty youre a sick perv and proud of it do you think you could defer your lesbian fantasies until you give me a report ive already had the fantasies and plan to have them again but i can postpone the next act your girl left the office twelve fortyfive and caught a cab proceeded uptown to the silby hotel on park went straight into the lobby where her date was waiting hot side dish later identified as serena unger through detectives charm skill and the fifty he passed the desk clerk fifty shit baxter hey classy joint classy bribe unger had preregistered both subjects proceeded to an elevator which was to the detectives great joy glasssided in this way he was able to use his keen observation techniques to watch them exchange a big sloppy wet one on the way up to the fourteenth floor they entered room where they remained engaged in activities the detective was sadly unable to witness until fourteen hundred at which time julietta gates exited the room and the hotel procuring another cab she returned to her place of employment with what the detective believed was a satisfied smile on her face you run unger had trueheart do it while we waited for the lunchtime quickie to run its course shes a fashion designer thirtytwo single no criminal currently employed with mirandis second label arm theyre new yorkbased question your woman cheats on you with another woman better or worse than her diddling with a guy oh worse bad enough shes playing you but shes doing it without a dick which means she doesnt think too much of your equipment its a guy you can maybe rationalize it some you know he took advantage of her or she had a moment of weakness took advantage of her eve snorted men are really sad and simple please a boy needs his illusions anyway its another skirt she had to go looking and she had to go looking for something you dont have makes you a double loser yeah thats how i see it its going to give you a real hardon against women so to speak were going to want to find out how long juliettas been going girlongirl he set the empty mug down and linked his hands in a gesture of prayer please please please let me do it i never get the fun stuff i need subtle on this my middle name i thought your middle name was hornydog thats my first middle name he said with some dignity come on dallas how about it play ringaroundarosie with unger talk to the staff at the hotel and keep the bribes to a minimum budgets not going to stretch if you keep slapping down fifties talk to her neighbors sniff around her place of employment shes going to get wind of it so keep the reason for the looksee quiet subtle baxter seriously ive got to do an outoftown if i get lucky ill be back in tomorrow if not it may take another day you can leave this in my very capable hands oh and i wont put in for the fifty he said as he started out it was worth the price of the ticket hed handle it she thought she couldnt be in boston new la and poking around serena unger in new york at the same time baxter could work that angle feeney the likecrimes area and shed pursue other potential leads it appeared shed put together a team without intending to now she thought she was about to add another member and it would be her turn to play it subtle she didnt expect to get through to roarke on the first try but the great god of meetings must have decided to cut her a break his admin passed her on to him with the polite comment that hed just returned from a business lunch so whatd you eat she asked when he came on chefs salad how about you im getting something in a minute you got any business in boston i could have why ive got to make a run up there maybe out to the west coast check out some things i dont want to take peabody shes got the exam day after tomorrow she needs to stay here plus i cant be a hundred percent ill be back on time for her to make it thought you might want to tag along i might when asap this wouldnt be a maneuver to avoid summersets return no but its a handy side benny look you want to go or not i have to do some shuffling he angled away and she saw him dance his fingers over a small keyboard i need two hours will do it that works for me now came the tricky part ill meet you at the newark transpo center say seventeen hundred well grab a shuttle there public transpo and at five oclock i dont think so she just loved the way he sneered timing cant be helped she began accommodations can well take one of my shuttles which was exactly what shed expected him to say thank god the last thing she wanted was to squeeze on to a commuter sweatbox and deal with the inevitable delays and poor hygiene but she knew how to play the game and gave him an obligatory scowl look pal this is police business youre just along for the ride and possible outoftown nookie all nookie is appreciated but the method of transpos a deal breaker ill pick you up when i arrange things here and if you argue youll just put me behind he checked his wrist unit ill let you know when im on my way and clicked off that she thought went perfectly shortly after five she was seated comfortably in roarkes private shuttle nibbling on strawberries and studying her notes in the fragrant cool as rides went it beat the hell out of the public sardine cans you can go along for the interview with roberta gable she told roarke but then i have to ditch you i talked to the primary with boston pd and hell take a meet with me but hes cranky about it i bring a civilian along hes going to get crankier i believe i can find something to occupy me he was working manually at one of the onboard computers and didnt glance up figure you will and i also figure that the shuffling you did had to be fast and furious thanks i expect to be paid in outoftown nookie at the first opportunity youre a cheap date roarke he smiled but kept on working well see about that oh and by the way your token protest about taking my shuttle lacked a certain panache you might put a little more effort into it next time she bit down on a strawberry i dont know what youre talking about and was saved from further comment by the beep of her link dallas hey kid got a couple bumps figured youd want to know while you were in transit feeneys droopy eyes narrowed you eating strawberries maybe she swallowed guiltily i missed lunch so what give first ones messy maybe too messy to be our guy mutilated body of an lc female twentyeight fished out of the river the seine thats gay paree three years ago june cut to pieces with liver and kidneys missing throat cut and a number of defensive wounds on forearms she was in the river too long for them to recover any trace evidence had there been any investigation deadended and the case remains open any suspects investigator pushed on the last john on her books but it didnt pan out did a press on her coordinator too whos got a known for roughing up his employees but that fizzled out too okay what else two years ago london ripperstyle murder in whitechapel sector junked up lc who slipped through the tox screenings she was thirtysix had two female roommates of the same occupation they tried to finger her onagain offagain boyfriend for it but he was alibied tight looks clear to me howd he do her slit her throat went for her works again and said works were not recovered on the scene he also cut her up slashes over the breasts palms of both hands investigator puts it down to lust kill but the mes got an interesting note here and looking it over i lean toward him says the slashes on breasts and palms were like an afterthought no passion to them you got one witness says he saw the vic head off with a guy dressed in a black cape and a fancy hat since the witness was trashed on zoner the investigator didnt put much faith in his statement it fits eve told him you know it fits he dressed like desalvo did for the strangulations in handyman garb why wouldnt he costume himself up for the ripper thanks feeney shoot the files to my office unit copy to my home unit im hoping to be back within twentyfour hours done im going to take this search offplanet its got me hooked now she sat back stared up at the ceiling are we going to london and paris roarke asked her i dont think i can risk the time or the energy itd take to hack through the international red tape ill try to tie it in talking to the primaries via link if you change your mind it wouldnt take more than one extra day shed like to see where hed been where hed done some of his early work but she shook her head hes in new york i need to be in new york hes been practicing a long time she said half to herself honing his talents thats why he can afford to kill close together now all the prep work all the research all the details are in place he doesnt have to wait because hes waited long enough practiced or not the speed is going to make him sloppy roarke stated he may be meticulous he may have honed his talents but hes moving too fast for caution i think youre right about that and when he messes up well get him when we get him when i get him in the box and break him down were going to find out there were more other bodies hidden or destroyed until he got better until he could leave them to be found with some pride but his early mistakes he doesnt want to be embarrassed by them thats the emotional reason the others more practical he didnt want to leave too many like crimes on the books draw attention until he was ready to make his splash ive done some research of my own roarke swiveled the workstation aside for fifteen months between march of and may of a man named peter brent murdered seven police officers in the city of chicago brent unable to pass the psych screen to become a member of the cpsd joined a fringe paramilitary group where he learned how to handle what would be his weapon of choice a longrange blaster already banned for civilians at that time i know about brent he liked rooftops hed hunker down on a roof wait for a cop to come into range and take him out with a head shot it took a fiftyman task force more than a year to bring him down understanding she leaned forward laid her hands on roarkes brent didnt kill women he killed cops didnt matter to him as long as they had the uniform he couldnt wear he doesnt fit the profile for the prototype five of the seven dead cops were female officers as was the chief of police who he tried and failed to assassinate dont hose me lieutenant he said calmly enough youve thought of brent and youve run a probability just as i have you know theres an eightyeight point six probability factor that he will emulate brent and target you hes not going to go for me she insisted not yet she thought not quite yet he needs me to pursue so he feels more important more successful more satisfied taking me out wouldnt give him the same rush so hes saving you for his final act there was no point in dissembling not with roarke i figure he may have that for a longrange goal but i can promise you he wont get there he took her hand linked fingers im holding you to that promise chapter shed decided to hang on to roarke for her interview with roberta gable he would she considered provide another set of impressions the former childcare professional had agreed to speak with eve as long as the interview lasted no longer than twenty minutes she wasnt particularly gracious about it eve told him as they approached the small apartment complex where gable made her home especially when i said wed be here around sixthirty she eats promptly at seven and i was told id have to respect that people of a certain age tend to develop routines and she called me miss dallas repeatedly companionably roarke swung an arm around her shoulders you already hate her i do i really do but the jobs the job no snuggling on the job she added i keep forgetting that still he gave her a friendly squeeze before removing his arm eve stepped up to the security grid gave her name displayed her badge stated her business she was cleared so quickly she assumed gable had been waiting for her im going to intro you as my associate she said as they walked into the tiny foyer one look at his gorgeous face the elegant suit and the shoes that probably cost more than gables monthly rent had eve sighing and unless shes blind and senile she wont buy it but well try to brash by that it shows a definite bias to assume that cops cant be well dressed your shirt lists for more than my weapon she chided so once in you keep it buttoned the lip as well as the shirt and look firm and stern and i was counting on shooting you quiet adoring looks burst that bubble second floor they took the steps turned into a short hall with two doors on either side the absolute silence told her the building had excellent soundproofing or everyone in the place was dead eve pressed the buzzer beside b miss dallas at the sound of the voice through the speaker roarke firmed his lips against a grin and stared dutifully at the door lieutenant dallas ms gable i want to see your identification hold it up to the peep after eve complied there was a long silence it appears to be in order theres a man with you you didnt indicate there would be a man with you my associate ms gable may we come in please i dont want to take up any more of your time than necessary very well there was another stretch during which eve assumed various locks were being turned roberta gable opened the door and scowled her identification photo was if anything flattering her thin face had the sort of hard edges eve judged came from not only avoiding any of the softer areas of life but disparaging them the grooves around her mouth indicated that the scowl was a regular feature her hair was pulled back so tightly it gave eve a headache just to look at it she was dressed in gray like her hair a crisp shirt and skirt that hung on her bony body her shoes were black and thicksoled with laces tied in very precise knots i know you she said to roarke and sucked in so much air her nostrils flared visibly you are not a police officer no maam civilian consultants are often utilized by the police department eve put in if you have any questions about this procedure you can call my commanding officer in new york we can wait outside until you verify that wont be necessary she stepped back until they entered the living area it was ruthlessly clean and spartan none of the frilly business eve generally expected from older women living alone was in evidence no pillows or dustcatchers no framed photos or flowers there was a single sofa a single chair two tables two lamps it was as soulless and just as welcoming as a cage in a highsecurity prison one would not she was sure hear the dulcet sounds of a carmichael smith cd within these walls that at least was one small mercy you may sit on the sofa i will not offer refreshments this close to mealtime she took the chair sat with her back straight as a poker her feet flat on the floor with her knees pressed so tightly together they might have been glued she folded her hands in her lap you indicated you wished to speak to me regarding one of my former charges but refused to give me a name i find that quite rude miss dallas i find murder quite rude and thats what im investigating there is no need for sass if you cant conduct yourself with respect this interview is over respects a twoway street my name is lieutenant dallas gables mouth folded in but she inclined her head in acknowledgment very well lieutenant dallas i assume since youve attained that rank you have some aptitude for your profession and some sense if youll explain succinctly why youve come to speak to me we can conclude this matter and get back to our business my questions will be of a highly confidential nature im asking for your discretion i lived and worked in private homes among important families most of my life i am nothing if not discreet one of those families included a son niles renquist gables eyebrows shot up the first genuine animation shed shown if youve come all the way from new york to ask me about the renquists youre wasting my time and your own mine is valuable to me valuable enough id imagine to want to avoid being transported to new york and brought into formal interview the threat was hot air no judge would give her the power to drag a civilian across state lines on what little shed gathered but the idea of the inconvenience was often enough to elicit cooperation i dont believe you can have me taken to new york like a common criminal there was more animation now as temper put an almost rosy flush in gables cheeks i have no doubt my attorney could prevent such a highhanded tactic maybe go ahead and contact him if you want to go to the trouble the time and the expense well see who wins in the end i dont care for your attitude or your demeanor gables fingers had curled on her thighs with the knuckles going white a pincher eve was sure of it i get that a lot something about murder just gets me all irritable you can talk to me here and now ms gable in the comfort of your own home or we can start the bureaucratic ball rolling up to you gable had a good stare icy and unblinking but it was no match for a cop with eleven years under her belt very well you can ask your questions ill answer what i deem appropriate did niles renquist ever demonstrate violent or disturbing behavior under your watch certainly not she sniffed even the thought of it away he was a wellbred young man from a good family i believe his current position and circumstance bears that out does he keep in touch with you i receive flowers on my birthday and a card at christmas as is proper so the two of you maintain an affectionate relationship affectionate gables face drew together as if shed scented something vaguely unpleasant i neither want nor expect affection from any of my charges lieutenant dallas as i doubt you expect any from your subordinates what do or did you expect obedience respect and organized welldisciplined behavior sounded more like the army than the nursery to eve but she nodded and you received same from renquist of course did you employ corporal punishment when appropriate my methods which served me and my charges well were to suit the disciplinary action to the child and the offense to your memory what disciplinary actions most usually suited niles renquist he responded best to denial denial of recreation society entertainment etcetera he could and would become argumentative or sullen during the deprivation but would eventually submit he learned as did all my charges that there are consequences for unacceptable behavior did he have friends he had a suitably selected number of playmates and acquaintances selected by myself or his parents and his relationship with his parents was all that it should be i fail to see the pertinence of these questions nearly done did he have any pets there was i recall a family dog a miniature terrier of some sort sarah the young girl was particularly fond of it and nearly inconsolable when it ran away how old was renquist when it ran away ten or twelve i believe how about the young girl renquists sister what can you tell me about her she was a model charge amenable quiet and wellmannered a bit clumsy and prone to nightmares but otherwise biddable and goodnatured clumsy how she went through a stage where she tripped over her own feet quite often or bumped into objects and had more than her share of bumps and scrapes at my recommendation the renquists had her vision checked but her sight was quite perfect it was simply a matter of a lack of coordination and a slightly skittish nature she grew out of it when would you say she grew out of it at about twelve i suppose she developed grace at a stage when many young girls lose theirs puberty is a difficult period but sarah bloomed during hers and about this time when she developed grace and stopped turning up with cuts and bruises her brother was sent to eton would that be about right i suppose it would doubtless having my undivided time and attention helped her gain more poise and confidence now if thats all just one more thing do you recall if there were any other family pets that went missing during your time with the renquists other animals in the neighborhood that ran away other peoples pets werent my concern i have no recollection were you following me in there eve asked roarke when they stood on the sidewalk clear enough youre looking to establish whether or not this renquist had an abusive female authority figure in his childhood whether or not he in turn abused his younger female sibling whether or not he may as is often the case with serial or torture killers killed or tortured pets textbook stuff eve agreed and whats funny is she didnt follow the dots that tells me shes either oblivious or stupid hiding something or the possibility she might have helped raise a psychopath doesnt enter her tidy little world whats your money on the last one shes a pincher all right and worse you get a lot of her type in the foster system somebody like her wouldnt consider she had a mentally or emotionally twisted charge as long as the kid presented the illusion of submission did you not so much but i could when it was worth my while and i know a lot of kids most kids come through something like that and lead normal lives renquist could be one of them his sister might very well have been clumsy but i dont like coincidence ive got to mull this over and ive got to go meet the boston cop ill drop you no better i catch a cab or take the underground this guy sees me show up in a hot car with a fancy piece behind the wheel hes not going to like me you know how i love being referred to as your fancy piece sometimes youre my love muffin he managed a strangled laugh she could at the oddest times surprise him and i try my very best to earn the name in any case ive got some business i can take care of why dont you contact me when youve finished and let me know what comes next youre pretty amenable for a fancy piece he leaned down and kissed her lightly ive been thoroughly disciplined my ass which is certainly part of the package no rush he added as he slid into the car im going to be at least an hour myself it took eve over a quarter of that to travel through the hideous boston traffic it still put her at the bar and grill a half block from haggertys station house ahead of time it was a typical cop haunt good cheap food and drink with no fancy notes booths a scatter of two and four tops and plenty of stools along the bar there were a number of offshift cops in and out of uniform winding down from the day attention slid her way when she entered the brief beat of observation then recognition of breed cop to cop shed expected haggerty to come in early marking his territory and wasnt surprised by the signal from a lone man at a table he was toughly built bullchested bigshouldered with a ruddy square face topped by a short crop of sandy hair he studied her as she crossed the room there was a beer half gone in front of him ds haggerty thats me lieutenant dallas thanks for making time they shook hands she sat want a beer could use one thanks she let him order it since it was his territory and let him take his time sizing her up you got an interest in one of my open cases he said at length i got a vic a strangulation rape with object a runthrough ircca for like crimes turned up yours my theory is he was practicing perfecting before he did the new york job he wasnt sloppy in boston neither am i she nodded sipped her beer im not here to bust balls haggerty or to question your investigation i need a hand if im right the guy were both looking for is working in new york now and hes not done so we help each other and we shut him down and you get the collar she drank more beer let it simmer i take him in new york i get the collar thats the way it works but your boss will know if any information you share with me aided in the arrest and conviction of this son of a bitch and youll close your case your cold case she added unless youre a fuckup youll be able to hang another murder on him when this goes down theres going to be a lot of media youll get your share of that too he sat back pissed you off i start off my day pissed off my investigation has led me to believe this asshole has killed at least six people to date i suspect there are more and i know goddamn well there will be more he sobered stand down lieutenant i was testing the waters i dont give a skinny rats ass about the media not going to say i dont care about the collar fucking right i do my vic was beat to shit before he tied his goddamn bow around her neck so i want him and i got nothing i worked the case hard and got nothing yeah officially its cold but it aint cold to me he took a long drink of beer its under my skin and i work it whenever i get the chance so you tell me you got a case in new york and it brings you back here to mine i want a piece of it because she understood she lowered her hackles and took the first step hes imitating historic serial killers one of the reasons he hit boston boston strangler haggerty pursed his lips i played with that a while copycat thing had enough of the same elements i studied up on those cases looking for an angle to work nothing gelled and since he didnt hit again he did a homeless woman in new la before boston and hes hit new york hes also killed three lcs paris london new york by emulating jack the ripper youve got to be shitting me its the same man he left me notes with my two nothing like that with mine he said answering her unspoken question dont have a single witness the security system on the building if you can call it that was taken out the day before he killed her nobody got around to fixing it let me get out my notes she took her own from his before shed drained her beer theyd agreed to exchange case files she checked the time calculated a call to the west coast netted her a meet with the primary there another got her roarke he seemed to be in some sort of a bar himself but from the pretty lights the quiet hum and the glint of what she thought was crystal it was several steps away from haggertys hangout ive wrapped up here she told him im on my way to transpo how much time do you need another half hour on this will do me fine just meet me there ive got enough to occupy myself with until you show any problem for you if we head straight to the west coast from here i believe i can find something to occupy myself with there as well she didnt doubt it by the time he walked onto the shuttle shed reread her notes and was writing a report on her boston leg for her team and her commander roarke set his briefcase aside cleared the shuttle to take off when ready then ordered them both a meal how do you feel about basketball he asked her its okay lacks the poetry of baseball and the sheer meanness of arena ball but its got speed and drama whatd you do spend your hour buying the celtics i did yes she looked up get out actually it took a bit more than an hour weve been in negotiations for a few months now since i was here i gave it the last push and we finalized it i thought it would be fun i spend an hour drinking a lukewarm beer and talking murder and you buy a basketball team we should all play to our strengths she ate because it was there and filled roarke in haggertys thorough bulldog type not just in build in mindset he hasnt let go of the case and a lot of cops would have after this amount of time hes kept picking at it but hasnt gotten anywhere i just cant see what he missed might catch something when i see the full file but he did the steps and how does that help you knowing he was here being sure of it the dates i can backtrack there see if anybody on my list was in boston or just unaccounted for on the corresponding dates see if maybe just maybe theres a connection between any of them and haggertys victim someone else is a bulldog roarke commented not in body type but certainly in mindset i could check the transportation angle for you see if any of your names show up on public or private transpos for those dates i dont have the authorization for that yet im going to get it i pull the new la and the european murders into the mix and ill get it any and all of my current suspects are highprofile enough that if i brush too close to the line they could use it to get evidence tossed in trial thats assuming they or their attorneys saw the brush strokes they wouldnt see roarkes eve knew no one would i cant use the evidence if i dont have the authorization to seek the evidence but shed know enough to be able to narrow the list enough potentially to save a life i take him down give him any wiggle room in the courts and he gets off hell kill someone else down the road he wont stop until hes stopped not only because he enjoys it he needs it but because hes been working toward this for a long long time if i screw this up all i do is put a hitch in his stride once he gets his rhythm back whoever he kills is on me i cant live with that all right i understand that but eve look at me now promise me that if he kills someone else before youre able to stop him you wont feel the same way she did look at him i wish i could was all she said detective sloan was a young eager beaver whod caught the case with his older more experienced and less interested partner the partner had since retired and sloan was partnered with a female counterpart whod come along for the ride for the meet with eve it was the first homicide where i was primary sloan told eve over chilled juices in a health bar new las version she supposed of the cop haunt the place was bright and cool done in crisp colors and boasting a cheery wait staff who were bouncy on their feet eve thanked god she lived and worked on the other coast where waiters were appropriately surly and never felt obliged to offer you something called pineapplepapaya phizz as the special of the day trent gave it to me as a training exercise he added he gave it to you so he didnt have to lift his fat ass off his desk chair the partner put in sloan grinned amiably mightve played into it the victim was one of the disenfranchised i did track some family after we identified her but nobody cared to claim the body i got conflictings from the witnesses i managed to convince to talk to me though they were impaired by some form of illegals the most substantial described a male race undetermined wearing a gray or blue uniform who was seen entering the building at or around the time of the murder victim was squatting and since anybody else in the building was also there illegally everybody worked at ignoring everybody else youve got a hot one back in new york with a similar mo the new partners name was baker and both she and sloan were attractive healthy specimens with sunbleached hair they looked more like a couple of professional surfers than cops unless eve mused you looked at the eyes we ah did a little research after you contacted me sloan explained get a better handle on what you were looking for and why good saves me time explaining myself you could reach out on this and let me have a copy of your case files and walk me through the steps of your investigation i can do that and id like quid pro quo my first case as primary sloan added id sure like to close it wed like to close it baker corrected trent cashed it on his twentyfive plans to spend the rest of his life fishing hes not in this fair enough eve said this time when she was finished she let roarke pick her up to her mind any cops who werent embarrassed to be seen drinking papaya juice couldnt blink at a fellow officer getting into a sleek little convertible she stashed her growing bag of notes and discs behind her seat i want to run by the scene take a look at the setup we can do that she gave him the address waited until hed programmed it into the onboard computer so did you buy the dodgers im afraid not but you have only to ask she leaned her head back let her thoughts circle while he drove cant figure out why anybody lives out here she said just because theyve had the big one doesnt mean theres not another big one just waiting to flatten them nice breeze though roarke commented and theyve certainly battled back the smog and noise pollution whole place feels like a vid you know or a vr program too much peachy pinky white too many healthy bodies with perfect smiling faces on top of them creeps me and i just dont think you ought to have palm trees waving around in the middle of a city its just not right this should please you then the building you want appears to be suitably shabby and unkempt and the locals seem to be satisfactorily shady she sat up stifled a yawn and looked around only about half the streetlights were working and the building itself was deaddark some of the windows were riotbarred others boarded several people skulked and slithered around in the shadows and in one she spotted an illegals deal winding up this is more like it cheered she stepped out of the car this thing got full security its loaded he put the top up engaged locks and deflectors her flop was on the third floor might as well poke around since were here its always a pleasure to poke around in a condemned building where someone might stab bludgeon or blast us at any moment youve got your kind of fun ive got mine she scanned the area selected her target yo asshole the chemihead in the long black jacket rocked to the balls of his feet if i have to chase you its going to piss me off eve warned then ill probably slip so that my foot ends up planted in your balls just got a question you got the answer its worth ten dont know nothing then you wont make the ten how long you flopped around here while not bothering nobody were you around when susie mannery got strangled up on three shit i dont kill nobody i dont know nobody prolly the men in white done it what men in white shit you know the guys from under the world turn themselves into rats when they want then kill people in their sleep cops know some prolly be cops right those men in white blow she told him and started into the building where my ten wrong answers she didnt get any right ones on her way to the third floor mannerys room was occupied again but the current resident wasnt at home there was a ripped mattress on the floor a box of rags and a very old sandwich like the chemihead outside nobody she managed to roust inside had seen anything knew anything done anything wasting our time she said at length this isnt my turf i dont know who to push and if i did i dont know what help it would be living like this people think youve given up but mannery hadnt sloan gave me a list of her personal effects she had clothes and a cache of food and a stuffed dog you dont haul around a stuffed dog if youve given up she was probably zoned out when he came in on her but she was still breathing and he had no right roarke turned her so that she faced him in the hot filthy room lieutenant youre tired im okay when he simply stroked her cheek she closed her eyes a moment yeah im tired i know about places like this a couple of times when he ran thin wed flop in places like this hell it mightve been here for all i know i dont have all of it back you need to shut down for a bit ill catch some sleep in the shuttle no point in staying out here i probably think better in new york anyway lets go home then i guess i reneged on the outoftown nookie ill put it on your account she dozed in the shuttle as it flew over the country and dreamed of rats who become men dressed in white of a man without a face who strangled her with a long white scarf and tied it with a pretty bow under her chin chapter marlene cox worked the tentotwo shift three nights a week at rileys irish pub it was her uncles place and his name was actually waterman but his mother had been born a riley and uncle pete figured that was close enough it was a good way to help finance her postgrad work at columbia she was studying horticulture though her plans for what she wanted to do with the degree once shed earned it were vague mostly she simply liked college so she remained a student at twentythree she was a slight and pretty brunette with long straight hair and a pair of guileless brown eyes earlier in the summer her family had worried so much about her several college students in new york had been murdered that shed canceled her summer classes she had to admit shed been a little scared herself shed known the first girl whod been killed only slightly but still it had been a shock to have recognized the face of a fellow student in the media reports shed never known anyone whod died before much less known anyone whod died violently it hadnt taken much persuasion to convince her to stick closer to home to take extra precautions but the police had caught the killer shed actually known him a little too that had been not only a shock but also a little exciting in a weird way now that things had quieted down again marlene didnt give much thought to the girl shed known slightly or the killer shed chatted with briefly at a cyberclub between her family the parttime job and her studies her life was as normal as normal got in fact it was just a little too normal at the moment she couldnt wait for classes to get into a serious rhythm again she wanted to get back in full swing spending more time with friends and she was toying with getting a bit more serious with a guy shed started flirting with during her aborted summer session she got off the subway two blocks from the apartment she shared with two of her cousins it was a good location family approved with quiet streets and a neighborhood feel the short walk didnt worry her shed been taking the same route for over two years and no one had ever bothered her sometimes she almost wished someone would just so she could prove to her doting family she could handle herself she turned the corner and saw a mini moving van one of the rentals from the same company shed used when shed moved from her parents place to the one she shared with her cousins it was a weird time for somebody to be moving in or out she thought but she heard thumps and a couple of breathless male curses as she came up alongside of it she saw the man struggling to get a small sofa into the back he was wellbuilt and though his back was to her she took him to be young enough to manage it then she saw the thick white cast on his right arm he tried to muscle it up lefthanded using his shoulder but the weight and angle fought against him causing the end of the sofa to thump onto the street again damn it damn it damn it he took out a white handkerchief mopped at his face she got a look at him now and thought he was cute under his ball cap curly dark hair her favorite on a man spilled out over the collar of his shirt she started to walk by cute or not it wasnt smart to talk to strange men on the street in the middle of the night but he looked so pitiful hot frustrated and just a little helpless her good nature had her pausing her new york caution had her keeping her distance moving in or out she asked he jolted making her bite back a laugh and when he turned and saw her his already flushed face went pinker ah looks like neither i guess i could just leave the stupid thing like this and live in the truck did a number on your arm huh curiosity had her edging a little closer ive never seen a cast like that yeah he ran his hand over it two more weeks broke it in three places rockclimbing in tennessee stupid she thought shed caught the south in his voice and edged a little closer pretty late at night for moving day well my girl exgirlfriend he said with a grimace works nights she said if i wanted my stuff i had to haul it out when she wasnt around another bad break he added with a hint of a smile my brothers supposed to be here but hes late typical i want to get this stuff loaded before donna gets back and ive only got the rental till six a m he was cute a bit older than her usual type but she liked the hint of twang in his voice plus he was in a jam maybe i could give you a hand with it really you wouldnt mind id really appreciate it if we could just get this bastard in maybe frank will show i think i could handle some of the other stuff no problem she stepped closer maybe if you get up in the back i could push it and you could guide it or something well give it a shot he climbed in hampered somewhat by the cast she did her best to lift and shove but the end of the sofa thudded on the pavement again sorry its okay he grinned at her though she thought he looked exhausted youre just a little thing arent you if youve got another minute we could try it the other way i can take the weight use my back shoulders maybe you could come up in here hold it steady sort of pull while i push there was a vague ring from a warning bell in the back of her mind but she ignored it she clambered up into the truck warmed by his grateful smile as he slid out he called out instructions as he grunted and cursed his brother frank in a way that made her laugh as the sofa began to slide in she backed up tugging it along with a fine sense of accomplishment mission accomplished hold on just a minute let me he boosted himself in swiping his good arm over his brow if we could just shove it that way he started to point and though the warning bell had pealed louder when hed climbed in with her into the small dark cave she glanced over at the direction of his finger the first blow caught her on the side of the head and sent her staggering she saw lights flash and felt a terrible and confusing pain she stumbled catching her foot on the leg of the sofa and pitching to the left without any idea that the spill saved her skull from a second brutal blow with the cast it smashed her shoulder instead had her whimpering as she tried to crawl away from the attack from the pain she could hear his voice through the screaming in her head but there was something different about it something ripped her clothes her body as he hauled her back no you dont sneaky little twat she couldnt see now there was only dark and those awful flashing lights but she tasted blood her own blood in her mouth and she could hear just hear through the screams in her head horrible things panted out in a horrible voice she was crying making tiny animal sounds that turned to moans as more blows rained on her back with a trembling hand she reached into her pocket fighting to stay conscious fighting to make her numb fingers grip the gift her uncle had given her when shed gone to work for him with blind instinct she pointed it toward the sound of his voice he howled a grotesque sound that told her the mugger spray had hit the mark the panic siren attached to the device wailed sobbing she thought she was sobbing but it might have been him she tried to crawl again pain more pain exploded inside her when a vicious kick hit her ribs her jaw she felt herself falling falling and the world was already dropping away when her head hit the pavement with a violent crack at four a m eve stood on the sidewalk studying the blood on the pavement marlene cox had been transported to the hospital an hour before unconscious she was not expected to live hed abandoned the rental and his props and left his victim bleeding on the street but he hadnt finished her eve crouched and with her sealed fingers picked up a small shard of white plaster shed fought back long enough hard enough to chase him away she studied the ball cap and wig already sealed in evidence cheap models she mused tough to trace the sofa looked old shabby used something he picked up at a flea market but they had the moving van so maybe theyd get lucky and a twentythreeyearold woman was dying she looked up as peabody sprinted down the sidewalk lieutenant twentythreeyearold female eve began identified as marlene cox lives in that building she said gesturing apparently on her way home from work ive checked with the hospital where she was taken before i arrived on scene shes in surgery prognosis poor she was beaten severely about the head face body he used this to start anyway she held up a chunk of plaster what is it plaster id say from a cast an arm cast poor guys trying to haul the sofa in or out of the truck probably in hed want to get her inside got a busted wing cant quite manage it he looks harmless helpless so she gives him a hand he was probably charming lots of smiles and aw shucks then when shes inside he hits her goes for the head needs to knock her down debilitate and disorient keep hitting her hard enough to smash the cast she stepped up to the opening in the back of the van close quarters small space that was a mistake eve noted didnt give himself enough room to really wind up for the hits and the props the couch the packing boxes got in the way the imitation was good she decided but the stage had been cramped and spoiled his performance he didnt move fast enough she said out loud or maybe he was enjoying it too much she had some mugger spray eve lifted the evidence bag with the pocket bottle i figure she got off at least one good shot in his face or near enough to hurt him and the panic siren tripped so he ran from the looks of it she added nodding to the blood on the pavement she either fell out of the truck or he shoved her out uniform that briefed me said there was so much blood from her head he thought she was dos but she had a pulse ted bundy ive been boning up peabody said when eve looked at her especially on the serial killers you put on your hot sheet he used this method yeah and more successfully than our guy thats going to piss him off even if she dies hell be pissed off lets run the truck peabody ive got some uniforms doing the knockondoors and im about to set the sweepers loose on the rental lets fucking find something on this bastard marlene was still in surgery when eve got to the hospital the surgical waiting area was packed with people the nurse on duty had already warned her the patients family was there en masse she recognized the mix of shock fear hope grief and anger on the faces as nearly as one they turned toward her im sorry to intrude im lieutenant dallas nypsd id like to speak with peter waterman thats me he rose a big burly man with a military cut to his dark hair and the shadows of worry in his eye if you could step out here mr waterman he bent to murmur to one of the waiting women then followed eve into the corridor im sorry to pull you away from your family but my information is you were the last to speak with ms cox before she left for home this morning she works for me for us i got a bar and marley she waits tables a few times a week yes sir i know what time did she leave right after two i sprang her did the lockup myself watched her walk to the subway station its only a few steps from the door shes only got two blocks to go once shes off its a good neighborhood

a good neighborhood safe goddamn it its a good neighborhood mr waterman and small comfort when the panic siren went off people came out they didnt burrow inside and ignore it weve already got a couple of witnesses who saw the man who attacked her running away he might not have run if it wasnt a good neighborhood if people hadnt opened their windows or come outside to help okay he swiped the heel of his hand across his cheek the back of his hand under his nose okay thanks i helped them find that apartment you see my sister marleys mother she asked me to check the place out and you found her a

some guy she met in school earlier this summer i dont know his name one of my girls might he took out a handkerchief blew his nose we pushed her to drop her summer classes because of those kids that were killed those college kids a few weeks ago she knew one of them the first one so it upset her upset all of us i got her that mugger spray told her to keep it in her pocket she did shes a good girl and she used it that means shes smart and shes tough she drove him off mr waterman the doctors wont tell us eve turned as a woman spoke behind her shed come to the door and stood there leaning on the opening as if she couldnt bear her own weight they wont say but i could see what they thought thats my baby theyve got in there my baby and they think shell die but theyre wrong shes going to be fine sela waterman pulled her into his arms held her tight marleys going to be just fine mrs cox is there anything you can tell me that will help shell tell you herself when she wakes up solas voice was stronger than her brothers and absolutely sure then youll go after him and youll lock him up when you do im going to come in and look right at his face and tell him it was my girl it was my baby who put him there dallas left them alone found a corner a cup of coffee and waited until peabody returned and sat down beside her no luck on the rental yet but mcnab and feeney are on it smart careful eve commented rents it via computer with a bogus name and license number and pays to have it delivered to the bogus address nobody sees him he seals up so weve got no prints no hair no nothing inside the van except the wig he ditched and the pieces of plaster maybe some of the blood onscene will turn out to be his eve only shook her head hes too smart for that but hes not as smart as he thinks he is because he didnt get marlene cox not the way he wanted and somebodys seen him somebody saw him get in that rental or park it by her building just the way people saw him running like a scared rabbit away from the scene she took a long breath a long sip of coffee the moving van that was his stage set so he was careful there he wanted us to find her inside the van but he had to run with his eyes burning his throat on fire from the spray had to get to his bolthole she looked over as a doctor in surgical scrubs came down the hall on his face she could see what sela cox had seen the grimness damn it eve got to her feet and waited for him to go in and speak with the family she heard weeping male and female and voices down to murmurs she was waiting when he stepped back out dallas she flipped out her badge i need a minute dr laurence she cant talk to you or anybody else shes alive i dont know how she made it through surgery and i dont expect her to last the morning im letting her family go in to say goodbye i wasnt able to speak to the mts onscene can you tell me about her injuries he stalked over to a vending machine ordered coffee broken ribs id say he kicked her collapsed lung bruised kidneys dislocated shoulder broken elbow those are just some of the minor injuries her skull thats a different matter ever taken a hardboiled egg run it with your palm over a hard surface to break up the shell yeah thats about what her skull looked like the mts got to her fast and they did a heroic job but shed lost a lot of blood before they responded her skulls fractured lieutenant and the damage is severe there were bone splinters in her brain the chances of her regaining consciousness even for a few minutes are slim to none the odds of her being able to speak have a coherent thought motor functions should that miracle occur he shook his head im told she sprayed the guy he added there was a container of mugger spray onscene eve confirmed the siren engaged it was identified as belonging to her my take is she got him otherwise hed have finished what he started im betting she got his eyes ive put the word out anybody comes in this er or any other facility ive been able to reach with the symptoms well send up a flag thats helpful thanks any change in her condition one way or the other id appreciate it if youd contact me peabody you got a card yes sir one more thing eve said when hed slipped it into his pocket you have much call to use this anymore she offered him a shard of plaster havent used this since my intern days he said turning it over in his hand still see it now and then depending on the injury and the insurance plasters cheaper than the skin casts used more habitually now a break takes longer to heal and the casts cumbersome uncomfortable more likely to see these on lowincome patients where do you get it the stuff you make it from medical supply company i imagine hell probably pick some up at a higher end rehab place for people who want the old stuff want authentic plasterwork yeah thats what i was thinking appreciate it medical supplies or building supplies peabody asked as they walked out i want both cash sales he wont want a paper trail and im betting there arent that many cash sales for this sort of thing small amounts selfpickup delivery means he had to give an address he walked in and bought this paid cash walked out run building supplies first she decided any joe blow can walk into one of them and nobody notices thats his first choice she checked the time as she slid into the car briefing in one hour when were done were going shopping she walked into her office and wasnt sure if she was annoyed or amused to see nadine furst sitting at her desk enjoying a cup of coffee and a tiny muffin dont snap and snarl i brought you doughnuts what kind of doughnuts creamfilled sprinkled with colored sugar nadine opened the small bakery box six of them and theyre all yours fatso i like a good bribe now get out of my chair she walked to the autochef ordered up coffee when she turned back nadine was sitting in her single visitors chair crossing her silky legs i should rephrase get out of my office i thought wed have breakfast together nadine lifted the minuscule muffin to her lips and took a bite eve estimated contained three crumbs dallas i appreciate your stand on playing favorites and the bitching and moaning from other members of the fourth estate ive backed off you have to agree im not seeing your back but with that shirt im seeing a lot of your tits pretty arent they but to remain on track ive respected your stand because you had a point i know youve fed quinton some information no more no less than you wanted out there i respect that as well were just loaded with respect this morning she took a huge bite of pastry byebye now he hasnt put it together he may especially after i give him a good nudge hes bright and hes eager but hes green as yet he hasnt wondered why youre primary on what is now three seemingly unrelated homicides crime is running rampant in our city run and hide better yet move to kansas and its two homicides nadine marlene cox isnt dead yet sorry my information was she wasnt expected to make it through surgery she has barely even more curious then why our stalwart homicide lieutenant is picking at the threads of an assault she took a tiny sip of coffee rubbed her lips together i say weve got one killer employing a variety of methods and this occurred to me when i got wind of the last cox was attacked about twothirty this morning shouldnt you have been asleep or banging your flavor of the month i was asleep and was awakened from my virginal bed pigs eye with an anonymous tip nadine finished with a little cats smile i started wondering then i started working and i started asking myself what these three women had in common besides you i decided the killer the first was obviously an imitation of the infamous ripper what if the others were also imitations of previous crimes im not going to comment on this nadine albert desalvo and theodore bundy no comment i dont need you to comment she leaned forward i can put enough together to go on the air with a story with supposition then whatre you doing here giving you a chance to confirm or deny or to ask me to hold the story im putting together ill hold it if you ask me because you wont unless you need to youre also thinking i wont ask unless youre right and then youll have a big sexy story with big sexy ratings that plays too but ill still hold it if you need me to and by holding it im giving competitors the chance to come to the same conclusions i have eve contemplated her doughnut i need to think a minute so just be quiet there were pros and cons here and eve ran through them all while nadine sat silently eating her muffin crumb by crumb im not going to give you data im not even going to give you hints because when im asked and i will be i want to be able to say honestly that i didnt that i wasnt your source im not going to confirm or deny your supposition which is what youll have to say if and when you break this story lieutenant dallas would neither confirm nor deny i will however make a personal comment between us girls besides having those pretty tits youve got a sharp brain why thank you ive also got great legs now if i were doing this story which im not id wonder why this particular bag of nuts has so little personality power and imagination he has to pretend hes somebody else to do the job and the last time out he flubs it up so bad a girl about half his size hurts him and he has to run away eve picked a sprinkle of colored sugar from the doughnut laid it on her tongue word is the primary investigating officer has a good idea just who he is and is at this time compiling the evidence so that she can make an arrest and ensure conviction are you i will neither confirm nor deny youre bluffing no comment big bluff dallas i go out with this and you dont make that arrest quickly youre going to look like an asshole the storys your business now that ive finished my doughnut ive got to get back to my business i break this and it goes down this way im going to deserve an exclusive oneonone ill see about that as soon as i consult my crystal ball nadine rose good luck serious good luck yeah eve murmured when she was alone im about due for some chapter she grabbed a conference room brought in her disc files set up her board as she was finishing peabody came in lieutenant im supposed to do that its my job to do that how come youre not letting me do my job bitch bitch bitch i gave you another job did you inform captain feeney and detective mcnab of the time and place of this briefing yes sir i then why arent they here well i she was saved as the door opened they are here good job then all right people take a seat im going to bring you up to speed on my outoftown interviews and why my conclusion is our target has practiced his skills in at least three other locations to date when shed finished she was sitting on the corner of the table drinking the coffee she noted peabody provided her without request im pushing for the authorization to check travel on my suspects for the dates in question the commander has agreed to put the pressure on but as my list contains some influential names its taking time ive bumped carmichael smith to the bottom my opinion is hes too volatile and too pampered to fit the profile peabody launched up a hand like the nerdy kid in class who screwed the grading curve for everybody else yes officer sir couldnt the fact that subject smith is volatile and pampered go toward profile rather than away these traits could play in and his travel will be checked along with the others but hes bottom of the list for now fortneys ahead of him but not by much we when peabodys hand shot up again eve found herself caught between amusement and irritation what sir sorry im just trying to cross all the ts like in a sim doesnt fortney fit profile almost perfectly his upbringing his previously documented violence against women his current lifestyle yeah but hes bumped down mostly because hes just such an asshole she waited to see if peabody would comment and watched her aides brow knit as she chewed over the response i think our guy has more style which is why renquist and breen are neckinneck in my mind im going to corner breens wifes lover today and well see what that nets us i hear shes smoking mcnab commented and earned a frigid look from peabody of course one of my primary concerns is the fact that shes smoking eve said coolly ive no doubt this attribute will assist us in identifying and apprehending a man whos killed two women and brutally assaulted another in under two weeks moving along she said when mcnab at least pretended to look chastised as you edd guys didnt come in here doing the victory shuffle i assume we havent locked down the rental why dont you take this bright boy feeney said see if you can redeem yourself he used a wireless unit mcnab began he didnt bother to bounce or filter so it was fairly easy to trace back the transmission for the order originated from the renaissance hotel thats the fancy place on park you gotta be worth minimum of a mil just to get past the doorman the van was ordered four days ago at fourteen thirtysix lunchtime crowd eve commented my guess is he frequents the place knows where to go to shoot off a quick trans lots of big business types cart their pricey little portables to lunch meetings since he had very specific requirements for the order he either had the trans ready to go or he sat down in one of the privacy booths or at a nice table with a glass of wine and generated it there good well see if any of our choices lunched at the renaissance on the order date not smart she said with a satisfied nod smarter wouldve been to dress down use a cyberhole somewhere a place nobody knew him but he likes to show off he likes to play so he goes to an exclusive hotel where i just bet they know him by name peabody tell me about the plaster ive got building supply places in brooklyn in newark and in queens who did cash transactions for small quantities of plaster in the past sixty days none in medical supply places for that substance cash transactions none no sir credit or purchasing order from established accounts then i got a brainstorm and checked art supply outlets art supply yes sir you can sculpt with plaster and other forms of art may utilize it i got several hits in the city several more in the boroughs and new jersey for cash looks like were going to be busy then she checked her wrist unit the plaster from the scenes been in the lab long enough if they dont have an exact match on the type they should have lets see if dickhead can earn his salary and tell us if theres a difference between household medical and art plaster she looked at feeney feel like getting out of the house wouldnt mind a little fresh air let me know if you find any out there want to take the hotel long as i dont have to wear a tie peabody and i will give dickhead a push on our way to see the side dish she might hit on you mcnab commented maybe we should take her ow he grabbed his side where peabodys elbow jabbed jeez just kidding since youve been studying your brains out youve got no sense of humor im going to laugh really hard after i kick your ass kids kids eve could feel her eye starting to twitch lets save all this until after we catch the mean man and send him to his room feeney control your moron not another word peabody she gave her aide a solid push out the door peabody held it in until theyd driven five blocks eve figured it was a new record i just dont think he should talk about other women that way or look at them with that gleam in his eye we signed a lease oh jesus christ on stilts youve got lease fear peabody official document phobia get over it jesus christ on stilts it just came to me youre obsessing because you signed up for what is it a year and now youre all what if it doesnt work out who moves out who takes the communal salad plates or some stupid shit well maybe but thats normal isnt it how the hell do i know whats normal youre married sincerely shocked eve jerked the vehicle to a halt at a light that makes me normal it just makes me married do you know how many abnormal married people there are out there across this great land and beyond just take a look at the double ds that get called in manhattan borough alone marriage doesnt make people normal marriage isnt normal probably it just is why did you get married i her mind went blank he wanted to hearing just how lame that sounded she shifted in her seat and punched the gas its just a promise thats all a promise and you do your best not to break it like a lease there you go you know dallas thats almost wise now im wise she sighed let me give you my little tidbit for the day you want mcnab to stop thinking about looking at talking about other women then youd better take him to the vet and have him fixed hell make a nice pet women are the worst they zero in on some guy oh boy hes the one gotta get me that one so they do then they spend the rest of their time trying to figure out how to change him then if they manage it theyre not all that interested anymore because guess what hes not the one anymore peabody was silent for several moments somewhere in there is a lot of good sense if you tell me im sensible in addition to normal and wise im going to punch you in the stomach im as screwed up as the next person and i like it that way in many ways lieutenant youre even more screwed up than the next person its what makes you you i think ill punch you in the stomach anyway put it on my calendar she toyed with double parking which always put her in a good mood but found a spot on a street ramp the seventh avenue building looked ordinary even shabby but the security there rivaled that at the un she passed through the first post which required her badge a palm print and a scan at the second post a uniformed guard requested her business and a second scan she looked around the small lobby with its aging linoleum floor and bare beige walls what you keep government secrets in here more vital than that lieutenant the guard offered a slight grimace as he passed her back her id fashion secrets competitors try every damn thing to get a peek delivery scams mostly trying to get up to the design floor carrying deli bags or pizza boxes but you get some more inventive ones too phoney fire inspector last month id cleared too but the scan picked up his recorder and we booted him you on the job was and he seemed pleased shed made him put in my twentyfive most of it out of the onetwo this pays better and it can get pretty lively around here before the big spring and fall shows i bet you know serena unger designer here i might if you draw me a picture tall thin black beautiful thirtytwo short black hair with a reddish overcast sharp face long nose likes the ladies yeah i know the one you mean got a caribbean accent you got a line on her she may be a line to somebody else theres a woman shes playing with about the same age blonde snazzy looker five ten curvy slick and professional married gates julietta shes cleared through here a few times fashion writer seen the two of them go out together lunchtime end of business day hold on a minute he turned to his computer called up his log last hmm last eight months by my log gates checked in for unger ten times six months before that six hits for unger a once a month deal go back four more you only get two visits eighteen months she considered the dates of the other murders thanks happy to help here he unlocked a drawer and took out two lapel pins put these on and youll clear through the rest of security no hassle you want the east elevator bank fifteenth floor appreciate it no problem miss the job sometimes the rush you know yeah i know fifteen was a working floor with a hive of offices and a huddle of cubes for the drones unger didnt keep them waiting youre prompt i appreciate that she stepped around her desk to offer a hand my days stacked well try to let you get back to it she closed the door which told eve she was discreet it was a corner office which told eve she was successful and it was stylishly decorated with beachy prints rather than fashion posters she gestured to two chairs and took her own behind the desk i have to say im a little confused as to why the police would want to talk to me she was good eve thought but not quite good enough julietta had talked to her and she knew exactly why they were there if your days stacked ms unger why should we waste time doing the routine julietta gates would have told you weve spoken to her and her husband you look like a bright woman so youve figured out that we know about your relationship with julietta i like keeping my personal life personal unger swiveled in her chair her body language relaxed her voice cool and calm and i dont see what my relationship with julietta has to do with your investigation you dont have to see you just have to answer questions ungers perfectly arched brows rose into her high forehead well thats moving straight to the punch ive got a pretty stacked day myself you have a sexual relationship with julietta gates we have an intimate relationship which is different than a sexual one so you just sit up in your hotel room at the silby during your lunch breaks and chat ungers lips pressed together as insult moved across her face then she hissed out a breath i dont like being spied on i imagine thomas breen doesnt much like being cheated on we all have to live with what is she took a long breath you have a point julietta and i have an intimate relationship that includes sex and one that she prefers her husband remain unaware of how long have you had this intimate relationship weve known each other professionally for about four years our relationship began to change about two years ago though we didnt become intimate right away that would have been more like a year and a half ago eve suggested and unger set her jaw youre very thorough we have a great deal in common and were attracted to each other julietta was and is restless in her marriage this was her first affair and it remains the only time ive entered into such a relationship with a married woman or man for that matter i dont like cheating must be hard doing something you dont like for a couple years its not without its difficulties or its excitement i wont deny that initially we just forgot ourselves but rather than the onetime thing we both assumed it would be our feelings deepened i enjoy sex she shrugged in general i find women more interesting in bed than men but with julietta i found more a kind of mate youre in love with her i am i am in love with her and its difficult as we cant be together openly she wont leave her husband no she would but she knows that i wont be with her if she does now youve lost me she has a child a child deserves to have both of his parents when this is possible i wont be a party to removing that child that innocent from the security he has now its not the boys fault that his mother loves me instead of his father were adults and responsible and she doesnt agree with your stand on this if julietta has a flaw its that shes not as good a mother as she could be not as devoted or involved as i think she should be id like to have children one day and i expect my mate to want and care for the child as i will from all i know thomas breen is an excellent father but he cant be the boys mother only she can but hes not so hot as a husband as hes not mine it wouldnt be accurate or fair for me to judge but she doesnt love him or respect him she finds him tedious and too easily led you were with her on the night of september second yes at my apartment she told her husband she had a late meeting and you think hes buying it shes careful he hasnt confronted her she would have told me to be frank lieutenant i think she wishes he would and the following sunday morning when she took the boy out were you with them i met them in the park her voice warmed i enjoy the boy so youve spent time with him the three of you together once a week or so i want him to know me so hes comfortable when hes older perhaps well find a way to blend our relationships has julietta ever told you her husband is violent no believe me if there was violence in the home i would urge her to take the boy and leave his work is odd disturbing but he appears to leave it at that you suspect him of killing that woman in chinatown lieutenant if i believed him capable of such a thing id get my lover and her son away from him whatever it took you know the trouble with people having extramarital affairs peabody explaining why you never wear all that sexy underwear you bought at home theres that but its the delusion they really believe theyre getting away with it some do for the short haul but there are always tells too many late nights at the office secret link transmissions the friend of a friend who happens to see you having lunch with someone not your spouse in some outoftheway restaurant and beyond all that if that spouse isnt in a coma theres a sense a look a smell a change in touch serena ungers no dummy but actually believes breen hasnt got a clue and you dont he knows his wifes been playing pass the strapon with another woman for a year and a half he knows but if he does how can he ignore it just go around pretending everythings fine day after day it would have to eat away at you make you crazy which is exactly what youre getting at if roarke was fooling around with somebody what would you do theyd never find the bodies she tapped her fingers on the wheel as she sat in traffic women are ruining his happy home threatening his family worse it leaves him feeling dickless you spend all day writing about murder youre fascinated with it why not give it a try show those bitches whos boss i think its time to bring him in and press him but first well check out some of your plaster outlets maybe we can add weight peabody pulled out her ppc did a search for the closest address village art supplies west broadway lieutenant i know youre looking sharp at breen and renquist but ive got just the opposite direction which i sincerely hope doesnt piss you off so that you remember to punch me in the stomach ive seen you punch and its gotta hurt if i got pissed off at everyone who disagrees with me oh thats right i do but in this case ill make an exception big thanks for that why do you disagree okay peabody scooted around in her seat to face eves profile i think fortney fits the profile more he has no respect for women he hits them and hits on them because its a way to show what a big shot he is hes hooked up with a strong woman because shell take care of him and the more she takes care of him the more he resents it and the more he cheats on her hes got two exes who skinned him financially because he couldnt keep it in his pants and without pepper he probably wouldnt be able to get a meeting in his chosen field hes lied in interview to protect himself his alibis have more holes than a pound of swiss and hes theatrical those are all good points and a proud tear threatens my eye really about the tear no however all those points you make are why hes still on the list but when you lean toward a guy like breen i just dont see it a man that sweet with his kid and if he does know about the affair isnt it more likely hes holding it together because he loves his wife and son and just wants it to go away as long as he doesnt acknowledge it its not real i can see how somebodyd handle it that way he could convince himself it doesnt count because shes not with another man shes going through a phase experimenting whatever you could be right i could emboldened peabody pressed on and renquist hes just too prissy or something the whole sundaybrunchatten routine then theres his wife i can see her looking the other way if he likes to try on her underwear occasionally in the privacy of their own home but i cant see her living with a psychopath shes too prissy and shed have to know you could tell she has her finger on the pulse of that household so shed have to know something i think youre right about that nothing gets by her but i think she could live with a psychopath just fine as long as he doesnt drip any blood on her floors i met the woman who raised him peabody he married the same basic type just more upscale and stylish but you think fortney ill tell you what if we havent closed this by the day after tomorrow you take him take him where work him peabody make him your focus and see what comes up you think were going to close it soon but you may get your shot they checked out three outlets before eve decided it was time to go by the hospital to check on marlene cox she acknowledged the guard shed stationed outside the door and told him to take a tenminute break while peabody stood as relief inside she found mrs cox reading aloud from a book beside the bed while machines kept her daughter tethered to the world sela looked up then marked her place before setting the book aside they know people in comas can often hear sounds voices and respond to them it can be like being behind a curtain you cant quite open yes maam one of us takes turns reading to her mrs cox reached over fussed with the sheet that covered marlene last night we put in a disc jane eyre its one of marleys favorites have you read it no its a wonderful story love survival triumph and redemption i brought the book today i think hearing me read it would be comforting for her im sure youre right you think shes already gone thats what they think here though theyre very kind and theyre working very hard they think shes gone but i know shes not its not for me to say mrs cox do you believe in miracles im sorry ive forgotten your name im dallas lieutenant dallas do you believe in miracles lieutenant dallas ive never thought much about it i believe in them eve crossed to the bed and looked down marlenes face was colorless her chest moved gently up and down to the rhythm of the machine that breathed for her in constant whooshing notes she saw death all over her mrs cox he would have raped her he would have been brutal he would have done his best to keep her conscious during it so shed have felt the pain and the fear and the helplessness he would have reveled in that and he would have taken some time to torture her there were instruments in the van he would have used on her you want me to know that because she fought she escaped that she stopped him from doing those terrible things to her and thats a kind of miracle her breath shuddered as she fought back a sob well where there can be one there can be another as soon as she can open the curtain shell tell you who it was they told us she probably wouldnt live through the morning its past noon now can you tell me if you believe shes done why you came in today eve started to speak then shook her head and looked back at marlene i was going to tell you its routine but the fact is mrs cox she belongs to me too now thats the way it is for me when her communicator signaled she excused herself and stepped out into the corridor peabody she said the minute she ended transmission with me have we got something i had a man watching renquists place the nanny just took a cab to the metropolitan museum without the kid ive been looking for an opening to talk to her solo sophia was doing a slow walk through french impressionism eve spoke briefly to the shadow dismissed her then wandered in the au pairs direction sophia dicarlo eve held up her badge and watched the woman jolt and go pale i didnt do anything then you shouldnt look so guilty lets sit down i havent broken the law then dont start now by refusing to speak to a police officer it was hardly a criminal offense but she could see sophia didnt know that mrs renquist said i wasnt to speak to you how did you find me here i could lose my job its a good job i do a good job with rose im sure you do and mrs renquist doesnt have to know you spoke with me to ensure some cooperation eve took her arm and drew her to a bench in the center of the room why do you think mrs renquist doesnt want you to talk to me people gossip if the family and the staff are questioned by the police people will gossip her husband is a very important man very important people like to gossip about important men she wrung her hands as she spoke it wasnt often eve saw someone actually wring their hands nerves and something closer to fear shimmered around the woman like warning lights sophia i checked with ins youre legal why are you afraid to talk to the police i told you mr and mrs renquist brought me to america they gave me a job if theyre displeased they could send me away i love rose i dont want to lose my little girl how long have you worked for them five years rose was only a oneyearold shes such a good girl what about her parents are they easy to work for they they are very fair i have a beautiful room and a good salary i have one full day and one afternoon off every week i like to come here to the museum im improving myself do they get along the renquists i dont understand do they argue no not ever sophia went from looking terrified to desperate they are very proper at all times thats hard to swallow sophia youve lived in their home for five years and have never witnessed an impropriety never overheard an argument its not my place im making it your place five years eve thought at the going salary rate the woman would have a reasonable financial cushion the vague possibility of losing her job might upset her but not frighten her why are you scared of them i dont know what you mean yes you do it was in her eyes now too easily recognizable does he come to your room at night when the girls asleep when his wifes down the hall tears welled up spilled over no no i wont talk this way ill lose my job look at me eve gripped sophias busy hands squeezed ive just left the hospital where a woman is losing her life you will talk to me and youll tell me the truth you wont believe me hes a very important man youll say im a liar and ill be sent away thats what he told you no one will believe you i can do whatever i want because no one would believe it hes wrong look at me look at my face ill believe you the tears had to blur her vision but she must have seen something seen enough to have the words come flooding out he says i must because his wife will not not since she learned she carried a child they have separate rooms it is he says it is the civilized way of marriage and that its my place to let him touch me its not the civilized way of anything hes an important man and im just a servant though she continued to cry her voice held a cold finality if i speak of it hell send me away away from rose in disgrace shame my family ruin them so he comes to my room and he locks the door and he turns off the lights i do what he tells me to do and he leaves me again does he hurt you sometimes she looked down at her hands and the tears that dripped on them if hes not able not able to he becomes angry she knows sophia lifted her drenched eyes mrs renquist there is nothing that happens in the house that she doesnt know but she does nothing says nothing and i know in my heart she will hurt me more than he could if she finds out i spoke of it i want you to think back to the night the early morning of september second was he home i dont know i swear to you she rushed on before eve could speak my room is at the back of the house and my door is closed i dont hear if someone comes in or goes out i have an intercom for roses room its always on except except when he turns it off i never leave my room at night unless rose needs me the following sunday morning the family had brunch as they always do tenthirty exactly tenthirty no minute sooner no minute later earlier than that say eight oclock was he in the house then i dont know she bit her bottom lip as she tried to remember i think not i was in roses room helping her pick her dress for the day she must wear a proper dress on sunday i saw from the window mr renquist drive to the house it was perhaps ninethirty he sometimes plays golf or tennis on sunday mornings its part of his work to socialize what was he wearing i im sorry i dont remember a golf shirt i think i think not a suit but something casual for summer they dress carefully both of them appropriately and last night was he home all night i dont know he didnt come to my room this morning how did he behave this morning i didnt see him i was instructed to give rose her breakfast in the nursery we do this if mr or mrs renquist is very busy or unwell or if they have appointments which was it i dont know i wasnt told is there any place in the house where he goes that you and the child arent allowed his office hes a very important man doing very important work his office is locked and no one is to disturb him there okay i may need to talk to you again in the meantime i can help you what renquist is doing to you is wrong and its a crime i can make it stop please please if you do anything ill have to leave rose needs me mrs renquist doesnt love rose not the way i do and he he barely notices the child the other what he does its not important it isnt so very often not any longer i think he loses interest if you change your mind you can contact me ill help you chapter a call to renquists office netted her the information that hed been called out of town and would be unavailable for the next two days she went through the formality of making an appointment upon his return then drove to his house the housekeeper gave her the same information you see him leave you personally i beg your pardon you watch him walk out the door with his suitcase i fail to see the relevance of such a question but as it happens i carried mr renquists luggage to the car myself whered he go im not privy to that information and would not be free to divulge it if i were mr renquists duties often require travel i bet id like to see mrs renquist mrs renquist isnt at home nor is she expected to be until this evening eve looked past her into the house shed have given a months pay for a search warrant let me ask you something jeeves she winced stevens stevens when did the boss get this call to duty i believe he made the arrangements very early this morning howd he find out he was hitting the trail excuse me a transmission come in a call a private messenger whiz by what im afraid i dont know some housekeeper you are howd his eyes look this morning stevens looked perplexed then simply annoyed lieutenant mr renquists eyes are not my concern nor yours good day she thought about booting the door open when it started to shut in her face but decided it was a waste of energy peabody start the edd troops doing a search to find out where renquist went and how hes getting there i guess hes the one why it was peabodys turn to look perplexed and she hurried after eve to the vehicle hes molesting the nanny he and his wife lied about him being home all morning on sunday hes got a private locked room in his house and this morning hes conveniently called out of town so you cross off fortney just like that peabody youre an investigative slut but it all fits you can fit it this way too hes molesting the nanny because hes a royal shit and a perv his wifes not putting out and hes got a young pretty girl in the house whos afraid to say no they lied because theyre both royal shits who dont want to be hassled by the police and saying he was home is more convenient hes got a locked home office because hes got staff who might poke into sensitive material and a kid he doesnt want bothering him when hes working hes called out of town this morning because his line of work demands he get up and go when the call comes well hell if you dont think it from both ends you dont get the right answers now lets see how breen holds up in formal interview he was waiting examining the oneway glass when eve stepped into interview room b he turned and sent her one of his boyish smiles i know i should be pissed off and yelling lawyer but this is just iced happy to entertain you i had to leave jed with a neighbor though i dont trust the droid when im not in the house so i hope this isnt going to take too long then sit down and lets get started sure she engaged the recorder recited the case data and the revised miranda do you understand your rights and obligations mr breen oh yeah look i heard the media reports on the attack early this morning guy pulled a bundy what do you think why dont you let me ask the questions tom sorry habit he flashed a grin where were you this morning at two a m at home asleep i knocked off work about midnight by two i was sawing them off was your wife at home sure sawing them off right beside me but in a delicate ladylike manner you think you get points for witty remarks in here tom cant hurt saying nothing eve shifted her gaze to peabody well yeah peabody responded if you piss her off it can hurt trust me are you going to do the good cop bad cop gambit he rocked back in his chair balancing it casually on its back legs ive studied all the basic interrogation techniques i can never figure out why that one works i mean come on its the oldest one in the books no the oldest one in the books is where i take you into a private room and during our little chat you trip and somehow manage to break your face he continued to rock while he studied eve i dont think so youve got an attitude for sure and some innate violent tendencies but you dont pound on suspects too much integrity youre a good cop he spoke earnestly now obviously high on his own intellect and intuition the kind that digs in and doesnt let go because you believe more than anything else you believe in the spirit of the law maybe not the letter but the spirit maybe you take shortcuts now and then stuff that doesnt find its way into your official reports but youre careful about the lines the ones you cross the ones you dont and beating confessions out of suspects isnt one of your shortcuts now he looked at peabody nailed her didnt i mr breen you couldnt nail the lieutenant if you made the attempt your lifes work shes beyond your scope oh come on he gave an irritated little twist of his lips you just dont want to admit im as good at this sort of game as you are listen when you study murder you dont just study murderers you study cops and victims eve put in sure and victims all that studying researching analyzing writing that would hone your observational skills wouldnt it writers are born observers its what we do so when youre writing about crime youre writing about who committed it who it happened to who investigated it and so on in essence youre writing about people you know people thats right an observant guy like you youd pick up on nuances on habits on what people think how they behave what they do right again so being so observant so in tune with human nature and behavior you wouldnt have missed the fact that your wifes out having chick sex while youre at home playing horsey with your kid that wiped the smug look off his face as if shed hit a delete button what replaced it was the shock that turned the skin shiny white before the heat of humiliation and rage bloomed youve got no right to say something like that come on tom your amazing powers of observation havent failed you inside your own little castle where a man is king you know what shes been up to or maybe i should say down on shut up its gotta be a pisser doesnt it shaking her head eve rose strolled around the table to lean over his shoulder to speak directly in his ear she doesnt even have the courtesy to fuck another guy while youre home playing mommy what does that say about you tom the sex was so boring she decided to see what it was like in the other end of the pool doesnt say much for your equipment does it i said shut up i dont have to listen to this kind of crap fists balled he pushed up from the chair eve shoved him down again yeah you do your wife wasnt at a meeting the night jacie wooton was slaughtered she was with her lover her female lover you know that dont you tom you know shes been sneaking off cheating on you for nearly two years how do you feel about that tom how does it feel to know she wants another woman loves another woman gives herself to another woman while youre raising the son you made together keeping the house together being more of a wife than she ever was bitch he covered his face with his hands goddamn bitch ive got to have some sympathy for you tom here you are doing it all the house the kid the career an important career too youre somebody but you go the professional father route and thats admirable while she spends her day in a big office having meetings about clothes for christs sake eve gave a hefty sigh slowly shook her head about what people are going to wear and thats more important to her than her family she ignores you and the kid your mother did the same but jule she takes it another step lying cheating whoring herself with another woman instead of standing up and being a wife being a mother shut up cant you just shut up you want to punish her for that tom who could blame you you want to get some of your own back who the hell wouldnt it eats at you day after day night after night makes you a little crazy women theyre just no damn good are they she sat on the edge of the table close pushing into his space knowing he could feel her pushing even as she felt him vibrating she looks me right in the eyes and lies i love her i hate her for that hate her because i still love her she doesnt think about us she puts that woman ahead of us and i hate her for it you knew she wasnt at a meeting did you stew about that while she was gone and she came home and went up to bed tired too tired to be with you because shed been with another woman did you wait until she was upstairs settled in before you left the house did you take your tools down to chinatown imagine yourself as jack the ripper powerful and terrifying and beyond the law did you see your wifes face when you cut jacie wootons throat i didnt leave the house she wouldnt know if you went out she doesnt pay any attention to you she doesnt care enough she saw him flinch when she said it watched his shoulders hunch as if bracing for hammering blows how many times did you go down to chinatown before you did jacie in that alley tom a guy like you does his research how many trips did it take over there to scope out the whores and junkies i dont go to chinatown never been to chinatown a native new yorker ive been there of course ive been there he was starting to sweat now and the cockiness had been replaced by shaky nerves i mean i dont go there for i dont use lcs tom tom eve clucked her tongue and sat across from him again there was a pleasant smile on her face and a look of amused incredulity in her eyes a young healthy man like you youre going to tell me you never paid for a quick blow job your wife hasnt been inclined to give you much of a bounce for what close to two years and you havent made use of a perfectly legal service if thats true you must be pretty wrought up or maybe you just cant get it up anymore and thats why your wife checked out the competition theres nothing wrong with me his color came up again jules just i dont know she just has to get this out of her system and okay so ive hired an lc a few times since things have gotten messed up at home jesus im not a eunuch shes making you one shes insulted belittled betrayed you maybe you were just going out to pick up some stranger guys entitled when his wife shuts him out maybe things got out of hand all that anger and frustration just built up thinking about how shed lied to you how she was in your bed fresh from another woman lying cheating making you nothing she let that single word vibrate in the room let it slap at him you needed some attention goddamn it youve got a head full of men who knew how to get attention knew how to make a woman stand up and take notice had to feel good to rip into jacie into the symbol of her to cut out what made her a woman to make her pay make them all pay for ignoring you no he wet his lips and his breath shuddered through them no youve got to be out of your mind out of your mind im not talking to you anymore i want a lawyer are you going to let me beat you too tom you gonna let some female cop beat you down once you call the lawyer i win the round start whining lawyer and i charge you with suspicion of murder in the first two counts assault with intent one count i get to squeeze your balls blue that is if youve still got balls to squeeze his breath hissed in and out in and out in the silence that followed and he turned his face from hers i dont have anything else to say until ive consulted with my attorney looks like its my point then this interview is ended to allow the subject to arrange for legal representation at his request record off peabody arrange for the standard psych exam for mr breen and escort him to holding where he can contact his legal rep yes sir mr breen he got shakily to his feet you think youve humiliated me he said to eve you think youve broken me down but youre too damn late julietta already took care of that she waited until hed gone out then she walked over and stared at her own reflection in the mirror exhausted she went back to her office for once she couldnt face the buzz of coffee and opted for water standing by her stingy window she drank like a camel and watched the air and street traffic people came people went she observed they didnt know what the hell went on in here didnt want to know just keep us safe that was the bottom line when they gave the cops inside the building a passing thought just do your job and keep us safe we dont care how you do it as long as it doesnt spill over on us lieutenant eve continued to stare out the window you got him tucked yes sir hes contacted the lawyer and hes clammed he requested a second transmission re childcare i um i authorized it with supervision he contacted the neighbor and asked if she could keep jed for several more hours said hed gotten tied up with something he made no request to contact his wife eve simply nodded you were pretty rough on him in there is that an observation or a complaint an observation i know youre going to say im an investigative slut but hes starting to look good to me the way you sprang knowledge of the wifes affair on him he never recovered from that no he didnt and pushing the lc angle the way he fumbled it denying any association then breaking down and admitting it to prove to you he was still sexually capable yeah that was stupid of him you dont sound too juiced about it im tired im just tired maybe you want to take a break before you wrap him up the lawyers got to get here do the consult youve got an hour anyway if you want to grab a bunk eve started to speak started to turn and trueheart stepped in excuse me lieutenant but pepper franklin is here wants to see you i didnt know if you wanted me to pass her through yeah go ahead do you want me to sit in peabody asked her when trueheart left or go babysit breen fortney was your pick before you decided to be fickle lets both hear what she has to say she walked to her desk sat and swiveled toward the door when pepper entered the actress was wearing enormous silver sunshades and bright red lip dye her glamorous hair was pulled straight back in a long sleek tail the sunny yellow skinsuit was in direct opposition to the murderous expression on her lovely face get us some coffee peabody have a seat pepper what can i do for you you can arrest that lying cheating son of a bitch leo and drop him in the deepest darkest hole you can find until the flesh rots off his fucking bones no need to stifle your emotions in here pepper tell us how you really feel im not in the mood for jokes she whipped off the shades and revealed an impressive shiner it would be more impressive in a few hours eve judged when the blood finished gathering in bruises bet that hurts im too mad to feel it i found out hes been boffing my understudy my goddamn understudy and the assistant stage manager and christ knows who else when i confronted him he denied it just kept lying telling me i was imagining things have you got any vodka no sorry probably just as well i woke up about three this morning i dont know why generally i sleep like im in a coma but i woke up and he wasnt there i was confused and concerned so i did a house scan and damned if it didnt tell me he was there in bed well he wasnt there in bed hed programmed it to say so i suppose if i ever got suspicious and ran a replay the system would verify that hed never left the house bastard i guess you looked through the place to make sure it wasnt a glitch and he was in the kitchen raiding the autochef of course i did i was worried bitterness spewed out like acid that was my only thought then i looked all over the house and i waited and i thought about calling the police then it occurred to me he might have just gone out for a walk or a drive or jesus i dont know and the security system was faulty i convinced myself and i actually dozed off in the chair about six when i woke up a couple hours later there was a message on the link she reached into a handbag the size of nebraska and pulled out the disc do you mind id like to hear it again sure eve took it slid it into her own link and requested message play leos voice spilled out good morning sleepyhead didnt want to wake you you looked so beautiful snuggled up in bed got up early decided to head straight to the health club and ended up having a breakfast meeting you never know who youll run into ive got a pretty full schedule so i wont be back until after youve left to record that promo spot this afternoon youll be great probably wont see you until after the show tonight ill wait up cause i miss you baby doll baby doll my butt pepper uttered he sent the transmission silent about sixfifteen he knows im never up before seventhirty never sleep past eight he never came home last night but he was covering himself i went to his office but hed called that bimbo hes probably been doing and told her he wouldnt be in all day she was surprised to see me as apparently hed told her that i was having some sort of emotional crisis and he needed to stay with me ill show him an emotional crisis she rose saw there wasnt room to pace then dropped down again i postponed the promo spot went home and went through his office thats how i found out hes been sending flowers and tasteful little gifts to his fucking harem and i found receipts for hotel rooms names and dates on his personal calendar he showed up about three looking all surprised to see me all delighted her bruised eye flashed fury hed had a couple of cancellations and wasnt this lucky why didnt we go upstairs to bed and get lucky again im assuming you told him his luck had run out in spades i hit him with not being home all night and he tried to make me think id been dreaming or sleepwalking when i showed him the copies id made of his personal receipts and date book he had the nerve the fucking nerve to act hurt and insulted if i didnt trust him we had a serious problem she paused lifted a hand to indicate she needed a moment i couldnt believe what i was hearing coming out of his mouth so smooth so practiced well well i dont have any alcohol in here eve said into the silence how about a hit of coffee thanks but just some water if you dont mind while peabody moved to take care of it pepper picked up her shades by the earpiece twirled them no point in going into all the ugly details but when he realized i wasnt buying when i explained to him that it was done he was out out of the house the office the expense account and my life the shit hit the fan and his fist hit my face where is he now i have no idea thanks she said when peabody handed her some water i expect you to find him dallas and arrest him id have worse than a black eye if i hadnt had a security droid on standby id done that because i wanted the droid to escort him upstairs wait while he packed up what belonged to him and escort him out instead when i called out it came in while leo was coming toward me ready to hit me again it hauled him up and heaved him out she drank slow sips until the glass was empty he said vicious things to me pepper continued crude vicious horrible things it was my fault he was seduced his term seduced by other women because i was so controlling even in bed how it was past time he showed me who was in charge around here because he was through taking orders from from some bossy cunt she shuddered he was screaming that sort of thing at me before the droid came in i was terrified i didnt know i could be terrified not really i didnt know he could be the way he was in those few awful minutes get her some more water peabody eve ordered when pepper started to shake id rather be mad than scared she dug into the bag again found a laceedged handkerchief and mopped at her streaming eyes im all right when im just mad i know about the woman who was attacked last night and the report speculated its connected with two murders the ones you asked me about and i thought oh god oh god i thought leo could have done it the leo i saw today could have done it i dont know what to do youre going to file a complaint and were going to bring charges of assault well track him down and bring him in he wont touch you again this time she only stared into the water peabody gave her and her voice dropped to a whisper im afraid to be alone im ashamed that hes made me a coward but youre not a coward you just had some guy who outweighs you by a good thirty sock his fist into your eye and threaten to do more if you werent shaken up youd be stupid youre not stupid because you came in and youre bringing charges what if he killed those women i slept beside him i made love with him what if he did those horrible things then came home to me lets take it one step at a time once weve done the paperwork i can arrange for an officer to stay at home with you if youd feel safer having a cop as well as your security droid i would i very much would but id need him or her to come to the theater i have a performance at eight she smiled wanly the show must go on by the time shed sent pepper and her police escort off to broadway the stress and fatigue had a headache swirling behind eves eyes shed put out an apb on fortney and the dragnet was already spreading she met with breens attorney let the preliminary complaints roll off her but when he demanded his client be allowed to return home and tend to his minor child she didnt argue in fact she surprised the attorney by postponing further questioning until nine the next morning and she assigned two men to stake out breen and his house overnight she sat back down in her office already past the end of shift and thought about coffee about sleep about work when mcnab jogged in he looked so bright and energetic it hurt to look at him cant you ever wear anything that doesnt glow she demanded summertime dallas guys gotta glow got some news should put a glow back in your cheeks fortney booked a firstclass seat on a shuttle to new la hes en route quick work mcnab he shot out his index finger blew on it fastest edd man in the east lieutenant you look well and truly beat nothing wrong with your vision either take peabody home make sure she gets a good nights sleep which is my delicate way of saying restrain yourself from rabbiting together half the night she needs a clear and alert mind tomorrow you got it you might try that good nights sleep yourself eventually she mumbled then started the process of extraditing fortney and arranging for local authorities to meet him when he stepped off the shuttle peabody bounced in lieutenant mcnab said you said i should just put in a revolving door because everybody just walks in and out as they damn well please anyway the door was open its almost always open mcnab said i was relieved but i havent yet contacted authorities in new la re fortney or transmitted the warrant its done theyll pick him up ship him back and have promised to take just enough time to ensure hell spend the night in a cell he wont wrangle a bail hearing until morning its my job to shut up peabody go home get a meal get some sleep the exam starts oh eight hundred sharp sir i believe it might be necessary to postpone the exam as this case is at a crucial point fortney and i see that my initial instincts there were right will have to be interviewed and youll want to interview breen and try to arrange an interview with renquist to tie the matter up i feel its inappropriate for me to take a half day minimum for personal business during this stage of the investigation got the jitters well yeah that too but youll take the exam peabody if you have to wait another three months to take it one of us will jump off the nearest building or more likely ill just pitch you off i think somehow i can muddle through the day without you but i think report at exam room one oh eight hundred officer thats an order i dont believe you can actually order me to take she trailed off swallowed hard when eve lifted her gaze but ah i understand the spirit of the statement sir im going to try not to let you down jesus peabody youre not going to let me down whatever you do on the exam and youll be stop peabody squeezed her eyes closed dont say anything thatll jinx it dont say it or any sentence with the word luck in it youd better go take a pill i might she gave a shaky smile dont wish me the l word okay but maybe you could do like a signal or a sign you could do this peabody showed her teeth in a grin widened her eyes to show enthusiasm and punched out her fist with her thumb sticking up leaning back eve cocked her head what is that im supposed to signal you to stick your thumb up your ass no its thumbsup jeez dallas thumbsup never mind peabody eve rose halting her aide before she could stalk out of the office commencing at oh eight hundred hours i expect you to kick exam butt yes sir thanks chapter when eve dragged herself home there was one thought uppermost in her mind to get herself horizontal on a flat surface for one blessed hour fortney was on his way back to new york under wraps and by god he could stew in a cage for a few hours shed deal with breen in the morning and renquist though smith was down on her list hed be watched for the next little while but she couldnt watch anyone with eyes that felt like a couple of burnt cinders stuck in her face she just needed to stretch out she told herself give her head a chance to clear she walked through a fog of fatigue into the cool and gorgeous quiet of the house the fog shimmered and tore apart and summerset stepped through it you are as usual late she stared for a moment while her numbed brain struggled to process tall bony ugly annoying oh yeah he was back she found the energy to peel off her linen jacket and tossed it on the newel just to irritate him it was amazing how much better the act made her feel howd you get through airport security with that steel pike up your ass ordering herself not to stagger she bent to pick up the cat who was busy threading himself between her legs she stroked galahads head look its back didnt i tell you to change the security code the disgrace you call a vehicle does not belong in front of the house nor he added picking up her jacket with two thin fingers is this the proper place for articles of clothing she started up the stairs stifling a yawn bite me he watched her go smiled thinly at her back it was good to be home she went straight to the bedroom managed to make it up to the platform where she dumped the cat on the bed seconds before she fell facedown onto it herself she was asleep before galahad padded his way over and curled up on her butt roarke found her there as hed expected from the brief report from summerset finally hit the wall have you he murmured noting she hadnt removed her weapon harness or boots he gave the cat an absent scratch between the ears then settled down in the sitting area to work while she slept she didnt dream not at first but simply lay at the bottom of a dark pool of exhaustion only when she began to surface did the dreams come in vague shapes and muffled sounds a hospital bed with a pale figure on it marlene cox then herself as a child both battered both helpless then the darker shapes that swirled around the bed the cop she was staring down at the child shed been there were questions to be answered you have to wake up and answer the questions or hell do it again to someone else theres always another victim but the figure in the bed didnt stir the face changed from her own to marlenes to jacie wootons to lois greggs then back to her own something began to rise up inside her that was both anger and fear youre not dead not like the others you have to wake up damn it wake up and stop him one of those swirling shapes coalesced stood on the opposite side of the bed the man whod battered the child and haunted the woman its never really over his eyes were bright with humor in his bloody face it never ends theres always going to be another no matter what you do you might as well sleep little girl better to sleep than to keep walking with the dead keep walking and youll be one of them he reached over pressed his hand over the childs mouth her eyes opened full of pain full of fear eve could only stare unable to move to protect to defend only stare into her own eyes as they glazed over and died she woke with a strangled gasp and in roarkes arms ssh youre just dreaming his lips pressed against her temple im right here hold on to me only a dream im okay but she kept her face buried against his shoulder until she got her breath back im okay hold on to me anyway for he wasnt never really was when she wandered through nightmares no problem she could already feel her pulse begin to level off and the ugly smear of terror over her mind fade she could smell him soap and skin and there was the lovely brush of his hair against her cheek her world steadied what time is it how long was i out it doesnt matter you needed to sleep now you need food and more sleep she wasnt going to argue she was starving more she recognized that tone in his voice and it meant hed find a way to pour a soother down her throat if she gave him the smallest opening i could use a meal but i could use something else first what you know how sometimes you get in a mood when you touch me when you love me and its all tender like you know im feeling raw inside i do she tipped her head back touched his cheek show me here now he feathered his lips over her brow her cheeks her mouth as he released her weapon harness will you tell me whats wrong she nodded just be with me first i need i just need you he eased her back on the bed slipped off her boots he hated to see the shadows under her eyes the shadows in them she looked so pale as if he could pass a hand through her and if he did shed vanish like one of his own dreams he didnt have to be told to be gentle didnt need her long quiet sigh to know it was love that would feed her now when i came in and you were sleeping i thought theres my soldier exhausted from her wars he lifted her hand kissed her fingers now i look and i think theres my woman soft and lovely her lips curved as he undressed her where do you get this stuff it just comes to me ive only to look at you and the world comes to me youre my life she reared up threw her arms around him the sob wanted to leap out of her throat but she feared if she let it out it would never stop with her lips pressed to the warm curve of his neck she rocked take me away she silently begged oh god take me away just for a little while as if he heard her he began to stroke gently to soothe to comfort whatever he crooned quieted her troubled soul until she relaxed in his arms and let him lead the way his lips were soft soft and warm when they found hers he took the kiss deep but slowly so she could drift into it and into him degree by degree he felt her surrender to it his strong and valiant soldier until she was pliant as wax fluid as water her mind misted over there were no nightmares here no shadows lurking in the corners there was only roarke and those almost lazy caresses those soft and dreamy kisses that took her under into a quiet eddy of peace sensations layered each one tissue thin coating over the fatigue and the despair she hadnt realized had bloomed inside her his mouth cruised over her breast stirred up her heartbeat as his tongue circled her tasted her she ran her hands over his back tracing the shape of him the muscle and bone death with its infinite faces was a world away when his mouth his hands became more demanding she was ready ready for those first shimmers of heat those long liquid pulls inside her belly turned her sigh into a moan he took his time endless time arousing fascinating and being fascinated her body was a joy to him with its long sleek lines the supple skin the surprising curves he could watch the pleasure bloom on her feel it spread through her with little quivers and shifts and at last when they were both ready he felt it burst through her that gorgeous throaty moan that lovely and helpless shudder the orgasm was a long hot wave that flooded body heart mind the sheer release of it was glorious like life she would have folded herself around him then wrapped him tight taken him in but he linked his fingers with hers and used his mouth to give her more she couldnt resist he weighed her down with tenderness and when a sob did escape it was one of stunned joy as she crested again a thousand pulses beat thickly nerves danced over her skin shivering at every brush of his lips her muscles had gone lax and everything she was lay open to him he watched her face as his lips rubbed lightly over hers her fingers tightened on his and her lips curved before she said his name before she rose up to meet him when they were still and quiet he lay with his head on her breast he thought she might sleep again more peacefully now but she lifted a hand threading her fingers through his hair i was so tired she said quietly i had to put the car on auto i felt so weighed down and punchy and stupid i had a pretty crappy day in a really crappy case its not just the victims not just the women its like hes pointing a finger at me when he kills them and that makes you one of them thank god was all she could think thank god he understands one of them and not she said thinking of her dream one of them and the one whos standing for them when its too late eve he lifted his head looked into her eyes its not its never too late you know that better than anyone usually usually i do there was something in her tone that had him sitting up drawing her with him then cupping her face so he could study it you know who he is yeah i know but the tricks stopping him proving it putting him away i knew in my gut from the start i needed to clear my head out so i could start taking the right steps you need to eat and tell me about it i guess i need to eat then i have to tell you about something else she scraped her hair back with both hands i want to take a shower and pull myself together first all right he knew her well enough to give her room well have something up here ill take care of it her throat filled and she dipped her head so her brow rested on his you know something handy about you you take care he wanted to gather her in then to push her to tell him what troubled her mind but he let her go she would run the water too hot he thought as he rose to get robes for both of them to select the sort of meal that would do her the most good then she would stand under the spray willing it to beat the energy back into her she wouldnt waste time with a towel but step directly into the drying tube and more heat no she wouldnt sleep again he knew as he set the meal in the sitting area not yet not for a time yet she would fuel then she would work then she would collapse it was one of the most fascinating and frustrating things about her she came back wearing the robe hed hung on the bathroom door a thin and simple black robe he doubted she knew she owned what is that green stuff asparagus its good for you she thought it looked like something youd whack out of a cartoon garden but the fish and rice with it looked pretty good so did the glass of strawcolored wine she went for the wine first hoping it would make the green stalks go down easier how come stuff thats good for you always has to be green and funnylooking because nutrition doesnt come in a candy bar it ought to youre stalling eve maybe she stabbed one of the stalks shoved it into her mouth it wasnt half bad but she made a disgusted face for form thats not what i meant i know she flaked off a bite of fish i had a dream about my mother dream or memory i dont know both she ate scooped up rice i think both i was in an apartment or a hotel room i dont know which but apartment i think some dump i was three four how do you tell i dont know me either anyway she told him of being alone of going into the bedroom playing with the enhancements the wig though shed been forbidden maybe kids always do what you tell them not to i dont know but i it was irresistible i think i wanted to look pretty i thought all that junk would make me look pretty dolling up thats what they call it dont they i was dolling up because once when she was in a good mood she told me i looked like a little doll children roarke said carefully must i think have an instinctive need to please their mothers at least during those early years i guess i didnt like her i was afraid of her but i wanted her to like me to tell me i was pretty or something hell she shoveled in more food i got so into it i didnt hear them come back she walked in saw me she belted me i think she was jonesing thats the cop talking but i think she was there were works on the dresser i didnt know what they were i mean as a kid i didnt but you dont have to explain yeah she kept eating she was afraid the food would stick in her throat but she kept eating she was screaming at me and i was crying sprawled on the floor bawling she was going to clock me again but he wouldnt let her he picked me up her stomach roiled at the memory shit oh shit when her fork clattered to her plate roarke reached over gently eased her head down between her knees all right then long and slow take long slow breaths his voice was gentle as was the hand on her head but his face was murderous i cant stand him putting his hands on me even then it made my skin crawl he hadnt touched me yet hadnt raped me yet but some part of me mustve known how could i have known instinct he pressed his lips to the back of her head as his heart ripped to pieces a child knows a monster when she sees one maybe maybe okay im okay she sat up let her head lean back i couldnt stand to have him touch me but i sort of curled into him anything to get away from her from what i saw in her eyes she hated me roarke she wanted me dead no more she wanted me erased she was a whore it was a whores tools on the dresser a whore and a junkie and she looked at me as if i were dirt i came out of her i think she hated me more because i did though her hand wasnt quite steady she reached for the wine used it to wet her dry throat i dont understand that i thought i guess i figured she couldnt be as bad as he was i grew inside her so there had to be something but she was as bad as he was maybe even worse theyre part of you she jerked when he said it and he closed his hands over hers kept his eyes fierce on hers what makes you eve is the fact that you are what you are despite that in spite of them her voice was strangled but she had to speak i love you a hell of a lot right now then were even roarke i didnt know didnt realize i wanted there to be something to have something from her until i realized for certain there wasnt stupid its not his heart broke a little more as he brought her hands one at a time to his lips no its not was tonight the first youve had the dream he saw it the combination of guilt and embarrassment that rushed into her face his fingers tightened on hers before she had a chance to draw her hands away that wasnt what this was about tonight his tone was flat a warning that made her hackles rise in defense how long ago eve a while a few days last week how the hell do i know i didnt mark it on my damn calendar having a few dead bodies fall at my feet tends to prey on my mind i dont have some handy admin keeping track of my every move and thought you think turning this into a fight will distract me from the fact youve kept this from me for days before we went to boston too angry to sit he pushed to his feet before that before i asked you what was wrong and you brushed me off with a handy lie i didnt lie i just didnt tell you i couldnt tell you because she trailed off shifted gears quickly i wasnt ready thats all bollocks i dont even know what that means she speared another asparagus and ate determinedly you made a decision not to tell me he sat again crowding her why you know ace maybe you could bag your ego for five fucking minutes so this isnt about you its my deal so hey she nearly slammed him back when he gripped her chin but he outmaneuvered her nudging her back so he could stare into her eyes but it is about me isnt it im following the path of your busy brain well enough now i think what i found out about my mother not long ago stopped you from letting me be there for you with this look youre still messed up about it you dont think you are not the big strong man but you are youve got bruises all over you and i can see them so i didnt figure dumping this on you would do any good because thinking of your mother who had no love for you would only bring the grief for my own who did love me closer to the surface something like that let go he didnt thats a flawed and stupid logic he leaned in kissed her long and hard and id have done the same i imagine i do grieve for her i dont know if ill ever stop completely and i dont know how id have begun to get through it without you dont shut me out i was just trying to give us both some time to settle understood accepted but we seem to settle better together dont you think where did she hit you staring at him she touched the back of her hand to her cheek then felt her heart stumble when he leaned in touched his lips gently to the spot as if it were still painful never again he told her weve beaten them darling eve separately and together weve beaten them for all the nightmares and the bitterness weve still won she took a breath are you going to be pissed off when i tell you i talked to mira about this a few days ago no did it help some this helped more she toyed with her food again cleaned me out maybe my brain will start cooking again i was so off when i got home i couldnt fling a decent insult at summerset and ive been saving up hmm was roarkes only response i had some good ones stockpiled theyll come back to me but my heads crowded with this business and the case then theres peabody driving me over the edge its tomorrow for her isnt it thank god ill hit fortney and breen tomorrow while shes in exam i can get feeney to team with me and then oh speaking of hitting fortney socked pepper excuse me blackened her eye she came in filed charges so that smoothes the way to holding him ive shuffled things so he wont be able to whine for bail until tomorrow i already had round one with breen today he started out smirky but i wiped that off his face ive got him shadowed until our scheduled interview tomorrow renquist is reportedly out of the city on business i thought i might tug on one of my connections and see if thats the case or just a runaround would it be my ego talking again if i assume im that connection she gave him a quick toothy grin youre pretty handy to have around even after sex darling thats so touching ive got smith locked down too i want to know where all of them are until i can push for a warrant and how do you know which of the four is your man i recognized him she replied then shook her head but thats gut and you cant arrest on gut theres only one who fits the profile right down the line only one whod have needed to feed himself by writing the notes i need to eliminate the other three build the case on the one once i tie the travel to the other murders ill have enough for a search warrant hes got stuff the paper the tools the costumes hes kept all that tomorrow the next day ill get in and ill have him are you going to tell me who it is i think well work on the elimination process do the travel and murder dates see if you start leaning in the direction ive taken youve got a pretty good gut yourself for a civilian such flattery then it appears were going to work yeah i shit her pocket link beeped ive got it she said leaping up to scramble to the platform where the bed stood and grab her trousers from off of the floor she dragged it out of a pocket flipped it on dallas lieutenant sela coxs tearstreaked face filled the screen and had eves heart dropping to her knees mrs cox shes awake the tears kept falling even as she smiled brilliantly the doctors with her now but i thought i should tell you as soon as i could im on my way she started to click off stopped herself mrs cox thank you ill be waiting for you i just got a miracle eve told roarke and dragged on her trousers then she found she had to sit just give into weak legs for one moment i saw her face in my dream tonight hers and the others my own i saw her face and i thought she was dead that id been too late for her and she was dead i was wrong she took a deep breath as roarke came over to join her i saw him too my father standing on the other side of the hospital bed he said it never ended anyway theres always another victim and i might as well give up before i was dead too and he was wrong youre damn right she pushed to her feet im not tagging peabody i want her fresh for the exam want to stand in lieutenant i already am chapter she strode down the hospital corridor shed hooked her badge on her belt to stop any medicals from getting in her way roarke wanted to tell her the fire in her eyes would have done the job but he was afraid it might dim that fierce light and he enjoyed seeing it too much to take the chance the guard shed placed at the door to icu was at attention when she turned the corner in roarkes opinion the uniform had likely scented her energy and whipped himself on alert even as she reached for the door it swung open the doctor roarke thought was a more courageous soul he barred her path folding his arms across his chest and using a frown as a shield i was told youd been notified and were en route the patient is barely conscious and drifting in and out her condition is still critical i wont risk having her interrogated at this point twentyfour hours ago you told me shed never regain consciousness she has frankly i consider it a miracle shes come out of a coma even briefly sela cox had asked for another miracle eve thought and by god shed gotten it i dont believe in wasting miracles somebody put her in that room and theres a chance she can tell me who before he puts someone else in the hospital or the goddamn morgue now her voice lashed like a whip that had the uniform wincing you dont want to get in my face on this on the contrary laurence kept his melodious voice low i am in your face on this and this is my turf my patients welfare is paramount on that last point were in perfect agreement i want her alive and well for her testimony goddamn right if you think that makes me the enemy then youre just stupid i put her in the dead column laurence just like you but she showed us both what shes made of now i want her to know the man who did this to her has been put away i want her to know im going to do that for her and that she had a part in making it happen right now shes just a victim im going to help make her a hero thats something to live for youve got two choices she said before he could speak again i have this officer restrain you or you go in with me and supervise i dont like your tactics lieutenant file a complaint she pushed open the door glanced at roarke over her shoulder i need you to wait when she stepped in her heart sank again marlene lay still and deathly pale in the bed her mother stood beside her holding her hand shes just resting sela said quickly when you said youd come i asked my husband to go down to the chapel theyll only let two of us in here at a time mrs cox i must tell you again lieutenant dallas presence is against medical orders your daughter needs to remain calm and quiet shes been quiet since this was done to her and she wont be calm until hes caught and punished im grateful to you doctor more than i can begin to say but marley needs to do this i know my child watch your step laurence warned eve or youll be the one restrained she kept her focus on marlene as she moved to the side of the bed you should talk to her mrs cox i dont want to scare her ive told her you were coming sela leaned over the bed touched her lips to her daughters forehead marley marley baby wake up now lieutenant dallas is here to talk to you so tired mom the words were slurred and soft i know baby just for a little while the lieutenant needs your help i know youve been through a lot eve ignored the doctor as he edged closer i know this is hard im not going to let him get away with what he did to you were not going to let him get away with it marley you and me you got away from him you stopped him once you can help me stop him once and for all her eyes fluttered open it was painful to watch the effort of lifting those lashes the intense focus in those eyes eve recognized the look the determination of fighting back pain its all blurred all runs together cant bring it clear thats all right tell me whatever you can you were coming home from work you took the subway always take the subway just a few blocks hot night feet hurt there was a van little moving van marlene shifted restlessly but before the doctor could move sela was stroking her daughters hair its all right baby its all over now nobodys going to hurt you again youre safe im right here man big cast on his arm never seen big cast like that couldnt couldnt get the sofa in kept sliding back out thumping against the street felt sorry for him mommy deliberately eve stepped closer took marlenes other hand he cant get to you now hes never going to touch you again he thinks he beat you but he didnt youve already won her eyes fluttered again i cant remember much i was going to help him then something hit me it hurt i never hurt like that i dont know after that i dont know tears began to leak i cant remember anything after that except mom talking to me or dad or my brother uncle pete was uncle pete here and aunt dora yes honey everyones been here i was just floating somewhere while they talked to me then i woke up here before he hurt you you looked at him eve felt marleys fingers twitch in hers i bet you hesitated a little got an impression of him you figured he was okay just some guy in trouble youre too smart to go up to someone who looked dangerous he had that big cast and he looked so upset and frustrated he was cute curly dark hair curly hair and a ball cap i think i cant he looked over at me and smiled can you see him now in your head can you see him marley yes i think its not clear im going to show you some pictures i want you to look at them and tell me if one of them is the man with the cast just see his face in your head and look at the pictures ill try she wet her lips im so thirsty here you are sweetheart all but crooning sela brought a cup and straw to her daughters lips take your time remember youre safe now hard to stay awake hard to think shes had enough lieutenant at laurences voice marley stirred again struggled to look toward him i heard you when i was floating i heard you you told me not to give up that you wouldnt give up if i didnt thats right it was the compassion in his voice on his face that had eve stifling her impatience and you didnt give up laurence said youve made me look real good around here give me one more minute eve pleaded with him just one more minute marley and well be all done youre the police marlene turned her head on the pillow and looked impossibly young impossibly frail im sorry im getting mixed up im the police eve drew out photos of her suspects when you look at these pictures remember he cant touch you now you got away you didnt give up and he cant touch you she showed them to marlene one at a time watching her eyes for that shock of recognition she saw it and the fear that rode with it him oh god him mom mommy lieutenant dallas thats enough she elbowed the doctor back marley are you sure yes yes yes she turned her face into her mothers breast thats his face those are his eyes he smiled at me its all right hes gone i want you out now im going wait marlene groped for eves hand again and turned her bruised and exhausted face away from her mother he was going to kill me wasnt he he didnt you beat him and you stopped him she leaned over the bed spoke very deliberately as marlenes eyes fluttered closed again youre the one who stopped him marley you remember that dont ever forget that she stepped back while the doctor checked the vitals the monitors then she turned and left the room got that son of a bitch she said to roarke and kept walking toward the elevator i need to go to central put this together i still want you to check the travel dates i want this icecold and locked ill have my warrant within two hours if i have to strangle a judge to get it lieutenant lieutenant wait sela rushed down the corridor youre going after him now yes maam i am did you mean what you said that shed stopped him i did she pressed her fingers to her lids thats going to get her through i know my girl and thatll get her through this they didnt think shed ever wake up i knew she would you sure as hell did sela laughed then clamped a hand over her lips to hold back a sob dr laurence i know he was rude to you but hes been very kind to us and worked very hard for marley i was rude right back were all just looking out for her i just wanted to say that ive thought of dr laurence as her guardian angel and you as her avenging one i wont ever forget you she rose on her toes gave eve a quick peck on the cheek then hurried away avenging angel embarrassed eve hunched her shoulders as she stepped into the elevator jesus then she straightened grinned fiercely i can tell you this when im finished niles renquist will see me as a demon from hell it was a tricky business both politically and personally peabody was going to be pissed and undoubtedly sulky that she hadnt been called in shed just have to suck it up eve thought as she prepared to make her pitch to commander whitney he was she imagined none too pleased himself to have been called back into central when she stepped into his office and noted the tuxedo covering his big frame she fought back a wince sir im sorry to have interrupted your evening i assume your reasons for doing so will be strong enough to placate my wife as eve wasnt quite as successful in holding back the wince this time whitney nodded you dont know the half of it youd better have niles renquist cold lieutenant because before i deal with my wife ive got the ambassador the un and the british government in line marlene cox has positively identified niles renquist as her assailant i have a statement from sophia dicarlo employed as au pair in the renquist household which conflicts with his and mrs renquists claim that he was home during the time of one of the murders he is in possession of the stationery used for the notes left at the murder scenes and he fits the profile at this time captain feeney and expert civilian consultant roarke are doing a search and scan on travel i believe we will confirm that the subject was in london paris boston and new la at the time of previous murders which match the methods of this case under ordinary circumstances this would be enough for a search warrant and a warrant to bring the subject in for questioning on suspicion but these arent ordinary circumstances no sir the subjects diplomatic status and the political arena add a sensitivity and a level of bureaucracy i request that you speak directly with the judge and the necessary parties to expedite the warrants he will kill again commander and soon you want my head in the noose lieutenant he cocked his head you have the statement of a woman in severe physical and emotional distress a woman with head trauma you have a statement from a household employee who in your report claims to have been sexually abused by the subject those are both shaky owning or purchasing the brand of paper used in the notes isnt enough and you know it or renquist would have been in a cage before this and there are others who fit the profile all of this will be argued by renquists representatives and attorneys and the british government you need to lock this down if i get into his house into his office ill lock it down its him commander i know its him he sat in silence wide fingers tapping on the surface of the desk if youve got any doubt if theres any room for doubt it would be best to hold off on taking these steps we can surveil watch his every move until there is no doubt and the case is a noose around his neck good luck watching his every move if he gets back inside the un eve thought but tried to put it more diplomatically renquist may already be in the wind without the search he stays in control hes the only one who knows the identity and whereabouts of his next target if he beats me to her she may not be as lucky as marlene cox once the calls are made and the ball starts rolling it could flatten both of us i can survive it ive had more years wearing a badge than youve had breathing i can live with retirement the ramifications of this should you be wrong will damage your career perhaps irrevocably understand that understood sir youre a solid cop dallas perhaps the best under my command is it worth pushing this forward now is it worth possible reassignment losing your status in homicide and your credibility she thought of the dream of the dead and the victims yet to come theres always another her father had said and damn him he was right yes sir if i weighed status more heavily than the job i shouldnt be here im not wrong but if i were id take the hit ill make the calls get me a goddamn cup of coffee she blinked at the order looked vaguely around his office the little twinge of resentment she felt as she walked to his autochef told her maybe status wasnt so far down on her list after all how do you want it sir coffee regular get me judge womack he said into the link then barked out a come at the knock on his door feeney hustled in a grim smile on his face roarke strolled in behind him grinned cheekily at eve i wouldnt mind a cup while youre at it i dont serve civilians serve and protect lieutenant he reminded her protect and serve bite me she mumbled under her breath and carried the coffee to whitneys desk we got em feeney said hold that call what have you got me and the civilian here did some efinessing if only the budget could afford this boy with sincere affection he slapped roarkes shoulder devious mind and magic fingers ah well cut through the bullshit feeney and give me some weight our suspect took diplomatic public and private shuttles and the private transpo was buried deep to paris to london to boston and to new la he was in those cities during the time of the unsolved murders preceding the ones here he frequently travels to london as youd expect less frequently to boston for london he uses the diplomatic transpo for boston public though its firstclass and pricey all the way but for the west coast he went private and alone two trips by this method the first one month before the murder of susie mannery the second two days before with a return the following day the day after the murder same pattern on the other unsolveds he turned to eve bullseye kid even with the added weight it was almost midnight before eve had the warrants in hand still her earlier fatigue had burned away in a rush of adrenaline how did you know roarke asked as she drove uptown walk the civilian through it it had to be one of them the stationery was too pointed too much there for it not to be he used it purposefully to bring himself into it the attention the amusement the excitement he needs that she swung in behind a rapid cab and let the cabbie plow the road for her but hed have to know thered be others in new york viable suspects so he wouldnt have been the first to buy it smith was and smith would be easy to track hes public and he likes to make a splash go on roarke prompted theres elliot hawthorne with his supply of the same paper speaking of him hes divorcing his current wife something about a tennis pro she took time to smirk figured hawthorne would get around to it he was a toss in never seriously on my list too old for the profile and nothing there no pop but you still had to take the time to check him out had to have him in the general mix that wouldve pleased renquist there you go then breen sending him the paper just added a nice touch for renquist breen was the expert and someone renquist probably admired a months pay says we find breens books in renquists office hes studied breen the work and the man you never thought it was breen didnt fit arrogant enough knowledgeable enough but this isnt a guy who hates or fears women she remembered his devastated face as she hammered at him remembered the broken look in his eyes shed have to live with her part in putting it there he loves his wife and that makes him a sap not a murderer he likes being at home with the kid probably hed do it whatever the mother did but i pushed him anyway pushed him hard he heard the regret in her voice and brushed a hand over her arm why in case i misjudged him in case she blew out a breath and tried to let the guilt blow out with it in case i was wrong i liked him right off the same way i didnt like renquist so you worried part of it was personal for you some and breen couldve been involved that was an angle i had to factor in he couldve provided the killer with data pooled all of it to put into his next book how he acted and reacted answered didnt answer in interview mattered hell get through it eve or he wont its his wife who betrayed him not you yeah all i did was shatter his nice fantasy shield anyway anyway renquists got a good line on breen i bet he knows about the wifes sidepiece ill double that bet and say well find unregistered equipment in his office equipment hes used to research and track the other suspects he lined them right up for me the son of a bitch i value my money too much to take that wager why not carmichael smith because hes pitiful he needs a woman to adore him and tend to him he doesnt kill them or whod rub his feet and stroke his head i appreciate a good foot rub myself yeah she snorted take a number he reached out to twist a lock of her shaggy hair around his finger just to touch and asked the next question just to keep her talking fortney then peabodys favorite mostly she leaned toward him because he offended her sensibilities shes soft yet you know yes i know shell keep some of that the soft eve tried not to think about the exam in the morning and how much of peabodys ego and esteem was wrapped up in it thats good she added its good shes got the makeup to keep some of it you get too hard you stop feeling then the jobs just being on the clock youve never stopped feeling he thought you never will youre worried about her im not she shot the words out then hissed when he chuckled okay maybe i am a little maybe im worried shes so nervous and sweaty about this damn stupid detectives exam that shell blow it maybe i wish id waited another six months to put her up for it if she blows it its going to set her back inside its so fucking important to her wasnt it to you that was different it was she said with conviction when he raised an eyebrow i wasnt going to blow it i had more confidence in myself than she does had to i didnt have anything else she surprised herself by smiling looking over at him then it didnt surprise her to feel his hand brush her cheek enough mush back to fortney he clouded peabodys thinking hes a putz and just not smart enough for this not an organized thinker and not cold enough violent tendencies toward women but a sock in the eye isnt mutilation you gotta be cold to mutilate and brave in a screwedup way fortneys not brave enough to go the whole route for him sex is his way of humiliating women he bought the paper second and i imagine that gave renquist a smile if he was following the purchases and you believe he was she gazed at the rearview to make sure the team was still behind her dead sure and he likely did a search on fortney and knew hed be in new york during this period takes time to put on a show months of lead time renquist didnt plan this overnight keep going roarke was keeping her talking she realized so she wouldnt lose her temper and her patience with the traffic which was hideous she toyed briefly with hitting the sirens and punching it but that violated procedure shed do this straight right down the line he needed time to scope out his targets so youve got several weeks between him sending the paper to breen and the first murder the first in new york she amended were going to find more bodies or whats left of them scattered over the planet and possibly off hell tell you roarke deduced oh yeah her face was grim as she threaded through a narrow break between bumpers once we get him in hell tell us he wont be able to stop himself he wants his place in the history books and youll have yours care about it or not lieutenant roarke said when she scowled youll have yours lets stick with renquist hes a perfectionist and hes had years of practice in his work within the image hes built he has to be discreet diplomatic often subservient and this goes against the grain day after day at heart hes an exhibitionist a man who finds himself above others even as hes been hammered down by females all his life women are inferior yet they have power over him so they have to be punished he hates us and killing us is his greatest joy his finest accomplishment you were going to be his last she glanced over saw him watching her yeah hed have gotten around to me later rather than sooner because hed want to string this out i saw it in his eyes the first time i met him just an instant couldnt stand the son of a bitch i wanted it to be him she pulled up in front of the renquist home and the search team pulled up behind her this is going to be fun she waited for feeney let the team file in behind home security scanned her badge then the warrant before shifting to a holding pattern within two minutes the housekeeper in a long black robe opened the door im sorry she began there must be some mistake this warrant authorizes me and my team to enter this residence and conduct a search thereof i am also authorized to arrest niles renquist on multiple counts of suspicion of murder in the first degree and a count of firstdegree assault with intent is mr renquist on the premises no hes away on business she looked more baffled than annoyed ill need to ask you to wait here while i inform mrs renquist of these circumstances eve held up the warrants again these mean i dont have to wait but go right ahead and tell her were here after you direct me to mr renquists home office im not i can hardly take the responsibility for its my responsibility she signaled the team behind her to enter split into groups of two i want a complete and thorough roombyroom all recorders on the office she said to the housekeeper its on the second level but youre going to want to lead the way stevens then step back you dont want a part of this without waiting for the housekeeper eve started up the staircase stevens came after her in a trot if youd just let me wake mrs renquist and inform her as soon as you show me his office its the last door on the right but its secured you got the code she pokered up then struggling for dignity as she stood in her nightrobe surrounded by cops only mr renquist has the code its his personal office and he handles sensitive material as an official of the british government yeah yeah blah blah eve decided shed been right this was fun my warrant gives me the right to open this door with or without the code she pulled out her master i am employing that authorization at this time and using a police master code to disengage the subjects security on this door the housekeeper turned and fled up to the third floor mrs renquist eve thought was about to get a rude awakening she used the master and wasnt the least surprised to find the police code denied hes taken extra precautions she looked over her shoulder at roarke at this time i find it necessary and expedient to employ alternate methods if the electronic experts on team are unable to disengage locks i will utilize the battering ram lets have a look first feeney suggested and eve deliberately turned her recorder away so that it wouldnt show roarke crouching down with burglar tools in his hands feeney im going to need you to confiscate all security discs i suspect the subject doctored them so that he wasnt scanned when he left the house for the murders and attack if he did well find the shadows he tracked his gaze toward roarke and had to bite down on a grin magic hands he thought again i want all links and transmission devices as well she didnt look at roarke kept her back to him but her mind was muttering hurry up damn it hurry up i cant stall much longer lieutenant roarke said a moment later i believe the locks are now disengaged good she turned back were now entering the private home office of niles renquist she opened the door called for lights on full then took a deep breath lets get to work the room was meticulously organized even elegant in its choice of furnishings and decor the antique desk held modern communication and data equipment and what she concluded after a puzzled study was an old silver inkwell and quill there was a leatherbound notebook an electronic calendar and deeply cushioned chairs in dark masculine green there was a neat blackandwhite bath attached with the towels perfectly aligned on the rack he would wash up there after the murders she presumed she could see him perfectly cleaning grooming watching himself in the long mirrors that shone on the walls she turned back mentally measuring the room and gestured to what looked to be a closet door there five gets you ten his unregistereds in there she crossed the room found the door locked rather than waste time she waved to roarke then planted her feet at the sound of rushing footsteps with a pale peach robe swirling around her pamela renquist rushed into the room her face was naked of enhancements and looked older than it had her color was high her teeth were already peeled back in a snarl this is outrageous this is criminal i want you all of you out of my home immediately im calling the ambassador im calling the consulate and your superiors be my guest eve invited and all but slapped the warrant in her face i have all the proper authorization for this search and i will complete same with or without your cooperation well see about that she started to march to the desk and eve blocked her you wont be able to use this link or any of the house links until the search is complete if you wish to make a call or send a transmission you are restricted to the use of your personal links in the company of a duly authorized officer where is your husband mrs renquist go to hell hes going to beat me there i promise you she caught the signal from roarke out of the corner of her eye and moved over to the unlocked door she opened it well well well what have we here a little hideyhole complete with data and communication center were going to find this is unregistered feeney and look at all these discs renquist is a big fan of thomas a breen and his ilk all these books and data on serial killers tucked in here its hardly against the law even in this country to have a private space and to own books on any subject but pamela was losing her furious color eve eased farther in and opened a barrelshaped leather bag not against the law to own surgical tools either but it sure is funny im sure he cleaned these very well but i just bet we find traces of jacie wootons blood on them she opened a long cupboard felt her own blood pump when she studied the collection of wigs the black cape the city employee uniform and other costumes niles likes to play dress up she booted a container of plaster with her toe and does his own home improvements too a real renaissance man opening a drawer she felt a little hitch in her heart then reached in with a sealed hand and picked up a gold band set with five small sapphires lois greggs ring she murmured i think her family will want this back got another of that sick bastards souvenirs eve turned saw feeneys face was white he held the lid of a portable cold box and she knew before he spoke what was inside looks like we found the rest of jacie wooton feeney breathed slowly through his teeth son of a bitch has it labeled for sweet christs sake eve made herself look made herself take the step over and look down into the container where the icy steam was already dissipating within was a clear sealed bag with its horror meticulously labeled whore she whirled around quickly and caught the expression on pamelas face you knew part of you knew and you covered for him dont want any scandal dont want any smudges on your perfect little world thats ridiculous i dont know what youre talking about there was a green tinge to her skin now as she stepped back from the closet and its awful contents but her chin stayed high and firm and her tone dismissive yes you do you know what goes on in your house you make it your business to know why dont you take a closer look eve took her arm gave it a little tug though she had no intention of letting her into the closet get a good upclose at what niles has been up to and think about when it might have been your turn or your daughters youre out of your mind take your hand off me im a british citizen im not under your aegis youre hipdeep in my aegis pam she stepped just a little closer im going to put him away thats priority and after ive got him in a cage im going to make it my mission in life to get you on accessory you have no right to speak to me that way in my own home when im finished with you well see who finishes feeney get her out of here house arrest female guard she gets one call dont you touch me dont you dare put your hands on me im not leaving this room until im satisfied every one of you has forfeited your badge eve tucked her thumbs in her pockets stood with hip thrust out and hoped you go voluntarily with captain feeney or i add resisting and have you forcibly restrained pamelas hand swung out it was a girl move and one eve could easily have dodged or deflected but she let it land and got her wish i was so hoping for that theres resisting and assaulting an officer you just made my night in a quick move eve had her restraints out as pamela blustered she spun the woman around jerked her arms back and cuffed her have her transported to central eve told feeney booked on resisting and assaulting an officer she can stay in a box until were through here pamela kicked swore with a vehemence and creativity that had eves eyebrows lifting i like her better that way rolling her shoulders as feeney muscled pamela out eve turned to roarke i need to verify that this is unregistered equipment which gives me another nice ball to add to the weight against renquist and i need all data contained within what are you grinning at pal you baited her so shed take that swipe at you so so im surprised you didnt take her out yourself shes small change im going to pocket that change before im done but i want him first im going to update the commander she pulled out her communicator get me that data within fifteen minutes she had an allpoints out on renquist and was reading over roarkes shoulder its all here she noted carefully logged his travel his trolling his selection every victim with chosen method tools wardrobe youll notice he has quite a file on you lieutenant yeah i can read and roarke continued in that same cool tone that he intended you to be his crescendo using peter brents copkilling method longrange laser blaster which means hes got one in here better find it and him i want him now as much as you she shifted her gaze met his its not personal she waited a beat shrugged okay what is it you say to crap like that bollocks its personal but it can wait im not next on his list she looked back to the screen katie mitchell west village cpa twentyeight divorced no kids lives alone works primarily out of her loft hes got everything on her height weight habits routines even her fucking shopping preferences stores purchases hes a thorough bastard hes looking to do a marsonini on her gain initial entrance by posing as a client roarke said clone security enter again when the victim is sleeping restrain torture rape and mutilate leaving a single red rose on the pillow beside them marsonini got six women with that method between the late winter of and the spring of all brunettes like mitchell all home workers all between the ages of twentysix and twentynine all bearing a slight resemblance to his older sister who had reputedly sexually and physically abused him in childhood she straightened well get this katie mitchell under wraps if we dont find renquist within the next fortyeight hours hes going to find us chapter there was no choice but to risk going directly to katie mitchells apartment if renquist had it staked it would spook him but eve couldnt risk a life if he bolted shed hunt him down with help from edd she had a list of residents and a layout of the building where mitchell had her thirdfloor loft she left feeney in charge of the ongoing search of renquists home and took roarke along for ballast she told him youre too good to me darling really ill get spoiled fat chance anyway youve got a good touch with women now im blushing im going to laugh my ass off any minute then where will i sit this woman may become hysterical youre better with hysterical females than i am excuse me did you say something i was busy thinking about your ass she whipped her vehicle up a ramp and squeezed it into a secondlevel spot a half block from mitchells loft im sure thats entertaining you have no idea but lets try to keep to the program its possible if we go in as a couple straight in he wont make me if hes staking out the building i dont think hes around tonight i think hes in some bolthole putting it all together odds are weve got time but i cant be sure marsonini always hit his victims between two and three a m were plenty early if hes marked her for tonight but i want us to walk straight to the building and in how fast can you get through the security time me lets move i think you should hold my hand he said as they started down the ramp youll look less like a cop take the left she switched sides with him i want my weapon hand free naturally even as he gave her arm a playful little swing he saw her eyes those cops eyes tracking scanning dissecting every shadow ill need my hands free at the door you could ease behind me it wouldnt hurt to give my butt an affectionate little pat what for because i like it she ignored that but did move behind him slightly as they climbed the short flight of steps to the buildings entrance its cooled off considerably i think were done with the worst of the heat for the year hmm maybe why dont you lean in a bit nuzzle my neck for cover or because you like it as a kind of reward he said and opened the door she hadnt even seen him finesse the lock youre pretty fucking slick she commented and stepped in ahead of him she walked straight back to the steps rather than hassle with the elevators security system that would open once cleared directly into mitchells loft less traumatizing eve hoped to knock on the hall door on the third level and gain admittance that way his log shows an appointment with her here this afternoon eve continued that tells me hes already bunged up her loft security and plans to move in tonight tomorrow latest i need to get her out but i dont want cops around yet well set up a unit in the morning early she knocked on the door held up her badge then turned to smile at roarke so im giving her to you youll transport her to central and shell be transferred to a safe house until this goes down and you plan to stay here tonight alone i dont think so i outrank you eve heard the click of the speaker engage and the puzzled yes that came through it police ms mitchell we need to speak with you whats this about id like to come in its nearly midnight katie opened the door a crack is something wrong has there been a breakin id like to discuss this inside she studied eves badge again then glanced at roarke the double take was almost comical i know you it was reverent oh my god ms mitchell eve had to order herself not to act annoyed as katie brushed at her hair with her hand may we come in um yes okay i was just going to bed she said apology in her voice as she tugged at the belt of a thin pink robe i wasnt expecting anybody the living area was spacious and simple with an opening on one side through which eve could see a small bedroom and through the opening on the other side was a larger professionallooking office a long galleystyle kitchen was behind a low wall she imagined the other door which was discreetly closed led to the bath good windows probably let in considerable light during the day she judged two exits including the elevator ms mitchell you had an appointment today with this man eve took a photo of renquist from her bag no katie said after a quick look her gaze went back to and held on roarkes face would you like to sit down would you please look at this picture again more carefully and tell me if this man was your three oclock appointment this afternoon my three oclock no he was oh wait it is mr marsonini but he had red hair long red hair done in a braid and he wore these little blue sunshades the entire time a little affected i thought but he was italian was he yes he had a really charming accent hes relocating here from rome though hell still have some business interests in europe hes in oil olive oil he needs a personal accountant to work with his corporate people oh my has something happened to him is that why youre here no she was measuring katie as shed measured the loft as shed concluded from the data and id picture katie mitchell was the same general build and coloring as peabody that might come in handy ms mitchell this mans name isnt marsonini its renquist and hes suspected of murdering at least five women oh you must be mistaken mr marsonini was perfectly charming i spent nearly two hours with him today theres no mistake posing as a potential client renquist gained entrance to this loft for the purposes of cloning your security having personal contact with you and assuring himself that you did still live alone which i assume you do well yes but he has stalked you for some time as is his pattern with his victims gathering information on your routines and habits he intends to enter this residence within the next fortyeight hours most likely when youre sleeping he would then restrain you rape and torture you before using your own kitchen utensils to mutilate and kill you in the most painful way he could devise eve listened to the little choked sound that creaked in katies throat than watched the brunettes eyes roll back in her head all yours she said as roarke swore and stepped in to catch katie before she toppled over you could have done that in a more sensitive and delicate way sure but this was quicker when she comes to she can pack what she needs then you get her out he hefted katie headed with her to a sofa youre not staying here alone and waiting for him to come hunting thats my job she began but im calling for backup call for it now and ill have her out of your way inside twenty minutes deal she pulled out her communicator and prepared to set up the next stage of her operation she spent the hours until dawn sitting in the dark waiting a surveillance vehicle sat outside and two armed uniforms were stationed in the living area of the mitchell apartment but the watch team had its orders renquist when he came was hers and he sat in his quiet room in a small apartment on the edge of the village hed decorated it carefully selecting each piece so that it would have a european feel and a rich one rich and colorful and sexy so unlike the cool stagnant home he shared with his wife when he was niles when he was in this warm deeply toned room he was victor clarence a small amusing joke and a play on his royal highness prince albert victor duke of clarence who some credited with the ripper murders of whitechapel renquist liked to believe it enjoyed the notion of a killer prince he considered himself no less a prince among men a king among killers and like that famed stylist of death he would never be caught but he was more than his prototypes because he would never stop he drank a brandy and smoked a thin cigar laced with just a whiff of zoner he loved these times alone the quiet reflective times when all the preparation was done he was pleased hed decided to feign a business trip to get away on his own for a few days pamela was irritating him more than usual with her long speculative stares her pointed questions who was she to question him to look at him if she only knew how many times hed imagined killing her the many and creative ways hed devised shed run screaming the image of his cold and rigid wife running for her life made him chuckle of course he would never do it it would bring it all too close to home and he was no fool pamela was safe simply because he was stuck with her besides if he killed her who would handle all the annoying details of his social life no it was enough just to have these periodic rests from her and the female shed saddled him with irritating sneaky little brat children were as hed learned from his dear old nanny meant to be neither seen nor heard if they rebelled or failed to obey smartly they were to be put somewhere in the dark where they were no longer seen where they couldnt be heard no matter how loud they screamed oh yes he remembered remembered the dark room nanny gable had had a way about her he would like to kill her slowly painfully while she screamed and screamed as hed once done but that wouldnt be wise like pamela she was safe because he was stuck with her in any case shed taught him hadnt she nanny gable had certainly taught him children were meant to be raised by someone paid and paid well to discipline and tutor not that the sly little italian thing disciplined his girl spoiled her coddled her but she was convenient her fear and loathing of him gave him such a rush of pleasure everything in his life had finally fallen into place he was respected admired obeyed he was comfortable financially and had an active and rarefied social life he had a wife who presented the proper image and a young mistress who was just fearful enough to do anything absolutely anything he required and he had the most fascinating and entertaining hobby years of study of planning of strategy of practice it was all coming to fruition now in ways even he hadnt anticipated how could he have known how much fun it would be to assume the guise of one of his heroes and follow in their bloody footsteps men who took charge who took life who did what they wished to women because they understood as others couldnt that women needed to be debased hurt killed they asked for death with their first breath trying to run the world trying to run him he took a slow drag of the cigar letting the zoner calm him before one of his rages could take over it wasnt the time for rage but for cool calculating action he worried that hed been too clever but really could one be too clever some might consider it a mistake to have deliberately put himself forward as a suspect but it was so much more satisfying so much more exciting that way it allowed him to participate on two levels and made it all so intimate in a way hed already fucked the whore cop what a thrill it was to watch her scramble around unable to outthink him to anticipate him being forced to come to him and apologize he hugged himself as he played that scene over in his head oh that had been a moment selecting eve dallas had been a brilliant stroke if he did say so himself and oh he did a man wouldnt have given him nearly the same buzz but a woman a woman who like most of her kind considered herself superior to a man simply because she could trap him between her legs that added spice to the brew he could think about choking her beating her raping her gutting her even as she watched him with those cool flat eyes he would never have known the same level of excitement with a male adversary she would be punished of course when she failed to stop him when others were killed as the accountant bitch would be killed the lieutenant would be punished and disciplined by her superiors as it should be and she would suffer never knowing whod bested her she would suffer until the laser blast struck her in the back of the head if only he could find a way to let her know to tell her reveal himself to her an instant before her death then it would be perfect there was time of course to work that out content he settled into bed to dream his terrible dreams they had obviously been off by a night eve thought as she set up the morning briefing in her home office with a small tight team she didnt want to risk central or a larger operation a leak even a trickle might send renquist into the wind now they could tighten the trap so hed never get away she used her board the wall screens and one of roarkes new toys a portable holounit well have units set here and here she highlighted the map onscreen with a laser pointer they are for observation only i want to take renquist inside the loft where he can be contained and no civilians are at risk we moved mitchells acrossthehall neighbor out at oh seven hundred on the pretext of a broken water pipe the cooperation of the building super is ensured and weve got him under wraps in case he gets an itch to share any of this with the media the empty loft will be observation post c she highlighted the third floor of the building blueprint on the second screen were installing cameras the loft will be under constant observation its unlikely renquist will use the elevator but well have cameras there as well and once hes inside the loft the power to the elevator will be shut down giving him only one exit a team will move in to block that exit another will be set on the street below in case he decides to take a header from the windows rat in a trap feeney commented thats the idea ill be inside the loft as will officer peabody who will be briefed when her examination is finished captain feeney will run electronics from mitchells home office inside the loft and detective mcnab will head observation post c she ordered up the holo and brought a scaleddown version of the mitchell loft into her office memorize it she ordered officer peabody will be decoy she and the target are approximately the same size and coloring shell be in the bed here ill be posted in this closet getting renquist in the bedroom is optimum no windows no escape route hell be armed mcnab put in she nodded noting the worry in his eyes that was the trouble she thought when a cop fell for another cop so will we its possible hell bring his own blades or that hell detour into the kitchen first to avail himself of mitchells kitchen stock he may have a blaster or another weapon though he has yet to utilize one we will go into this assuming hes armed as marsonini habitually carried a blaster or stunner and act accordingly she waited a beat were working on finding him before tonight hes in the city and as hes emulating marsonini its likely hes settled in somewhere near his targets home marsonini habitually had a good meal with wine on the evening before a murder he dressed well generally in suits by italian designers and carried his tools in an expensive briefcase he did his work to opera again italian he spoke with an accent though it was affected as he was born in st louis history details and a complete bio of this subject are in your packs she waited again while members of the team shuffled and took out the bio renquist will become marsonini attempt and likely succeed in copying his mannerisms habits and routines you also have in your packs the projected image of how hell look wearing the long red hair and sunshades now lets go over the details if renquist follows this pattern this is going down tonight she spent another hour before dismissing her team since shed seen mcnab look at his purplebanded wrist unit three times during the briefing she held him back shes got another two hours youd better chill sorry she was just so wigged this morning shes going into the sims now she keeps choking on the sims if she chokes shes not ready to make the grade the timing blows on this mcnab but the fact is weve got a lot more at stake here than peabody getting her detective shield i know it shes so damn worried about letting you down shes turned her guts inside out jesus its not about me he pressed his lips together as if wrestling with a decision then shrugged yeah it is sure it is a big part of it i wasnt supposed to tell you but i figure you gotta know so if she messes up on this you can handle it handle her she better handle herself shes going straight into this op when shes done and she wont have the results she better handle herself and do the job he slipped his hands into his pockets and gave eve a cheeky grin see you know just how to handle her get out of here she sat on the corner of the desk for a moment to clear peabody out of her head it was one thing to be responsible for lives for justice but it was a hell of a kick in the ass to be told you had somebodys psyche in your hands how the hell had it gotten there lieutenant roarke stood in the doorway of their adjoining offices watching her a minute of your time yeah she rose to walk into the simulation of the mitchell bedroom again judging distances angles moves thats about all ive got for you we could take him on the street she said half to herself but marsonini carried a blaster or stunner so renquist will have a blaster or stunner if he gets to it starts popping off heat maybe some idiot civilian gets in the way potential hostage better do it inside contained and controlled inside no place to run no civilian targets it should be cleaner inside she looked over shrugged when she realized shed walked in and out of the holographic bedroom closet sorry its not a problem youre worried because peabody will be in the bed in the open she can take care of herself so she can but the fact that youre worried should help you understand ive some concerns of my own so im asking you to let me in on this operation deliberately she cocked her brow asking me why dont you just go to your good pal jack or your buddy ryan one tries to learn by ones mistakes does one i want to be there for several reasons and one is because its become personal for you its trickier when its personal she turned back end hologram program screens off there was cold coffee on her desk she picked up the cup put it down then found herself reaching for the little statue of the goddess peabodys mother had given her its not the notes theyre just irritating on a personal level and helpful otherwise its not the fact that hes marked me as a future target that goes with the territory its not even that hes a vicious arrogant sick son of a bitch you get that all the time it was watching marlene cox fighting to come back and more than that seeing her mother will her back sitting beside that hospital bed reading to her holding her hand talking to her believing refusing not to believe because she loved her more than well more than anything she set the statue down again the way the mother looked at me with this utter faith that id make it right in my line youre almost always trying to make it right for the dead but marlenes alive so its personal it got turned on me and yeah its trickier when its personal can you use me slick operator like you dont see why not ill give you a ride into central you can report to feeney in edd her first task at central was to arrange for pamela renquist to be brought to an interview room renquists highpriced lawyers were already working on her release eve would consider herself lucky to hold the woman another twelve hours pamela came in without her attorney but wearing her own clothes rather than prison garb used her pull for her priority eve assumed and gestured to the table ive agreed to speak with you and alone because i dont want to give you the importance of my attorneys pamela sat brushed at her soft silk pants ill be released shortly and have already instructed my attorneys to initiate suit against you for harassment false arrest and imprisonment and slander gosh im in big trouble now tell me where he is pam and well end this without anyone else getting hurt first i dont appreciate your familiar form of address gee now you hurt my feelings secondly pamela continued in a voice iced as february my husband is in london on business and when he returns he will use all his influence to destroy you hey heres a flash for you your husband is in new york city finalizing his preparation to kill a female accountant using the method of enrico marsonini who was infamous for the rape and torture of his victims before he cut them to pieces he always took a finger or toe with him as a kind of door prize youre disgusting im disgusting eve let out a baffled laugh you are some piece of work to continue following the pattern of his latest mentor niles visited his intended victim in her home yesterday afternoon pamela curled her fingers examined her manicure thats preposterous you know its not you know that your husband the father of your child the man you live with is a psychopath youve smelled the blood on him havent you pam youve seen what he is when you look at his face you have a daughter isnt it time for you to protect her pamelas gaze flashed up and a hint of rage eked through my daughter is none of your concern and apparently none of yours either i sent a child liaison officer to your home last evening rose along with sophia dicarlo has been taken into protective custody the reason this is news to you is that you havent bothered contacting your daughter since you were brought in yesterday you had no right to remove my daughter from my home i do but it was the liaison who opted to do so after speaking with her and her au pair and other members of your staff if you want your daughter back its time to step away from the madman and stand with them against him its time to shield your child the rage that tiny hint of emotion was iced over again lieutenant dallas my husband is an important man within a year he will be named the new british ambassador to spain its been promised to us you will not besmirch his reputation or mine with your horrendous and ugly fantasies go down with him then its a nice bonus for me eve rose paused eventually hed have done you and your daughter he wouldnt have been able to stop himself youre not going to spain pam but wherever you end up youre going to have plenty of time to think about the fact that i saved your worthless life she walked over gave the steelreinforced panel two hard thuds on the door she called and walked away she was heading back to her office when she heard herself being hailed eve kept walking and let peabody catch up dallas sir lieutenant theres paperwork in your cube deal with it in my office in ten for a briefing we head out in thirty sir ive already been informed about the op mcnab nipped over to meet me when i came out of exam good eve thought good for him but she kept her cop scowl in place the fact that detective moron bypassed procedure does not negate the necessity for your briefing he wouldnt have had to tell me if you had it was the mutter that did it eve swung into homicide my office now you put the thumb on renquist last night peabody trotted behind eve i should have been called in for the search you bypassed procedure eve shoved her door closed are you questioning my methods or my authority officer your methods lieutenant sort of i mean jeez if hed been home last night youd have him and idve missed it as your aide as my aide you do what youre told when youre told if youre dissatisfied with this arrangement put it in writing and file it you worked the case last night without me you held an op briefing this morning without me the exam shouldnt have taken priority over my involvement in this case i decide what takes priority its done if you have any more bitching and complaining to do about this matter i repeat do so in writing and file it through the proper channels peabodys chin jutted up i have no wish to file a complaint lieutenant your choice complete the paperwork on your desk meet me in the garage in twentyfive youll be briefed en route it was going to be a long day eve imagined as she walked through katie mitchells loft just as shed walked through the hologram and a long night wherever renquist had tucked himself hed done a good job of it your move she thought and gulped down more coffee shed thrown a net over every hotel in the sector but she hadnt found him even while she paced the loft the search was widening she stepped up to the doorway of the office where roarke and feeney worked nothing roarke said sensing her its more likely hes using a private residence shortterm rental were searching that area she checked her wrist unit once more there were hours yet and she couldnt risk going in and out of the building she walked back to the kitchen poked at mitchells autochef restless roarke said from behind her i hate the waiting doing nothing but going over and over it in my head makes me antsy he leaned down to kiss the back of her head so does having a spat with peabody why do men always say women have spats men dont have spats its a stupid weenie word he rubbed her shoulders because they were like rock he made a mental note to schedule a relaxation treatment for her whether she liked it or not why dont you ask her how the exam went she wants me to know shell tell me he leaned down closer brushing his lips over her hair then speaking directly into her ear she thinks she tanked it shit eve fisted her hands shit fuck damn she swung to the freezer sorted through it and confiscated a quart of strawberry fields frozen dessert she found a spoon stuck it in then marched off toward the bedroom theres my girl roarke murmured peabody sat on the edge of the bed studying the morning briefing on her ppc she glanced up when eve entered nearly had her sulky look in place when she spotted the quart of ice cream here eve shoved it into her hand eat this and stop pouting i need you at a hundred percent its just i think i fucked up really bad i dont want you to think you put it out of your mind all the way you have to be focused you cant afford to miss a move miss a signal in a few hours youre going to be lying in that bed in the dark when he comes in his whole purpose will be to kill you hell be wearing nightvision goggles he likes to work in the dark hell see you but you wont see him until we make the move you wont see him so you cant fuck that up or youre going to get hurt you get hurt youll really piss me off im sorry about this afternoon peabody shoved in the strawberry ice cream i had myself all worked up id kicked my own ass as many times as i could on the way back from the exam i just needed to kick somebody elses and i started thinking if youd just called me in i wouldnt have taken that stupid goddamn exam you did take it and tomorrow youll know the results now put it aside and do the job i will she held out a spoonful of ice cream to eve taking it eve sampled christ thats just horrible i think its pretty good more cheerful peabody took the spoon back and dug in for more youre just spoiled because you get the real thing now thanks for not being mad at me anymore who says im not if i liked you id have sent somebody out for real ice cream instead of stealing a civilians frozen crap peabody just smiled and licked the spoon chapter hed be getting dressed now eve figured as she looked out through the privacyscreened windows of mitchells loft it would be full dark soon marsonini had always had a long leisurely meal with two glasses of wine before a kill always an upscale restaurant booking a corner table he could spend two even three hours over it savoring the food sipping the wine ending with coffee and dessert a man who enjoyed the finer things renquist would appreciate that eve could see him now in her minds eye buttoning a perfectly white bespoke shirt watching his own fingers in the mirror it would be a good room well appointed he wouldnt tolerate anything but the best as renquist or marsonini a silk tie probably a silk tie hed like the way it felt in his fingers as he slipped it on as he finessed the perfect knot he would take it off after his victim was subdued and restrained carefully hanging every article of clothing to avoid creasing he wouldnt want creases any more than bloodstains but for now hed enjoy the act of dressing well of good material against his skin and the anticipation of the food and wine and what followed it she could see him renquist turning himself into marsonini grooming the long red hair that was his pride and his vanity would renquist see marsoninis face in the mirror now she imagined he would the darker complexion the less even features the fuller mouth the pale pale eyes that would peer out from behind tinted shades he would need to see it or the night wouldnt have the same flavor now the jacket something in light gray maybe perhaps with a faint pinstripe a good summer suit for a man of discriminating tastes then the lightest splash of cologne he would check his briefcase take a long breath to draw in the scent of the leather would he take out all of his tools probably he would run his hands along the lengths of rope thin strong rope that would leave painful grooves in his victims flesh he loved the thought of their pain then the ball gag he preferred the humiliation of that over cloth the condoms for his own safety and protection the thin cigars and slim gold lighter he enjoyed a good smoke nearly as much as burning those tiny circles into his victims skin and watching the agony scream in their eyes the little antique bottle hed filled with alcohol to pour over the wounds for that extra panache a retractable bat honed steel strong enough to break bones shatter cartilage and phallic enough to suit another purpose should he be in the mood blades of course smooth ones jagged ones in case he found the womans kitchen knives under par his music discs the nightvision goggles the hand blaster or the ministunner his paperthin clear gloves he detested the texture and scent of sealit or any of its clones his own towel white egyptian cotton and his own fresh cake of unscented soap for washing up after the job was done and lastly the security codes cloned the day before during his visit to the loft the jammer that would disengage the cameras so that he could stroll into the building without leaving a trace all neatly packed now and locked into the elegant case one last look in the mirror a fulllength to show himself the entire effect it had to be perfect a flick of the finger over a lapel to remove a minute speck of lint then he would stroll out the door to begin his evening out where were you roarke asked when her eyes changed when her shoulders relaxed with him she looked over saw he held two mugs of coffee thanks she said taking one and where is he heading out to dinner soup to nuts hell pay cash he always pays cash hell linger over it until nearly midnight then hell take a long walk marsonini didnt drive and rarely took cabs hell walk here juicing himself up block by block how did they catch him he knew but he wanted eve to say it to talk it out his intended victim lived in a loft not so different than this makes sense one of her friends had a major fight with her boyfriend and came over to cry on lisels that was her name came over to cry on her shoulder or whatever women do eat strawberry ice cream shut up so the friend finally cried it out and bunked on the sofa it was the music that woke her up she hadnt heard him come in apparently theyd killed a bottle of cheap wine or brew something marsonini hadnt spotted her sleeping there which was a break so the friend goes toward the bedroom to see about the music lisel was already bound gagged with a broken kneecap marsonini was naked his back was to the doorway he was climbing onto the bed getting ready to rape lisel she knew what had been in the victims head swimming over the pain she knew that the awful terror of what was to come was worse so much worse than pain the friend kept her head eve continued she ran back to the living room called nineoneone then hurried back to the bedroom picked up this bat hed used to break lisels kneecap and she whaled on him fractured his skull broke his jaw his nose his elbow by the time the cops got there marsonini was unconscious and in a sorry state shed untied lisel covered her up and was holding a knife to the bastards throat hoping she said in her statement hed come around so she could stick it in his gullet id say it stuck in his gullet that a woman stopped him her lips quirked a little because she understood im counting on it he died in prison two years later when an unidentified inmate or guard castrated him and left him lying in his own cage bled to death she breathed deep found it had helped to talk it through im going to make the rounds youve got two hours to stretch your legs around here then we tuck in and we wait at midnight she hauled a stool into the closet she kept the door open to an angle that gave her a view of the bed and peabodys upper half the apartment was full dark and silent peabody check your communicator every fifteen until i order radio silence i dont want you nodding off in there lieutenant i couldnt fall asleep if you gave me a highpowered soother im revved do the checks stay icy what if im wrong she asked herself if he changed targets changed methods got a whiff of me if he doesnt come tonight will he kill randomly or just rabbit does he have a back door an emergency route emergency funds and id hell come she assured herself and if he doesnt ill track him she ran through her own checks got the allquiet from the street teams the house teams after an hour she stood up to stretch and keep herself limber after two she felt her blood begin to pump he was coming she knew he was coming seconds before her communicator hissed in her ear possible sighting lone male proceeding south toward building sixtwo a hundred and ninety lightcolored suit and dark tie hes carrying a briefcase observe only dont approach feeney you copy loud and clear mcnab were on it looks like a false alarm hes moving past the building continuing south wait hes watching thats what hes doing scoping things out checking the street hes turning back approaching the building again something in his hand might be a security jammer turning in hes heading in lieutenant stay in the vehicle wait for my command peabody im ready eve saw the slight movement in the bed and knew peabody had her stunner in her hand feeney you and the civilian stay behind those doors until i clear it i want him all the way in mcnab i want that elevator shut down the minute hes through the door and your team out and blocking the hall a second after that copy youve got it hows my sex queen i beg your pardon detective um question directed at officer peabody lieutenant no personal communications or stupidass remarks for sweet christs sake give me a twenty on the suspect hes using the stairs sir moving between second and third floor ive got a good clear view of his face dallas positive id for niles renquist moving to your door now taking out a keycode hes through and in move now eve said in a whisper all units close in now and hold she couldnt hear him not yet so she brought him into her head marsonini always removed his shoes before entering the bedroom shoes and socks he would leave them neatly beside the entrance door then take off the shades put on the nightvision goggles with them he could move through the dark like a cat then he could stand over the victim watching her sleep before he pounced eve drew her weapon waited she heard the faintest creak of the floorboard and willed him to come on come on you son of a bitch then with her eyes long adjusted to the dark she saw the shape of him saw him stroke a hand gently over peabodys back she kicked the door open lights she shouted he whirled with the goggles blinding him now the bat was in his hand and he swung out with it toward the sound of her voice even as he ripped the goggles away police drop the weapon drop your weapon and freeze or i will drop you his eyes were huge blinking madly but she saw the instant he recognized her and understood she saw all his plans his victories drain out of his head filthy cunt come on then she lowered her weapon then stabbed a warning finger toward the doorway when roarke shoved in with feeney behind him dont do it she snapped at them renquist howled threw the bat at her then leaped she shifted let the metal glance off her shoulder because it was more satisfying than a stun she used her body tucking to drive that same shoulder into his gut her knee to his groin and when he started to fold her fist found its way to the underside of his jaw that last one was for marlene cox eve muttered she planted her foot on the small of his back as she pulled out her restraints hands behind you you bucket of puke ill kill you ill kill all of you blood trickled out of his mouth as he struggled his eyes went wide and wild when eve yanked the wig away keep your hands off me you revolting bitch do you know who i am yeah i know just who you are she flipped him over because she wanted him to see her she wanted him to look at her face the hate was there the sort shed seen before the kind of bonedeep loathing shed seen in the eyes of her own mother but seeing it now brought her only satisfaction do you know who i am niles im the woman the revolting bitch the filthy cunt whos kicked your sorry ass im the one whos going to lock the cage on you youll never put me away tears began to shimmer in his eyes you wont lock me in the dark again youre already gone and when breen writes about this one hell make careful note that it was a woman who beat you he began to wail and to weep she wouldve said like a woman but it wouldve been an insult to her entire sex read him his rights she told peabody whod emerged from the bed in full uniform have him transported to central and booked you know the drill yes sir do you wish to accompany the prisoner ill settle things here and follow you in i think you should be able to handle him detective i think a tenyearold boy could handle him in this shape sir she shook her head as renquist continued to sob and drum his feet like a child in the throes of a tantrum then her head snapped up what what did you say do i have to repeat a standard order for prisoner procedure no no sir did you did you say detective something wrong with your ears oh by the way congratulations suspect is contained and in custody she said into her communicator as she walked from the room she paused only long enough to wink at roarke all units stand down nice job go ahead feeney said to peabody as she stood shellshocked with mcnabs kissing noises and applause ringing in her earpiece ive got this bag of shit with a little whoop peabody leaped over renquist dallas are you sure really really sure the results arent posted until tomorrow why arent you following my direct order re the prisoner please jesus what a baby but it took every ounce of will to hold back the grin ive got some pull i used it results will be posted at oh eight hundred you placed twentysixth which isnt shabby theyre taking a full hundred so youre in you couldve done better on the sims i knew it but you did good all in all you did good the standard ceremony will be at noon day after tomorrow you will not cry during the cleanup of an operation she said when peabodys eyes teared up i wont okay peabody threw open her arms lurched forward eve backpedaled no kissing mother of god you get a handshake a handshake she stuck out her hand in defense thats it yes sir yes sir she took eves hand pumped it oh screw it she said and wrapped her arms tightly enough around eve to crack ribs get off me you maniac but now it was touchandgo whether she could hold back the laugh go jump mcnab ill transport the damn prisoner thanks oh man oh boy thanks she started to run for the door when it flew open mcnab caught her and eve had to give him credit for keeping his feet in midair rolling her eyes for form she walked back into the bedroom ill load him up feeney told her let the girl have time to do her victory dance ill be right behind you youll be sorry renquists eyes were still streaming but the fury was in them again lighting the tears very sorry she stepped up into his face let the silence hang until she saw fear eat away at the anger i knew it was you the first time i saw you i saw what you were do you know what you are niles pitiful and weak a coward who hid behind other cowards because he didnt even have the balls to be himself when he killed innocents do you know why i ordered my detective to take you in because youre not worth another minute of my time youre over she turned away when he began to weep again give me a lift sailor she said to roarke it would be my pleasure he took her hand when they reached the door and tightened his grip when she hissed and tried to shake him off too late to worry about such things now you winked at me during an operation i certainly did nothing of the kind she folded her lips primly maybe i had something in my eye lets have a look he backed her up against the wall of the hallway and laughed when she swore at him no i dont see a thing except those big gorgeous cops eyes he kissed her between them peabodys not the only one who did good today i did the job thats good enough for me two days later she read miras preliminary psych report on niles renquist then she leaned back stared at the ceiling it was an interesting ploy she mused if his defense team was good enough he might just pull it off she looked to the vase of flowers on her desk sent that morning by marlene cox via her mother instead of embarrassing her as they might have done they pleased her whatever the ploy justice would be served niles renquist would never see freedom again and she had a decent shot at nailing his wife as accessory after the fact at least the pa had agreed to press for it and that would have to be enough if she succeeded there she was orphaning a young girl deliberately seeing to it that a fiveyearold child was without mother or father rising she walked to the window but some children were better off werent they without a certain type of parent how the hell did she know she dragged a hand through her hair scrubbed them both over her face she could only do the job and hope when the dust settled it was right it felt right she heard her knob turn then the knock shed locked it pointedly and now checked the time rolling her shoulders she picked up her cap set it in place when she opened the door she saw the rare jolt of shock on roarkes face then the interest then the gleam that had color rising up on her neck what are you staring at im not entirely sure he stepped in before she could step out then closed the door behind him weve got to go the ceremony starts in fifteen and its a fiveminute walk turn around once i will not another few seconds she figured and that damn flush would hit her cheeks mortifying her youve seen a cop in uniform before ive never seen my cop in uniform before i didnt know you had one of course ive got one weve all got one i just never wear it but this is important thats all you look he traced one of her shiny brass buttons amazing very sexy oh get out seriously he leaned back to take it in that long lanky form did wonders he thought for the spit and polish the crisp formal blues medals earned in the line of duty glinted against the stiff jacket shed shined her black cop shoes which he now imagined shed kept buried in her locker to mirror gleams she wore her weapon at her hip and her cap squared off on her short hair lieutenant he said with a purr in his voice youve got to wear that home why he grinned guess youre a sick sick man well play cops and robbers out of my way pervert one thing he had fast hands and had dipped one down her starched collar before she could move and pulled out to his delight the chain that carried the diamond hed once given her thats perfect then he murmured and tucked it away again were not holding hands im absolutely firm on that actually i was planning to walk a couple steps behind you so i could see how your ass moves in that thing she laughed but pulled him out with her update on renquist if youre interested i am hes trying for insanity not unexpected but hes giving it a good shot using multiple personality disorder one minute hes jack the ripper next hes son of sam or john wayne gacy trips from that to desalvo or back to jack do you think its genuine not for a minute and mira doesnt buy it he could pull it off though his defense will hire plenty of shrinks that go along and hes good at the game it may keep him from a cement cage and put him in a padded cell on the mentally defective floor how would you feel about that i want the cage but you dont always get what you want im going by the hospital after shift so i can tell marlene cox and her family what may happen i think theyll be fine with it theyre not soldiers eve he said when she looked at him they only want him put away and youve done that its payment enough for them if not for you it has to be enough for me because its over and therell be another to take his place knowing that drags some cops under not my cop no what the hell she took his hand anyway as they walked into the meeting room for the ceremony it pushes me over you just find a seat wherever i have to be up on the stupid stage he lifted her hand to his lips congratulations lieutenant on a job well done she glanced over as he did to where peabody stood with mcnab in the front of the room she did it herself was all eve said it pleased her to see that commander whitney had made time to officiate she stepped onto the stage with him took the hand he offered congratulations lieutenant on your aides promotion thank you sir were going to start right away we have twentyseven promotions this session out of central sixteen detective third grades eight second grades and three detective sergeants he smiled a little i dont believe ive seen you in uniform since you made lieutenant no sir she stepped back with the other trainers stood next to feeney one of my boys made second grade he told her thought wed have a celebration drink across the street after shift suit you yeah but the civilians going to want in hes soft on peabody fair enough here we go jackll give his standard speech thank god its him and not that putz leroy who stands in for him when he cant make it leroys got the trots of the tongue cant stop it running in her assigned seat peabody sat with her spine straight and her stomach doing cartwheels she was terrified shed burst into tears as she had when shed called home to tell her parents it would be mortifying to cry now but everything was so welled up flooding her throat that she was afraid when she opened her mouth to speak it would all pour out her ears were buzzing so now she was afraid she wouldnt hear her name called and would just sit there like an idiot she concentrated on eve and how she stood cool and perfect at parade rest in her uniform when shed seen her lieutenant walk in in uniform shed nearly bawled then and there she hadnt been able to speak to her but buzzing or not she heard her name in the commanders big voice detective third grade delia peabody and got to her feet she couldnt feel her knees but somehow she was walking to the stage up the side steps and across it congratulations detective he said and took her hand in his enormous one before he stepped back and there was dallas stepping forward congratulations detective well done she held out the shield and for a moment just a flicker there was a smile thank you lieutenant then eve stepped back and it was done all peabody could think when she resumed her seat was that she hadnt cried she hadnt cried and there was a detectives shield in her hand she was still moving through a daze when the ceremony was done and mcnab rushed forward to lift her off her feet and roarke leaned over and oh my god kissed her right on the mouth but she couldnt find eve through the congratulations and pats on the back the ribbing and the noise she didnt see eve anywhere finally still clutching her badge she broke away when she tracked eve down in her office her lieutenant was back in street clothes at her desk hunched over paperwork sir you got out of there so fast i had things to do you were wearing your uniform why does everybody say that like its cause for a national holiday listen congratulations i mean it im proud of you and glad for you but fun times over and ive got a shitpile of paperwork well im going to take time to thank you and thats that i wouldnt have this if it wasnt for you she kept the shield cupped in her hand as if it were the finest crystal because you believed in me you pushed me and you taught me ive got it thats not entirely untrue eve tipped the chair back put the heel of one boot on the desk but if you hadnt believed in yourself pushed yourself and learned i wouldnt have done you a damn bit of good so youre welcome for what part i played in it youre a good cop peabody and youll be a better one as time goes by now the paperwork peabodys vision was blurry but she blinked back the tears ill get right on it sir thats not your job as your aide youre no longer my aide youre a detective and part of this paperwork im slogging through is your new assignment the tears dried up and the flush the excitement and joy had put in her cheeks drained away i dont understand detectives cant be wasted as aides eve spoke briskly youll be reassigned i assume youd prefer to stay in homicide but but god dallas i never considered that i couldnt stay that we wouldnt work together id never have taken the damn exam if id known youd have to boot me thats a ridiculous thing to say and shows a lack of respect for your shield i can give you a short list of choices for your reassignment eve flicked a key on the desk unit and had a spreadsheet coming up or if youre just going to whine about it ill make the choice for you i wasnt thinking wasnt expecting and now her stomach hurt all over again i cant take it in couldnt i at least take a few days to adjust continue as your aide until you make other arrangements i could clear up the pending peabody i dont need an aide i never needed an aide and got along fine without one before i took you on now its time for you to move along eve turned back to her desk in a gesture of dismissal with her lips pressed tightly together peabody nodded yes sir dont need a damn aide eve repeated could use a partner though that stopped peabody in her tracks sir she managed in a croak if youre interested that is and as the ranking officer id still dump most of the shitwork on you thats the part i really like partner your partner peabodys lips trembled and the tears won oh for gods sake close the door if youre going to blubber do you think i want the bullpen to hear crying in here they might think its me she sprang up slammed the door herself and then found herself caught in another of peabodys bear hugs i take this as a yes this is the best day of my life peabody stepped back rubbed the tears off her cheeks the ult im going to make you a hell of a partner i bet you will and i wont do the hug and blubber thing except in extreme circumstances good to know get out of here so i can finish my work ill buy you a drink after shift no sir im buying she opened her hand showed eve her badge its beautiful isnt it yeah yeah it is alone eve sat at her desk again then took out her own badge and studied it tucking it away again she looked up at the ceiling but this time she smiled it felt right it felt exactly right
